It combines unrivalled expertise on transport engineering, marketing, local government and research. The Board has established an English Regions Cycling Development Team responsible for promoting and monitoring cycling to bring about an improvement in conditions for cycling. Their work includes an audit of local authority provision for cycling; assessment of local authority cycling strategies in Local Transport Plans; and monitoring Cycling Project Fund schemes.</p>

The Fund is open to any organisation, with the exception of local highway authorities, for projects that will increase cycling. More than &pound;3 million has been made available in total. Any project that could be expected to lead to an increase in cycling, such as cycle parking, routes, cycle training or elements within a travel plan may be eligible.</p>
	<p pid=".139W.5/4">Improved facilities for cyclists are largely funded through Local Transport Plan funds. Highway authorities are asked to develop a local cycling strategy as part of these plans. This must identify gaps in the local infrastructure and potential improvements to the cycling network.</p>

	<p pid=".145W.3/1">My hon. Friends the Parliamentary Under-Secretaries of State (Lords) and (Commons) and I represented the United Kingdom at the meeting of the Agriculture and Fisheries Council in Brussels on 27&ndash;<phrase class="date" code="2003-01-28">28 January 2003</phrase>. Ministers with agriculture and fisheries responsibilities in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales also attended.</p>
	<p pid=".145W.3/2">The Greek Presidency outlined its priorities and planned work programme for the period ahead.</p>
	<p pid=".145W.3/3">The Commission formally presented draft legislative proposals that would give effect to the Common Agricultural Policy reforms outlined in its paper of July 2002; member states gave their initial reactions. I emphasised the need for a sustainable CAP and welcomed the general direction of the proposals and the benefits they would bring EU farmers. I noted, however, that the current proposals for modulation of direct payments to farmers put a disproportionate burden on larger and more efficient farms. I argued for a simpler and more equitable model. I also urged a faster and more substantial transfer of funds to rural development spending than the Commission had proposed. Detailed consideration of the proposals will now take place at official level.</p>
	<p pid=".145W.3/4">Over dinner, Ministers discussed the WTO agriculture negotiations. I welcomed the agreement that had been reached on a modalities paper for submission to the negotiations in Geneva and supported the Commission in stressing that the EU would need to be flexible if it were to reach a satisfactory outcome.</p>
	<p pid=".145W.3/5">The Commission presented a proposal for revision of EU measures to control and eradicate foot and mouth disease. We welcomed the opportunity to update the rules, while recognising that careful consideration would be needed in many areas before new strategies could be put in place.</p>
	<p pid=".145W.3/6">The Commission presented a proposal for the individual identification of sheep and goats. We stressed the need for practical requirements that took account of the structure of the UK industry and the high number of animal movements associated with it.</p>
	<p pid=".145W.3/7">The Council unanimously agreed to ban the import of eggs and poultry from three US states where an outbreak of Newcastle disease has occurred.</p>
	<p pid=".145W.3/8">The Commission gave its regular report on BSE-related developments. It was noteworthy that there had been a significant increase in testing in 2002 but the total of cases identified was similar to that in 2001.</p>
	<p pid=".145W.3/9">Under other business, several delegations urged the Commission to keep the case of processed poultry imports under review to ensure that there was no unfair exploitation of the discounted duty rates that apply. On GMOs, there was an exchange of views regarding the co-existence of GM and non-GM agriculture. We supported the case for fuller discussion but warned against attempts to impose a de facto moratorium on GM approvals. Separately the Commission indicated that existing rules would continue to govern the approval of new GM products. New rules, following Council agreement of principle last November, were still under preparation and could not apply immediately.</p>
	<p pid=".145W.3/10">On fisheries, the Council adopted conclusions welcoming the Commission's communication on the integration of environmental protection with the common fisheries policy and the future actions envisaged in it. We underlined in particular the importance of taking forward action to minimise the by-catch of cetaceans in fishing nets.</p>
	<p pid=".145W.3/11">The Council similarly adopted conclusions welcoming the Commission's strategy for the sustainable development of aquaculture.</p>
	<p pid=".145W.3/12">The Commissioner gave initial presentations on his communication on an integrated framework for fisheries partnerships with third countries, and his proposed draft regulation on the conservation of fishery resources through technical measures for the protection of juveniles of marine organisms (which would consolidate and update the Community's technical conservation requirements). Work will continue on these in coming weeks.</p>
	<p pid=".145W.3/13">Under any other business, Ireland expressed concerns about the Commission's proposals concerning access rules in western Community waters (which are for discussion in coming months) and the Commission expressed its determination to dispel legal uncertainty.</p>

	<p pid=".148W.5/1">Government energy efficiency initiatives and programmes are continually reviewed and evaluated, to assess the impact on carbon abatement, social and environmental issues, as well as the impact on the market and the relevant industry sectors. In addition Government keeps in close contact with the industry to ensure that any assumptions made are as up-to-date and realistic as possible. The capacity of particular energy efficiency industries is an important consideration in the development of new initiatives.</p>

	<p pid=".149W.2/1">Since the publication of the UK's Climate Change Programme in November 2000, the following key actions have been taken to help deliver energy efficiency in both homes and offices across the whole of the country, in both urban and rural areas:</p>
	<p pid=".149W.2/2" class="indent">The Climate Change Levy, a levy on the business use of fuel, was introduced in April 2001. Receipts, forecast at &pound;1 billion a year, are recycled back to business&mdash;including &pound;50 million for business energy efficiency.</p>
	<p pid=".149W.2/3" class="indent">The Carbon Trust was launched in April 2001, and it receives two thirds of its annual budget from recycled receipts from the Climate Change Levy. It encourages and promotes the development of low carbon technologies to support the transition to a low carbon economy. It offers an interest free loan scheme for small and medium sized businesses and provides funding for the development of low carbon technologies through the Low Carbon Innovation Programme.</p>
	<p pid=".149W.2/4" class="indent">The Enhanced Capital Allowances Scheme enables businesses to claim 100 per cent. first year capital allowances on investments in a range of approved energy saving technologies.</p>
	<p pid=".149W.2/5" class="indent">The Energy Efficiency Commitment for 2002&ndash;05 (EEC) places a challenging but realistic obligation on electricity and gas suppliers to promote improvements in domestic energy efficiency. Suppliers will achieve individual EEC targets by encouraging and assisting consumers to take up energy efficiency measures. It is expected to save 0.4 million tonnes of carbon a year by 2005. It will also help those on lower incomes-who spend a larger proportion of their incomes on energy-by focusing at least 50 per cent. of energy savings on consumers in receipt of benefits or tax credits.</p>
	<p pid=".149W.2/6" class="indent">Since its launch in June 2000, the new Home Energy Efficiency Scheme-which is now marketed as Warm Front-has helped over 400,000 households through the installation of a range of insulation and heating measures. Warm Front is the Government's main programme for tackling fuel poverty, aimed at the most vulnerable groups in the private sector in England. Fuel poverty can occur in both urban and rural areas. We have recently received a scoping study looking at alternative technologies to help tackle fuel poverty, which may be of particular benefit to those in rural areas and a working group has reported on the potential to extend the gas network.</p>
	<p pid=".149W.2/7" class="indent">The Community Energy Programme is a &pound;50 million grant programme operational from 2002&ndash;04 aiming to promote community heating in the UK, primarily through the use of CHP. It will install and refurbish community heating schemes, benefiting people on low incomes while contributing to the Climate Change Programme by reducing carbon emissions by an estimated 0.15 million tonnes of carbon a year.</p>
	<p pid=".149W.2/8" class="indent">Part L of the Building Regulations covering energy efficiency provisions was revised in October 2001 and the changes came into effect in 2002. These require work on new buildings and the refurbishment of the existing stock to conform to higher energy efficiency standards including those relating to building insulation, air tightness, lighting, space heating, hot water, boiler performance and replacement glazing. It is estimated that the package of measures introduced in October will reduce carbon emissions from the domestic sector by 0.8 million tonnes per year by 2010.</p>
	<p pid=".149W.2/9" class="indent">The Treasury has recently introduced a VAT reduction on certain energy saving materials installed under grant schemes.</p>
	<p pid=".149W.2/10" class="indent">The Government have provided funding for the Energy Saving Trust (EST) to help individual households, local authorities and others improve domestic energy efficiency. Since 2000, EST has created the Practical Help advisory service, expanded its local authority support programme providing dedicated staff to 23 areas across the UK, introduced a new grant scheme for innovative projects and expanded its network of Energy Efficiency Advice Centres providing households with advice and support. EST has developed the Energy Efficiency Recommended (EER) labelling scheme (with energy efficiency manufacturers, retailers and installers) to provide easy identification of energy efficient products. EST has also developed EEI-the network of accredited installers in the insulation and heating industries.</p>
	<p pid=".149W.2/11" class="indent">The Community Renewables Initiative (administered by the Countryside Agency) gives advice to community groups, individuals and businesses on ways in which they can incorporate energy conservation technologies within their homes, properties and buildings and so increase their energy efficiency. It currently operates in Scotland and in half of England. It is hoped that GB wide coverage of the Initiative will be achieved soon.</p>

	<p pid=".150W.2/1">I represented the UK at Environment Council on <phrase class="date" code="2003-12-09">9 December</phrase>, accompanied by my right hon. Friend the Minister for the Environment. This was the final Environment Council of the Danish Presidency. The Council reached agreement on four proposals and also considered a number of other important issues.</p>
	<p pid=".150W.2/2">Political approval was given to a Regulation implementing the Rotterdam Convention on establishing a system of Prior Informed Consent for trade in hazardous substances, and also to a Decision to ratify the Convention.</p>
	<p pid=".150W.2/3">The Council reached unanimous political agreement on the greenhouse gas Emissions Trading Directive. In negotiation the UK had secured a number of changes to meet our key requirements and I strongly supported this proposal, which gives further effect to the EU's strong commitment to action on climate change. The agreement includes an opt-out for the first phase in 2005&ndash;07, which will assist the transition from established national emissions trading schemes such as we have in the UK into the EU scheme.</p>
	<p pid=".150W.2/4">Political agreement was reached, by a qualified majority, on a Regulation on traceability and labelling of Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs). The package included elements already agreed in Agriculture and Fisheries Council (such as the inclusion of products derived from GMOs but including no detectable GM material and a 0.9 per cent. labelling threshold) for the parallel Regulation on food and feed, which I had voted against. Debate at Environment Council principally concerned the identification requirements for bulk shipments of GMOs in agricultural commodities. I argued that the requirement should be aligned to the language in the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety, which creates an obligation to identify the GMOs a shipment &quot;may contain&quot;. Most other member states were able to accept a wording requiring the identification of GMOs that &quot;have been used&quot; in shipments, which I regarded as unduly restrictive and impractical, and an insufficient reflection of the requirements of the Cartagena Protocol. My view was that the final package did not provide a sound basis for consumer choice, and was unworkable. I therefore voted against, as did the Netherlands, Denmark and Luxembourg, on different grounds.</p>
	<p pid=".150W.2/5">Council Conclusions were adopted on the Community's Strategy on the Sustainable Use of Pesticides. The Conclusions recognised the importance of reducing the environmental impacts of pesticides and emphasised the principle of subsidiarity, calling for Community action to complement action at member state level.</p>
	<p pid=".150W.2/6">The Council adopted Conclusions in advance of the UNEP Governing Council in February 2003. These highlighted the need for a strategic approach to international chemicals management.</p>
	<p pid=".150W.2/7">Member states and other interested parties have been waiting for some time for firm proposals from the Commission for a legislative package on Chemicals. The Danish Presidency called a debate at Council around what it regarded as four key areas of the future chemicals strategy&mdash;scope, sanctions, dealing with chemicals in products and handling small and medium sized enterprises and downstream users. There was a useful discussion and the Commission confirmed that it planned, as urged by the member states, to bring forward proposals as quickly as possible. The residency adopted Conclusions summarising the debate.</p>
	<p pid=".150W.2/8">The Council also took note of progress reports on a proposal for a Regulation concerning monitoring of forests (&quot;Forest Focus&quot;), and on the draft Environmental Liability Directive. There were several difficult outstanding issues on the latter, which would be taken forward under the Greek Presidency.</p>
	<p pid=".150W.2/9">The Council noted a Commission Communication entitled &quot;Towards a strategy to protect and conserve the marine environment&quot;, advocating an ecosystem approach to managing the marine environment. The Danish Presidency gave a report of a marine environment conference held in Denmark in early December.</p>
	<p pid=".150W.2/10">The Council also noted a presentation by the Commission on its proposal to amend the Bathing Water Directive, and a written presentation by the Commission of the recently adopted nuclear package, covering safety of facilities and management of radioactive waste.</p>
	<p pid=".150W.2/11">Spain made a statement on the situation of the sunken oil tanker &quot;Prestige&quot; and its environmental impact on the Galician coast. Portugal and France expressed their own concerns. The Council adopted Conclusions complementing those adopted by Transport Council on <phrase class="date" code="2003-12-06">6 December</phrase>. These Conclusions underlined the significant environmental impact of the incident and encouraged further work in the IMO to tackle these issues. It reiterated the need to ban single hull tankers for the transport of heavy grade oils, called for a review of safety conditions and condemned the practice of cleaning out tanks while at sea.</p>
	<p pid=".150W.2/12">The Danish Presidency reported on the outcome of the 12th Conference of the Parties to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species, attributing much of the success of the conference to the personal contribution made by my hon. Friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State responsible for fisheries, water and nature protection.</p>
	<p pid=".150W.2/13">Portugal made a statement on its difficulties in implementing Natura 2000 when most its sites were in private ownership. The Commission assured Portugal that it was bringing forward a Communication on Natura 2000.</p>
	<p pid=".150W.2/14">Finally, the Council noted a Belgian statement underlining the importance of setting thresholds for the maximum tolerated levels of genetic contamination of seed.</p>

	<p pid=".152W.2/1">The use of three distinct variant specifications for timber and wood products was recommended in the report on the timber scoping study that was commissioned by Defra in October 2001 and is currently under consideration. The rationale for this proposal is: <i>(a)</i> to allow poor producer countries some opportunities to compete for UK Government business and <i>(b)</i> to guard against any shortfall in supply that might jeopardise essential Government operations. The use of variants is permitted by the existing EU public procurement supply directive and the position is not changed by the new procurement directive as currently drafted.</p>
	<p pid=".152W.2/2">What the report commissioned by Defra proposes is that bids based on the variant specification for &quot;legal and progressing towards sustainable&quot; would only be considered in the absence of an acceptable bid based on the higher standard variant specification. Similarly bids based on &quot;legal&quot; timber would only be considered in the absence of acceptable offers based on either of the two higher standard variant specifications.</p>
	<p pid=".152W.2/3">Contracting Authorities would have the option of declining all bids if they believe that inviting fresh tenders would result in acceptable bids for legal and sustainable timber. However, where operational demands rule out such a course of action, it is practicable to include a fall back position that allows buyers to consider bids against the lower variants. Central Government Departments will be advised that whenever they receive acceptable offers to supply legal and sustainable products they should reject bids based on lower standard variant specifications.</p>
	<p pid=".152W.2/4">Public procurement directives require that contracts be awarded either to the lowest bid or to the bid that is most economically advantageous to the Contracting Authority. UK Government procurement policy is to select the most economically advantageous bid criterion because that provides true value for money in terms of quality and whole life costs. Quality in the context of timber procurement includes the standard of forest management. This means that preferring bids based on the top variant for &quot;legal and sustainable&quot; is consistent with both UK Government policy and EC Directives.</p>

The Government have no plans to establish a Fair Price Commission to examine the facts relating to the distribution of profits in the agri-food sector.

	<p pid=".158W.6/4">In addition, the EA will continue to promote a Flood Risk Management Plan for the area in partnership with local authorities and other organisations. Through the plan, the EA will seek to manage and reduce flood risk through the control of development in the flood plain, provide an enhanced flood warning strategy and deal with the longer term impacts of climate change. The EA is also reappraising options for flood alleviation measures in areas at risk of flooding.</p>

	<p pid=".158W.9/2">The Environment Agency's (EA) initial findings from measurements made from weir gauges is that there is no evidence that the Jubilee River has caused downstream water levels to rise, and that in the recent flooding event, the rates of rise upstream and downstream of the Jubilee River were very comparable.</p>
	<p pid=".158W.9/3">The EA has commissioned independent engineering consultants to rerun an updated hydraulic model using 2003 flood data to determine the impact on downstream flood levels. Their preliminary findings show no significant difference between downstream levels, with or without the flood alleviation channel, in the River Thames just downstream of where the Jubilee River rejoins it. I understand the EA plans to make this data and the analysis available to the public.</p>

	<p pid=".159W.2/27">The duration covered by the data set is too short to allow any meaningful analysis of any trends in changes to the condition of assets. In addition, there are variations in the way that the data has been collected that are still being resolved, in effect the data set is still being &quot;bedded down&quot; and any apparent trends are as likely to be as a result of changes to the data as to changes to the defences and structures.

	<p pid=".161W.5/1">It has long been recognised that traditional urban development has an impact on downstream flood flows, typically reducing the time between the rainfall event and the peak flow in the river. This is, for example, incorporated in standard procedures for flood risk assessment set out in the Flood Estimation Handbook produced by the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology with the support of extensive research funded by the Department. It is for this reason that PPG25 promotes the use of sustainable drainage systems for new development that aim to mitigate such impacts. The Environment Agency, as a statutory consultee to the planning authorities, is committed to ensuring that new development adopts such measures, where appropriate, to minimise impact on river levels and flood risk.</p>
	<p pid=".161W.5/2">In Bedfordshire, the Environment Agency in conjunction with partner organisations is actively involved in the Milton Keynes surface water drainage strategy (River Great Ouse and tributaries, upstream of Bedfordshire). It has also been in partnership with other organisations (Beds and Ivel IDE) to produce the Marston Vale surface waters plan. These are examples of initiatives that aim to develop long-term strategies to address surface water run-off problems from development in the relevant areas.</p>

	<p pid=".162W.5/2">The Environment Agency's maps show that 11,694 properties fall within the 1 per cent. probability or 1 in 100 years flood return period in the Spelthorne flood plain. These maps show the indicative floodplain area, not flood risk or definitive flood boundaries, and are based on land topography taking noaccount of the defences which are in place. The Environment Agency, with Defra funding, is creating more refined maps which will take account of likely depth of flooding and also current and planned flood defences. Pilot maps for four areas should be available soon with complete coverage planned for later in the year. To support this improved understanding of flood risk on a national basis, the EA are also developing a National Flood and Coastal Defence Database, again with funding from Defra. The aim of the project is to provide a single, easily accessible definitive store for all data on flood and coastal defences.</p>

	<p pid=".163W.0/1">The assessment is in progress. The UK is the lead competent authority for this application from Monsanto under Directive 2001/18 on the release of GMOs to the environment. Monsanto has applied for consent to import into the European Community this GM maize grain for use as or in food and feed products. The application is for import only and does not cover proposed cultivation uses. The UK authorities are required to assess whether the GMO in question should be placed on the European Community market and, if so, under what conditions. If the UK authorities form the view that the application does comply with Directive 2001/18, other member states and the European Commission will then have the opportunity to comment on the assessment or raise reasoned objections as regards possible risks to the environment or human health. The assessment will be made available to the public. No decision on the placing of the product on the market can be made until other member states and the Commission have given their views.</p>

	<p pid=".163W.6/35">Bushmeat is defined as the meat of any wild animal hunted for food. It is not necessarily from endangered species. There is little evidence that meat from endangered species for human consumption is entering the country on a large scale. Indeed, bushmeat forms a very small proportion of illegal imports seized&mdash;around 2.5 per cent. Chicken or pork make up the vast majority of reported meat seizures.</p>

	<p pid=".167W.2/1">I announced on <phrase class="date" code="2002-10-17">17 October 2002</phrase> that there would be no change to the packaging waste recycling targets in the UK for 2003. Before the decision was taken to leave the targets unchanged, we consulted with other departments, including the DTI, Cabinet Office and the Treasury. We are required to hold a public consultation only if changes are being proposed to the Regulations. The decision to make no changes to the targets was taken largely because we did not know what targets the new EC Directive is going to set, nor to what deadline. Under these circumstances, I was unwilling to go into a consultation which would have meant 2003 targets being announced well into 2003.</p>
	<p pid=".167W.2/2">We have received a number of letters from British Glass regarding the effects of leaving the targets unchanged on the PRN market. Concern was also voiced at the December meeting of the compliance scheme body (CoSWiG) which I attended.</p>
	<p pid=".167W.2/3">We expect the level of recycling to rise slightly in 2003, consistent with the increase in the amount of packaging in the waste stream, but it could be greater if additional obligated businesses are identified. Estimates of available capacity, and of PRN prices, are affected, too, by an ongoing examination of whether reprocessing claimed so far in 2002 relates exclusively to packaging waste, and as to how far other factors have a significant influence. It is also expected that industry will be focussing in 2003 on starting the process necessary to have the requisite collection capacity in place in 2004&ndash;05. Inaction now will make the period 2004&ndash;08 more difficult. We expect to consult later this year on business targets in the packaging Regulations for the period 2004&ndash;08, or at least on targets for three years, to be rolled forward. It will be important for industry to set action in hand now if they are to have the necessary infrastructure in place to meet what are certainly higher targets in this period.</p>

	<p pid=".168W.5/2">The Department is promoting the Catchment Flood Management Plan (CFMP) initiative with the Environment Agency and has to date made funds available for five pilot studies. The Agency has developed a programme for delivery of CFMPs to cover the whole of England over the next five years.</p>
	<p pid=".168W.5/3">The Thames Valley will be covered by eight plans; one for the River Thames itself and seven others on the major tributaries. The scoping phase of these plans has just started and is programmed to be complete by September.</p>
	<p pid=".168W.5/4">Once the scoping work has been completed, subject to a satisfactory review of the five pilot plans, the main studies will begin. Currently, the eight plans for the Thames Valley are scheduled to be completed by December 2005.</p>

	<p pid=".168W.11/1">The most recent estimates published by the Government are contained in the Waste Strategy 2000 for England and Wales, Part 2, Appendix B. (Cm 4693&ndash;2) (<a href="http://defraweb/environment/waste/strategy/cm4693/index.htm">http://defraweb/environment/waste/strategy/cm4693/index.htm</a>). This contains the following information.</p>
	<p pid=".168W.11/2">Several studies have been published which attempt to value the environmental costs and benefits of different waste management options. It is difficult to make comparison between these studies, as they adopt different assumptions about technology used, emissions factors, environmental impact of emissions and economic values of environmental impacts. They do not all have the same coverage of environmental impact and some emissions and impacts are omitted due to absent data. Some studies do not adequately report the uncertainty in their estimates of environmental costs, and these are likely to be significant.</p>
	<p pid=".168W.11/3">Most of the work done so far looks at single waste management options (ETU 1996), single materials (BNMA 1995), or compares the environmental costs of incineration and landfill (CSERGE 1993). Only one major study (Coopers and Lybrand 1997) compares incineration, landfill and recycling the different fractions of MSW. The result of these studies generally support the view that recycling has net environmental benefits over incineration and landfill (with the possible exception of certain materials, such as plastic film). The results of the Coopers and Lybrand (1997) study are shown in the table (Table C4, options with negative external cost have net environmental benefits). However, these estimates seem to omit the costs of leachate from landfills, all disamenity costs and some of the environmental costs of processing for recycling.</p>

	<p pid=".168W.11/22"><i>Source:</i>Adapted from Cooper and Lybrand (1997)</p>
	<p pid=".168W.11/23">CSERGE (1993) suggests that existing rural landfill sites without energy recovery may have net external costs of between &pound;1.09 and &pound;10.90 per tonne (1999 prices). These estimates exclude disamenity costs which the study suggests could be significant. The same study suggests that urban incinerators with energy recovery may have net external benefits up to &pound;15.20 per tonne, through to a net environmental cost &pound;4.10 per tonne (1999 prices). However, this does not reflect potential disamenity impacts and it assumes that the electricity generated displaces in that of a coal-fired power station.</p>
	<p pid=".168W.11/24">These estimates of external costs should be viewed with caution, due to the level of uncertainty in quantifying and valuing impacts, particularly those on human health. However they do provide an indication of the relative impacts of different waste management options&mdash;while recognising that the external costs per tonne of waste may vary according to location and the quantity of waste sent to each option.</p>

	<p pid=".171W.2/1">As disclosed in the departmental minute of <phrase class="date" code="2002-12-17">17 December 2002</phrase>, there is a group of warranties for which Ministry of Defence has a maximum liability equivalent to the cash proceeds received in relation to the transaction. The precise value of these proceeds will not be confirmed until after the completion accounts have been finalised, but is currently forecast to be &pound;140 to &pound;150 million. In setting MOD's maximum liability to the purchaser, we have deducted the &pound;50 million already received as part of the PPP process, as this was a previous payment made directly to MOD by QinetiQ.</p>
	<p pid=".171W.2/2">In addition, as set out in the departmental minute, MOD has given further indemnities for which the maximum possible exposure is as follows:</p>
	<p pid=".171W.2/3" class="indent">compensation for the premature cancellation for the 25-year Long Term Partnering Agreement for Ranges and Test and Evaluation services (sliding scale from &pound;40 million in year one to zero at the end of year three);</p>
	<p pid=".171W.2/4" class="indent">an actuarial adjustment to the QinetiQ pension fund (maximum &pound;45 million);</p>
	<p pid=".171W.2/5" class="indent">certain specific provisions in QinetiQ's accounts (maximum &pound;4.3 million); and</p>
	<p pid=".171W.2/6" class="indent">costs arising but not yet incurred related to vesting of QinetiQ (maximum &pound;3 million).</p>
	<p pid=".171W.2/7">The actual costs that might arise in these areas are impossible to predict. However, MOD has taken measures which we believe reduce the potential financial risks to a very low level, and we do not anticipate making significant payments against these contingent liabilities.</p>

This is an annual average figure based on direct costs charged for financial year 2001&ndash;02, which was the last full financial year prior to her decommissioning in November 2002. In addition, during 1992 HMS Sheffield underwent a planned docking period for routine repair work. While the exact cost of the period is no longer available, it is estimated that it would have cost some &pound;5 million to &pound;6 million, based on other similar work at the time. In 1996, HMS Sheffield underwent a major refit at a cost of about &pound;15.9 million. This was her last major upkeep period.</p>

	<p pid=".176W.6/1">All members of the Territorial Army may be called out when a call-out order made under the Reserve Forces Act 1996 is in force. However, it is Ministry of Defence policy that members of the Territorial Army whose reserve liabilities predate the Reserve Forces Act 1996 are only called out if they had a liability under a corresponding power in the Reserve Forces Act 1980 unless they voluntarily elected to assume the liabilities of the 1996 Act.</p>
	<p pid=".176W.6/2">Five call-out orders are currently in force. Of these, three were made under Section 54 of the Reserve Forces Act 1996 and two were made under Section 56 of that Act. The corresponding power to Section 54 was Section of the 11 Reserve Forces Act 1980. The majority of members of the Territorial Army had a liability under that section and are therefore liable to be called out. However, there is no call-out power in the 1980 Act which corresponds to section 56 of the 1996 Act. Therefore reservists whose liabilities predate the Reserve Forces Act 1996 and who did not voluntarily elect to assume the liabilities under that Act are not called out under that section.</p>

	<p pid=".181W.0/1">The European Commission published in November 2001 a notice in the Official Journal of the European Communities, alerting EC importers of the ineligibility of products originating from settlements in the occupied territories for preferences provided for by the EU/lsrael Association Agreement. Along with customs authorities in other Community member states, Customs and Excise are selecting for verification those imports where preference has been claimed under the terms of the Agreement but where there is evidence that the goods are likely to have been produced in the Occupied Territories. Security for duty is being taken on such imports while verification enquiries are undertaken. Customs require payment of duty if they do not receive adequate confirmation that goods originated in Israel itself.</p>

Copies are available in the Library. Estimates covering 2000&ndash;01 are scheduled for publication in March 2003.</p>
	<p pid=".182W.3/3">We welcome the findings of the recent National Audit Office (NAO) report, &quot;Tackling Pensioner Poverty; encouraging take up of benefits&quot;; which made a number of recommendations to improve the take up of benefits and make them easier to claim. We are pleased that the majority of the actions recommended are already well in train. We have introduced various initiatives to encourage pensioners to take-up the benefits to which they are entitled. As a consequence of one take-up campaign we put an average of &pound;20 a week in the pockets of an extra 140,000 MIG recipients. We are working in partnership with organisations for older people on a series of initiatives and have already introduced a shortened claim form to make it easier for pensioners to claim MIG.</p>
	<p pid=".182W.3/4">It is not possible to be precise about the number of pensioners who might be entitled to Attendance Allowance (AA) if they claimed it. This is because entitlement to AA is determined on the customer's specific circumstances which can only be determined after a claim has been made. Up to date estimates of the take up of Attendance Allowance (AA) and Disability Living Allowance (DLA) are not available and could be obtained only at disproportionate cost.</p>
	<p pid=".182W.3/5">The Disability Benefits Modernisation Programme has been set up to improve the information given to people about AA and the way claims are made. It is working on a range of initiatives including designing a new AA claim form and process, redesigning forms seeking medical evidence and the introduction of improved IT.</p>

	<p pid=".185W.7/1">The Chancellor and I asked Derek Higgs to report on the role and effectiveness of non-executive directors. Research for his review, published on <phrase class="date" code="2003-01-20">20 January</phrase>, showed that in the FTSE-100, women represent 11 per cent. of non-executive directors, 3 per cent. of executive directors and 1 per cent. of chairmen.</p>
	<p pid=".185W.7/2">Derek Higgs emphasised in his review the importance of promoting meritocracy in the boardroom. He also noted that the composition of a board sends important signals about the values of the company. A commitment to equal opportunities is inevitably undermined, he argued, if the board itself does not follow the same guiding principles. He recommended that there should be a formal, rigorous and transparent process for the appointment of new directors to the boards of listed companies. Companies would need to set out the process used, and explain if external advice or open advertising has not been used. At the start of an appointment process, the balance of skills, knowledge and experience on the board should be evaluated and a description of the role and capabilities prepared for a particular appointment. These will be incorporated in a revised combined code applying to listed companies.</p>
	<p pid=".185W.7/3">He also made various proposals to widen the pool from which non-executive directors are drawn, which in many cases would bring in more women. These include more executive directors and senior executives from other companies and directors of private companies, as well as advisers and those from other backgrounds. A small group of business leaders and others will be set up, led by Laura Tyson, Dean of London Business School, to bring to greater prominence candidates from the non-commercial sector. This will describe the profile of relevant skills and experience that make an effective non-executive director with such a background and a list will be developed of around 100 individuals. As women are more strongly represented at senior levels in the non-commercial sector, the expected outcome would be that a significant proportion would be female. The group will report to me in May.</p>
	<p pid=".185W.7/4">He also noted that areas where women tend to be more strongly represented are in roles such as human resources, change management and customer care which are not regarded as traditional routes to the board. Yet the issues dealt with in such roles, and the skills needed, are important ones for the board, and he hoped that in future boards would draw more actively from these groups.</p>
	<p pid=".185W.7/5">The Government welcomed Derek Higgs' recommendations. We will be looking to listed companies to put them into early effect as they make changes to their boards. I also hope that shareholders will play their part in pressing to ensure meritocracy and diversity in appointments to boards.</p>

The Department also provided the same material on the ACLF to local LSCs to help inform their strategic planning.</p>

	<p pid=".192W.8/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2003-01-15">15 January</phrase> an historic national agreement was signed by government, employers and school workforce unions, paving the way for radical workforce reform to raise standards and tackle teacher workload. The agreement covers progressive reductions in teachers' total hours, and changes to teachers' contracts to ensure they do not routinely undertake administrative and clerical tasks. To help achieve this, funding is in place to improve support available to both headteachers and teachers. There will also be a concerted attack on unnecessary bureaucracy and paperwork.</p>
	<p pid=".192W.8/2">Schools are to be enabled to recruit at least 50,000 additional support staff during this Parliament. This will include personal administrative assistants for teachers and additional technical support, as well as new managers from outside education and the training and recruitment of more bursars to relieve the burden on headteachers of financial and administrative work. We are also investing in teachers' personal access to computers&mdash;the total budget has risen from &pound;100 million to &pound;300 million, and the programme's duration from two years to four years, providing over 300,000 laptops.</p>
	<p pid=".192W.8/3">To tackle bureaucracy, we are setting up an independent Implementation Review Unit to consider the workload impact of existing and new initiatives. The focus will extend beyond DfES and will cover all bodies which impact upon schools, including national agencies such as Ofsted, the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority and the Teacher Training Agency, as well as local education authorities and learning and skills councils. It will feature a panel of practitioners&mdash;overwhelmingly serving headteachers. They will have direct access to Ministers, will scrutinise existing policies and programmes and identify priorities for end to end reviews to eliminate burdens. Panel members will make sure that grass-roots concerns get through to DfES and central agencies, and are tackled.</p>

	<p pid=".195W.3/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid=".195W.3/2">The Government did not sign Protocol 12 because it was not satisfied with the drafting of the text. In particular, we considered that there is uncertainty about the scope for positive action and as regards the meaning of the reference in the text to &quot;any right set forth by law.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".195W.3/3">The Government remains in favour of a free-standing prohibition on discrimination. We have undertaken to keep the matter under careful consideration and to take account of the jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights as it develops. We will report any new thinking as part of our general review of international human rights instruments, which is due to be completed in the spring of this year.</p>

	<p pid=".196W.8/1">My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs and I represented the UK at the General Affairs and External Relations Council in Brussels on 27 and <phrase class="date" code="2003-01-28">28 January</phrase>, 2003. Conclusions were agreed by consensus and no formal votes were taken.</p>
	<p pid=".196W.8/2" class="italic">General Affairs Session</p>
	<p pid=".196W.8/3" class="italic">Operational Programme of the Council for 2003 and Western Balkans (external session)</p>
	<p pid=".196W.8/4">The Council heard presentations from the President and the High Representative about their recent visits to the Western Balkans and from Commissioner Patten on Stabilisation and Association Process (SAP) developments.</p>
	<p pid=".196W.8/5">Separately, in the Council's public debate on the Operational Programme of the Council (broadcast live) the Presidency stressed that the Union's relations with the Western Balkans would constitute a major priority and that the EU was keen to capitalise on the positive results so far yielded. Work would continue on consolidating democratic institutions, protection of minorities, promotion of economic reconstruction and regional co-operation. The Thessalonika European Council on <phrase class="date" code="2003-06-21">21 June 2003</phrase> is expected to lend a new impetus to this process. I welcomed the Presidency's focus, and emphasised the importance of entrenching the rule of law. Several speakers referred to the importance of the fight against crime and corruption. <i>Progress of work in other Council configurations</i></p>
	<p pid=".196W.8/6">The Council took note of the Presidency's progress report on the state of play. The report highlights agreements reached on several important dossiers, including the Single European Sky, the greenhouse emission allowance, the Regulation on GMOs, the 'Dublin II Regulation (on member state responsibility for assessing asylum claims), as well as measures taken following the 'Prestige' accident. Particular attention was drawn to the ECOFIN agreement on the taxation of savings.</p>

	<p pid=".196W.8/8">The Presidency debriefed on the successful conclusion of consultations with the European Parliament on the modalities for appointing the Members of the European Commission from the new member states for the remainder of the Commission's mandate, until late 2004.</p>
	<p pid=".196W.8/9">The Presidency also outlined their priorities; these included taking forward the December 2002 Transport and Environment Council conclusions concerning measures to be implemented following the 'Prestige' accident; and continuing work on the 'Wider Europe' agenda, with the Western Balkans, Russia, Ukraine, Moldova and Belarus, and the southern Mediterranean countries.</p>
	<p pid=".196W.8/10" class="italic">Enlargement</p>
	<p pid=".196W.8/11">The Presidency reported on its enlargement work programme and reiterated the priority it attached to meeting the timetable set by the European Copenhagen Council in December 2002. This included completing and signing the Accession Treaty on <phrase class="date" code="2003-04-16">16 April 2003</phrase> in Athens, ensuring the smooth integration of all new member states, and continuing to monitor the transposition of the acquis by the acceding states.</p>
	<p pid=".196W.8/12">Recalling the European Council's preference for the accession of united Cyprus, the Presidency welcomed the resumption of talks between the two parties in Cyprus and their willingness to conclude a comprehensive settlement by <phrase class="date" code="2003-02-28">28 February 2003</phrase>. The Commission referred to the possibility of a donors' conference to raise funds to support a settlement.</p>
	<p pid=".196W.8/13">The Presidency stated its strong desire to maintain the momentum of the negotiations with Bulgaria and Romania and to strive energetically to strengthen further Turkey's accession strategy.

	<p pid=".196W.8/15">Member states broadly welcomed a presentation by President Prodi on the Commission's 2003 spring synthesis report, drawn up in view of the spring European Council meeting on <phrase class="date" code="2003-03-21">21 March 2003</phrase>. <i>External Relations Session</i></p>
	<p pid=".196W.8/16" class="italic">Western Balkans</p>
	<p pid=".196W.8/17">In addition to discussion in the Open Debate, the Council adopted conclusions on:</p>
	<p pid=".196W.8/18" class="italic">Federal Republic of Yugoslavia</p>
	<p pid=".196W.8/19">The Council welcomed the recent progress on Serbia and Montenegro's Constitutional Charter and Implementing Law, and urged their early parliamentary approval and their full implementation.

	<p pid=".196W.8/20" class="italic">Bosnia and Herzegovina</p>
	<p pid=".196W.8/21">The Council welcomed the formation of governments at the State and Republika Srpska levels and looked forward to the prompt formation of the Federation Government. It urged the BiH authorities to proceed rapidly with the implementation of the reforms necessary for progress in the Stabilisation and Association Process (SAP), including the establishment of a single state-level customs and VAT system.</p>
	<p pid=".196W.8/22" class="italic">Co-operation with the International Criminal Tribunal for former Yugoslavia (ICTY)</p>
	<p pid=".196W.8/23">The Council welcomed that former Serbian President Milan Milutonovic will appear before the ICTY but expressed concerns that co-operation with FRY and ICTY remained insufficient. Failure to co-operate could seriously jeopardise further movement towards the EU.</p>
	<p pid=".196W.8/24" class="italic">European Security and Defence Policy</p>
	<p pid=".196W.8/25" class="italic">FYROM</p>
	<p pid=".196W.8/26">The High Representative, Mr. Solana, debriefed on the preparations for the first ESDP military operation. The Council agreed on a Joint Action to launch this operation.

	<p pid=".196W.8/27" class="italic">EU Police Mission (EUPM)</p>
	<p pid=".196W.8/28">The Council also welcomed the successful start of the EUPM in Bosnia and Herzegovina on <phrase class="date" code="2003-01-01">1 January 2003</phrase>, the first operation under ESDP. The Council welcomed the commitments made by the new Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina to work with the EUPM.</p>
	<p pid=".196W.8/29" class="italic">EU-Africa Relations and Zimbabwe</p>
	<p pid=".196W.8/30">Ministers discussed the renewal of EU sanctions against Zimbabwe (set to expire on <phrase class="date" code="2003-02-18">18 February</phrase>), handling of the Franco-African Summit (Paris, 20&ndash;<phrase class="date" code="2003-02-21">21 February</phrase>) and the EU-Africa Summit (Lisbon, 4&ndash;<phrase class="date" code="2003-04-05">5 April</phrase>).</p>
	<p pid=".196W.8/31">The outcome is that Coreper has been tasked to pursue, rapidly, work on the draft Common Position on Zimbabwe, renewing the targeted sanctions, with particular attention on the procedure for granting any exemptions to the travel ban. The measures in place include: an embargo on the sale, supply or transfer of arms and technical advice; assistance or training related to military activities; an embargo on the sale or supply of equipment that could be used for internal repression; as well as a travel ban on and a freezing of funds, financial assets and economic resources of certain members of the Government of Zimbabwe and those bearing a particular responsibility for the observed violations.</p>
	<p pid=".196W.8/32">In the discussion, we made clear that public opinion would not understand a failure to continue sanctions. We also made clear our firm opposition to the attendance of the EU/Africa Summit by President Mugabe. Several partners spoke along similar lines. Some others emphasised the importance of continued engagement with Zimbabwe.</p>
	<p pid=".196W.8/33" class="italic">Central Africa</p>
	<p pid=".196W.8/34">The Council heard presentations by the Belgian Minister, following his recent trip to Central Africa, and by EU Special Representative, Ajello, on the implementation of the Pretoria Agreement. In its conclusions, the Council stressed inter alia that it could see no alternative to securing peace and stability in the Congo, other than through the global and inclusive Agreement on transition, signed in Pretoria on <phrase class="date" code="2002-12-17">17 December 2002</phrase>. It urged all parties to complete negotiations on the outstanding points and to speedily establish the institutions required for transition. It reaffirmed its willingness to support transition to free and transparent elections, and intention to implement programmes to promote aid, the strengthening of state structure and the economic reconstruction of the country, as soon as its institutions are in place.</p>
	<p pid=".196W.8/35" class="italic">Cote D'Ivoire</p>
	<p pid=".196W.8/36">The French Minister briefed his colleagues on prospects following the agreement among the representative Ivorian political forces, reached on <phrase class="date" code="2003-01-24">24 January</phrase>.

	<p pid=".196W.8/40">Ministers discussed this over lunch on <phrase class="date" code="2003-01-27">27 January</phrase>. Several speakers emphasised that a diplomatic solution was desirable but would be possible only if there was unanimity in the international community plus a credible threat of force. War might still be avoided but it would require real pressure to get Saddam Hussein to change his approach. In its conclusions, the Council reaffirmed that its goal remains the effective and complete disarmament of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction, its support for UN efforts to secure full and immediate compliance; its appreciation for the work accomplished by the inspectors so far, urging the Iraqi authorities to engage in full and active co-operation with UNMOVIC and the IAEA; the fundamental importance of preventing proliferation of weapons of mass destruction; and the role of the UNSC in the implementation of UNSC 1441. On the second day of the Council there was an informal and inconclusive exchange following the debriefing of the UN Security Council by Mr. Blix.</p>
	<p pid=".196W.8/41" class="italic">North Korea</p>
	<p pid=".196W.8/42">The Council welcomed the envisaged meeting between the permanent members of the Security Council and the EU, Japan and the two Koreas.

The EU should stay in close touch with the major players. Other speakers agreed.</p>
	<p pid=".196W.8/43" class="italic">EC's approach to WTO Doha Development Agenda agriculture negotiations</p>
	<p pid=".196W.8/44">After initial reluctance by a few member states, the Council agreed that the Commission should table its paper at the WTO Agriculture Negotiations. The Commission was clear that the timetable for its proposals in the mid term review of the CAP remained unchanged.</p>
	<p pid=".196W.8/45" class="italic">Items approved without debate</p>
	<p pid=".196W.8/46" class="italic">Relations with Russia</p>

Our understanding is that the Constitutional Court has reached its judgment based on the legislation's compatibility with Peru's international human rights obligations. The laws in question were adopted in 1992 and have been the subject of criticism internationally. The Peruvian Government intends to adopt new legislation within 30 working days of this ruling. We support the Peruvian Government's efforts to improve and protect human rights for all Peruvians. We maintain a good dialogue with Peru on human rights matters as well as security aspects in common to both sides, including terrorism.</p>

The term has become widely used by media and commentators to describe states of proliferation concern and those which provide succour and support for terrorism.

The White Paper was published following a review of current licensing laws that involved all key stakeholders including the licensed trade, the police and local authorities. 1,215 individuals and organisations responded to the White Paper, including many members of the public. The majority of responses were in favour of the proposed reforms.</p>
	<p pid=".207W.4/3">In addition to publishing Explanatory Notes with the Licensing Bill, the Government will be issuing guidance to licensing authorities and the police when the Bill receives Royal Assent. A draft version of the guidance will be made available before the Bill reaches Report Stage in the House of Lords. The guidance will explain in clear terms how the new licensing system will work and, like the Bill, is being prepared in consultation with other Government Departments, executive agencies and an Advisory Group comprising representatives of the following organisations:</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2003-02-04.88247.r0" oldstyleid="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2003-02-04.210W.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/978" speakername="Kim Howells" colnum="210W"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200203/cmhansrd/vo030204/text/30204w22.htm#30204w22.html_spnew2">
	<p pid=".210W.0/1">In developing the proposals in the Licensing Bill the Government were careful to ensure that it included appropriate exemptions in relation to the provision of entertainment, including live music, for any faith when they are engaged in worship or any form of religious meeting. The Bill as drafted draws a distinction, however, between the provision of secular entertainment in a place of public religious worship and entertainment which is provided there for, or incidental to, a religious service or meeting. The Government are aware of the concerns that have been expressed about the licensing of secular entertainment in places of public religious worship and we have discussed possible solutions with faith organisations. An amendment extending the exemption to the provision of any entertainment or entertainment facilities at a place of public religious worship has been tabled for consideration at Report stage in another place.</p>
	<p pid=".210W.0/2">Under the Bill as presently drafted, carol singing as part of, or incidental to, a religious service or meeting would not be licensable as the exemption in paragraph 9 of Schedule 1 to the Bill would apply. This exemption relates to the activity, not the place, and therefore applies irrespective of the venue. However, if a carol concert were held not as part of, or incidental to, a religious service or meeting it would be licensable and authorisation would be needed either under a premises licence or a temporary event notice. As noted above, an amendment has been tabled for consideration at Report stage in another place.</p>
	<p pid=".210W.0/3">Bell ringing would not be licensable under the Bill if it were part of, or incidental to, a religious service or meeting. Further, if bell ringing is undertaken as a hobby or for practice, it would not be licensable because it would not be being provided for the public. However, if a bell ringing concert is put on for the public and it is not part of a religious meeting or service, then it would be licensable under the Bill as drafted. As already noted, an amendment has been tabled for consideration at Report stage in another place.</p>
	<p pid=".210W.0/4">Under the current law, live music is licensable in community centres and village and parish halls.Outside Greater London these venues enjoy an exemption from fees in respect of public entertainment. Under the Bill, fees will be set centrally by the Secretary of State in regulations and the Government have announced their intention to exempt church halls, chapel halls or other similar buildings occupied in connection with a place of public religious worship, and village halls, parish or community halls or other similar buildings from the fees associated with the provision of entertainment under the licensing regime.</p>
	<p pid=".210W.0/5">The Government do not anticipate that the Licensing Bill will cause any adverse impact on the ability of churches and village halls to host community events involving live music, and in fact believe that the new system of premises licences and temporary event notices will be simpler for applicants than the current regime. No specific estimates were made of the costs that would be incurred by churches and village halls in North Yorkshire. However, a Regulatory Impact Assessment was published with the Bill.</p>
	<p pid=".210W.0/6">As the Bill is currently drafted, a Christian musical staged in a church or a church hall would not be licensable if it were provided for the purposes of, or for purposes incidental to, a religious meeting or service, but it would otherwise be licensable. As noted, an amendment has been tabled for consideration at Report stage in another place.</p>

	<p pid=".216W.0/1">There are currently no plans to introduce mandatory labelling of cigarette packets detailing additives. The number of additives contained in a brand of cigarette ranges greatly depending on the brand from under 20 to possibly over 100. The Government believes that it would be difficult to label these effectively on cigarette packets, in a fashion that is meaningful to the consumer.</p>
	<p pid=".216W.0/2">However the Government has recently made Regulations setting out new requirements for the labelling of cigarette packets with larger, starker health warnings, including drawing attention to the chemicals in tobacco smoke.</p>
	<p pid=".216W.0/3">The Regulations also provide for the Government to collect information about ingredients contained in tobacco products. We are collecting this data and plan to make information about product ingredients available to the public in a meaningful way.</p>

	<p pid=".217W.11/1">A total of 139 expressions of interest were received for field site status, covering 27 of the 28 strategic health authorities. Fifty applications, grouped into 26 field sites, have been approved by the programme steering board for further development. More detailed work now needs to be done to ensure that the applicants are able to deliver the required learning within the capacity of the programme. Officials from the Modernisation Agency will visit each of these 50 applicants soon, and we will publish a list of participants in the options for change field sites once this work has been completed.</p>
	<p pid=".217W.11/2">Some 79 applications were found not to fall within the seven key themes in the options for change report. The remaining 10, while not suitable for field site status, are being considered for inclusion in other modernisation programmes, for example, development of the information technology infrastructure for National Health Service dentistry andpersonal dental services pilot schemes.</p>
	<p pid=".217W.11/3">With their positive response to the call for applications to become field sites dentists have demonstrated a most welcome commitment to changing the way in which NHS dentistry is organised. This together with the Government's intention to legislate to enable far reaching reform for NHS dentistry provides an opportunity to address the problems that have been identified with the system over many years.</p>

Latest figures suggest a further increase of around 200 in the current financial year. We are expecting further increases in the numbers entering midwifery training over the next three years.

A benchmark statement for midwifery education was published in 2002. It brings together all the stakeholder requirements, i.e., the NMC, workforce development confederations and higher education, as a single shared statement that describes the nature, characteristics and expected standards and learning outcomes of midwifery programmes.</p>
	<p pid=".222W.6/3">During the academic years 2003&ndash;06, all national health service funded midwifery education, alongside nursing and allied health professional education, will be reviewed, against respective benchmark statements, using the new integrated and streamlined process of major review. Reports will be published for each higher education institution and their associated workforce development confederation.</p>

	<p pid=".223W.5/1">The main Government agency for research into the causes of and treatments for disease is the Medical Research Council (MRC). The Department of Health also funds research to support policy and the delivery of effective practice in the national health service.</p>
	<p pid=".223W.5/2">The MRC spent &pound;1.4 million in 2001&ndash;02 on research relevant to motor neurone disease (MND) and on basic work on the function of motor neurones. The MRC also supports a large portfolio of basic research into the biology of the brain and the nervous system in both normal and diseased states. Such studies may well have relevance to the treatment of MND and related conditions in the future.</p>
	<p pid=".223W.5/3">The Department of Health has also supported work in this area. Recent research projects include &quot;The Clinical Effectiveness and Cost Effectiveness of Riluzole for the Treatment of Motor Neurone Disease&quot; that completed in December 2001. There is an on-going project on speech recognition for people with severe dysarthria that is due for completion in July 2003. Dysarthria is the inability to articulate speech and is common in MND patients.</p>
	<p pid=".223W.5/4">Also, a project entitled &quot;Health and Independence through Education: a controlled evaluation&quot; ended last year. It assessed the value of education in promoting health and independence for people with progressive neurological disorders.</p>

The NSF will include services for people with Parkinson's disease, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, MND and other similar conditions. Publication of the NSF is currently planned for 2004, with implementation starting in 2005.</p>

	<p pid=".227W.2/2">The Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition is currently considering whether the evidence on dietary salt and health has altered since it was looked at in 1994 by the Committee on the Medical Aspects of Food and Nutrition. Salt intakes by adults are currently recommended to reduce by around 30 per cent. A final report on this is expected to be published in the spring. In anticipation of the report, the Food Standards Agency and the Department are currently engaged in discussions with the food industry about salt reductions in processed foods already achieved and the scope for further reductions.</p>

Where claims are made about the quantity of salt present in packaged food, either in words of by using voluntary logos or symbols, full nutrition information must be given. The Food Standards Agency is pressing for European Union rules to require compulsory nutrition labelling (including a declaration of salt content) on all foods, and in a format that is consumer friendly. Consumer research is being carried out to determine the ideal content and format of the nutrition label.</p>

The HSC advises that all NHS trusts and health authorities are expected to issue guidance to staff so that they know how to raise concerns in a reasonable and responsible way. The Department's policy is that, wherever possible, concerns raised by staff should be dealt with locally in accordance with local policies and procedures on whistleblowing, so that problems can be addressed quickly. However, there have been cases where whistleblowers have considered the local response inadequate, and, as a consequence, have sought to raise their concerns with the Department. At present, these cases would be examined by the relevant Directorate of Health and Social Care, on behalf of the Department.</p>

	<p pid=".230W.9/1">One of the stated objectives of the Millennium Experience was to support the regeneration efforts on the Greenwich Peninsula. English Partnerships' acquisition of land on the Greenwich Peninsula for the Millennium celebrations has so far resulted in: reclamation of 289 acres of despoiled land; installation of servicing and public access across the land; private investment of over &pound;400 million in the Millennium Village, a new cinema, retail and hotel developments on the Peninsula; the provision of a new school and health centre; 50 acres of new parkland, a new ecology park and yacht club, and over 12,000 trees planted. The Village will ultimately have some 1,400 homes, 300 of which have been completed so far: 20 per cent. will be affordable.</p>
	<p pid=".230W.9/2">A study commissioned by the New Millennium Experience Company, English Partnerships and the London borough of Greenwich in 1999 found that the preparation for and running of the Millennium celebrations at the Dome led to the creation of 7,700 jobs in construction, 5,300 jobs in management and operation of the Dome. In addition, of the &pound;500 million worth of contracts let for the Dome, companies in Greenwich won &pound;44.7 million.</p>
	<p pid=".230W.9/3">These developments and activities have helped narrow the gap between the unemployment rate in Greenwich and the rate in London from 2.9 per cent. in April 1993 to 1.0 per cent. in November 2002.</p>
	<p pid=".230W.9/4">The regeneration momentum is being maintained, and will be boosted further on the Peninsula by the deal signed by English Partnerships on <phrase class="date" code="2002-05-29">29 May 2002</phrase>, under which Meridian Delta Ltd and Anschutz Entertainment Group are committed to investing &pound;200 million in the Dome. MDL expects the total investment in the development on the Greenwich Peninsula to be up to &pound;4 billion. The development is expected to deliver around 20,000 full-time equivalent jobs.</p>
	<p pid=".230W.9/5">The deal is subject primarily to planning permission. An application for planning permission was submitted to Greenwich Council on <phrase class="date" code="2002-12-23">23 December 2002</phrase>, for a new 26,000 capacity arena inside the Dome, with associated leisure, entertainment, retail, exhibition and community uses in and around the Dome; over 10,000 homes on the Peninsula of which a substantial number will be affordable; 3.5 million sq. ft. of commercial development; and associated infrastructure and public open space. An interim base-line study and evaluation published by the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions in 2000 confirmed that the Peninsula developments were acting as a catalyst for regeneration in Greenwich and the Thames Gateway, and that the developments demonstrated best practice in terms of sustainable development. It is intended to follow up that research with a further evaluation and long-term monitoring of the Peninsula regeneration.</p>

The amendments to the 1996 Act which came into force on <phrase class="date" code="2003-01-31">31 January 2003</phrase>, include a provision to make it easier for housing authorities to offer housing applicants a choice of accommodation, whether they live within or outside that local authority area.

	<p pid=".236W.10/1">The NAO report recommends that Departments should: ensure that planned improvements in efficiency and quality of service are achieved; adopt a portfolio approach to assessing quality of service; ensure that reliable information is available and regularly monitored to give assurance that services are delivered cost effectively; manage call centre resources to handle peaks and troughs in the volume of calls; and provide better information for the public on the services which they can obtain by telephone.</p>
	<p pid=".236W.10/2">The Department welcomes this report. As far as the specific recommendations are concerned:</p>
	<p pid=".236W.10/3" class="indent">DWP accepts the need for a robust business case covering the development of all new centres and for effective planning and monitoring to ensure that the expected benefits are actually realised. The Department has established new governance procedures to ensure that modernisation projects only proceed to the next stage of development if an appropriate business case, including appropriate plans for realising benefits, is in place.</p>
	<p pid=".236W.10/4" class="indent">DWP accepts the portfolio approach to measuring the quality of service it provides from its centres. We already use a variety of measures (cost, efficiency, customer service etc) but are always looking for ways to improve our measures. In particular our central Contact Centre Advisory Team are currently developing proposals for measuring customer satisfaction in a way that gives quicker feedback to our centre managers. We expect this new methodology to be ready for piloting in the summer of 2003.</p>
	<p pid=".236W.10/5" class="indent">All new DWP centres are being developed using modern IT designed to give managers at all levels a wide range of information about the cost and effectiveness of the service provided. Managers are being trained, in understanding the data they receive and acting on it to improve performance. Some of our existing centres operate on old IT that does not give access to as much information as we would like, for these centres we will update their technology as and when opportunities arise.</p>
	<p pid=".236W.10/6" class="indent">All new DWP centres are being established with appropriate work force management software. Several of our older centres lack this software. Our central Contact Centre Advisory Team have recently secured funding for a project to provide this software to the older centres that don't currently have it, this project is due to complete its work in September 2003.</p>
	<p pid=".236W.10/7" class="indent">DWP routinely publicises details of its services in telephone directories, on leaflets and letters and on its website.</p>
	<p pid=".236W.10/8">DWP is keen to develop and improve the service it gives its customers. With that in mind we have become foundation partners of the Call Centre Association and our central advisory team, working closely with the CCA, have developed a good practice framework for DWP centres and are developing the process through which our centres will be able to secure professional accreditation.</p>

The survey estimated that 34 per cent. of disabled people had a disability related to hearing.</p>
	<p pid=".238W.0/16">It should be noted that entitlement to Disability Living Allowance is based on the extent to which a severely disabled person requires attention, supervision or watching over by another person and/or has walking difficulties as a result of their disabilities, and not on the disabilities themselves. In addition, the majority of people who are hard of hearing are over the age of 65. People who become disabled after reaching age 65 claim Attendance Allowance instead of Disability Living Allowance.

The transfer to payments using an ARC are being introduced on a phased basis and we are aiming to complete the transition by the Spring of this year. Until the transfer is complete some asylum seekers will continue to receive their support on presentation of a personal Receipt Book at their designated Post Office. Making payments via an ARC provide a more secure method of payment. The process requires Post Office counter staff to undertake a photo Identity check which is proving to be an effective control. The system also allows for detailed electronic records of all transactions including the location, time and nature of every transaction (whether successful or unsuccessful).</p>

	<p pid=".249W.2/1">Recorded crime figures include statistics on drugs offences, such as possession, and on acquisitive crimes, such as burglary, but do not record whether the latter are related to an offender's drug habits.</p>
	<p pid=".249W.2/2">However, the New English and Welsh Arrestee Drug Abuse Monitoring (NEW-ADAM) research programme, which involves interviewing and drug testing those arrested by the police, confirms a link between drug misuse and crime, although the conclusions do not relate specifically to Lincolnshire. Analysis of the data from the first eight sites in the survey, collected during 1999&ndash;2000, shows that 65 per cent. of arrestees provided a urine sample that tested positive for one or more illegal drug. The analysis also shows that up to 29 per cent. of arrestees tested positive for opiates (including heroin) and/or cocaine (including crack).</p>
	<p pid=".249W.2/3">As a guide to the proportion of crime that is drug-related, analysis of the NEW-ADAM self-report data indicates that whilst only 21 per cent. of non-drug using arrestees reported having previously offended in the past 12 months, this figure rises to 75 per cent. for those arrestees who use heroin and/or cocaine/crack. Moreover, whilst users of both heroin and cocaine/crack represented just under one-quarter of all arrestees interviewed, they were responsible for more than three-fifths of all the illegal income reported.</p>
	<p pid=".249W.2/4">In support of this, 55 per cent. of arrestees who reported using one or more drugs in the last 12 months and committing one or more acquisitive crimes acknowledged a link between their drug use and their offending behaviour. This proportion rose to 78 per cent. for arrestees who said they had used heroin and cocaine/crack.</p>

	<p pid=".252W.3/1">Prison officers involved in the teaching of vocational qualifications receive a specialist allowance of &pound;1,200 a year. There are no direct promotion incentives for prison officers to assist prisoners in obtaining qualifications or in improving their emotional and parenting skills. However, a number of personal development opportunities are available. Prison officers undertake the Custodial Care National Vocational Qualification (NVQ) which includes optional units that measure competence in areas such as assisting in the provision of emotional and parenting skills. The Prison Service is considering linking attainment of the NVQ to the promotion process.</p>
	<p pid=".252W.3/2">There are also a number of specific training courses for prison officers that relate to these areas and cover:</p>
	<p pid=".252W.3/3" class="indent">staff working in mother-and-baby units;</p>
	<p pid=".252W.3/4" class="indent">staff at establishments that provide offending behaviour programmes (including the reasoning and rehabilitation, sex offender treatment, enhanced thinking skills and cognitive self-change programmes);</p>
	<p pid=".252W.3/5" class="indent">physical education officer training; and a prisoner development and pre-release course.</p>

	<p pid=".252W.6/1">It is for the courts to decide in indidual cases whether a prison sentence is appropriate. However, custodial sentences should be used for dangerous violent and sexual offenders and those who persistently offend or commit serious offences. Protecting the public is a priority and these offenders should go to prison for as long as public protection requires. Whether a custodial or community sentence is given it is important that rehabilitative processes are followed to address the causes of offenders' behaviour and to break the cycle of repeat offending.</p>
	<p pid=".252W.6/2">We are taking forward the 'Women's Offending Reduction Programme' over the next three years, which seeks to address the range of factors that have an impact on why women offend. It encourages closer joint working between departments, agencies and other organisations where a primary focus will be on improving community-based interventions that are better suited to the needs of women. Greater use of such interventions will ensure that custody is only used for women offenders who really need to be there.</p>
	<p pid=".252W.6/3">For young offenders the Government has introduced a range of credible community options including Electronically monitored curfew orders for 10&ndash;15 year olds and Electronic tagging for 12&ndash;16 year olds on bail and local authority remand. The Intensive Supervision and Surveillance Programme (ISSP) is a recently introduced programme to tackle persistent and serious young offenders as an alternative to custodial sentences or secure remands. Targeting the 3 per cent. of young offenders estimated to be responsible for 25 per cent. of youth crime, it is the most rigorous non-custodial intervention available for young offenders, providing the courts with a credible alternative to custody.</p>
