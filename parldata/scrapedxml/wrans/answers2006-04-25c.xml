	<p pid="c.971W.3/2">The Animals Act 1971 currently has the effect of placing strict liability on the owner of animals that cause harm whatever the circumstances. This appears to be inconsistent with current liability law in other areas which allows for a general defence of reasonable care. The Government have acknowledged that there may be a case for an amendment to the Animals Act and expects to launch a consultation shortly on this matter.</p>

	<p pid="c.971W.6/1">Local authorities have a duty under Part IV of the Environment Act 1995 to review and assess the current, and likely future, air quality in their areas. Where local authorities consider that one or more of the nationally prescribed air quality objectives for each of the seven pollutants is unlikely to be met by the relevant deadline, they must declare an air quality management area (AQMA), covering the area where the problem is expected. These local authorities must then take action, along with other agencies and organisations, to work towards meeting the air quality objectives.</p>
	<p pid="c.971W.6/2">Kingston-upon-Hull city council submitted their last Updating and Screening Assessment (USA) in July 2003. The authority subsequently carried out a Detailed Assessment in respect of nitrogen dioxide, particles (PM10), and sulphur dioxide, which was submitted to my Department in May 2004. In light of the conclusions of the Detailed Assessment, Kingston declared an Air Quality Management Area (AQMA) in respect of nitrogen dioxide, in August 2005. Kingston is currently developing their air quality action plan, which will set out measures to work towards meeting the air quality objective. They have included measures within Hull city council's local transport plan, which should improve the capacity to deliver cleaner air within the AQMA.</p>
	<p pid="c.971W.6/3">The next round of review and assessments has now started and local authorities are asked to submit a new Updating and Screening Assessment by end of April 2006, which will be considered by my officials. My Department will be assessing Kingston-upon-Hull's report as part of this exercise.</p>

	<p pid="c.972W.5/1">H5N1 avian influenza was confirmed in a sample from the partially decomposed body of a Whooper swan found on the causeway at Cellardyke, Fife, Scotland. The swan is the first case of H5N1 detected in a wild bird in the UK and our current hypothesis is that it originated outside Great Britain. Ongoing intensified surveillance across the UK has not identified any other positive live or dead wild bird. There is also no evidence that the virus is present in domestic poultry.</p>
	<p pid="c.972W.5/2">Poultry keepers within a 2,500 sq km wild bird risk area around the area where the swan was found have been required to house their birds. All bird keepers throughout the UK are encouraged to continue their efforts to maintain high levels of biosecurity and develop their plans to bring their birds indoors should that become necessary.</p>
	<p pid="c.972W.5/3">The implications of the Whooper swan finding have been discussed with ornithologists and a revised veterinary risk assessment has been published. It concludes that the current measures put in place throughout Scotland are adequate and proportionate at present. The situation will continue to be reviewed.</p>
	<p pid="c.972W.5/4">We are monitoring the market impact of avian flu closely. The European market is currently volatile, and the knock-on effects of significant downturns in some member states (notably Italy and France) are being felt domestically in terms of lower prices. So far, however, consumption of poultry products has not been significantly affected in the UK.</p>

	<p pid="c.977W.5/1">Regulation of the horseracing industry is being transferred from the Jockey Club to the Horseracing Regulatory Authority (HRA). The Department welcomes the transfer and views it as a vital step towards the modernisation of the sport. We are confident that the HRA will work closely with the industry to continually assess and improve measures to protect racehorses from harm.</p>
	<p pid="c.977W.5/2">The Protection of Animals Act 1911 already protects the welfare of racehorses. Under this Act it is an offence to ill treat or cause any unnecessary suffering to any domestic or captive animal. The maximum penalty is a fine of &pound;5,000 or six months' imprisonment, or both.</p>
	<p pid="c.977W.5/3">The Animal Welfare Bill will extend these powers by introducing a duty of care for those who are responsible for animals. This will allow action to be taken, even if the animal is not currently suffering. Under the Bill, we have proposed that the maximum penalty for an offence of cruelty will be raised to a fine of up to &pound;20,000 or imprisonment for 51 weeks, or both.</p>

	<p pid="c.978W.6/1">The information requested is as follows.</p>
	<p pid="c.978W.6/2" class="italic">Domestic Waste</p>
	<p pid="c.978W.6/3">There are two targets for local authorities to achieve in respect of domestic waste.</p>
	<p pid="c.978W.6/4">The first is to meet the challenging national target set by the EU Landfill Directive.</p>
	<p pid="c.978W.6/5" class="indent">By 2010 to reduce biodegradable municipal waste land filled to 75 per cent. of that produced in 1995</p>
	<p pid="c.978W.6/6" class="indent">By 2013 to reduce biodegradable municipal waste landfilled to 50 per cent. of that produced in 1995</p>
	<p pid="c.978W.6/7" class="indent">By 2020 to reduce biodegradable municipal waste landfilled to 35 per cent. of that produced in 1995.</p>
	<p pid="c.978W.6/8">This target is being delivered through a combination of measures/drivers designed to assist and encourage local authorities. In particular the Government have established the Waste Implementation Programme (WIP) with an aim of driving waste management solutions up the waste hierarchy, improving the sustainability of waste management. WIP delivers this through the following nine work-streams:</p>
	<p pid="c.978W.6/9" class="indent">1. Local Authority Support Unit</p>
	<p pid="c.978W.6/10" class="indent">2. Local Authority Funding</p>
	<p pid="c.978W.6/11" class="indent">3. Waste Minimisation (managed by WRAP <sup>1</sup> )</p>
	<p pid="c.978W.6/12" class="indent">4. Efficiency</p>
	<p pid="c.978W.6/13" class="indent">5. Education (managed by WRAP)</p>
	<p pid="c.978W.6/14" class="indent">6. Kerbside recycling (managed by WRAP)</p>
	<p pid="c.978W.6/15" class="indent">7. Research</p>
	<p pid="c.978W.6/16" class="indent">8. Data</p>
	<p pid="c.978W.6/17" class="indent">9. New Technologies</p>
	<p pid="c.978W.6/18" class="indent"><sup>1</sup> WRAP&mdash;Waste Resource Action Programme</p>
	<p pid="c.978W.6/19">Recycling is towards the top of the waste hierarchy, together with minimisation and reuse, and each of the work-streams includes effort towards these areas.</p>
	<p pid="c.978W.6/20">Local authorities are responsible for meeting the EU targets and contribute individually to the overall target through compliance with the Local Authority Trading Scheme (LATS) scheme. This provides landfill allowance allocations for each authority and measures their performance against these targets. The scheme allows authorities to trade their allowances (buying, selling, or borrowing from future years) with penalties applied to those who fail to meet the scheme requirements.</p>
	<p pid="c.978W.6/21">The second target is the Defra PSA6 target to:</p>
	<p pid="c.978W.6/22" class="indent">Enable at least 25 per cent. of household waste to be recycled or composted by 2005&ndash;06, with further improvements by 2008.</p>
	<p pid="c.978W.6/23">Although looking more widely than biodegradable waste this target focuses on household&mdash;rather than municipal&mdash;waste.</p>
	<p pid="c.978W.6/24">WIP monitors and assists with the delivery of this target in a number of ways but in particular through programmes of work delivered through WRAP, and the work undertaken by the Local Authority Support Unit programme.</p>
	<p pid="c.978W.6/25" class="italic">Commercial Waste</p>
	<p pid="c.978W.6/26">The current targets, and therefore WIP remit, does not extend to commercial waste. Current policy is for local authorities to manage commercial waste through the usual commercial processes.</p>
	<p pid="c.978W.6/27" class="italic">Plastics</p>
	<p pid="c.978W.6/28">The Biodegradeable municipal remit of WIP does not extend plastics, however WRAP are using other Defra funding to engage with industry to develop recycling markets.</p>
	<p pid="c.978W.6/29" class="italic">Recycling/Composting Performance for Swindon borough council</p>
	<p pid="c.978W.6/30">The Recycling/Composting Performance for the last five years for Swindon borough council is outlined in the following table:</p>

	<p pid="c.980W.8/1">Most recent data from the Environment Agency (2002&ndash;03) indicate that 44 per cent. of waste produced by business in England and Wales was recycled. This level of recycling exceeds what is being achieved for household waste, and is up from 37.5 per cent. in 1998&ndash;89.</p>
	<p pid="c.980W.8/2">The Government have identified a need for further action on recycling by businesses and producer responsibility makes an important contribution to increasing recycling. The policy is aimed at ensuring that businesses take responsibility for the environmental impact of products that they place on the market, particularly once they become waste. Recent waste legislation, such as that implementing EC directives on packaging and end-of-life vehicles, places various requirements on producers, including recovery and recycling targets.</p>
	<p pid="c.980W.8/3">Government funding from the Business Resource Efficiency and Waste (BREW) Programme is another significant element of the Government programme to increase recycling by businesses, by funding resource efficiency and waste minimisation programmes. Various BREW delivery bodies are charged with returning &pound;284 million, from additional landfill tax receipts, to business over three years.</p>
	<p pid="c.980W.8/4">Initiatives already under way to encourage recycling by businesses, under BREW and other programmes, include:</p>
	<p pid="c.980W.8/5" class="indent">work by the Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP), to improve the range and quality of recycled products and to increase the demand for them;</p>
	<p pid="c.980W.8/6" class="indent">a WRAP-led pilot of sector-specific help for small businesses. Following this pilot, DEFRA will consider how recycling services for small businesses might best be developed;</p>
	<p pid="c.980W.8/7" class="indent">work by Envirowise to provide resource efficiency advice to businesses;</p>
	<p pid="c.980W.8/8" class="indent">the DTI Technology Programme, which facilitates research and development into resource efficiency, including in the area of waste management; and</p>
	<p pid="c.980W.8/9" class="indent">the Environment Agency's pilot of an online internet service for small businesses: 'What do I do with my waste?'. The pilot is working as an extension to the Agency's existing guidance service for small and medium sized enterprises ('NetRegs').</p>
	<p pid="c.980W.8/10">The Government are currently reviewing its Waste Strategy for England. On <phrase class="date" code="2006-02-14">14 February 2006</phrase>, DEFRA issued a consultation document on the review which suggested various proposals to increase business waste recycling and recovery. The proposals include a wider role for local authorities in fostering better recycling services for small businesses, better integrating municipal and business waste management and continuing to develop markets for recycled materials. The consultation period ends on <phrase class="date" code="2007-05-09">9 May</phrase>. Following the consultation, DEFRA will issue a revised strategy which will take account of comments received from stakeholders.</p>
	<p pid="c.980W.8/11">The Government do not have an estimate of the proportion of waste recycled by business in the last 12 months. However, the Environment Agency estimates that 53 per cent. of all business waste regulated under the Pollution Prevention and Control (PPC) regime was recycled or re-used in 2004.

	<p pid="c.982W.0/1">There is currently no legislative requirement to recycle spent batteries. However, the Government support the development of the proposed EU Batteries Directive as its objectives are consistent with those in the Government's Waste Strategy and Sustainable Development Strategy. Both aim to reduce the quantity of hazardous and non hazardous waste batteries going to landfill and increase the recovery of waste materials.</p>
	<p pid="c.982W.0/2">The proposed directive, which might be expected to come into force in the UK in 2008, sets targets for the collection and recycling of all waste batteries. We expect that producers of batteries will have collection and recycling obligations to meet. The exact form these may take will not be decided until the directive has been finalised and we have completed formal domestic consultation with all parties concerned. It is expected that producers will need to work closely with waste management companies and local authorities, among others, in order to collect and recycle waste batteries in line with the likely obligations under the directive.</p>

The Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP) is supporting the efforts of local authorities by increasing domestic plastic recycling capacity and developing markets for recycled plastic products. WRAP'S ROTATE programme also gives local authorities free advice on collection programmes and local communications and awareness programmes.

	<p pid="c.986W.3/1">The Waste Minimisation and Recycling Fund was challenge based, and in each of the three bidding rounds applications were received from a large number of local authorities. Defra considered in full each application against set criteria agreed with an expert advisory panel, comprising key representatives from across the industry.</p>
	<p pid="c.986W.3/2">The panel separately assessed each application and Defra officials took into account their recommendations before final decisions were taken by the Minister of State.</p>
	<p pid="c.986W.3/3">Support was given to the best local authority projects designed to either minimise the amount of household waste generated, or those that aimed to provide more new or improved facilities for re-use and recycling and composting.</p>

	<p pid="c.986W.3/17">In addition, in December 2005, Defra wrote to all local authorities regarding the Waste Performance and Efficiency Grant (WPEG). This is a 3-year targeted grant totalling &pound;260 million over 3 years, which is replacing the Waste Minimisation and Recycling Fund from 2006.</p>
	<p pid="c.986W.3/18">Every English local authority with waste management responsibilities received a portion of the &pound;40 million allocation in 2005&ndash;06. The allocations for the next two years were announced at the end of 2005.</p>

Most were instances of planned maintenance for which users of the network are normally given seven days' notice, and which is normally undertaken either at weekends or before 9am and after 7pm on weekdays.

Given the size and complexity of the site, the LDA has decided that it is necessary to exercise its powers of compulsory acquisition so as to be sure of securing possession of the land when required.

	<p pid="c.999W.2/1">For 2005&ndash;06, the Schools Formula Spending Share (FSS) system was used to distribute resources for nursery education between local authorities. The formula for under 5s used pupil numbers, weighted for deprivation, area costs and sparsity to divide up the overall total of resources for under 5s. That resulted in a unit of funding for under 5s of &pound;2,980 for Nottinghamshire. For 2006&ndash;07, the Dedicated Schools Grant (DSG) replaced Schools FSS, and &pound;82 million was added to the total of DSG to fund the increased entitlement for nursery education from 33 weeks to 38 weeks per year. DSG has a single unit of funding for all pupils from 3 to 15: the baseline figure for Nottinghamshire for 2005&ndash;06 was &pound;3,246 per pupil; and the figure for 2006&ndash;07 is &pound;3,457 per pupil, which takes account of the additional funding for the increased entitlement for nursery education.</p>

	<p pid="c.1002W.0/1">The provisions set out in clause 42 of the Education and Inspections Bill will permit the schools adjudicator to consider any aspect of a school's admission arrangements in addition to the aspect which is the subject of the objection. The Bill does not give the adjudicator any power to consider schools' admission arrangements where he has not received an objection.</p>
	<p pid="c.1002W.0/2">Admission forums have a different remit. They are required by regulations to give advice to admission authorities on their admission arrangements, and where this advice is not followed, clause 38(8) of the Bill will enable them to refer objections to the adjudicator. As part of this process, they should see all local schools' admission arrangements and will be able to request these where they have not been supplied.</p>
	<p pid="c.1002W.0/3">Admission forums will also be able to prepare and publish reports on how well an area's admission arrangements engender fair access and work in the interests of parents and children. The local authority, neighbouring local authorities, and admission authorities in their area will be required by regulations to provide the admission forum with any information they hold that will enable them to produce their report.</p>

	<p pid="c.1003W.5/2">All LEAs and educational establishments should have procedures for dealing with allegations against staff that aim to strike a balance between the need to protect children from abuse, and the need to protect staff and volunteers from false or unfounded accusations. Any decision to suspend or dismiss a teacher is taken locally, School Staffing (England) Regulations 2003 give both the governing body and the head teacher the power to suspend any person employed or engaged to work at the school. Usually such action is agreed by the governing body, though where a decision should not be delayed, the head teacher may use their discretion to remove a teacher by suspending or terminating their employment with immediate effect.</p>
	<p pid="c.1003W.5/3">Employers have a statutory duty, under the Education (Restriction of Employment) Regulations 2000, to make a report to my Department when a person is dismissed from employment on the grounds of misconduct or resigns in circumstances which would have led to their dismissal if they had not resigned. With the support of the panel of experts chaired by Sir Roger Singleton Panel it is then the responsibility of the Secretary of State to consider whether to prohibit the person from working with children in the future by placing them on List 99.</p>
	<p pid="c.1003W.5/4">Where an individual who states they are employed to teach or work with children is convicted of a sexual assault, the police also report this for consideration. A number of convictions are considered sufficiently serious to warrant an immediate and automatic bar from working with children&mdash;'an offence contrary to section 3 of the Sexual Offences Act 2003 (sexual assault)'&mdash;is a conviction that would result in an automatic bar from teaching.</p>

	<p pid="c.1010W.3/2">The table also shows the value of housing capital receipts set-aside by local authorities to repay debt.

The amount invested in housing was &pound;4.1 billion i.e. almost 2&frac12; times the amount received in receipts. The ratio is expected to increase substantially in the future.</p>

	<p pid="c.1014W.8/1">During the NATO campaign, persecution by the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia military led to the temporary exodus of over 500,000 Kosovo-Albanian refugees moving to Macedonia, Montenegro and Albania. Shortly after the campaign ended a large majority of those Kosovo-Albanian refugees returned. However, after the end of the campaign an estimated 65,000 to 70,000 Kosovo Serbs left Kosovo.</p>
	<p pid="c.1014W.8/2">Since 1999 the overall numbers of Kosovo-Serbs, previously displaced from their homes, returning to Kosovo has remained disappointingly low. Uncertainty over the outcome of the final status process and its impact on the sustainability of returns create significant disincentives to return to Kosovo. Economic security remains very limited. Weak property rights protection, discouragement from the authorities in Belgrade and shortages of social housing all contribute to an atmosphere of uncertainty and insecurity. We are encouraging Kosovo's Provisional Institutions to take the essential actions necessary to enable those who wish to return to do so and create an environment conducive to facilitate returns. We are also urging the Government in Belgrade to sign the protocol on returns agreed in September 2005.</p>

	<p pid="c.1016W.0/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2005-03-30">30 March 2005</phrase>, my right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary wrote to the Brazilian Foreign Minister in support of Craig Alden's application for Presidential Expulsion. The Brazilians rejected this application. Both my right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary and my noble Friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Foreign and Common wealth affairs, Lord Triesman of Tottenham, who is responsible for Consular matters in Latin America, have subsequently raised Mr. Alden's case with their Brazilian counterparts on a number of occasions asking that they take account of the human rights issues involved in Mr. Alden's case. Most recently, my noble Friend Lord Triesman of Tottenham raised Mr. Alden's case with the Brazilian Foreign Minister in March 2006.</p>
	<p pid="c.1016W.0/2">Since his arrest, Mr. Alden and his family have expressed concerns over his safety while in prison. We have taken his fears about his safety seriously and officials from our Embassy in Brasilia have made numerous successful representations to the Brazilian authorities, requesting that he remain apart from other prisoners.</p>
	<p pid="c.1016W.0/3">The Foreign and Commonwealth Office remains completely impartial in respect of the substance of any allegations against Mr. Alden. However, we share the concerns about the fairness of his trial, which we continue to raise with the Brazilian government.</p>

	<p pid="c.1016W.3/1">As part of the 2005&ndash;08 pay settlement for delegated grades, agreed in November 2005, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) agreed with the Trade Union Side (TUS) to undertake annual Equal Pay Audits and to review the findings on completion with the TUS. The first of these will be carried out during 2006.</p>
	<p pid="c.1016W.3/2">The FCO last carried out an Equal Pay Audit in 2003. The conclusions were that the overall picture on mean salaries within bands for full-time employees is within the 5 per cent. tolerance set out by the Equal Opportunities Commission; women do not seem to be less favourably treated than men in the way they are allocated to, or progress through, the salary scale and within each band the distribution of performance ratings is in proportion to the general split.</p>

	<p pid="c.1016W.6/1">15 nations took part in this UK exercise in November 2005 as part of the Proliferation Security Initiative (PSI). The exercise identified a number of lessons, with extensive and valuable feedback provided by participating nations. The need for appropriate and timely access to information from a range of sources reinforced the importance of cross-government involvement from the outset. Sharing of information between PSI nations was also shown to be vital, highlighting the need for secure and reliable communications channels to be established. Almost all nations commented on the need to continue to improve inter-departmental operations and awareness within their own governments. A number of important issues were raised which will be examined in future PSI exercises, such as the disposition of cargo after an interdiction and how the Suppression of Unlawful Acts at Sea protocols will affect the legal basis for interdiction. The cost effectiveness and benefits of running a federated exercise in national capitals showed that this way of hosting exercises could reduce the cost without compromising the high standards associated with PSI events.</p>
	<p pid="c.1016W.6/2">The UK has benefited a great deal from running Exercise Exploring Themis and from our involvement in other PSI exercises. The main benefits have been improved intra-Government co-ordination, better understanding of the legal environment and improved technical abilities, such as communications. These factors have all contributed to improved UK maritime security. The exercise also enabled governments from 15 nations to co-ordinate their efforts to address potential future weapons of mass destruction proliferation threats. Effective joint international action helps to address maritime security for UK shipping outside UK territorial waters.</p>

	<p pid="c.1022W.11/1">The number of incidents of pilots of fast-jet aircraft blacking out in the past 10 years is not held centrally by the RAF. However, in 2004 the Ministry of Defence conducted a survey of all RAF aircrew to determine the prevalence of gravity-induced loss of consciousness (G-LOC). Of the 2,259 aircrew who responded to the survey, 454 (20.1 per cent.) admitted to having lost consciousness for a number of seconds following G exposure at least once during their career. There have been no recorded RAF aircraft accidents within the last 10 years where G-LOC has been a contributing factor.</p>

	<p pid="c.1024W.2/1">Operational&quot; criteria as such are not generally considered when deciding which Z berth to use. The strict limitations on nuclear powered submarine operational activities at Z berths mean that these locations are used for planned crew stand-off periods, materiel re-supply and personnel changeovers only.</p>
	<p pid="c.1024W.2/2">It is possible that, for example during the briefing or debriefing phases of an exercise, proximity to other forces may dictate the choice of berth.

	<p pid="c.1024W.5/1">No infrastructure is required around Z berths to deal with radioactive effluent from operational nuclear-powered submarines as discharges of this type are prohibited at these berths.</p>
	<p pid="c.1024W.5/2">Other effluent, such as sewage or bilge water, is managed in the same way as for conventionally powered warships and civilian vessels, and depending on the location of the Z berth it is discharged either by direct connection to an installed shore-based facility or by tanker collection. In commercial ports the Ministry of Defence pays for effluent disposal services; these vary from port to port and generally depend on volume. In the naval bases effluent disposal facilities are shared with surface warships and the associated costs cannot therefore be identified separately.</p>

	<p pid="c.1029W.5/1">Enforcement of these offences is an operational matter for the police. There are no such plans of which I am aware. Speed cameras are designed and type approved only to detect vehicles exceeding the speed limit and record an image of them. Enforcement depends on the police witnessing the offences. The likelihood of this is increased by the expanded use of police intercept teams linked to the operation of Automatic Number Plate Recognition systems We expect enforcement of these and other motoring offences to reflect the joint Home Office/Department for Transport/Association of Chief Police Officers Roads Policing Strategy issued last year, the National Policing Plan and the National Community Safety Plan, which emphasise the importance of roads policing and encourage a pro-active approach.</p>

	<p pid="c.1030W.8/1">Young people who commit a first offence will normally be dealt with under the Final Warning scheme, unless the offence is so serious that they must be charged and dealt with by a court. They will not receive a caution as that process for young offenders was replaced by the Final Warning Scheme under Section 65, Crime and Disorder Act 1998. The Home Office and the Youth Justice Board produced guidance for the police and Youth Offending Panels on how to operate the scheme and that guidance is available on the Home Office website. The guidance provides comprehensive details on how to proceed with the most common offences but makes it clear that in deciding on the correct course the individual circumstances of the offence, offender and other relevant information must be considered as part of the decision-making process. That ensures that appropriate levels of discretion remain in the system for dealing with young offenders and that the correct action is taken in each case.</p>

	<p pid="c.1031W.3/2">The UK does not carry out eradication in Afghanistan; eradication policy and implementation is the responsibility of the Government of Afghanistan, in particular, the Ministry of Counter Narcotics and the Ministry of Interior. The Government of Afghanistan's policy on eradication is set out in its National Drug Control Strategy which states that where there are legal livelihoods, a credible threat of eradication is needed in order to incentivise the shift away from poppy cultivation. We will therefore carry out targeted ground-based eradication throughout Afghanistan in order to ensure we make maximum progress towards our long-term elimination goal&quot;. The UK supports this approach and in 2005&ndash;06 provided &pound;5.25 million to support the Government of Afghanistan's eradication effort. In particular, the UK supported the Ministry of Counter Narcotics targeting work to identify priority areas for eradication and provided equipment, including tractors and all-terrain vehicles.</p>

	<p pid="c.1032W.5/1">Set out are details of UK official development assistance (ODA) with and without debt relief as a percentage of gross national income. This is the measure used in international reporting.</p>
	<p pid="c.1032W.5/2">The Government have announced a clear timetable to reach the UN target of 0.7 per cent. of gross national income (GNI) spent on development aid by 2013. Last year UK aid spending as a proportion of GNI rose sharply, reflecting implementation of the Government's plan to increase development assistance set out in its 2004 Spending Round and a significant short-term increase due to debt relief for Nigeria. Debt relief to poor countries frees resources for poverty reduction and is quite rightly classified as official development assistance (ODA).</p>
	<p pid="c.1032W.5/3">ODA, excluding debt relief, rose in cash terms last year but decreased as a proportion of GNI. The main factors were changes in the CDC portfolio and timing of payments to the European development fund. We do not expect these issues to affect the 2006 figures.</p>

To date, one grant has been approved by the Fund, which received some 30 proposals in its first two months of operation. It was anticipated that the Fund would disburse up to &pound;3 million of British and Swiss funds over its three-year life, with some &pound;400,000 allocated for the 2006&ndash;07 financial year. However, management and implementation of all development activities, including this Fund, have been seriously affected by the current political crisis in Nepal.</p>

	<p pid="c.1035W.11/1">Human security is essential for development. At the same time it is important for governments to strike the right balance between expenditure and security and on reducing poverty in areas such as education and health.</p>
	<p pid="c.1035W.11/2">An independent assessment of the UK's support for Uganda's first strategic Defence Review was carried out in December 2004. It found that the Review has helped to establish the processes necessary for ensuring a professional, modern, accountable, efficient and affordable security sector. Already the Review has been the basis for the development of a Defence Corporate Plan that prioritises expenditure and includes indicators which can be used to monitor performance for example in procurement, financial management and management of human resources. The Defence Review and the Corporate Plan provide a basis for more effective dialogue between government and development partners about Uganda's defence expenditure. In this, we emphasise the importance of implementing the recommendations of the Defence Review to help provide the security required for poverty reduction.</p>

	<p pid="c.1037W.2/1">The cost of NIO travel cannot be disaggregated, except at disproportionate cost. However, it is estimated that less than 10 per cent. of the cost is for travel within NI and between NI and the RoI. It is further estimated that some 80 per cent. of all travel cost is in respect of flights between NI and GB and that less than &pound;1,000 was spent on travel between NI and continental Europe.</p>
	<p pid="c.1037W.2/2">Approximately 90 per cent. of air travel cost was for journeys between Belfast and London and some 94 per cent. of these trips were at business class with the remaining 6 per cent. at economy class.</p>
	<p pid="c.1037W.2/3">NIO business class travel bookings are at competitive rates, are fully flexible and refundable and enable staff to make last minute adjustments to their travel arrangements without a cost penalty to meet the demands of the Department's business.</p>

	<p pid="c.1037W.2/5">However, it is estimated that some 85 per cent. of expenditure was on mileage, which is likely to relate primarily to travel within Northern Ireland, 12 per cent. related to public transport within the United Kingdom (including air, train and bus fares) and 3 per cent. related to travel outside of the United Kingdom.</p>

	<p pid="c.1050W.3/1">As set out in the formal Government response to the autumn 2005 consultation on pension scheme rules, the pensions industry overwhelmingly supported the option of introducing, from April 2007, a new regulated activity of establishing, operating or winding up a personal pension scheme. This new activity will cover independent trustees of self-invested personal pensions. Industry also overwhelmingly agreed with Government that it was sensible not to rush through this regulation before April 2007. The FSA published a consultation paper in April 2006 and will analyse feedback during the summer before making the necessary amendments to their rulebook by October 2006.</p>

	<p pid="c.1055W.2/2">The Government's National Carer's Strategy, which we developed with carers and the organisations that represent them, and published in 1999, has achieved much in improving the financial support for carers, including older carers, through carer's allowance and other benefits, and through introduction of the carers grant to support local authorities in providing breaks and services for carers. In the last local government finance settlement, we confirmed our commitment to continue the carers grant beyond 2006. Until at least the end of the 2007&ndash;08 financial year, provision for the grant will be &pound;185 million a year.

	<p pid="c.1058W.0/2" class="letterfrom">Letter from Hilary Reynolds</p>
	<p pid="c.1058W.0/3">In reply to your parliamentary question about the Child Support Agency, the Secretary of State promised a substantive reply from the chief executive. As he is currently unavailable, I am responding on his behalf. Please accept my apologies for the delay in responding to your question. You asked the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions how many parents have been found to have been avoiding paying the rightful amount of child support in <i>(a)</i> Tamworth constituency <i>(b)</i> Staffordshire <i>(c)</i> the West Midlands and <i>(d)</i> the UK in each year since 1997.We cannot provide the information at the requested constituency or county level. We have some information at West Midlands level, but only in relation to cases under the old scheme until 2003. All other data is given at GB level, as the CSA does not cover Northern Ireland cases.There are a variety of ways in which a non-resident parent could potentially avoid paying the right amount of child support. For example, an NRP could:</p>
	<p pid="c.1058W.0/4" class="indent">Refuse to provide information about their income or circumstances.</p>
	<p pid="c.1058W.0/5" class="indent">By refusing to provide this information they are preventing the Agency from performing a maintenance calculation/assessment and could thus be said to be avoiding paying the rightful amount of child support. Where a parent consistently refuses to provide this information, the Agency may impose an Interim Maintenance Assessment (old scheme) or a Default Maintenance Decision (new scheme). Information on the number of DMDs and IMAs imposed by the Agency is attached as Table 1.</p>
	<p pid="c.1058W.0/6" class="indent">Under-declare their income and assets. Doing this may result in the establishment of a lower liability for child maintenance than should otherwise have applied, had the NRP's true income and assets been declared. In this case the parent with care may then apply for a departure or variation (old and new rules respectively) from the standard formula, on the basis that the non-resident parent's lifestyle is inconsistent with the income they are declaring to the Agency. Limitations with management information means that the number of variations applied for is not available. However, the number of departures applied for is attached as Table 2.</p>
	<p pid="c.1058W.0/7" class="indent">Failure to pay the full assessed amount of child maintenance. An NRP who does not pay the full maintenance liability due to them is clearly avoiding paying the rightful amount of child support. The number of NRPs who do not pay the full liability for which they have been assessed is attached as Table 3 and 3.1, relating to GB and west Midlands respectively.</p>

	<p pid="c.1060W.2/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2007-02-09">9 February</phrase> my right hon. Friend, the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, announced that Sir David Henshaw will undertake a fundamental redesign of child support policy and delivery mechanisms and he will deliver his finding before summer recess.</p>
	<p pid="c.1060W.2/2">My right hon. Friend also announced that we are making available an additional &pound;120 million to the Child Support Agency to implement the Operational Improvement plan which introduces a number of measures to improve the compliance rate of non-resident parents. This plan is available in the House Library.</p>
	<p pid="c.1060W.2/3">For your benefit the relevant section of this plan is as follows:</p>
	<p pid="c.1060W.2/4" class="italic">Child Support Agency Operational Improvement Plan 2006&ndash;2009</p>
	<p pid="c.1060W.2/5" class="italic">Putting It Right: Enforcing Responsibilities</p>
	<p pid="c.1060W.2/6" class="italic">The Issues</p>
	<p pid="c.1060W.2/7" class="indent">Nearly one in three non-resident parents who have been assessed and are due to make a payment fail to pay</p>
	<p pid="c.1060W.2/8" class="indent">Debt accrued since 1993 as a result of non-resident parents' failure to pay exceeds &pound;3.3 billion, some of which is considered uncollectable</p>
	<p pid="c.1060W.2/9" class="indent">The Agency does not respond quickly or firmly enough when non-resident parents start to default</p>
	<p pid="c.1060W.2/10" class="indent">Non-resident parents and the general public need greater awareness of the impact on children of the failure to pay child support</p>
	<p pid="c.1060W.2/11" class="italic">The Action</p>
	<p pid="c.1060W.2/12" class="indent">Managing non-resident parents with child support debt more effectively.</p>
	<p pid="c.1060W.2/13" class="indent">Child support debt is created by parents failing to fulfil their responsibility for their children. We will take quicker and firmer action against those who default on payment. We will employ external debt collection agencies to recover outstanding debt.</p>
	<p pid="c.1060W.2/14" class="indent">We will also improve our own debt collection and enforcement activity to ensure greater returns by using best practice from the private sector. Over 600 more staff trained and effective within the next year and staffing dedicated to enforcement activity quadrupled over the period of the plan through redeployment and restructuring.</p>
	<p pid="c.1060W.2/15" class="indent">There are many non-resident parents who seek to avoid payment of debt by evading the attempts of the Agency to contact them. We will make more use of information held by HMRC and credit reference agencies to track down those who owe money for their children.</p>
	<p pid="c.1060W.2/16" class="italic">Court action for those who won't pay</p>
	<p pid="c.1060W.2/17" class="indent">We will significantly increase the number of non-resident parents brought before the courts through our increased focus on compliance and enforcement, utilising the existing range of sanctions available such as driving licence removal and imprisonment.</p>
	<p pid="c.1060W.2/18" class="indent">We have been increasing the number of cases where debt is secured through Liability Orders in the courts. We will continue to increase our efforts here, enabling us to seek the seizure of assets where appropriate.</p>
	<p pid="c.1060W.2/19" class="italic">Understanding the impact for children</p>
	<p pid="c.1060W.2/20" class="indent">Failure to pay child support causes real hardship for children. We will increase the awareness of this hardship among non-resident parents and the general public. We will work with the media and stakeholders to develop a campaign to make clear that failing to pay has real and lasting consequences for children.</p>
	<p pid="c.1060W.2/21" class="italic">The Improvement</p>
	<p pid="c.1060W.2/22" class="indent">More responsibility from non-resident parents</p>
	<p pid="c.1060W.2/23" class="indent">Increased enforcement action and action in the courts</p>
	<p pid="c.1060W.2/24" class="indent">More money for more children</p>
	<p pid="c.1060W.2/25" class="indent">Using debt collection agencies to recover more debt more quickly. Over &pound;100 million more historic debt collected over the three years, although it should be noted that new debt will continue to accrue over this period.</p>
	<p pid="c.1060W.2/26" class="indent">Delivery that is more efficient and effective</p>
	<p pid="c.1060W.2/27" class="indent">Four times as many designated enforcement staff generating increased levels of case compliance from 65 per cent. currently, to 75 per cent. by March 2008 and 80 per cent. in March 2009.</p>

Recipients are free to spend these benefits in any way they choose, During the winter months, disabled people in receipt of certain benefits may be eligible to receive a cold weather payment. Cold weather payments are intended to provide extra help to the most vulnerable people towards additional heating costs during a period of cold weather. People receiving pension credit are eligible. Income support or income-based jobseeker's allowance customers with a pensioner or disability premium, or who have a child under five or a child who is disabled in their family, are eligible because they are considered to be the most vulnerable.</p>

	<p pid="c.1070W.3/2">The national bowel cancer screening programme will be rolled out nationally over the next three years. Funding for the first year of the screening programme is being transferred to the national cancer screening team in Sheffield, and Wolverhampton will be the first local screening centre.</p>
	<p pid="c.1070W.3/3">We estimate that around &pound;10 million will be spent on the first stages of the national bowel cancer screening programme. Funding decisions have not yet been made for future years are but we are committed to ensuring that the necessary funding is available to ensure the full implementation of the programme.</p>
	<p pid="c.1070W.3/4">NHS Cancer Screening Programmes are taking all the necessary action to ensure the successful roll-out of the programme, including the procurement of testing kits. The kit supplier has been notified that the first order is for 100,000 kits. No kits have been distributed as they have not yet been received from the manufacturer.</p>
	<p pid="c.1070W.3/5">Five programme hubs across England will invite men and women to participate in the screening programme, send out the faecal occult blood (FOB) testing kits, interpret kits and send results out. 90 to 100 local screening centres will provide endoscopy services for the 2 per cent. of men and women who have a positive FOB test result.</p>
	<p pid="c.1070W.3/6">The first of the five programme hubs will be established in Rugby. The NHS Cancer Screening Programmes team is currently considering where the other programme hubs will be located. We intend that the other four programme hubs will be established by March 2007, with announcements to be made in due course.</p>
	<p pid="c.1070W.3/7">We estimate that we could invite about 120,000&ndash;150,000 men and women for screening in 2006&ndash;07 as part of the national bowel cancer screening programme. No invitations have been sent out as yet. In addition, the pilot in Rugby plan to invite a further 28,360 people over the next 12 months.</p>

	<p pid="c.1072W.5/1">NHS Connecting for Health manages its relationships with its contractors through a range of standard contractual provisions and remedies designed to address poor performance at an early stage and to support the contractor towards full compliance. These include requirements for the contractor to supply more information about the manner in which services are being provided, and the causes of any failures on the contractor's part. Others enable NHS Connecting for Health to exert greater control over how a contractor provides the services, or to require that a contractor provide the services in a different way. Specific financial remedies cover compensation for the national health service for loss suffered due to non-delivery, and the withholding of payment to incentivise compliance with contractual obligations. The contract does contain provision for the termination of the whole contract, or a part of the services provided by a contractor. However, termination is a step that NHS Connecting for Health would contemplate only after every opportunity, and all possible assistance had been given to enable a contractor to recover its position and become successful.</p>

Information on the funding arrangements of claimants is therefore collected but necessarily incomplete.</p>

The following caveat to the data was quoted in the report:</p>
	<p pid="c.1080W.6/4" class="indent">It is important to note that the proportion of CFA [conditional fee arrangement] funded cases implied by these figures is an underestimate of the proportion of cases run by claimants on a CFA basis.

	<p pid="c.1081W.11/2">The Chinese Government has acknowledged the practice of organ harvesting from executed prisoners, but has given little indication as to how widespread it is other than to say it is relatively uncommon. We have received no evidence to substantiate recent media reports of large-scale organ harvesting in China. Despite Chinese Government assurances that prisoners agree to the donations voluntarily and that their families sign donation agreements, we arc concerned about this practice. I raised these concerns with the Chinese Government on <phrase class="date" code="2007-04-07">7 April</phrase>. We believe that the right approach is to seek to overcome the social taboo of organ transplants in China and encourage donation from the general population. The Government welcome the announcement by the Chinese Ministry of Health of a new regulation to come into effect on <phrase class="date" code="">1 July</phrase>, to ban the sale of organs and introduce medical standards for organ transplants.</p>

However, the Department expects councils, working with local partners, to achieve key public service agreement targets around supporting people with long term conditions and improving the patient and user experience, in particular supporting older people to live at home.</p>
