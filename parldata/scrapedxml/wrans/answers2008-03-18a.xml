Funding from 2006 onwards was made available through the &pound;45 million uplift given to the Youth Justice Board as part of their youth prevention budget. In 2007-08 the Youth Justice Board invested &pound;31.2 million in grants to Youth Offending Teams (YOTs) to run a range of targeted prevention programmes. This investment supports over 400 evidence-based programmes across England and Wales. All of these programmes are available to support young people involved in antisocial behaviour and crime in order to reduce their involvement, as part of a tiered approach that involves ISOs where appropriate.</p>

	<p pid="a.944W.5/2">However, a combination of measures will sequentially reduce the risk of biting and reduce the risk of animals becoming infected with bluetongue. These measures may include the removal of midge breeding sites, insecticide use and considering the geographical location of animals on the farm, for instance, moving animals to areas of low midge activity at certain times.</p>
	<p pid="a.944W.5/3">No insecticides are authorised specifically for use against 'Culicoides', the midge species which spreads bluetongue virus. Synthetic pyrethroids such as Deltamethrin and Cypermethrin have performed best in tests. However, they do not entirely remove the risk of an animal contracting bluetongue in their short period of protection (one to two days at best).</p>

Progress in implementing them is kept under close review through regular inspections by DEFRA and the Health and Safety Executive. In relation to the recommendations on further action on biosecurity and biosafety, the chief veterinary officer recently wrote to Merial and the Institute for Animal Health (IAH) to remind them of the importance of clarity of roles, responsibilities and effective communications. Once we received assurances that sufficient mechanisms were in place, and following progress in relation to the immediate actions on containment, Merial's licence to handle specified animal pathogens was restored on <phrase class="date" code="2008-02-25">25 February 2008</phrase>.

I understand that the review is expected to report in April. At present, we do not believe that further work on identifying the source of the virus would add to our understanding of the measures that need to be put in place, but we will keep that assessment under review.</p>

	<p pid="a.949W.5/1">The Government paid a grant of &pound;31 million in total to travel concession authorities (TCAs) in England outside London in this financial year (2007-08) to cover the cost of issuing a new concessionary travel pass to every eligible person who applied for one. The passes grant is based on &pound;4 for each pass in circulation at October 2007, uplifted by 20 per cent. to recognise that the new England-wide concession is likely to be more attractive than the existing one. &pound;31 million is not an annual cost as passes can remain in use for up to five years. As TCAs may choose to replace them at more frequent intervals, it is not possible to calculate the exact annual cost.</p>

	<p pid="a.957W.2/1">Following the introduction of the free off-peak local bus travel concession within local authority areas in April 2006, central Government provided an extra &pound;350 million in 2006-07 and &pound;367.5 million in 2007-08 (increasing annually) for statutory concessionary fares through the revenue support grant.</p>
	<p pid="a.957W.2/2">The Department is now paying an additional special grant of &pound;212 million to travel concessionary authorities in 2008-09 (and rising thereafter) just to cover the cost of extending the statutory minimum bus concession to provide free off-peak local bus travel anywhere in England. This additional amount is based on our assessment of the likely cost impact of the new concession, which is based on generous assumptions about pass take-up, fares and increased patronage. It is enough to fund around an extra 200 million bus journeys across England.</p>
	<p pid="a.957W.2/3">The money will be distributed by a special grant, in line with the wishes of local government itself, using a formula to direct to funding to areas likely to experience increased costs such as urban and tourist centres and coastal towns. The formula used is based on the most popular option with local authorities from our recent consultation on the issue. We are confident that sufficient total funding will be distributed to cover the additional cost of the new concession.</p>

	<p pid="a.960W.0/2">The provision of street lighting on local roads in England is the responsibility of individual local highway authorities.

We expect the research to be published in the summer.</p>
	<p pid="a.960W.0/3">The safety benefits of road lighting on the strategic road network (motorways and major A roads in England) operated by the Highways Agency in England were most recently assessed in 2006. That analysis of 11 years of accident data found that road lighting reduced night time personal injury accidents on motorway and major A road links, between junctions, by about 10 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="a.960W.0/4">In August 2007 the Agency published revised standards for new and replacement lighting, so that future provision as a safety measure was cost effective and sensitive to the environment, while maintaining road safety.</p>

As part of this programme we are committed to delivering at least 70,000 more affordable homes a year by 2010. This includes 25,000 shared ownership and shared equity homes a year funded mainly by the Housing Corporation.</p>
	<p pid="a.970W.9/2">We are committed to helping more people into partial ownership on a shared equity basis. The Chancellor announced, in the Budget, that from April this year two new equity loans will be available through the Government's shared equity scheme Open Market HomeBuy (OMHB). The loans provide first time buyers with more flexibility in the percentage of the value of their home that can be borrowed&mdash;to a maximum of 50 per cent.&mdash;and more choice in the mortgage they can take out.</p>
	<p pid="a.970W.9/3">In the period 2006-08, we have invested approximately &pound;1.3 million through the Housing Corporation on affordable housing in my hon. Friend's constituency.

	<p pid="a.973W.0/1">Subject to their legal duties, including the duty of best value and public procurement law, local authorities are responsible for taking their own procurement decisions. Communities and Local Government have not issued guidance to local authorities which opt to use a leisure trust model for the management of local leisure facilities. However, every local authority is under a statutory duty to establish an adequate and effective system of financial management and arrangements for the management of risk. The authority's chief finance officer also has duties to report to the council on proposed decisions or actions that would be unlawful or likely to cause a loss.</p>
	<p pid="a.973W.0/2">Queries about the VAT affairs of arrangements made by a leisure trust should be referred to HM Revenue and Customs. Where a chosen local leisure management system is unable to operate it would be for the local authority to make decisions about future arrangements.</p>
	<p pid="a.973W.0/3">The duty of best value, as laid down in legislation, requires authorities to make arrangements to secure continuous improvement in the way in which they exercise their functions, having regard to a combination of economy, efficiency and effectiveness. It is for them to decide, in the first place, whether the duty of best value can only be met by conducting a tendering exercise. Following the recent consultation exercise, current best value guidance set out in ODPM Circular 03/2003 will be replaced by the new 'Creating Strong, Safe and Prosperous Communities' guidance. The draft consultation guidance made clear that local authorities should adopt practices that are fair and open, that is, neutral between different types of providers and should ensure that any procurement decision, including retaining services in-house, is undertaken and justified in an open and transparent way. Any specific complaints that best value is not being met in a particular set of circumstances would need to be addressed in the first instance to the authority's external auditor.</p>

Communities and Local Government have not issued guidance to local authorities which opt to use a leisure trust model for the management of local leisure facilities. However, every local authority is under a statutory duty to establish an adequate and effective system of financial management and arrangements for the management of risk. The authority's chief finance officer also has duties to report to the council on proposed decisions or actions that would be unlawful or likely to cause a loss.</p>
	<p pid="a.973W.3/3">Queries about the VAT affairs of arrangements made by a leisure trust should be referred to HM Revenue and Customs. Where a chosen local leisure management system is unable to operate it would be for the local authority to make decisions about future arrangements.</p>
	<p pid="a.973W.3/4">The duty of best value, as laid down in legislation, requires authorities to make arrangements to secure continuous improvement in the way in which they exercise their functions, having regard to a combination of economy, efficiency and effectiveness. It is for them to decide, in the first place, whether the duty of best value can only be met by conducting a tendering exercise. Following the recent consultation exercise, current best value guidance set out in ODPM Circular 03/2003 will be replaced by the new 'Creating Strong, Safe and Prosperous Communities' guidance. The draft consultation guidance made clear that local authorities should adopt practices that are fair and open, that is, neutral between different types of providers and should ensure that any procurement decision, including retaining services in-house, is undertaken and justified in an open and transparent way. Any specific complaints that best value is not being met in a particular set of circumstances would need to be addressed in the first instance to the authority's external auditor.</p>
	<p pid="a.973W.3/5">Information on which leisure trust-managed local leisure facilities have ceased to operate in England since 1997 is not held centrally.</p>

	<p pid="a.982W.3/2">During the 1990s B220 was upgraded to modern standards in anticipation of receiving a licence from NII. Those upgrades included modifications to the ventilation system, electrical system, fire protection system, and radiological alarm system. In the mid-1990s a suite of shielded cells was commissioned for work on highly radioactive materials. Laboratory modifications were also made to support metallurgical analyses. These facilities are now abandoned and undergoing decommissioning.</p>
	<p pid="a.982W.3/3">The decommissioning process began in 1993 and has resulted in the removal of redundant glove box facilities, laboratory areas, and pressurised suit facilities. Packaging of radium contaminated wastes is proceeding in an area of the facility which contains shielded cells as a part of the Harwell site decommissioning activities.</p>

	<p pid="a.986W.5/1">Twenty-one projects, which will provide mains to gas to 5,800 homes, have been delivered using the Design and Demonstration Unit model and with the direct involvement of the Unit. Further projects using the model are being delivered by Community Energy Solutions, a community interest company co-funded by the local Regional Development Agencies and my Department to undertake demonstration programmes in North-East England and Yorkshire and Humberside. Of these further projects, eight projects connecting 1,500 households have been completed or are in train, and more will be undertaken over the coming year. The model can also be used by organisations with no connection to BERR.</p>

	<p pid="a.999W.5/1">Since 2006 one appeal to the Civil Service Appeal Board (CSAB) has been decided, during 2007. The appeal was not upheld, so no compensation or reinstatement resulted. The reason for dismissal which related to that appeal was redundancy.</p>
	<p pid="a.999W.5/2">Prior to 2006, information from the Department is not available without incurring disproportionate costs as it would be necessary to refer to individual staff files.</p>

	<p pid="a.1005W.0/2">As part of a series of guides to support the national health service in complying with existing and forthcoming public sector duties on equalities, the Department has commissioned guidance for the NHS on religion and belief which will be published in April 2008 and once available will be placed in the Library. This guidance will outline examples of good practice and feature case studies from NHS organisations that are working towards achieving equality in treatment of patients from diverse religious backgrounds.</p>
	<p pid="a.1005W.0/3">The NHS has been committed for some time to the recognition of the needs of patients and staff of diverse religious groups. Guidance on meeting the spiritual needs of patients and staff has been in place since 1992 and states that:</p>
	<p pid="a.1005W.0/4" class="indent">The NHS should, where necessary, make every effort to provide for the spiritual needs of patients and staff. As far as reasonably possible, this provision should recognise the welfare needs of both Christians and non-Christians.</p>
	<p pid="a.1005W.0/5">In November 2003 the Department published &quot;NHS Chaplaincy: Meeting the Religious and Spiritual needs of Patients and Staff&quot;, which aims to ensure that NHS chaplaincy services reflect the religious diversity of the communities the NHS serves. This guidance was developed with advice from the Multi-Faith Group for Healthcare Chaplaincy, an independent group, which includes representatives from nine faith communities. A copy of the guidance has been placed in the Library and is also available on the Department's website at:</p>

	<p pid="a.1005W.3/1">Health inequalities are unacceptable. That is why in 2005 the Government introduced the most ambitious programme ever seen in this country to address them.</p>
	<p pid="a.1005W.3/2">This commitment was strengthened further in September 2007, when my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State announced the Department will publish a comprehensive strategy in 2008 for reducing health inequalities that will address unjustified gaps in health status and ensure fair access to national health service services for everyone and good outcomes of care for all.</p>
	<p pid="a.1005W.3/3">The current cross-Government national health inequalities strategy, 'Tackling Health Inequalities: A Programme for Action' is in place to deliver the 2010 health inequalities target to narrow the gap in infant mortality, by social class, and life expectancy at birth, by geographical area.</p>
	<p pid="a.1005W.3/4">A review of the infant mortality element of the 2010 target, published in February 2007, will help improve delivery of local services to disadvantaged populations by working in partnership with local government and others. An implementation plan and good practice guide to promote the findings of the review was published in December 2007.</p>
	<p pid="a.1005W.3/5">Health inequalities are a key priority for the NHS as set out in the NHS operating framework 2008-09. Incentives for the NHS and local authorities have been aligned with the same health inequalities indicators in both the NHS operating framework 2008-09&mdash;Vital Signs and the New Performance Framework for Local Authorities and Local Authority Partnerships: Single Set of National Indicators.</p>
	<p pid="a.1005W.3/6">Joint Strategic Needs Assessment supports primary care trusts (PCTs) and local authorities to develop a whole health and social care system, which meets the needs of local people and takes account of inequalities, and Communities for Health is a local authority-led initiative focused on health improvement and reducing health inequalities by promoting action across local organisations, including all Spearheads.</p>
	<p pid="a.1005W.3/7">The Department is also providing tailored, intensive, assistance to areas that face the biggest challenges in delivering the 2010 target. We have established national support teams on health inequalities and on tobacco control and smoking cessation that will disseminate best practice across areas with high infant mortality rates and Spearhead areas&mdash;the local authority areas with the worst health and deprivation indicators and PCTs which map to them.</p>
	<p pid="a.1005W.3/8">The Department and the Association of Public Health Observatories have developed the interactive Health Inequalities Intervention Tool. Launched in August 2007, the tool helps local health services and councils improve life expectancy in Spearhead areas.</p>

	<p pid="a.1016W.5/2" class="italic"> Letter from Colin Mowl, dated <phrase class="date" code="2008-03-18">18 March 2008</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="a.1016W.5/3" class="indent">The National Statistician has been asked to reply to your recent parliamentary question asking for expenditure on national non-domestic rates by businesses in England, by turnover band, as percentages of turnover, purchases and gross value added (GVA). I am replying in her absence. (193246)</p>
	<p pid="a.1016W.5/4" class="indent">Our annual business inquiry (ABI), which covers most of the economy but excludes some sectors, such as agriculture, finance, local and central government, collects data on national non-domestic rates. The latest figures published for England alone relate to 2005. 2006 estimates will be available in June 2008.</p>
	<p pid="a.1016W.5/5" class="indent">The ABI is normally stratified using employment sizebands but the turnover sizebands used in the analysis are standard to the inquiry.</p>
	<p pid="a.1016W.5/6" class="indent">The attached table shows the data as per your request.</p>
	<p pid="a.1016W.5/7" class="indent">Further details of the coverage of the annual business inquiry are given at:</p>
	<p pid="a.1016W.5/8" class="indent"><a href="http://www.statistics.gov.uk/abi">http://www.statistics.gov.uk/abi</a></p>
	<p pid="a.1016W.5/9" class="indent">The annual business inquiry is a sample survey so the figures are subject to sampling error. This is likely to be greater for the figures relating to small businesses than for businesses in the larger turnover bands.</p>

	<p pid="a.1021W.8/2">The estimated cost to produce the DIUS branding guidelines is &pound;20,000. At present there is no specific separate cost foreseen for complying with the guidelines, they simply represent the way materials and communications from the Department will be formatted online and in print. The effectiveness of the guidelines will be reviewed continuously to ensure they meet the departmental needs. This will be done on a project by project basis and will not involve additional cost.</p>

In addition, HEFCE, Research Councils UK and the Wellcome Trust have supported the establishment of Beacons of Public Engagement, as part of the Government's Science and Society programme, in which HEIs will further develop their work to build links with the public.</p>

	<p pid="a.1024W.2/1">Widening participation is at the heart of our policies both for economic reasons and to promote social justice. The proportion of UK domiciled, young, full-time, first degree entrants to English higher education institutions who were from lower socio-economic groups rose from 27.9 per cent. in 2002/03 to 29.1 per cent. in 2005/06.</p>
	<p pid="a.1024W.2/2">In July, we announced further reforms to student finance. These were:</p>
	<p pid="a.1024W.2/3" class="indent">(a) an increase in the threshold so that more students qualify for full and partial maintenance grants;</p>
	<p pid="a.1024W.2/4" class="indent">(b) more flexibility into the repayment system, with the offer of a five-year repayment holiday; and</p>
	<p pid="a.1024W.2/5" class="indent">(c) introduction of a guaranteed level of support for students in receipt of education maintenance allowances from 2008 who go on to higher education.</p>
	<p pid="a.1024W.2/6">There is no reason for anyone to be deterred from higher education (HE) because of the costs.</p>
	<p pid="a.1024W.2/7">In May this year, the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) published guidance to Aimhigher partnerships and universities on how to target their interventions more effectively on young people from lower socio-economic groups. I announced recently that Aimhigher, which raises the attainment levels of young people and their aspirations towards higher education, will continue for another three years.</p>
	<p pid="a.1024W.2/8">In October, DIUS and DCSF launched a joint prospectus on how universities could sponsor trusts or academies. Such partnerships, alongside Aimhigher partnerships, can bring together universities, colleges and schools to identify and nurture talented young people from disadvantaged backgrounds who would benefit from participation in HE.</p>
	<p pid="a.1024W.2/9">This year, we also launched nine Excellence Hubs. These are higher education-led outreach centres providing aspiration raising activities for gifted and talented learners. Hubs provide at least 10 per cent. of places free to gifted and talented learners from poorer backgrounds.</p>
	<p pid="a.1024W.2/10">In addition, higher education institutions run their own outreach activities, funded for example from tuition fee income under the terms of their access agreements with the Office for Fair Access, or from the widening participation allocation provided by HEFCE.</p>

	<p pid="a.1024W.5/1">As we made clear when we announced it in September, our policy is not to &quot;withdraw&quot; funding for students studying for equivalent or lower level qualifications. It is to redeploy over three years around 30 per cent. of the funding that is available for such students and to redeploy it to fund students without such prior qualifications. The policy will therefore promote both our objective of widening access to higher education and our progress towards the target that 40 per cent. of the working age population should have an HE qualification by 2020. It will enable us to support 20,000 more first-time or progressing students (in full-time equivalent terms) than would otherwise be possible, and create incentives for universities to reach out to the six million adults who currently have an A-level or equivalent qualification, but no HE experience.</p>

	<p pid="a.1025W.2/1">The statutory responsibility to take investigations and enforcement actions rests with local authorities and their trading standards officers. It is an offence for a UK-based body to offer what could be taken to be UK degrees unless that body is recognised. In addition, local authorities can prosecute UK-based bodies illegally using the protected word &quot;university&quot; in the UK under Business Names regulations. The Trade Descriptions Act and misleading advertising regulations can also be employed in this context. However, the Department is actively assisting the Home Office, the Border and Immigration Agency and local authorities with a number of on-going investigations. Over the last five years, my Department (and its predecessors) has directly assisted local authorities in successful enforcement against 17 offending bodies with closure of 10 and prosecution of a further three. In addition, and since <phrase class="date" code="2005-01-01">1 January 2005</phrase>, 256 colleges on the Department's Register of Education and Training Providers have been investigated by the Borders and Immigration Agency.

	<p pid="a.1026W.5/1">Abolishing interest on new student loans&mdash;to English domiciled students in the UK and EU students studying in England&mdash;would increase the long-term resource cost from around 27 per cent. of the face value of the loans to 39 per cent. That means that every &pound;100 lent to students, would cost the taxpayer &pound;12 more, resulting in extra expenditure of around &pound;700 million per year for maintenance and fee loans, once fee loans are in steady state. The estimated cost of abolishing interest for loans that have already been issued is &pound;2.0 billion. These costs are due to the extra interest rate subsidy that would be incurred under a zero interest rate. The terms of student loans are already generous with interest pegged to the rate of inflation so that, in real terms, borrowers repay no more than they borrowed. Abolishing interest would substantially increase the costs to Government and to the taxpayer of subsidising these loans and means that students would repay less in real terms than they had borrowed.</p>

	<p pid="a.1026W.8/1">The responsibility for confirming the identity of applicants for student support in England rests with local authorities and the number of cases of identity fraud is not centrally held at present. From 2009/10 the SLC will assess all new applications for student support, and records will be held centrally.</p>
	<p pid="a.1026W.8/2">Where local authorities suspect fraud at the application stage, they will not process the application until they are completely satisfied with the documentary evidence. Where payments have been made, the local authorities may prosecute the students, or report the matter to the police for prosecution and recover any overpayments.</p>
	<p pid="a.1026W.8/3">Last year, departmental officials&mdash;in conjunction with the Student Loans Company and local authorities&mdash;investigated 15 cases of suspected identity fraud, including some involving the use of stolen birth certificates to create false identities, which resulted in successful prosecutions.</p>
	<p pid="a.1026W.8/4">The NHS Counter Fraud and Security Management Service Study, commissioned by the Department last year, estimated the identity fraud rate for student support was around 0.6 per cent. of applications in 2005-06.

	<p pid="a.1033W.6/1">There are no formal criteria used by the EU Commission.

In 2007 the EU-Israel human rights working group, established under the framework of the Association Agreement, provided the opportunity to discuss: inter alia minorities; respect for human rights including respect for religious freedom and belief; Israeli settlement expansion; administrative detention including individual cases; international humanitarian law; as well as questions related to the UN Human Rights Council; and thereby established a closer bilateral dialogue on these issues.</p>

	<p pid="a.1036W.2/1">We have received no reports that the Ugandan government has approached the UN Security Council to request suspension of the International Criminal Court (ICC) warrants against the leading members of the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA). We note that in the peace agreement, the LRA leadership has asked the Ugandan government to request a deferral of the ICC warrants and establish national mechanisms to try those alleged to have committed crimes against humanity and war crimes as an alternative to the ICC. We believe that justice is an essential part of a sustainable peace and it is vital that those responsible for the terrible crimes committed during the conflict in northern Uganda are held to account. It is up to the Ugandan government to convince the ICC that any new national mechanisms are in line with the Rome Statute and are sufficient to allow the ICC to lift the warrants issued for the arrest of LRA leaders.</p>

The need for full co-operation with ICTY is a message we constantly deliver in the region, particularly to the authorities in Serbia who have a key role to play in this regard.</p>

	<p pid="a.1037W.12/1">In serious fraud cases it is common for allegedly criminal conduct to occur in more than one country. In such cases inevitably proceedings are commenced in one country rather than the other. In this case, investigations had begun in the USA and there had been no complaint by anyone in this country.</p>
	<p pid="a.1037W.12/2">When the Serious Fraud Office came to consider whether to investigate, it decided not to do so because the main evidence was in the USA (the co-conspirators); the conspiracy took place there; the alleged fraud could not have occurred without the complicity of the Enron executives; the American case was advanced and it was in the overall interests of justice for it to be dealt with by one court.</p>

Since 1997, the RBL accepts the Government have made a number of improvements but would like to see more done. The Government have taken a number of important steps to ensure that the nation meets its responsibilities towards its armed forces, veterans and their families, including improvements to compensation, healthcare, accommodation, and welfare support. The forthcoming Cross-Government Command Paper will review the current position and set out such further improvements as may be appropriate.

	<p pid="a.1045W.8/4">In February 1996, summary judgment was granted in favour of the MOD as against Mr. Foxley and his son, Paul Foxley, and both were made bankrupt. Between July 1996 and September 1997, the MOD settled their claims against the foreign arms companies.</p>
	<p pid="a.1045W.8/5">Notwithstanding Mr. Foxley's successful application to strike out Crown Prosecution Service and MOD proceedings to enforce the confiscation and bankruptcy orders, substantial recoveries have been made in respect of Mr. Foxley's offending. The settlements reached with the foreign arms companies amounted to &pound;3,390,371. In addition, other sums of money have been recovered from various Foxley family sources amounting to about &pound;800,000.00. This sum includes Mr. Foxley's share in the matrimonial home.</p>

	<p pid="a.1050W.0/1">The UK Government are supportive of efforts to achieve gender equality and continue to work very closely with both the Women's National Commission and the Women's Budget Group on promoting gender equality within the UK. In 2004, HM Treasury undertook a pilot project on gender analysis of expenditure with the Women's Budget Group. The project demonstrated the value of gender analysis in some areas and identified what tools and expertise were necessary within government to carry out gender analysis, but that further work was needed before gender responsive budgeting could be implemented. In 2008, HM Treasury will be conducting further work that will determine whether it is prudent and feasible to disaggregate departmental expenditure statistics by gender. The DCMS Equality Scheme 2007-10 sets out the action which the Department is taking to promote gender equality. I am arranging for copies to be placed in the House Libraries.</p>

	<p pid="a.1056W.5/1">We have tough protections in place to protect playing fields and planning guidance is clear that no playing field needed by the local community should be lost. This is supported by the facts. In 2005-06 (the latest year for which we have figures) Sport England reported that 97 per cent. of all planning applications affecting playing fields represented either an improvement or no change to sporting provision.</p>
	<p pid="a.1056W.5/2">However, we are not complacent and continue to keep the effectiveness of current arrangements under review. I am aware of concerns from some organisations that having a time limit acts as an incentive for developers to fence off playing field land from public use in the hope of gaining future planning permission. As such, I have asked Sport England to investigate and assess any issues surrounding the five year rule on consultation. Following this my officials and Sport England will be meeting their colleagues in Communities and Local Government shortly to discuss the issue.</p>

Exception E3 is defined as:</p>

It did not, however, monitor specific types of industry, such as television and broadcasting. The research shows that, overall, 47 per cent. of all the establishments surveyed reported having employed at least one disabled member of staff within the past 10 years, and 34 per cent. said that they employed at least one disabled person at the time of the survey.</p>
	<p pid="a.1064W.11/2">The Labour Force Survey provides quarterly statistics on the employment rates disabled people, and provides a breakdown by industry sector. For example, the survey for the period October to December 2007 shows that, of disabled people in work, 7.64 per cent. were employed in the 'Transport, Storage and Communication' sector. However, data for this sector cannot be broken down further by individual types of communication, such as television and broadcasting.</p>

	<p pid="a.1065W.2/1">We do not have a target employment rate for women. However, we do know that female employment is over 70 per cent. and the trend has been upwards for some time. As a result the UK has already exceeded the EU target for getting female employment above 60 per cent. by 2010.</p>
	<p pid="a.1065W.2/2">The Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) does not set numerical targets for the employment rate of older people. The public service agreement (PSA) targets set in the 2002 and 2004 comprehensive spending reviews were, taking account of the economic cycle, to increase the employment rate of people aged 50 and over, and significantly reduce the difference between their employment rate and the overall rate.</p>
	<p pid="a.1065W.2/3">The 2002 PSA target covered people aged 50 to state pension age. The 2004 target extended the age range to people aged 50 to 69 to take account of, and encourage, working past state pension age.</p>
	<p pid="a.1065W.2/4">The employment rates for older people are set out in the following tables.</p>

	<p pid="a.1068W.2/12">The relatively low level of expenditure in the bottom quintile is partly explained by the low proportion of pensioners in that quintile, with only 15 per cent. of pensioners in the bottom quintile of incomes across all individuals. Many pensioners are moved out of this quintile by pension credit and other benefits, so expenditure in the lowest quintile is expected to be relatively low.</p>

	<p pid="a.1072W.8/3">We provide substantial help (totalling over &pound;3 million a day) through the tax credit system, in providing up to 80 per cent. of child care costs&mdash;helping nearly 430,000 families.</p>
	<p pid="a.1072W.8/4">Beginning in September 2008, &pound;75 million has been made available over three years, so that 50,000 workless families can benefit from free childcare, allowing parents to access training and move into work.</p>
	<p pid="a.1072W.8/5">In addition, Jobcentre Plus have a range of funding available for costs of child care including funds specifically for lone parents, under the new deal for lone parents programme.</p>
	<p pid="a.1072W.8/6">The Budget increased the commitment to child care by announcing additional pilots to support new approaches to child care, building on good practice from the additional child care support provided by the &pound;33 million London Childcare Affordability Programme. In addition, the Government will also pilot new child development grants of &pound;200 in 10 local authority areas, payable where parents take up their child care places and have contact with their local Children's Centre.</p>
	<p pid="a.1072W.8/7">The DCSF &quot;affordable childcare&quot; campaign aims to make parents much more aware of the range of provision in their areas and the support available to make child care more affordable. Specific strands of work have been developed for lone parents, which have received good feedback and high response rates. In addition, the budget announced a pilot to place HM Revenue and Customs advisers in children's centres to provide help with claims for the child care element of the working tax credit, and keeping their awards up to date.</p>

	<p pid="a.1073W.2/1">Child abuse is completely unacceptable. We are determined to address all types of abuse and harm to children including forced marriage, domestic violence, child trafficking, and others. All professionals working with or who come into contact with children, including those working in health or education, should be aware of how to recognise and respond to safeguarding concerns, including signs of possible abuse or neglect. If they have reason to believe that a child is at risk from harm as a result of a potential forced marriage, they should take action to follow up their concern, involving other agencies as required. This should take place for any child at risk of abuse.</p>
	<p pid="a.1073W.2/2">Guidance for relevant organisations and professionals is set out in &quot;What To Do If You're Worried a Child Is Being Abused&quot; (2006), and in &quot;Working Together to Safeguard Children&quot; (2006). &quot;Working Together&quot; is statutory guidance aimed at all individuals and organisations that have responsibility for safeguarding and promoting the welfare of children and sets out the detailed processes that must be followed where there is cause for concern about a child's welfare. This contains specific guidance on forced marriage.</p>
	<p pid="a.1073W.2/3">This Government have created statutory Local Safeguarding Children Boards (LSCBs) to co-ordinate what local bodies do to safeguard children and to ensure that they are working effectively together. LSCBs draw up local procedures for how agencies, including education, children's social care, and the police, work together. These procedures often contain specific, detailed sections on identifying and responding to particular types of harm to children, such as forced marriage.</p>
	<p pid="a.1073W.2/4">The Children Act 2004 also gave a range of statutory agencies a legal duty to safeguard and promote the welfare of children. Statutory guidance, &quot;Making arrangements to safeguard and promote the welfare of children under section 11 of the Children Act 2004&quot;, was issued in July 2005 and updated in March 2007. This is aimed at the police, hospitals, prisons and others covered by the requirement saying what they should do to make sure children are safe.</p>
	<p pid="a.1073W.2/5">The Forced Marriage Unit (FMU) and my Department produced practical guidance for education professionals, &quot;Dealing with Cases of Forced Marriage&quot; in 2005. My Department is currently working with the FMU to revise this guidance and put it onto a statutory footing in the autumn, following a period of public consultation.</p>
	<p pid="a.1073W.2/6">The Department has no role in assessing the vulnerability of individual children&mdash;local authorities have the statutory function to safeguard and promote the welfare of children in their area who may be in need, including looked after children. This includes minimising the risk of children going missing from care, keeping detailed records when children do go missing, and taking steps to address the reasons why an individual child might go missing.</p>
	<p pid="a.1073W.2/7">National figures showing the overall numbers of children who went missing from their care placements for more than 24 hours are published at:</p>
	<p pid="a.1073W.2/8" class="indent"><a href="http://www.dcsf.gov.uk/rsgateway/DB/SFR/s000741/index.shtml">http://www.dcsf.gov.uk/rsgateway/DB/SFR/s000741/index.shtml</a>.</p>
	<p pid="a.1073W.2/9">All looked after children have a detailed care plan, informed by a full assessment of their needs under the assessment framework for children in need and their families. This assessment includes all the factors that are relevant to safeguarding the child and promoting their welfare, and the resulting care plan sets out the information that needs to be shared with other agencies in order to keep the child safe.</p>
	<p pid="a.1073W.2/10">Statistics on children missing from education are not collected nationally. We introduced a new statutory duty in February 2007 for local authorities to put robust systems in place to identify any child not receiving a suitable education, and provided guidance on how to implement this duty. I have written to Her Majesty's Chief Inspector to ask Ofsted to provide their view of how well this new duty is being implemented.</p>

The project demonstrated the value of gender analysis in some areas and identified what tools and expertise were necessary within government to carry out gender analysis, but that further work was needed before gender responsive budgeting could be implemented.

Prior to that there were an estimated 700 walking buses in England. A further 1,335 schools received funding for other initiatives to increase walking to school. We are currently reviewing entitlement to second-year funding. A breakdown of the 1,918 schools by local authority is set out in the table.</p>

	<p pid="a.1083W.5/1">Under the Education Act 1996, local authorities have a duty, where necessary, to assess children's special educational needs (SEN) and draw up SEN statements. The Government provide statutory guidance in the SEN code of practice to help local authorities fulfil that duty. The Government expect every child who needs a statement to have their SEN met will receive one. Our SEN strategy 'Removing Barriers to Achievement' set out a programme to improve SEN provision in schools with the result that more children can have their special educational needs met fully without requiring a statement. However, the Government have maintained parents' rights, under the Education Act 1996, to request a statutory assessment of their children's SEN, with a view to statements being drawn up, and to appeal refusals to assess and statement to the SEN and Disability Tribunal.</p>

	<p pid="a.1084W.6/2">Community Champions Fund support is provided to individuals, not organisations. It is delivered through the nine Government offices (GOs) in England. Each GO is allocated a budget according to the number of long-term unemployed (six months or more) 18 to 65-year-olds in the region. The GOs deliver the funding through locally contracted intermediary organisations. These promote the programme, support and receive applications, in conjunction with the GOs undertake selection, and administer accounts for individual payments. Up to 15 per cent. of the allocated budget can be drawn on by the intermediaries to administer the fund.</p>
