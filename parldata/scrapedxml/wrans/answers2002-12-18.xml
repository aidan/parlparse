	<p pid=".797W.3/2">In October 2001 we published a consultation document on measures to remove abandoned and untaxed vehicles from the streets more quickly and, for the longer term, bring forward changes to vehicle registration and licensing procedures to ensure greater accuracy of DVLA's vehicle record.</p>
	<p pid=".797W.3/3">Regulations reducing the statutory notice periods after which local authorities can remove abandoned vehicles from the highway and the storage periods for unlicensed vehicles came into force on <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-09">9 April</phrase>. Local authorities can now remove those vehicles that they consider merit destruction from the highway after the expiry of a 24 hour notice placed on them.</p>
	<p pid=".797W.3/4">We have supported pilot schemes in the London boroughs of Newham and Lewisham in which the local authority was given DVLA's powers to wheelclamp and remove unlicensed vehicles after 24 hours. Following the success of the Newham pilot on <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-10">10 April</phrase>, we announced that all councils who wished could operate in the same way.</p>
	<p pid=".797W.3/5">In addition, councils have targeted over 6,000 abandoned unlicensed vehicles in multi-agency XOperation Cubits&quot; with over 4,000 vehicles crushed and more operations are planned. To date we estimate that the operations have induced more than 15,700 motorists to relicense their vehicles voluntarily bringing in over #2.3 million in additional revenue.</p>
	<p pid=".797W.3/6">The Government are currently developing proposals for the reform and modernisation of vehicle registration and licensing, to reduce evasion and to bear down on vehicle crime. In response to the recommendations of a report commissioned by the Department for Transport from the Jill Dando Institute of Crime Science, that Department has established a Modernising Vehicle Registration Implementation Board (MVRIB). This includes representatives of motorists' organisations, the motor trade, the police and the insurance industry to advise on and develop those proposals.</p>
	<p pid=".797W.3/7">The 2002 Finance Act contained provisions under which the responsibility for licensing and taxing vehicles will be placed on the registered keeper, who will remain liable for doing so until such time that the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) has properly been notified of a change of keeper. These proposals will also mean that it is not necessary for a vehicle to be detected on the road for effective enforcement action to take place. The implementation of these new powers is at the heart of MVRIB's agenda.</p>

	<p pid=".798W.2/1">The agri-environment schemes review consists of three phases. The first phase centred on an initial consultation, held between March and May 2002. This asked for views on the existing schemes and explored what people would like to see in future schemes. There were over 130 responses to this consultation, which were analysed in a report produced in July 2002. This is available on the DEFRA website at: <a href="http://defraweb/erdp/schemes/landbased/review/consultnew.htm">http://defraweb/erdp/schemes/landbased/review/consultnew.htm</a>.</p>
	<p pid=".798W.2/2">The second phase of the review is currently in progress. It consists of two main areas of work: the production of a framework document setting out the future direction of agri-environment schemes, and the development of a pilot scheme to test the proposed entry-level scheme. The framework document was issued for consultation on <phrase class="date" code="2002-12-16">16 December 2002</phrase>, and responses are sought by <phrase class="date" code="2003-02-28">28 February 2003</phrase>. I announced the pilot areas for the entry level scheme on <phrase class="date" code="2002-11-14">14 November 2002</phrase> and the pilot scheme is due to be launched next spring.</p>
	<p pid=".798W.2/3">The third phase of the review will involve the detailed design and development of the main entry-level scheme and a revised higher-tier scheme, intended to incorporate the best features from both the countryside stewardship and environmentally sensitive areas schemes. It is hoped to complete the review in the summer of 2004, when details of both schemes are sent to the European Commission for approval. The new schemes should open for applications early in 2005.</p>

	<p pid=".800W.2/1">In 1996, the Government concluded a voluntary agreement on the use of HFCs with the Air Conditioning and Refrigeration Industry Board (ACRIB) and its member organisations to ensure emissions to atmosphere were minimised. The agreement took the form of a Xdeclaration of intent&quot; in recognition of the fact that the industry is very widely dispersed and that signatories to the agreement could not make a commitment on behalf of those they did not directly represent.</p>
	<p pid=".800W.2/2">The UK climate change programme published in November 2000 sets out the key elements of the Government's policy on HFCs. During 2000, discussions with ACRIB led Government to conclude that a national registration and competence scheme for refrigerant handlers would be a more effective way of limiting and minimising HFC emissions from the refrigeration sector. The industry is developing a scheme which it proposes to put to Government in early 2003. The Government's intention is to make registration and minimum competence mandatory for companies and refrigerant handlers.</p>

The current generation of IFF equipment (IFF Mk 10) is in the process of being replaced by an updated system, the Mk 12 standard, through the Successor IFF (SIFF) programme. The Mk 12 provides additional security by means of high reliability encrypted interrogation of platforms. IFF is one of a number of methods employed by the armed forces to assist Combat Identification and to minimise the risk of friendly fire incidents. Combat Identification is achieved through a triad of measures: Situational Awareness, Target Identification, and Tactics, Techniques and Procedures. These measures are complementary and IFF plays a part in improving situational awareness and contributes to effective identification.</p>

	<p pid=".809W.13/1">In the UK in the immediate aftermath of September 2001 attacks we immediately tightened the security regime for commercial flights by small aircraft. Prior to that, commercial aircraft of less than 15 tonnes (maximum take off weight) were outside the requirements of the National Aviation Security Programme. That exemption has been removed, and aircraft of any weight are now subject to the programme.</p>

	<p pid=".810W.8/1">The transport segment of the Transport, Energy and Telecommunications Council was held in Brussels on 5&ndash;<phrase class="date" code="">6 December</phrase>, my right hon. Friend the Minister of State for Transport attended on the first day, and I attended on the second day, when the Prestige incident was discussed.</p>
	<p pid=".810W.8/2">The Council came to an agreement on the Single European Sky package. The aim of the four regulations making up the package is to improve the efficiency of air traffic management across the EU, thereby reducing air traffic delays. The United Kingdom has been a strong supporter of this package from the outset and I am very pleased to be able to report the successful outcome. Civil/military co-operation is an important aspect of air traffic management, and the member states made a declaration agreeing to co-operate on military aspects.</p>
	<p pid=".810W.8/3">The Commission presented its recent Communication on the consequences for European aviation policy of the recent ECJ rulings on aviation agreements. The Commission called for rapid progress on concluding an EU-US aviation agreement, the Commissioner having written to Ministers, asking them to denounce their existing agreements with the US, which, following the ECJ rulings, the Commission believed were no longer valid. There was general agreement that member states and the Commission needed to discuss the consequences of the ruling urgently, including the question of a Commission mandate for negotiations with the US. COREPER was asked to work on proposals to be put to the Council.</p>
	<p pid=".810W.8/4">The Council agreed on a Regulation providing for new levels of compensation to air passengers in the event of denied boarding, cancellation and delay. A majority of Ministers accepted three levels of compensation: 250 euros for all flights of 1,500 km or less, 400 euros for intra-EU flights of more than 1,500 km and other flights between 1,500&ndash;3,500 km, and 600 euros for all other flights. These compensation levels will be reviewed four years after the Regulation comes into effect. The UK voted against the Regulation because in the absence of a link to the ticket price it could damage the interests of consumers of Xno-frills&quot; air services. During the debate, the Minister of State had voiced concern at the impact on the services of no-frills carriers, pointing out that the minimum compensation level was almost four times the average cost of a no-frills ticket. Following a suggestion from some member states that the scope of the Regulation be extended to certain passengers returning to the EU from non-Community airports, it was agreed that the Commission would publish a report on this issue.</p>
	<p pid=".810W.8/5">Conclusions were agreed setting out the basis for the continuation of the Galileo satellite navigation project, including the tendering procedure, and addressing the importance of relations with third countries. A final decision on whether to include a Public Regulated Service (PRS) in the project is to be taken before the end-of 2003. The UK and the Netherlands entered a Minutes Statement stressing that they could not accept any PRS that would overlay the US GPS M-Code.</p>
	<p pid=".810W.8/6">The Council debated the second package of rail measures. The presidency noted the progress that had been made on this package of five proposals, designed to progress the development of more harmonised technical standards for interoperability, harmonise safety regulation processes, to open up access to the market for all rail freight services, and to establish a European Rail Agency. In discussion of the main outstanding issues on the safety and interoperability proposals there was a consensus for member states to be able to maintain safety levels above any harmonised minimum standard, and general support for extending the scope of the interoperability requirements. The presidency concluded that work should continue on the package. Greece made clear that it hoped to reach agreement during its presidency.</p>
	<p pid=".810W.8/7">There was a debate on action to be taken following the Prestige accident. I, in common with other Ministers and the Commission, generally welcomed the presidency's approach in the Conclusions put to the Council. I joined others in arguing for better quality port state control inspections, and expressed the UK view that in general there should be co-ordinated EU actions leading to improvements in the international regulatory framework. The Conclusions reaffirmed the support of member states for the establishment of a supplementary compensation fund, developed in the IMO, to the benefit of the victims of oil pollution. This would enhance the existing international fund. The UK's concern was that the EU should not commit itself at this stage to its own fund in the event of failure of negotiations in the IMO, for fear of prejudicing those negotiations, and we secured an amendment to this effect. The Conclusions also include commitments to a faster phasing out of single-hulled tankers and restrictions on those carrying very heavy oil. There is to be an analysis of available double-hull tanker capacity. Also included are: better implementation of port state control obligations, and possible measures by member states to prohibit within 200 miles of their coasts traffic carrying dangerous and polluting goods.</p>
	<p pid=".810W.8/8">The Council agreed on a Regulation establishing the Marco Polo programme to grant community financial aid to projects designed to achieve the shift of freight transport from road to other modes. The programme will have a total budget of 75 million euros.</p>
	<p pid=".810W.8/9">Political agreement was reached on a Regulation to prohibit the use of environmentally damaging anti-fouling paints on ships, in accordance with the latest IMO agreements.</p>
	<p pid=".810W.8/10">Conclusions were agreed on the integration of environment and sustainable development into transport policy, a continuation of the process begun at the Cardiff European Council in 1998.</p>
	<p pid=".810W.8/11">The Council debated the issue of Alpine transit and the ecopoint system for transit through Austria. Agreement could not be reached, and the presidency submitted the dossier to the General Affairs and External Relations Council.</p>
	<p pid=".810W.8/12">During the Council, Ministers signed the Agreement on Maritime Transport between the European Community and its member states, and the People's Republic of China.</p>

Therefore, the UK is pleased to note that in preparation for the annual meetings of the International Monetary and Financial Committee and Development Committee in September 2002, IMF and World bank staff committed to develop alternative macroeconomic scenarios, including a policy-based Xoptimistic&quot; and a Xconservative&quot; scenario that would reflect country's vulnerabilities and the uncertainties of external environment. IMF and World bank staff are also expected to base their own growth projections on a thorough analysis of the likely sources of growth and to present such analyses explicitly in discussions with authorities, as well as in staff documents.</p>
	<p pid=".818W.2/2">The Independent Evaluations Office (IEO) of the IMF has been discussing its work programme for 2003, proposing an evaluation of the poverty reductions strategy papers and the poverty reduction and growth facility approach. The UK has contributed to that discussion to ensure the IEO can conduct a thorough assessment.</p>

	<p pid=".823W.3/2">Concern is sometimes expressed that the growth of the service sector may slow overall productivity growth because measured productivity growth is lower in the service sector than in the rest of the economy. However this conclusion, which emerged in academic research in the 1960s, has been called into question by later research. Moreover a number of studies show that the UK service sector has considerable potential to catch up with best-practice productivity levels elsewhere.

	<p pid=".824W.2/1">The Performance and Innovation Unit's 'Renewable Energy in the UK&mdash;Building for the Future' report recommended that up to #10 million of support be provided as capital grants specifically for renewable energy schemes that engage local communities or individual households.</p>
	<p pid=".824W.2/2">The DTI has since undertaken a broad consultation exercise to inform the positioning, design and workings of this scheme. Through the consultation the DTI has revisited the initial recommendations of the PIU. An initial scoping exercise identified schemes, which had potential overlap with the proposed Community and Household Scheme (CHS), and concluded that such a scheme would be beneficial for the advancement of renewables in the UK.</p>
	<p pid=".824W.2/3">Although the PIU recommended that no restrictions be placed on technology, the DTI has sought to identify which technologies would enhance the public's understanding of renewables. The scheme has also been designed so that it would not duplicate work under way through other Government or Industry initiatives. Although solar PV has a significant contribution to make to enhancing the public's understanding of renewables, it is already supported by the first phase of the PV Major Demonstration Programme (MDP) which has a budget of #20 million. The programme has already supported PV installations by homeowners and local groups. Technologies such as solar water heating, small wind and micro hydro can also make a positive contribution to the public's understanding of renewables. These technologies, in contrast to solar PV, receive little or no Government support.</p>
	<p pid=".824W.2/4">The scheme also aims to tackle some of the other barriers to uptake such as installer accreditation. Again installer accreditation for solar PV occurs under the MDP and so any such work in the Community and Household would be redundant.</p>
	<p pid=".824W.2/5">On off grid applications, the DTI are currently looking at whether to expand the MDP to include off grid PV systems. On hybrid systems, customers will be able to apply to the CHS for the non solar PV component and to the MDP for the solar PV component of the hybrid system.</p>
	<p pid=".824W.2/6">The technologies supported by the CHS will be reviewed throughout the lifetime of the scheme and altered if necessary.</p>

	<p pid=".826W.2/1">At the outset of the scheme, officials&mdash; in conjunction with local trawlermen and their representatives&mdash;compiled a list of Icelandic-water vessels based on independent contemporary documentary evidence. More vessels have been added to this list as further such evidence has come to light during the period of operation of the Scheme. There are now over 700 vessels on the list. We continue to believe that independent contemporary documentary evidence provides the best basis for assessing the status of particular vessels.</p>

Rather than spending around #250,000 to develop and administer a specific supporting people means test, I have decided that eligibility for housing benefit or any other means tested benefit, should be the automatic passport to free housing support services. This will be easy to operate with little additional costs in terms of administration.</p>

It is for teachers to decide on the most appropriate materials, including visual aids, to encourage teaching and learning in the classroom. Teachers are aware of potential political problems and are professional in their approach. There are safeguards in law to guard against biased teaching. LEAs and schools must take reasonable steps to ensure that where political or controversial issues are covered, teachers offer pupils a balanced presentation of opposing views.

We favour funding indicators more closely related to the extra costs to institutions of recruiting and supporting students from non-traditional backgrounds.

	<p pid=".833W.5/2">The Department has no analysis of how much cost is incurred in educating an excluded pupil at a pupil referral unit (PRU). This is due to the wide variance in provision that any particular excluded pupil would require from a PRU, as well as other factors such as the location of the PRU and the funding structure of the local education authority.</p>
	<p pid=".833W.5/3">Funding for PRUs is contained in the Social Inclusion: Pupil Support (SIPS) grant. This grant (#176 million in 2002&ndash;03) is designed to tackle bad behaviour in schools and to provide education for pupils outside mainstream schools. PRUs can also be funded from other sources and there is therefore no measure of costs for a PRU.</p>

The local government reorganisation means that data for 1996&ndash;97 and 1997&ndash;98 does not conform to current boundaries so comparable figures are not available.</p>

However, we have provided Kent and Medway with figures for total education formula spending for 2004&ndash;05 and 2005&ndash;06, together with forward projections at national level of pupil numbers for those years. We have also said that there will be minimum and maximum increases for authorities as we introduce the new LEA funding system. Indicator data will be averaged over three years to provide further stability and predictability in future formula spending shares. Kent and Medway will be able to use this data&mdash;together with local knowledge about pupil numbers and indicators&mdash;to form a good estimate of what their EFSS might be in those years. That will in turn allow them to provide schools with indicative budgets for the next three years.</p>

	<p pid=".836W.0/1">The Department will not be abolishing the sponsorship requirement for schools applying for specialist school status.</p>
	<p pid=".836W.0/2">Raising sponsorship is a key aspect of the Specialist Schools Programme. The main rationale behind it is the need for specialist schools to build partnerships with sponsors and the local community. As a task, raising sponsorship links into the enterprising ethos that is integral to the programme as a whole and it serves as a forum for the school's public presentation of its plans for specialist designation.</p>
	<p pid=".836W.0/3">The Department has already done much to help schools which are having difficulties raising the necessary sponsorship. We grant-aid the Technology Colleges Trust and the Youth Sport Trust, which advise schools on raising sponsorship. The Trusts are often able to help schools with money donated centrally, on the basis of criteria set out by sponsors.</p>
	<p pid=".836W.0/4">In 1999 we reduced the sponsorship requirement to #50,000, and in May this year we reduced the amount of sponsorship required by small mainstream schools (defined as those with under 500 pupils on roll) to #100 per pupil, subject to a minimum of #20,000, rising to #50,000 for a school with 500 pupils.</p>
	<p pid=".836W.0/5">In November the Secretary of State for Education and Skills announced the creation of a Partnership Fund. The Fund, which will contain #3 million in 2003&ndash;04, is designed specifically to help schools which have had serious difficulties meeting the #50,000 sponsorship requirement. The Department is in the process of developing criteria for the allocation of the fund, which will be managed by the Technology Colleges Trust. The criteria will be based around evidence that the school has made a real effort to raise sponsorship and has created valuable links with businesses.</p>

	<p pid=".837W.3/2">The Extradition Act 1989 contains a number of statutory safeguards against surrender of which a fugitive can seek to avail himself before the courts. If no legal challenge is made, or if any that are made are unsuccessful, it falls to my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary to decide, in the exercise of residual discretion, whether to order surrender. In so deciding, he has regard to all the circumstances of the case and to any grounds for concluding that it would be unjust or oppressive to order surrender. As part of that consideration, the fugitive has an opportunity to make such representations against surrender as he would wish to be taken into account.</p>

	<p pid=".840W.5/2">Information is not available in the form requested. Under the previous arrangements some volunteers were subject to police checks via local authorities and other organisations but separate statistics were not collected. A number of voluntary organisations accessed police checks through a body called the Voluntary Organisations Consultancy Service (VOCS), covering both volunteers and paid employees. Their last annual report covering the financial year 2001&ndash;2002 showed that they processed 13,535 police checks for voluntary organisations of which 6,595 were for paid employees and 6,940 were for volunteers. The average time for responses from the police was 30 days. VOCS' own handling time was additional.</p>
	<p pid=".840W.5/3">As to the current arrangements, no distinction is made in relation to the profession or status of an applicant. As a result, the IT system is not able at present to extract this data from the Criminal Records Bureau (CRB) database (although it is expected to be able to do so in future when the system is updated). They are all subject to the same level of service. However, access to checks by the voluntary sector has been greatly increased with the advent of the CRB and many more volunteers are now subject to such checks.</p>
	<p pid=".840W.5/4">The average turnaround time for processing applications remains at about six weeks.</p>
	<p pid=".840W.5/5">This is measured from the point at which a correctly completed application form is received by the CRB, accompanied by all pertinent supporting details, to issuing a Disclosure.</p>

	<p pid=".841W.3/2">All prisons have a Counselling, Assessment, Referral, Advice and Throughcare service (CARAT), which seeks to put in place care plans for prisoners, which should identify need for throughcare on release. Prisoners serving sentences of 12 months or less can receive support from CARATs. Prior to release, CARATs will warn of the dangers associated with loss of tolerance in prison and will try to establish a link with a community drug service. When this is not achieved, CARATs will provide a degree of support, where practical, for up to eight weeks after release.</p>
	<p pid=".841W.3/3">Prisoners serving sentences in excess of 12 months are routinely subject to supervision by the National Probation Service. CARAT workers will advise a supervising probation officer of any continuing, post-release drug treatment needs and will request the establishment of a link with a community drug agency. A prisoner's progress will be monitored until the expiry of the supervision period.</p>

The latest estimates for the number of Class A problem drug users in England and Wales range from 281,125 to 506,025. The first of these figures is closest to previously reported estimates.

	<p pid=".843W.2/1">The general prison population contains a large number of prisoners with a combination of psychiatric disorders, alcohol and drug dependency, family background and relationship problems, histories of self-harm and previous abuse, all of which raise their risk of suicide. Good care and support from staff saves many lives but such instances go largely unreported. The current operating environment is very challenging because an increased prisoner population and movement of prisoners puts a strain on resources and makes it harder to prevent suicides. The Prison Service's approach, in close partnership with outside organisations such as Samaritans, better identify and support those who seem at greatest risk with an approach that focuses on relationships, processes and the physical environment.</p>
	<p pid=".843W.2/2">The Prison Service's suicide prevention and self-harm reduction programme includes a series of inter-related projects to improve pre-reception, reception and induction arrangements; inter-agency information exchange; prisoner care; detoxification; prisoner peer support, and the learning from investigations into deaths in custody.</p>
	<p pid=".843W.2/3">Piloting of these projects is focused on six establishments&mdash;Wandsworth, Feltham, Eastwood Park, Leeds, Winchester and Birmingham&mdash;although others are involved in aspects of the work. An investment of #21.69 million over the three year programme from April 2001 is allowing physical improvements to be made at these six sites, for example to reception and induction areas, and through the installation of more first night centres, safer cells, crisis suites and gated cells that enable staff to watch at-risk prisoners closely. The programme will be subject to an independent quantitative and qualitative evaluation. No resources have at present been allocated to work beyond April 2004.</p>
	<p pid=".843W.2/4">Thirty full-time suicide prevention co-ordinators (SPCs) were trained and located in the most high risk establishments, and a further 99 mostly part-time SPCs are now operating across the estate. There has been a continuing increase in the numbers of prisoner XListeners&quot; being recruited in high-risk establishments, with 608 new Listeners recruited within these establishments between <phrase class="date" code="2001-10-01">1 October 2001</phrase> and <phrase class="date" code="2002-03-31">31 March 2002</phrase> alone, and further recruitment and training taking place.</p>
	<p pid=".843W.2/5">Concurrently, new health care screening procedures have been piloted at 10 establishments and are to be rolled out across the estate. Wing staff will be increasingly supported in their work by in-reach mental health teams and by the establishment where possible of dedicated drug detoxification units.</p>

This is expected to cover food shortage needs of five countries in the region, including Mauritania. We will be considering this appeal and are also considering a related proposal from Oxfam. Funding is also provided via the EC, of which DFID share around 19 per cent. In 2000 (the latest figures available) this amounted to approximately #7.8 million.</p>

	<p pid=".851W.2/5" class="indent">The Agency recognises that it needs to improve the handling of complaints and as a result conducted a detailed review of the complaints process. The recommendations from this review are being taken forward as part of the Child Support Reform programme. The key deliverable from this work is a standard process and organisation for handling client complaints. This will include:</p>
	<p pid=".851W.2/6" class="indent">Dedicated complaints resolution teams.</p>
	<p pid=".851W.2/7" class="indent">Clients, staff and stakeholders knowing how a complaint will be progressed whatever the client's location.</p>
	<p pid=".851W.2/8" class="indent">Complaint resolution plans agreed with the client, which specify the actions and timescales to resolve the complaint.</p>
	<p pid=".851W.2/9" class="indent">Senior Resolution Managers heading up a technical assurance team in each Business Unit. These teams deal with cases that cannot be resolved by the complaints resolution teams or have been referred to them by the Chief Executive or Area Director.</p>

	<p pid=".851W.2/11" class="indent">A Centre of Excellence, to analyse and learn from complaints data.</p>
	<p pid=".851W.2/12" class="indent">In 2001/02 the Child Support Agency has worked hard with the Independent Case Examiner to reduce the backlog of outstanding complaints. Advice on how the Agency might best improve the way it handles complaints has proved invaluable.</p>
	<p pid=".851W.2/13" class="indent">Using this information the Agency has made some significant steps forward in improving its service to our clients including:</p>
	<p pid=".851W.2/14" class="indent">Restructuring the front end of its business to provide an end-to-end service for new clients, and on each team have a dedicated specialist complaints handler Creating new IT support for debt management, appointed new bailiffs improve efficiency and reduce the complaints about lack of activity in this area</p>
	<p pid=".851W.2/15" class="indent">These improvements are a part of the comprehensive modernisation programme in which the Agency is engaged and against that background we will continue to work closely with the Independent Case Examiner to significantly reduce the number of complaints referred to her office where she finds that the Agency has not done enough either to apologise, to offer compensation and redress or to resolve the position for the future.</p>

	<p pid=".858W.6/1">Between September 2001 and April 2002 we piloted a number of approaches aimed at encouraging greater take up of basic skills provision by people claiming Jobseeker's Allowance. These included testing different mechanisms to identify those with basic skills needs, and the use of financial incentives and/or benefit sanctions to encourage the take up of training.</p>
	<p pid=".858W.6/2">In North Nottinghamshire we piloted the use of benefit sanctions if a client refused an offer of training or left training early without good cause. In Leeds we combined the use of sanctions with financial incentives of #20 per week on top of their benefit for taking up training and #100 for achieving a basic skills qualification. In the two pilots, 1,623 clients had a possible basic skills need identified. Of these, 18 had sanctions applied, three because they failed to attend a basic skills assessment and 15 because they failed to attend training or left early without good cause.</p>
	<p pid=".858W.6/3">All the basic skills pilots are subject to an extensive, longitudinal evaluation study. This is looking at both the quantitative and qualitative aspects of the pilots. The final evaluation report will be available in summer 2003. We will use the evidence from the evaluation to decide what changes we might make to help encourage more Jobcentre Plus clients to take up offers of help to improve their basic skills.</p>

	<p pid=".864W.0/1">The Local Government Bill currently before Parliament clarifies the power to vary the number of council tax bands. Work on an English council tax revaluation will begin in 2005, with council tax bills based on updated property values issuing in 2007. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister is aware of the concerns of people who live in low value houses about the current width of band A. Ahead of revaluation the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister will listen to the views of local government and taxpayers about council tax bands. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister will decide on any changes to the banding structure nearer to the time of the revaluation.</p>

	<p pid=".868W.0/1">The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister will be commissioning a major survey of homeless households in temporary accommodation early in the new year. The research will examine the factors that led to homelessness among a representative sample of households placed in temporary accommodation under the homelessness legislation, and the impact of homelessness and life in temporary accommodation on those households.</p>
	<p pid=".868W.0/2">The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister's procurement guidance strongly advises against releasing the project budget in advance of commissioning the work as this can distort competition. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister will ensure that sufficient funding is available to cover the estimated cost of the research which we anticipate will take up to two years to be completed.</p>
	<p pid=".868W.0/3">The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister will consult other Government Departments, including the Department of Health and the Department for Education and Skills, on the research. In taking forward the work, the appointed contractors will be expected to consult local authorities and other interest groups.</p>
	<p pid=".868W.0/4">In line with the commitment to tackle homelessness more effectively we are also commissioning a project to evaluate different models of family support. The project will examine models led by different agencies, the voluntary sector, Primary Care Trust and a local authority (Hull City Primary Care Trust, Blackpool City Primary Care Trust, Leicester City Council and the Field Lane Foundation in London). All the models chosen demonstrate multi-agency working and have a health focus. The research will examine the effectiveness of the models in preventing repeat homelessness and will identify good practice to influence future delivery of services.</p>
	<p pid=".868W.0/5">The evaluation will commence in February 2003 with a review of each service by June 2003, and a final paper by December 2003. Again, it is not appropriate to release the project budget at this stage but we will ensure that there is sufficient funding available to cover the estimated cost of the evaluation. In taking forward the work, the appointed researchers will be expected to consult other relevant interest groups and agencies, drawing on other examples of good practice in the field of family homelessness.</p>

The recent announcement concerning freedoms and flexibilities for local authorities recommended that local cultural strategies should be subsumed within community strategies. Where this happens, the profile of sport will be raised in forming part of the strategic vision for the area. In addition, the role of all cultural and leisure services within community strategies will be included in the forthcoming evaluation which the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister will commission early in 2003.</p>

	<p pid=".873W.3/1">Our policies for improving services for people with learning disabilities, their families and carers are set out in the White Paper XValuing People: A New Strategy for Learning Disability for the 21st Century&quot; (Cm 5086), published in March 2001.</p>
	<p pid=".873W.3/2">Some #3 billion a year is already spent on health and social care provision for people with learning disabilities. The proposals in XValuing People&quot; will help to ensure that this money is spent effectively and efficiently. People with learning disabilities will also benefit from the general growth in total health and social services spending and from specific initiatives.</p>
	<p pid=".873W.3/3">The White Paper announced the creation of two new funds, the implementation support fund and the learning disability development fund. The support fund, #2.3 million a year for three years from April 2001, is being used to support a range of initiatives connected with the White Paper's programme of action. These include developing and expanding advocacy services across the country.</p>
	<p pid=".873W.3/4">The development fund has both revenue (#22.6 million) and capital (#20 million) elements. #2 million of the revenue element is being used to fund the XValuing People&quot; support team and its related activities, with the remainder being distributed to health authorities. It was distributed to the then health authorities (HAs) in March 2002 to support priorities for service change as outlined in joint investment plans they drew up with their partner local authorities. The distribution was based on the NHS general allocation formula except that five authorities received additional money to help them meet the needs of their old long stay population. Where a health authority related to more than one local authority, the allocation was to be divided according to the size of their respective resident populations unless all the parties agreed to an alternative distribution.</p>
	<p pid=".873W.3/5">The distribution by HA has been placed in the Library.</p>
	<p pid=".873W.3/6">Learning Disability Partnership Boards were invited to bid for funding from the capital element of the Development Fund. A list of the successful boards has been placed in the Library, but the money will not all be spent in this first financial year.</p>

Primary care trusts are responsible for ensuring that services for patients needing brain injury rehabilitation are in place. The configuration of this service provision, however, is a matter for local decision makers as they are best placed to understand the health needs of their local populations.</p>

In July 2002, research by the charity Crisis found that 83 per cent. of single homeless people were drug users.

	<p pid=".883W.5/2">The Homelessness Directorate's report, XMore than a Roof&quot;, set out a new approach to tackling homelessness, focused on the problems that homeless people face in the places where they live. It identified addressing health needs as critical in helping homeless people, as well as preventing homelessness.</p>
	<p pid=".883W.5/3">In the Cross-Cutting Review on health inequalities, which the Government published on <phrase class="date" code="2002-11-20">20 November 2002</phrase>, inequalities faced by vulnerable groups, including homeless people, were identified as a top-line priority. As part of Government's response to this through measures to improve access to health services for vulnerable groups and others, the Government have put in place more than 1,300 Personal Medical Service Pilots and 42 NHS Walk-in Centres. Local authorities are expected to work with a range of organisations to deliver their homelessness strategies, including primary care trusts on appropriate health services.</p>
	<p pid=".883W.5/4">In addition, all local housing authorities are now required, under the Homelessness Act 2002, to conduct a review of homelessness in their district and to adopt a strategy, by July 2003, which must include plans for ensuring that accommodation and support are available for homeless people. As made clear in the statutory Homelessness Code of Guidance for local authorities, published jointly by the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister and the Department of Health, the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister expects local housing authorities to work with a range of organisations to deliver the aims of the homelessness strategy and ensure that all the support needs of homeless people are taken into account. This includes working with primary care trusts (PCTs), to deliver appropriate health services to this client group.</p>
