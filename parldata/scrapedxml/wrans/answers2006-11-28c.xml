	<p pid="c.491W.2/1">Action to encourage recycling and reduce the amount of waste sent to landfill is driven by regional and local strategies and supported by nationally funded programmes.</p>
	<p pid="c.491W.2/2">Waste Strategy 2000 set a target to reduce the amount of commercial and industrial waste going to landfill to 85 per cent. of that landfilled in 1998, by 2005. On the basis of the latest figures, from 2002, we expect to have met this target.</p>
	<p pid="c.491W.2/3">Businesses already have a strong financial incentive to reuse or recycle their waste, and the continued increase in the rate of Landfill Tax (rising by 3 per tonne per year from 2005-06, until it reaches 35 per tonne in the medium to long term) is another important instrument in reducing our reliance on landfill and moving to more sustainable waste management options.</p>
	<p pid="c.491W.2/4">Revenue from the landfill tax escalator is in turn being recycled to businesses through the Business Resource Efficiency and Waste (BREW) Programme, which is returning &pound;284 million to businesses over three years through resource efficiency and waste minimisation programmes, providing support and advice to businesses that wish to improve their resource efficiency.</p>
	<p pid="c.491W.2/5">In 2006-07, BREW has been funding a pilot project to create a BREW Centre for local authorities, based at Oxfordshire County Council, which provides information, guidance, advice and good practice examples on how local authorities can support local business on resource efficiency and waste management.</p>
	<p pid="c.491W.2/6">The Review of England's Waste Strategy consultation document (published in February this year) asked for views on the proposed wider strategic role for local authorities on business waste and resources and on whether there should be new requirements for recycling of commercial waste on local authorities and/or business. In light of the consultation responses and progress of the BREW pilot mentioned, we are developing proposals on the role of local authorities in commercial waste. We are aiming to publish the revised Waste Strategy in the new year.</p>

	<p pid="c.495W.3/1">The Government consider that, where there is a need for wildlife management, the proper use of snares is one of a range of control methods. Used according to best practice, snares can be an effective and practical means of wildlife management and are needed where other forms of pest control are ineffective or impractical. In these circumstances, snares restrain rather than kill and may prove to be more humane than other methods. If snares were to be banned entirely it may encourage the use of more dangerous and illegal alternatives such as poisons.</p>
	<p pid="c.495W.3/2">The Government are committed to working to improve the legal use of snares. Following an informal consultation on snares and traps and their use, carried out in 2003, Defra convened an independent snares working group chaired by the Universities Federation for Animal Welfare. The Group was given a remit of producing a good practice guide and advising Defra on the next steps on improving the use of snares. On <phrase class="date" code="2005-10-19">19 October 2005</phrase>, we published the Group's report, together with the Defra Snares Action Plan and the Defra Code of Good Practice on the use of Snares in Fox and Rabbit Control in England.

	<p pid="c.496W.5/1">The Defra Waste Implementation Programme's Local Authority Support Unit (LASU) provides direct support and information to local authorities on waste disposal and recycling. The unit assists with the removal of barriers to improved waste performance and provides information on other agencies and programmes that offer relevant support. This good practice and guidance on waste management issues is shared to local authorities through the LASU website (<a href="http://lasupport.defra.gov.uk/">http://lasupport.defra.gov.uk/</a>).

It is a free advisory service that provides hands-on advice and best practice to local authorities in England and Northern Ireland on their collection programmes for dry recyclables and organic waste. The service also offers best practice advice on local communications and awareness programmes.</p>
	<p pid="c.496W.5/3">WRAP provides toolkits and best practice guides for local authorities. These collate results of local authority-related studies, which enables the sharing of best practice. WRAP will also be running food waste collection pilots to research the most effective way to divert food waste from landfill. The research results will be shared with all local authorities.</p>

	<p pid="c.497W.2/1">The Rame Head disposal site has received dredged material from the Plymouth area for over 100 years. A disposal licence under the Food and Environment Protection Act 1985 (FEPA) is required prior to any disposal taking place. No licence would be issued until the impact of disposing of the material had been fully assessed. The decision would account for Principle 15 of the Rio Declaration on the precautionary principle.</p>
	<p pid="c.497W.2/2">The majority of the dredged material disposed of at Rame Head is sourced from the Devonport Naval Base on the River Tamar. However, Cattewater Harbour and ABP Millbay Docks and Lincombe Boatyard have also used the site. The following tables show the licences issued since 1997 and the amounts disposed of to the disposal site. Further historical information is available on request.</p>
	<p pid="c.497W.2/3">The weight of evidence currently to hand supports the view that the continued disposal of dredged material to the Rame Head site in Whitsand Bay is an environmentally acceptable one, subject to licence conditions and oversight of the activities.</p>

	<p pid="c.500W.4/1">The Children (Leaving Care) Act 2000, which commenced in October 2001, requires that all local authorities must provide or maintain care leavers under the age of 18 in &quot;suitable accommodation&quot;. Like any other services for care leavers, the provision of suitable accommodation should be based on an assessment of individual need, taking into account, their health, including any disabilities; their education and training needs; and the suitability of any accommodation provider. Once care leavers reach 18, then they are entitled to have access to the same mainstream services as other young people, including housing services. As their responsible authority has continuing duties to help them plan and to support them, it will be their personal adviser's role to assist them to access the available housing that will be the most appropriate to their circumstances, which in some cases may well involve housing services that offer their residents personal and practical support.</p>
	<p pid="c.500W.4/2">The requirements set out in Section 10 of the Children Act 2004 provide the opportunity to enable improved joint planning to better meet the housing needs of children and vulnerable groups of young people, including, care leavers. The section requires each children's services authority to put in place arrangements to promote co-operation amongst those who engage in activities in relation to children and young people, and gives key strategic partners, including housing authorities, a duty to take part.</p>

	<p pid="c.501W.5/1">The information sharing index will aid more effective prevention and early intervention as a tool to support practitioners to improve outcomes for children, and is therefore a key element of the Every Child Matters programme. The index will hold only basic information about children and young people such as name, address, gender, date of birth, an identifying number, and contact details for services working with them.</p>
	<p pid="c.501W.5/2">The Information Sharing Index (England) Regulations 2006 came into effect on <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-07">7 April 2006</phrase>. They provided for data matching trials to take place, as essential initial work in the development and implementation of the index.</p>
	<p pid="c.501W.5/3">The aim was to examine a sample of records from the main data sources, to enable an assessment of how comprehensively each covers the population of children, which is the most reliable source of accurate and up-to-date information for each data item, and assess how disparities in the ways in which data sources record each item can most efficiently be overcome.</p>
	<p pid="c.501W.5/4">The trials were intended to provide an early indication of the expected level of data matching for the full national index. Samples of basic identifying information were supplied from the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP), Department of Health (DH), the Department for Education and Skills (DfES) and nine local authorities. For records where it was possible to compare data held about a child by more than one source (about 90 per cent. of all records examined) there was sufficient correspondence to be very confident that the data was correct. For the remaining information, where it was not possible to compare the information, the index project will provide resources to investigate any discrepancies and correct them, leading to a high level of confidence in the index data. This supports the strategy underpinning the index business case of using data from a number of existing national and local sources.</p>
	<p pid="c.501W.5/5">The data matching trials report will shortly be made available on the Every Child Matters website. My officials will send the hon. Member a copy and place copies in the House Library.</p>

	<p pid="c.503W.0/1">The information sharing index will aid more effective prevention and early intervention as a tool to support practitioners to improve outcomes for children, and is therefore a key element of the Every Child Matters programme.</p>
	<p pid="c.503W.0/2">On <phrase class="date" code="2005-12-08">8 December 2005</phrase>, the Government announced their intention to implement a national information sharing index across all 150 local authorities in England by the end of 2008. The Government are committing substantial resources to implement the index&mdash;one-off implementation costs will total &pound;224 million over the next three years, and &pound;41 million per year thereafter to cover operating costs, most of which will pay for the additional staff needed to ensure the on-going security, accuracy and audit of the index. My Department has made provision to fund both set-up and operating costs, so that the costs to local authorities will not result in a pressure on the council tax.</p>
	<p pid="c.503W.0/3">We have now entered the detailed design and pre-deployment phase of the index. To support this, details of the &pound;12 million index local authority funding for 2006-07, were announced in April 2006. In October, a further funding allocation, totalling &pound;29.8 million, was announced, covering the period 2007-08. This funding is being made available to enable local authorities to undertake necessary work in respect of readiness assessment and local pre-deployment work to prepare for the national implementation of the index. We have also developed an implementation toolkit to provide practical support for local authorities during this phase.</p>
	<p pid="c.503W.0/4">Additional funding of &pound;4.14 million is being provided in the 2007-08 allocation to the first wave of 17 'early adopter' local authorities, based in the North West.</p>
	<p pid="c.503W.0/5">Earlier this year, we conducted data matching trials under the Information Sharing Index (England) Regulations 2006. The trials were intended to provide an early indication of the expected level of data matching for the full national Index. Samples of basic identifying information were supplied from the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP), Department of Health (DH), the Department for Education and Skills (DfES) and nine local authorities. The results were in line with expectations and support the strategy underpinning the index business case of using data from a number of existing national and local sources.</p>
	<p pid="c.503W.0/6">Currently, we are consulting on draft affirmative resolution regulations to be made under section 12 of the Children Act 2004, which will govern the operation of the index. Consultation closes on <phrase class="date" code="2006-12-14">14 December</phrase>. Subject to the will of Parliament, we expect the regulations to be in force by spring 2007. Also in spring 2007 we will publish for public consultation, statutory guidance, which will support operators and users of the index users in exercising their statutory duties in relation to the index.</p>
	<p pid="c.503W.0/7">Further milestones are:</p>
	<p pid="c.503W.0/8" class="indent">From late spring or early summer of 2007, we will have created initial records for each child in England, drawn from key national data sources;</p>
	<p pid="c.503W.0/9" class="indent">The first index release, which will include those initial records, will be deployed to the first wave of early adopter local authorities by the summer of 2007.</p>
	<p pid="c.503W.0/10" class="indent">The index will then be rolled out progressively so that, by the end of 2008, it will be available in all local authorities in England.</p>
	<p pid="c.503W.0/11">There have been some inaccurate and misleading press articles following the publication of the Foundation for Policy Information Research report &quot;Children's Databases&mdash;Safety and Privacy&quot;. Their findings are based largely on personal views rather than firm evidence and, in some cases, relate to information that is over six months old. The report also contains numerous factual inaccuracies that were either not checked with me or my Department. The information sharing index will contain only the basic details of every child, end details, for example a GP or social worker, who are in contact with them. It will not contain case information or any subjective judgment about a child or their parents. It will not hold information about vaccinations, fruit and vegetable consumption or educational attainment. To say that it can be used to predict the future outcome for a child is nonsense.</p>
	<p pid="c.503W.0/12">The index is being developed in response to a key recommendation of Lord Laming following his inquiry in to the tragic death of Victoria Climbie. It is being developed in consultation with children's work force practitioners and will enable them to do their jobs more efficiently and effectively by providing them with contact details for other services working with the same child. Security is a key concern and access to the index will be tightly controlled and audited.</p>
	<p pid="c.503W.0/13">Our over-riding goal is to improve the outcomes for children, young people and families. The information sharing index will be a vital part of delivering early intervention for children who need additional services and effective safeguarding for children at risk of harm.</p>

Experts on cooking dishes that meet the new standards will train, support and mentor school cooks, including supporting them in their own school.

	<p pid="c.506W.6/1">In the last six months, ministerial colleagues and I have held a number of meetings with representatives of private, voluntary and independent childcare providers. These meetings have been opportunities to celebrate the progress that we are making together towards the delivery of our 10-year childcare strategy commitments and to discuss issues of concern. Ministers and officials have also received a range of correspondence from providers including on the code of practice.</p>
	<p pid="c.506W.6/2">Some private sector providers have suggested that the funding they receive from local authorities to fund delivery of the free entitlement does not cover their costs and expressed concern that, in their view, the code of practice prevents, for the first time, the charging of &quot;top-up fees&quot; for hours covered by the free entitlement. In responding, we have been clear that we believe the &pound;3 billion per year that the Government put into early years through the dedicated schools grant is sufficient to fund the free entitlement and that local authorities have discretion over the use they make of funding from the DSG including the rates at which they fund early education in all types of setting. They are encouraged to fund early years provision equitably across settings in accordance with local circumstances. We have also emphasised that the position on 'top-up' fees has not changed and that previous iterations of the code of practice have made this clear. The Government remain committed to a universal free early learning entitlement that benefits all children regardless of their parents' income or ability to pay.</p>
	<p pid="c.506W.6/3">We conducted a full public consultation on the 2006 code of practice from June to October 2005, to which 585 responses were received; the majority were from private providers who were generally content with the proposed extension to 38 weeks. None expressed concern about the requirement to ensure that the entitlement is entirely free at the point of delivery. A summary of the responses is available at:</p>

	<p pid="c.507W.2/1">Since the Code of Practice came into force in April, ministerial colleagues and I have received a number of representations about the details of arrangements for increasing the free entitlement from 33 to 38 weeks and about &quot;top up fees&quot;, which some providers wrongly believe the Code of Practice ruled out for the first time.</p>
	<p pid="c.507W.2/2">The single substantive change to the delivery of the free early education entitlement set out in the 2006 Code of Practice was its extension from 33 to 38 weeks. Following the consultation we made clear our recognition that not all providers would be able to extend their provision to 38 weeks and that, at the relevant local authority's discretion, they could be funded for the provision they actually delivered. In addition, all local authorities have received additional funding to support the extension to the free entitlement to 38 weeks.</p>
	<p pid="c.507W.2/3">The Code of Practice simply restated the existing position on &quot;top up fees&quot;: that the entitlement should be free at the point of delivery and that providers should not add any additional charges for the hours covered by free entitlement funding.</p>

This principle is not new, and has been made clear in successive versions of the relevant Code of Practice since 2003. The 2006 Code simply sets it out again explicitly. It confirms that parents should not be required to pay any fee for the free entitlement, either directly or indirectly as a condition of accessing the free place.</p>

	<p pid="c.510W.2/1">This Government are committed to improving outcomes for all children, especially the most vulnerable, for example those children and young people who run away.</p>
	<p pid="c.510W.2/2">We need to prevent young people from going missing in the first place, and ensure their safe return and safety when they do run away. Most runaways return within 24 hours, but they need effective mediation and resolution for their problems. When a child is missing for longer, it's even more important we have clear support mechanisms, procedures and responsibilities to enable them to be found and returned, safely and speedily, and their problems addressed.</p>
	<p pid="c.510W.2/3">Our fundamental programme of reform to improve outcomes for children everywhere&mdash;&quot;Every Child Matters&quot;&mdash;is designed to ensure vulnerable young people receive local services that identify them quickly, give responsive support tailored to their needs, and ensure their safety. It covers early intervention and prevention; integration of education, social care and health services available to at-risk youngsters; information sharing to prevent young people slipping through the net; early assessment of young people's needs, including those relating to broader family issues; joined up support for children and families, through a lead professional.</p>
	<p pid="c.510W.2/4">This means that children at risk of running away can receive practical local help for all the problems they face, not just the immediate presenting crisis. Local children's services are best placed to identify and engage with at-risk groups more quickly and effectively, where prevention and speed of response is vital. Unfortunately, not all runaways are reported as missing, but when the needs of such vulnerable young people become known to, and assessed as a priority by, a children's social care department, they have a duty to assess and address those needs.</p>
	<p pid="c.510W.2/5">Nationally, we're working across Departments, with the police, and with other key voluntary bodies. We are working with Barnardo's to summarise and disseminate lessons learned from the six community-based refuge pilot projects we funded recently. We are also working with The Children's Society to find and disseminate good practice across local authorities. We are planning new quality standards for information advice and guidance for young people; greater focus on early intervention and prevention for the whole family; and we are working with the London councils to consider their next steps towards a pan-London strategy for runaways.</p>

	<p pid="c.511W.8/1">The evaluation of the effectiveness of the Transformation Fund is due to commence in December 2006 and will cover the period until March 2009.</p>
	<p pid="c.511W.8/2">Indicative plans submitted by local authorities for using the Transformation Fund between 2006 and 2008 show that over 26,000 child-carers intend to study for Level 3 qualifications, over 8,500 intend to study for Level 4 qualifications and over 7,000 intend to study for Level 5 qualifications.</p>
	<p pid="c.511W.8/3">These plans also show that over 4,000 settings across the private, voluntary and independent sectors are expected to take up the Quality Premium element of the Fund and therefore employ a graduate who will work towards the new Early Years Professional Status, which is assessed at level 6. The plans do not, however, provide a breakdown of take up of the Quality Premium between the sectors; and, although the plans show the number of staff expected to undertake Level 3, Level 4 and Level 5 qualifications, they do not identify the number of settings involved in accessing this funding.</p>
	<p pid="c.511W.8/4">Local authorities are next due to submit a report on the take-up of the Transformation Fund in spring 2007. This will provide further details about how the funding is being used and the number of settings that are benefiting.</p>
	<p pid="c.511W.8/5">Funding in 2008-09 and beyond is subject to the outcome of the 2007 Comprehensive Spending Review, which is currently under way.</p>

	<p pid="c.512W.3/1">The United Kingdom's Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) is an independent part of the Department for Transport and is responsible for the investigation of civil aircraft accidents and serious incidents within the UK. It also assists in the investigation of military accidents on request and civil aircraft accidents overseas where there is a UK interest. The Chief Inspector of Air Accidents reports directly to the Secretary of State for Transport on safety matters.</p>
	<p pid="c.512W.3/2">Authority for the AAIB to investigate accidents originates from the Civil Aviation Act: The Civil Aviation (Investigation of Air Accidents and Incidents) Regulations 1996.</p>
	<p pid="c.512W.3/3">The fundamental purpose of investigating accidents and incidents is to determine the circumstances and causes of the accident with a view to the preservation of life and the avoidance of accidents in the future, it is not to apportion blame or liability.</p>

Its work to promote effective aviation security overseas does however help reinforce the security of flights originating in other states, including flights to the UK itself.</p>

The regulations apply to &quot;mobile workers&quot; (basically drivers and crew) operating on vehicles subject to the separate EU drivers' hour rules&mdash;which apply to most HGV drivers and about half the bus and coach drivers in the UK.

In addition, given the order elevates the status of fire prevention, we have set the Fire and Rescue Services a Best Value Performance Indicator (BV 207) relating to the number of fires that occur per 1,000 non-domestic premises in their area. We shall be monitoring that as an indicator of success.</p>

	<p pid="c.538W.0/1">I have asked the Chief Executive of the Standards Board to write to my hon. Friend on this matter. I shall arrange for a copy of his reply to be placed in the Library of the House.</p>
	<p pid="c.538W.0/2" class="italic"> Letter from David Prince, dated <phrase class="date" code="2006-11-28">28 November 2006</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="c.538W.0/3" class="indent">Thank you for your recent Parliamentary questions requesting information on the complaints dealt with by the Standards Board for England (the Standards Board) and the Adjudication Panel for England (APE). The Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government has asked the Standards Board to reply directly to your request. I am copying this reply to her officials.</p>
	<p pid="c.538W.0/4" class="indent">The information you have requested has been placed in a table format for ease of reference. The table is on the enclosed sheet. In summary, 91 per cent. of cases referred to them have been upheld by the APE.</p>
	<p pid="c.538W.0/5" class="indent">We did not refer any completed investigations for adjudication by the APE until October 2002, since the Code of Conduct was not approved by Parliament until November 2001. You may also note that there were a relatively high number of cases referred to the APE in the financial year 2002-2003. This is because a majority of the first cases referred to the APE were register of interest cases that involved parish councillors who were opposed to the register of interests being imposed halfway through their term of office.</p>
	<p pid="c.538W.0/6" class="indent">You will also note from the table of statistics that the APE received and determined fewer cases than the Standards Board referred to it. This is because when the APE receives multiple cases about the same member it will normally consider all the cases at the same time, and therefore consider them as a single case.</p>
	<p pid="c.538W.0/7" class="indent">There is also a disparity in each year between the numbers of cases the APE received and the number it determined. This is because the APE will receive cases near the end of a financial year that it will subsequently determine in the following financial year. The normal handling time, allowing for circulation of papers and responses, is around 16 weeks.</p>
	<p pid="c.538W.0/8" class="indent">We have been able to provide you with the number of cases referred to the APE by the Standards Board since 2001 by region. However, we do not collate this regional information by each type of authority so I am unable to provide you with this information broken down between parish/town councils and the other remaining local authorities. This is however an area of our statistical analysis that we will look to provide in the future.</p>
	<p pid="c.538W.0/9" class="indent">We cannot provide any statistics on complaints relating to local authorities in Wales as, under the &quot;Local Government Act 2000&quot;, the Standards Board does not have the power to consider complaints against members of local authorities in Wales. Under the Act the Standards Board only has the power to issue guidance on the Code of Conduct to Welsh police authorities. It is the Public Service Ombudsman for Wales that considers complaints against members of local authorities in Wales, and you would need to contact him direct for any information you require.</p>
	<p pid="c.538W.0/10" class="indent">It is interesting to note that an increasing proportion of the complaints we receive are submitted by members of the public. 51 per cent. of the complaints we received in 2003-04 were from the public, rising to 60 per cent. in 2004-05 and rising further to 64 per cent. in 2005-06.</p>
	<p pid="c.538W.0/11" class="indent">I hope that this information is helpful. If you would like any further information please do not hesitate to contact me.</p>

	<p pid="c.540W.3/1">Since 2001, DFID has spent over &pound;390 million on reconstruction and development in Afghanistan. Afghanistan is DFID's fifth largest programme and we are the second largest bilateral donor, spending over &pound;100 million in 2005-06.</p>
	<p pid="c.540W.3/2">DFID has already increased aid for southern Afghanistan in 2006-07, by committing &pound;20 million to Helmand province, of which &pound;14 million has been spent so far.</p>
	<p pid="c.540W.3/3">This includes &pound;2 million of DFID money spent on quick impact projects (QIPs). Examples of what that funding has delivered include humanitarian assistance to IDPs and drought victims, permanent vehicle checkpoints to improve security, river bank walls reinforced and flood defences built.</p>
	<p pid="c.540W.3/4">It also includes &pound;11 million to the government of Afghanistan which is supporting agriculture and rural development (Helmand Agricultural and Rural Development Programme). The first tangible results will be seen in the next few weeks when the first of 200 wells will be dug in and around Lashkar Gah and construction of 49 km of roads begun.</p>
	<p pid="c.540W.3/5">DFID expect to spend at least &pound;50 million in Helmand over the next three years. Helmand gets more aid than any other province in the south of Afghanistan, according to government of Afghanistan figures. We are in discussion with donor partners on their plans for development assistance in the south of Afghanistan.</p>

	<p pid="c.541W.0/1">DFID country offices monitor how basket funding and budget support is spent to ensure that there is evidence it has been used for the purposes agreed with partner governments. An important aspect of country monitoring arrangements is ensuring adequate audit arrangements are in place.</p>
	<p pid="c.541W.0/2">Given the diverse nature of the countries in which DFID works and the different partners (both government and international) involved, the design of monitoring and audit arrangements varies considerably for both basket funds and budget support. The best figures we can provide are for funds disbursed in the 2005 budget year of the countries concerned.</p>
	<p pid="c.541W.0/3">DFID contributed to some 45 basket funds in 18 different countries in 2005 and delivered aid through poverty reduction budget support in 16 countries. In all these cases, DFID staff reviewed relevant financial information on how funds were used and participated in meetings with government and donor partners to discuss progress.</p>
	<p pid="c.541W.0/4">Around half of the basket funds were audited by the national audit institution and half by a specially appointed auditor. Poverty reduction budget support in 11 countries was audited by the national audit institution and in five, by a specially appointed auditor.</p>
	<p pid="c.541W.0/5">The nature of basket funding and budget support means that common agreements usually exist between government and donors on how funds will be used and the monitoring and auditing arrangements. Therefore there is no distinction between UK and lead donor arrangements.</p>
	<p pid="c.541W.0/6">There is no standardised definition of a basket fund. In order to respond to the question, we have defined it as having a common bank account into which at least two donors pool resources to support a government to implement an agreed sector programme or set of activities; and procedures relating to the operation of the bank account are additional to government's own procedures and are governed by an agreement between government and donors.</p>
	<p pid="c.541W.0/7">Nearly all national audit institutions are statutorily independent of the executive branch of government and in this sense are non-governmental auditors, although they are the auditors of government's expenditure. In many cases and particularly in regard to budget support, this is the form of independent audit carried out. This reply distinguishes between audit by the national audit institution and an audit carried out by a private sector auditor appointed outside normal national procedures to meet donor requirements.</p>

	<p pid="c.543W.5/1">The fund board, which consists of donor representatives and independent international experts, will select and approve grants, targeting those most at risk from HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria, particularly those with limited or no access to public health services. Over time, it is expected that the independent fund manager will take a greater role in selecting and approving grants, on the basis of policy and criteria set by the fund board.</p>

During the consultations for this we will seek a wide variety of views and ensure they are fed into our CAP planning. The Government of Pakistan have made progress in fighting poverty, but very real needs remain. One in 10 children die before their fifth birthday; around 8 million children do not go to school; approximately 50 per cent. of the adult population are illiterate, two thirds of whom are women; and some 38 million people were living below the official poverty line in 2005. It is likely that one of our priorities will be to increase our assistance to the education sector.</p>

We are also agreeing a set of indicators with the Government of Pakistan, to track progress towards the commitments made in the Development Partnership Arrangement. Individual programmes will continue to have indicators of outcomes that will, as at present, be monitored at least annually.</p>

	<p pid="c.546W.8/2">The recent review of the UK's energy policy confirmed the Government's view that security of supply is best ensured by a competitive and liberalised market-based system. Coupled with a light touch regulatory framework, this facilitates the short-term balancing of supply and demand, and provides the price signals and incentives to encourage investment for the longer term in diverse supplies. Two outcomes from the Energy Review address security of gas supply: DTI is working to streamline consent regimes for gas supply infrastructure projects, and is also consulting on possible ways to further improve the effectiveness of the current UK gas security of supply arrangements.</p>

While progress has been made in implementing the EU's 2003 liberalisation package, further steps are needed and I welcome the action the Commission is taking, both in conducting a sectoral inquiry of energy and in considering what other action may be necessary.</p>
	<p pid="c.547W.8/3">In the UK's response to the Commission energy Green Paper of March this year, we underlined a number of factors which we regard as key to the development of the market: ensuring sufficient information is available for all market players and consumers to benefit from fair competition; the need for regulators to have sufficient powers and independence to deliver competition, including across borders; investment in cross-border infrastructure; and effective unbundling to prevent discrimination against market entrants.</p>
	<p pid="c.547W.8/4">I look forward to the publication of the Commission's strategic energy review and the conclusions of the sectoral inquiry, both due to be published in January.</p>

	<p pid="c.560W.9/1">We are currently in the process of implementing our commitment to introduce targeted health screening for tuberculosis (TB) in high-risk countries at the entry clearance stage. In the six countries where we implemented the pre-entry TB screening programme last year on a pilot basis all those applying to come to the United Kingdom for over six months have been screened, using a protocol based on x-rays and sputum smears. From the commencement of pre-entry TB screening in October 2005 until the end of October 2006, 27,807 people were subject to TB screening. Of these, 14 were found to have infectious TB. Applicants with infectious TB are not considered for entry clearance until they have successfully completed a course of treatment.</p>

Until these pre-entry controls are in place Government policy is that all those entering the UK from these countries, and from other countries with a high incidence of TB not covered by the pre-entry screening programme, for over six months should be routinely referred for medical examination for TB.</p>

Approximately 100 of the people who were x-rayed in 2004-05 were subsequently found to have TB. Any person thought on the basis of the examination at the port to have TB is referred to the national health service, and those who are subsequently diagnosed with TB are offered treatment.</p>

	<p pid="c.563W.3/2" class="italic"> Letter from Dr. Malcolm McKibbin, dated <phrase class="date" code="2006-11-28">28 November 2006</phrase></p>
	<p pid="c.563W.3/3" class="indent">You recently asked the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland a Parliamentary Question regarding the timescale for the commencement of the improvement schemes at the junctions of (a) Dromore Road, Hillsborough with the Al dual carriageway and (b) Banbridge Road, Dromore with the Al dual carriageway. As this issue falls within my responsibility as Chief Executive of Roads Service, I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="c.563W.3/4" class="indent">By way of background, the proposals to upgrade the Dromore Road, Hillsborough and Banbridge Road, Dromore junctions with the Al dual carriageway are included within a Design Build Finance and Operate (DBFO) Package announced by the then Minister for Regional Development, Mr John Spellar MP on 21st March 2005.</p>
	<p pid="c.563W.3/5" class="indent">Roads Service is currently progressing the complex tendering process for the procurement of this package of road projects as a Public Private Partnership, and is working towards awarding the contract in Spring 2007.</p>
	<p pid="c.563W.3/6" class="indent">The phasing of the construction of individual schemes, within the overall DBFO package of schemes, is for the successful tenderer to determine. As the tendering process is not complete, Roads Service is at this stage unable to provide a definitive date for the commencement of each scheme. However, from the information that the tenderers have provided, Roads Service is hopeful that both schemes would commence in the 2007 / 2008 financial year.</p>

	<p pid="c.567W.0/1">The UK National Screening Committee has considered the case for bowel screening and recommended that a population programme should be introduced. I would wish to see such a programme introduced in Northern Ireland. However, before a programme could be implemented in Northern Ireland, detailed planning is required in order that the introduction of bowel screening does not adversely impact on services for those patients with symptomatic bowel disease. In addition, infrastructure development and capacity building is required so that the necessary resources, people and skills are in place to ensure a quality service.</p>
	<p pid="c.567W.0/2">In preparation of this, the workshop on bowel cancer held on <phrase class="date" code="2006-06-20">20 June</phrase> considered the current capacity and pressure on the symptomatic bowel service. It identified the need for expansion of endoscopy training and capacity, and the introduction of quality standards in line with those applied in England. My Department has allocated resources to support these developments and is currently working with the relevant health professionals to address these issues and thereby enhance the capacity of the symptomatic service.</p>
	<p pid="c.567W.0/3">A bowel cancer screening conference, jointly organised by Action Cancer and my Department, was held on <phrase class="date" code="2006-10-09">9 October 2006</phrase>. It provided learning from the experiences of introducing bowel cancer screening in England and Scotland, which will be taken into account for the introduction of bowel screening here. These and other initiatives will leave Northern Ireland in a much better position to introduce bowel cancer screening in 2009.</p>

	<p pid="c.567W.6/1">Analysis was undertaken in 2004 and 2005 regarding the introduction of a rural rate relief scheme for Northern Ireland to include support for rural post offices and shops. This analysis was directed at small properties below the (then) levels applicable in GB of &pound;6,000 net annual value and the cost was estimated at &pound;1.6 million. It was not possible to establish how much of this &pound;1.6 million was attributable to post offices because a significant number of them are categorised by the Valuation and Lands Agency as ordinary shops.</p>
	<p pid="c.567W.6/2">Preliminary results of the Equality Impact Assessment and New TSN analysis were unfavourable, with the high likelihood of adverse differential effects occurring at local level. Furthermore, the assessment concluded that such a measure would do little or nothing for rural shops in Northern Ireland. It was decided not to implement the rural rate relief scheme in Northern Ireland because the scheme which applies in the rest of the UK is based on designated rural areas which would be inappropriate for Northern Ireland's dispersed rural settlement pattern.</p>
	<p pid="c.567W.6/3">The case for providing small business rates relief will be re-examined during 2007 and this will include consideration of sub-post offices.</p>

The Co-ownership scheme, which has, since 1978, assisted almost 20,000 mainly first time buyers to become home owners, was amended earlier this year to make it more accessible for people on lower incomes while the starting threshold for stamp duty on property was increased to &pound;125,000. In addition an independent housing affordability review has been initiated. This will look at barriers affecting those seeking affordable housing in both owner occupied, social and private rented sectors and make recommendations as to how these might be overcome.

	<p pid="c.574W.2/1">The Central Services Agency (CSA) undertook part of the investigation into the performance of George Bruce Kelso on behalf of the Eastern Health and Social Services Board (EHSSB). Initially this involved analysis of Mr. Kelso's pattern of dental treatment and calling in patient record cards and radiographs. Following the decision of the police in 2002 to discontinue their investigation into Mr. Kelso, the CSA assisted the EHSSB by compiling all the available records, reports, correspondence, claims and radiographs into a single master file in electronic format. This was a substantial task which was performed to a high standard. This master file was submitted to the General Dental Council (GDC) in June 2004 by the EHSSB. The Chairman of the Professional Conduct Committee of the GDC, while passing judgment on Mr. Kelso, stated 'the standard of evidence from the CSA was clear and detailed'.</p>

The Department will shortly be issuing guidance to Health and Social Services Boards which will apply the lessons learnt from this case. The Department is also developing guidance for dealing with underperforming doctors and dentists and this should be available in the new year. In addition, legislative changes in 2007 will provide Health and Social Services Boards with increased powers of suspension for independent practitioners. Given the measures outlined above, I do not feel it is appropriate to conduct an independent review into this case.</p>

	<p pid="c.575W.8/1">There is a robust framework of checks in place for all health service dental practices. The Referral Dental Service based in the DHSSPS undertakes post treatment dental examinations on a random sample of health service claims. Health Boards undertake inspections of health service dental practices in their area to ensure compliance with health and safety and other regulatory requirements. The Central Services Agency (CSA) undertakes pre-treatment checks on proposed courses of treatment which are in excess of the prior approval limit (currently &pound;384). The CSA also generate practice profiles of all health service practices on a quarterly basis which outline individual practitioner's treatment prescribing patterns and bench mark these against local and regional averages. Since 2005, Health Boards have undertaken probity checks of a random sample of claims from all health service dentists. The practice at 14 The Square, Portaferry would have been included in those checks which were available during the years in which it operated health service dentistry (June 1995 to January 2001).</p>

	<p pid="c.576W.9/1">Departmental records indicate that the then Chief Dental Officer would have been aware of the concerns about Mr. Kelso in early 1999 following the findings from a series of post treatment examinations undertaken by the Referral Dental Service. Following this, in accordance with procedure, the case was referred to the Eastern Health and Social Services Board (EHSSB), in its role as commissioner of this practitioner, to further manage. The EHSSB then utilised the Referral Dental Service based at the Department to undertake targeted examinations of Mr Kelso's dental treatment.</p>

Over the next six months, the trust will carry out a process of closing a continuing care ward. This will allow improvements in the hospital environment for those remaining as inpatients. Relatives and carers will be involved in the closure process.</p>

This is in part due to the huge task of transferring the management of maintenance and replacement of all parking equipment in Northern Ireland to one central control point. The pay and display machines currently operating in Limavady Central car park are relatively old and are soon to be replaced. A computer monitoring system, linked to the new pay and display machines will enable faults to be detected as soon as they occur. It is hoped this improved system will reduce the time machines are out of order.</p>

	<p pid="c.584W.12/2" class="italic"> Letter from Dr. Malcolm McKibbin to Gregory Campbell, dated <phrase class="date" code="2006-11-28">28 November 2006</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="c.584W.12/3" class="indent">You recently asked the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland a Parliamentary Question regarding what measures are in place to promote safer travel for pupils attending rural schools in Northern Ireland.</p>
	<p pid="c.584W.12/4" class="indent">As this issue falls within my responsibility as Chief Executive of Roads Service. I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="c.584W.12/5" class="indent">You may be aware that Roads Service, in liaison with the Department of Education, is promoting a Safer Routes to Schools initiative, to encourage walking, cycling, greater use of public transport, and car sharing for the journey to and from school. One aspect of the project entails the introduction of traffic management measures outside schools, to create a safer local environment for children, in both urban and rural areas, to get to school. The programme is being taken forward in liaison with other statutory agencies, including the Department of the Environment's Road Safety Branch and the Health Promotion Agency.</p>
	<p pid="c.584W.12/6" class="indent">I should also explain that The Traffic Signs (Northern Ireland) Regulations 1997, permit road signs to be used in the vicinity of schools to warn drivers of the potential of encountering children in the road ahead, going to and from school. These signs are commonplace on our rural road network, particularly on busy roads and where speeds are high. The signs are often supplemented by flashing amber lights.</p>
	<p pid="c.584W.12/7" class="indent">In addition, Roads Service plan to introduce a programme of school safety zones to manage speeds specifically at rural schools where the current speed limit is 60mph. These zones will include prominent signs and road markings to draw motorists' attention to the possible presence of children at schools. Work has started on this project so that an additional 10 schools will have measures installed by the end of this current financial year and it is planned to complete work at a further 20 schools in the 2007-08 financial year. As part of this initiative, Roads Service is actively investigating the potential of introducing variable speed limits at rural schools.</p>
	<p pid="c.584W.12/8" class="indent">You may also be interested to know that Sustrans, the sustainable travel charity, has been offered a funding package from the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development Structural Fund valued at &pound;900,000 for the purpose of protecting and enhancing the physical environment of rural areas. Following preliminary discussions with Roads Service, it has been proposed that this funding should be directed at 18 rural schools to address Safer Routes to Schools and Speed Management issues, with financial input from other Agencies. Work on implementing this project is ongoing.</p>

Education and Library Boards in fact achieved savings of &pound;1.7 million in 2005-06.

Prior to that date the Russell Commission Implementation Team at the Home Office supported a capacity building small grants programme which provided Home Office funding to the amount of &pound;620,287 to 45 projects&mdash;21 organisations were awarded grants under the best practice strand and 24 under the developing strategies strand.</p>
	<p pid="c.595W.8/2">Of these 45 projects, 14 organisations received funding from both the Home Office sponsored small grants programme in 2005-06 and the first v grants round for programmes in 2006-07. The organisations received a total of &pound;154,681 in the 2005-06 one year grants round.</p>
	<p pid="c.595W.8/3">The same organisations then applied for further funding in the July 2006 v grants round. This grants round, the first provided by v, covers a three-year period and the organisations will receive just under &pound;2 million of funding over the three years, equivalent to 15 per cent. of the total for projects in this grants round.</p>
	<p pid="c.595W.8/4">These grants have provided 11,000 volunteering opportunities for young people in programmes across England. The opportunities allow the young people to volunteer in projects which give them new ways to engage with their local community, develop their confidence and skills and have fun while increasing employability.</p>

This excludes any consideration of the probability of 'climate catastrophes'. The Government are re-examining this, with the Stern Review on the economics of climate change informing our conclusions.</p>

	<p pid="c.600W.5/1">The European Commission has announced that it will publish the Solvency II directive in July 2007. The legislative proposal will then need to be adopted by the Council of Ministers and the European Parliament. The date of implementation of the directive will be subject to their agreement. It is not expected that implementation will be earlier than 2010 or 2011.</p>
	<p pid="c.600W.5/2">The amount of time required to reach agreement on the directive is uncertain and will depend on a range of factors. The UK Government is supportive of the Solvency II project and will therefore work with other EU member states to achieve agreement to the directive without undue delay. HM Treasury participates in regular meetings of the European Commission's Working Group on Insurance Solvency and meetings of the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Committee (EIOPC).</p>
	<p pid="c.600W.5/3">The Solvency II directive has not yet been adopted by the Council of Ministers and the European Parliament and therefore its effects on the limits and restrictions on the type of assets which may be held to cover capital requirements by insurance companies remain uncertain. The Government's views on this issue have been outlined in a joint discussion paper by HM Treasury and the Financial Services Authority: &quot;Solvency II: a new framework for prudential regulation of insurance in the EU&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="c.600W.5/4">HM Treasury and the Financial Services Authority are working together closely on the Solvency II project. HM Treasury and the FSA have jointly produced two discussion papers on Solvency II: &quot;Solvency II: a new framework for prudential regulation of insurance in the EU&quot; and &quot;Supervising insurance groups under Solvency II&quot;:</p>

	<p pid="c.600W.5/7">HM Treasury has received representations from insurance companies, the Association of British Insurers and the Association of Mutual Insurers in respect of the discussion papers. HM Treasury is in regular dialogue with stakeholders on Solvency II issues.</p>
	<p pid="c.600W.5/8">The Solvency II directive has not yet been adopted by the Council of Ministers and the European Parliament. At this stage it is not possible to determine accurately the costs and benefits of the directive. The Government's view is that the directive can generate significant economic benefits by deepening the EU Single Market in insurance services. The directive has support in principle from industry stakeholders including the Association of British Insurers (ABI).</p>
	<p pid="c.600W.5/9">The European Commission is required to publish an impact assessment of the Solvency II directive. HM Treasury will publish a partial Regulatory Impact Assessment in summer 2007 in order to assess the costs and benefits to the UK insurance industry and UK consumers.</p>

We provided support because we believed it was important to support a new administration determined to take tough decisions to tackle drugs, but it was the responsibility of the Afghan authorities to implement the programme and to make payments to farmers. Eradication in 2003-06 has not been compensated.</p>

As part of this, it agreed on the need for UN funding of the force. Once finalised, this financial arrangement should enable the AU to pay per diems to AMIS troops on a more regular basis.

	<p pid="c.609W.11/1">We have serious concerns about the continued use of the death penalty in Iran. According to international non-governmental organisations, in 2005 Iran was second only to China in terms of total number of executions carried out and Iran was the only country known to have executed those under the age of 18. We are particularly concerned that basic standards surrounding the application of capital punishment are absent in Iran and that death sentences are often carried out in public. The execution of minors is in clear contravention of Iran's obligations under the Convention on the Rights of the Child and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.</p>
	<p pid="c.609W.11/2">We make frequent representations to the Iranian authorities about the use of the death penalty. On <phrase class="date" code="2006-05-05">5 May</phrase>, the EU presidency in Tehran issued a statement expressing its</p>

	<p pid="c.609W.11/4">On <phrase class="date" code="2006-05-29">29 May</phrase>, the EU raised specific concerns about the use of the juvenile death penalty. On <phrase class="date" code="2006-11-20">20 November</phrase>, the EU presidency raised our concerns about the imminent execution of 10 men in Ahwaz, and reiterated the EU's longstanding objection to the .death penalty in all circumstances.</p>
	<p pid="c.609W.11/5">We also raise our concerns about the death penalty in international fora. On <phrase class="date" code="2006-10-18">18 October</phrase>, the EU presidency made a statement on human rights at the United Nations General Assembly Third Committee, which highlighted Iran as one of the few countries where minors are sentenced to death and executed. All EU member states sponsored a draft resolution on human rights in Iran at this year's UN General Assembly expressing serious concern at</p>

Some of these states, including Iran, have denied the allegations.

	<p pid="c.627W.2/1">The new Armed Forces Pension Scheme (AFPS 05) was broadly intended to be 'cost neutral' at the time of introduction in April 2005 in comparison with AFPS75. The main reasons for introducing the new scheme were to modernise the schemes benefits and at the same time ensure affordability in the future as factors such as increased longevity took affect.</p>
	<p pid="c.627W.2/2">The scheme's actuary is confident that there will be significant long term savings if a comparison is made between the emerging costs of the new scheme and the costs that would have resulted if we had continued exclusively with the old scheme.</p>
	<p pid="c.627W.2/3">The estimate is that the eventual long term savings will be in the region of &pound;120 million per year once the vast majority of personnel are active members of the new AFPS 05&mdash;in about 20 years time. An accurate net present value at this point in time could only be provided at disproportionate cost.</p>

	<p pid="c.630W.2/1">The Ministry of Defence assists Service personnel to purchase a house through Long Service Advance of Pay (LSAP). This is an interest free loan of up to &pound;8,500 or 182 days pay (whichever is the lesser) which can only be used for house purchase. The loan is usually repaid at about 10 per cent. per year, with any balance remaining on discharge being recovered from terminal benefits.</p>

This gives Service personnel based in London, the East and South East access to the New Build Home-buy scheme. This is a shared equity scheme where the Service person purchases a 25 per cent. minimum stake in the property and pays a low cost rent on the remainder. For personnel based in the remainder of England, a similar scheme known as the First-Time Buyers Initiative exists. This again is a shared equity scheme run by the regional housing boards. The minimum ownership stake in this scheme is 50 per cent. with the remainder again being paid as a low cost rent. In both cases, LSAP can be used as part of the owned stake in the property.</p>
	<p pid="c.630W.2/3">There are also several schemes provided by commercial enterprises to assist home ownership for Service personnel that have been developed in conjunction with MOD. These include shared ownership schemes, buy to let schemes, cash grants, mortgage advice, and discounts to Service personnel on former MOD managed properties.</p>
	<p pid="c.630W.2/4">Details of all the above schemes are available to Service personnel through the MOD's Joint Service Housing Advice Office. This is a full-time dedicated facility that was created to assist Service personnel by providing advice and guidance on the full range of accommodation options open to them when they leave the Services.</p>

	<p pid="c.630W.5/22">HQ LAND received no additional funding to enable the uplift of support staff for the restructuring and re-balancing of the TA as a result of Future Army Strategy (TA). Existing resources have been re-profiled to pay for these posts.</p>
	<p pid="c.630W.5/23">The decision was made to delay the implementation of TA rebalancing in certain Arms and Services, which meant that the recruitment of non-regular Permanent Staff and civilian staff for these units was not required as soon as was anticipated. The budget allocated by HQ to the recruitment of these posts has therefore been moved from 2006-07 to 2007-08.</p>

	<p pid="c.634W.2/1">Addressing underage drinking forms a key part of the Government's Alcohol Harm Reduction strategy. Four national alcohol misuse enforcement campaigns have been conducted over the past two years funded by the Home Office. Police and other authorities have been able to develop effective tactics in dealing with alcohol-related crime and disorder. This good practice is now being embedded in core policing business.</p>
	<p pid="c.634W.2/2">Through the Licensing Act 2003, we have increased the penalties on conviction for selling alcohol to minors from &pound;1,000 to a maximum &pound;5,000; and the court may suspend or revoke the offender's personal licence on first conviction and not on second or subsequent conviction as previously was the case. In addition, through the Violent Crime Reduction Act 2006, which received Royal Assent on the <phrase class="date" code="2006-11-08">8 November 2006</phrase>, we have created a new offence of persistently selling alcohol to children if, on three or more different occasions in a period of three consecutive months, alcohol is unlawfully sold on the same premises to a person under 18. The penalty for the new offence on summary conviction would be a fine not exceeding &pound;10,000 and, where the offender is a premises licence holder, the premises licence could be suspended for up to three months in so far as it authorises the sales by retail of alcohol.</p>
	<p pid="c.634W.2/3">The Home Office is working in partnership with alcohol retailers in seeking to eliminate sales to minors, with progress being measured through test purchasing. The majority of retailers have now adopted the &quot;Think 21&quot; approach whereby cashiers ask any customer who appears to be under 21 for identification when purchasing alcohol.</p>
	<p pid="c.634W.2/4">The Home Office supports the Proof of Age Standards Scheme (PASS) scheme, which establishes a common standard for issuing the various proof of age cards that are available. PASS accredited cards carry a secure hologram which helps retailers to identify genuine proof of age cards.</p>

	<p pid="c.634W.5/2">The Government's Alcohol Harm Reduction Strategy published in 2004 provides the most recent estimate of the costs of alcohol related crime and disorder. This estimated that the overall annual cost to England and Wales of crime and antisocial behaviour linked to alcohol misuse to be some &pound;7.3 billion. The Strategy set out the steps we would take to tackle the problems of alcohol misuse and seek to prevent any further increase in alcohol-related harms. We are committed to taking stock on delivering the recommendations in the Strategy in 2007.</p>

	<p pid="c.638W.5/1">Information is not available in the form requested. 'Mugging' is not a legal term and in terms of the recorded crime statistics such offences are generally recorded under the 'Robbery of personal property' classification. Offences recorded and detected in each Basic Command Unit in the Metropolitan Police area are given in table 1.</p>
	<p pid="c.638W.5/2">Court proceedings data does not distinguish between offences of robbery of personal or business property. Information taken from the Court Proceedings Database held by the Office for Criminal Justice Reform showing the number of defendants proceeded at magistrates courts and found guilty at all courts for robbery in Greater London, by court area, in 2003-05, is provided in table 2.</p>
	<p pid="c.638W.5/3">Since recorded crime deals with offences and court proceedings data is based on offenders, the two sets of data are not directly comparable.</p>

	<p pid="c.647W.0/1">The following table gives the costs, over the years 2002-03 to 2005-06, for the two key areas of National DNA Database (NDNAD) activity: NDNAD Services and Supplier Accreditation. NDNAD Services activity is concerned with the day to day operation of the NDNAD, for example loading DNA profiles, delivery of match reports, and handling of inquiries (principally from police forces and forensic suppliers). The costs also include maintenance of the NDNAD IT system as well as business support, including accommodation. Supplier Accreditation activity is concerned with the accreditation of the forensic supplier laboratories that analyse police DNA submissions, and thus supply DNA profiles to the NDNAD.</p>
	<p pid="c.647W.0/2">This accreditation involves scrutinising prospective new suppliers to the Database as well as continuous quality monitoring of existing suppliers. Data is not available for years before 2002-03, as in the past the costs of the NDNAD were tightly bound in with other costs incurred by the Forensic Science Service. The process of clearly drawing out these costs was fully resolved as part of the process of separating the NDNAD custodian from the FSS, which was completed in December 2005, when the FSS was vested as a Government owned company and the NDNAD transferred from the FSS to the Home Office. These figures do not include payments made to police forces under the DNA expansion programme which ran from 2000 to 2005, to enable them to retrieve more samples from scenes of crime and to take samples from more individuals.</p>

These events will include topics such as financial and resource management, performance management, public promotion of probation, public protection, budget management, etc. A major theme will be the transition from board to trust status and how probation will operate in this new environment. Chief officers who are ex-officio members of boards are the accountable officers in terms of budgets and also have responsibility for all operational matters including public protection. The new board chairs have a key ambassadorial role for their board and this will be developed in the programme outlined above.</p>

	<p pid="c.652W.5/1">Police powers to arrange for the removal or recovery of vehicles are provided for by Section 99 of the Road Traffic Regulation Act 1984 and associated regulations The regulations also set the charges which the police can levy for removals which they order. A vehicle has to be released once the prescribed charge has been paid.</p>
	<p pid="c.652W.5/2">The removal and recovery of vehicles including heavy vehicles such as lorries is an important routine activity for all police forces. They normally use contracted recovery operators to act on their behalf. Police contracts require operators to provide a guaranteed speedy response, to have specialist equipment, secure storage facilities and an efficient administration department. The detailed arrangements between individual police forces and vehicle recovery operators is a contractual matter between the parties involved.</p>

	<p pid="c.652W.8/1">Research and police intelligence on the scale and nature of trafficking in human beings suggests that there has been an increase in the trafficking problem over the last two or three years, however it remains difficult to make an accurate assessment of the scale of the problem. The majority of our knowledge regarding the situation in the UK centres on trafficking for sexual exploitation.</p>
	<p pid="c.652W.8/2">The majority of trafficked victims originate from eastern Europe and the Balkans, or from the far east (China and Thailand). Recently the UK has seen a growing trend in victims of trafficking for sexual exploitation being brought to the UK from within the EU, in particular from Lithuania. Although violence and force are often encountered in trafficking cases, evidence suggests that in the initial stages the vast majority of victims who are brought to the UK are not actually kidnapped or forced into moving here, but instead are recruited by deception. The personal freedom of the trafficked victim is severely limited and they are often controlled through the removal of their documentation, unrealistic debt-bonds, threats of violence against them or their families and in the worst cases actual physical, sexual and/or emotional abuse.</p>

	<p pid="c.656W.2/2">The ill-health pension under the Police Pension Scheme 1987, to which most officers belong, is based on the pension rights the officer has accrued up to retirement, but where the officer has at least five years' pensionable service the pension will be enhanced to compensate at least in part for the additional service he or she was unable to go on to complete.</p>
	<p pid="c.656W.2/3">The Police Pension Scheme 2006, which applies to those who have joined the police service on or after <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-06">6 April</phrase> this year, provides two levels of ill-health pension: a standard ill-health pension which is not enhanced and is payable to those who are permanently disabled for the ordinary duties of a member of the force but who can undertake other regular employment, and an enhanced top-up pension, which is payable in addition to the standard pension where the officer is also assessed as permanently disabled for all regular employment.</p>
	<p pid="c.656W.2/4">Information about the rate of ill-health retirement for police officers is not available in the form requested for all the years that the hon. Member has asked for. A table follows with information from 1990-91 to 2004-05. From 2001-02 the rate of ill-health retirement has not been recorded as a percentage of the number of retirements but as a proportion of the number of officers in service, expressed in terms of ill-health retirements per 1,000 officers. This is a more stable measure since the number of ordinary retirements is liable to change from year to year. The figures show a very clear downward trend which started in the mid 1990s&mdash;from 2,587 ill-health retirements in 1994-95 to 405 in 2004-05. The rate of reduction has been given added impetus following the Police Negotiating Board Agreement of 2002 which resulted in the issue of joint guidance to forces in 2003 on the better management of ill-health. The effective management of ill-health continues to be a priority for the police service. Improvements in sickness management and rehabilitation and better incentives for making appropriate use of ill health retirement (e.g. by introducing more than one tier of ill-health benefits) have been a key part of public service reform.</p>

	<p pid="c.657W.2/1">We are unable to give exact numbers of cold cases that are currently under examination by the police. However since February 2004, the Police Standards Unit in the Home Office has been working closely with police forces assisting with the forensic review of undetected serious sexual assaults and rapes from the late eighties through to the late nineties, by applying the latest scientific technology to historic forensic samples and submitting the results to the police forces concerned. To date, this national programme of work&mdash;Operation Advance&mdash;has involved the review of 9615 forensic case files, of which 1387 were suitable for forensic review and 395 were identified as suitable for reinvestigation by the police forces concerned. Operation Advance is an ongoing programme of work; the work has already resulted in the conviction of 22 offenders and with more awaiting trial. This work and the good practice and practical advice generated as a result have been seen by many police forces as a catalyst to create their own cold case review teams and we are confident that as many as 17 police forces have already done so and as a result are reviewing their own historic as yet unsolved cases of rape and serious sexual assault and in most cases homicide. The Home Office are committed to promoting the value of cold case reviews not least because this work is all about victims&mdash;it is about bringing justice, relief, 'closure' and freedom from fear to victims of the most horrendous crimes, often after many years. The vast majority of the offenders identified and convicted in this work have proved to be persistent, prolific and dangerous criminals with criminal convictions stretching back many years. Bringing these individuals to justice has undoubtedly prevented them from committing many more crimes in the future.</p>

	<p pid="c.674W.11/1">If an unaccompanied child makes an application for asylum or humanitarian protection in the UK the asylum caseworker will assess whether there is a real risk of either persecution for a 1951 Refugee Convention reason or of serious harm in the country of return. If their applications for asylum and humanitarian protection are refused children will only be returned where safe and adequate reception arrangements exist and an assessment of each case has been carried out. We will always give proper regard to a child's welfare in performing immigration functions. We are currently reviewing our policy on the return of unaccompanied asylum seeking children whose applications have been refused. In formulating our policy we will continue to consult non-governmental organisations.</p>
