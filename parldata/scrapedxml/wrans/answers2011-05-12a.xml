	<p pid="a.1291W.3/1">English Heritage has made every effort to minimise the effects of the reduction in its budget for 2011-12 on its support for archaeology and associated activities. It has done this by protecting, so far as possible, its advisory services to local authorities, and its listing, scheduling and other designation activities. In addition, it has carried out a root and branch re-organisation of its processes for prioritising resources to understand and protect heritage, and has maintained the National Heritage Commissions Programme, through which it supports the work of others, at the highest possible level.</p>

The figures do not include the contracts further down the supply chain, in tiers two, three and so on, which are awarded by the tier one contractors and not by the ODA. The ODA estimates that tens of thousands more contracts will be generated throughout its supply chains.

	<p pid="a.1296W.7/1">The table shows how much aid the UK has provided to the Palestinian people over the last three years through our imputed share of European Union (EU) aid spending in the Occupied Palestinian Territories (OPTs); through UN agencies such as the UN Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA), World Food Programme and UN Mines Action Services; and through bilateral programming which includes both financial assistance to the Palestinian Authority (PA) and various projects across the OPTs,</p>
	<p pid="a.1296W.7/2">Our support to Palestinian refugees is provided through UNRWA and helps provide basic services, such as education, health care and social services, to Palestinian refugees across the OPTs, Jordan, Syria and Lebanon. The figure for UK support to refugees through the EU is estimated from the proportion of EU support to UNRWA relative to its total support to the OPTs.</p>
	<p pid="a.1296W.7/3">It is not possible fully to disaggregate UK aid to Gaza and to the West Bank. For example, our financial assistance to the Palestinian Authority (PA), via a World Bank Trust Fund, helps pay for basic services and salaries of public sector workers in both Gaza and the West Bank. The table disaggregates Gaza-specific assistance (such as support for humanitarian and early recovery activity) where it is possible to do so. EU assistance to the OPTs is similarly provided via a variety of instruments, and from the information available it is not possible to disaggregate between Gaza and the West Bank.</p>

	<p pid="a.1299W.9/1">In 1999 the Highways Agency prepared a list of locations on the motorway and trunk road network in England most seriously affected by noise. The list was published on <phrase class="date" code="1999-11-11">11 November 1999</phrase>, <phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/1999-11-11.681"><i>Official Report</i>, columns 681-83W</phrase>. No locations on the M5 in Worcestershire were identified.</p>
	<p pid="a.1299W.9/2">The management of noise issues is currently being reviewed as a result of the European environmental noise directive, introduced into UK legislation in October 2006 through the environmental noise regulations. The lead Department for this is the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA). The regulations require strategic noise maps and action plans to be prepared for urban areas and major roads, railways and airports. The mapping and action plan process is being undertaken on a five year cycle.</p>
	<p pid="a.1299W.9/3">DEFRA published noise maps for England's roads on <phrase class="date" code="2008-05-16">16 May 2008</phrase> and the corresponding noise action plans were formally adopted by the Secretary of State for DEFRA on <phrase class="date" code="2010-03-15">15 March 2010</phrase>. The action plans set out a framework for managing noise rather than propose specific mitigation measures. They have been designed to identify &#8216;Important Areas&#8217; that are impacted by noise from major sources and therefore must be investigated. The action plans also require those &#8216;Important Areas&#8217; that contain &#8216;First Priority Locations&#8217; to be investigated as a priority.</p>
	<p pid="a.1299W.9/4">DEFRA is producing maps of Important Areas, identifying those which include First Priority Locations and those which do not. The Highways Agency will examine these locations over the coming years, taking into account current Government policy on noise mitigation and available funding.</p>
	<p pid="a.1299W.9/5">There are 10 First Priority Locations in Worcestershire: three between Junctions 4 and 4a, three between Junctions 4a and 5, one between Junctions 5 and 6, two between Junctions 6 and 7 and one between Junctions 7 and 8.</p>
	<p pid="a.1299W.9/6">In the present economic climate, the Highways Agency is not able to take action for noise mitigation reasons alone but, whenever resurfacing of its network becomes due as part of the normal maintenance cycle, a material with quiet noise properties is used.

These arrangements are considered sufficient to mitigate any road safety risks that may be associated with the use of these 175 vehicles.</p>

It is assumed that all staff who are not in the 'NHS Infrastructure Support' staff group have some contact with patients or the public. <i>Data Quality:</i> The NHS Information Centre for health and social care seeks to minimise inaccuracies and the effect of missing and invalid data but responsibility for data accuracy lies with the organisations providing the data. Methods are continually being updated to improve data quality where changes impact on figures already published. This is assessed but unless it is significant at national level figures are not changed. Impact at detailed or local level is footnoted in relevant analyses. <i>Source:</i> The NHS Information Centre Non-Medical Workforce Census.</td> </tr>

	<p pid="a.1306W.11/1">In 2009-10, the latest year for which figures are available, the national health service spent approximately &#163;37 billion with external suppliers on the procurement of goods and services, of which &#163;16.5 billion is spent by NHS providers (NHS trusts and NHS foundation trusts). This &#163;16.5 billion comprises a number of different expenditure categories such as drugs, non-clinical supplies and services, transport and establishment, all of which may include elements of medical supplies and equipment, but the category &#8220;clinical supplies and services&#8221; will cover most of the purely medical supplies and associated equipment purchased by NHS providers. Expenditure in this particular category for 2009-10 was &#163;4.5 billion.</p>
	<p pid="a.1306W.11/2">In future years NHS providers will continue to be free to make their own procurement decisions from within their own budgets. However, efficiencies across the NHS in the region of &#163;15-20 billion by the end of 2013-14 are required under the Quality, Innovation, Productivity and Prevention initiative which includes projected efficiency savings of &#163;1.2 billion from procurement by the end of 2013-14. To achieve this the Department has a comprehensive procurement strategy in place based around three key work strands of greater transparency on pricing; promoting and improving the national collaborative bodies such as NHS Supply Chain; and product standardisation and rationalisation.</p>
	<p pid="a.1306W.11/3">The National Audit Office published a report on its review of procurement by NHS providers in February 2011. The Department agreed with most of their recommendations, and which are already being addressed by these work strands.</p>
	<p pid="a.1306W.11/4">The Department does not make assessments of individual NHS contracts. The role of the Department is on making the tools and information available for the NHS to make the best procurement decisions. All NHS bodies must follow their Standing Financial Instructions to ensure that any contracts entered into are value for money and comply with any legal requirements.</p>

	<p pid="a.1308W.6/2">In September 2010 I launched a new sector led support and challenge programme for children's homes. The aim of this programme is to support the sector itself in developing and sharing evidence of effective practice so that children and young people in children's homes receive the best possible care.</p>
	<p pid="a.1308W.6/3">A range of activities is now under way, in close collaboration with local authorities, independent children's homes providers, Ofsted and leading researchers in the field. These include analysing data about children's homes, working with areas which have high concentrations of children's homes to identify features of good and poor practice and commissioning research about the characteristics and needs of the workforce in children's homes. The Department for Education is working closely with partners in the sector to make sure that the learning from this work is shared as widely as possible to support service improvement.</p>
	<p pid="a.1308W.6/4">Revised and streamlined regulations, guidance and National Minimum Standards for children's homes came into effect in April 2011. These emphasise the importance of delegating decision making as much and as clearly as possible to children's homes staff, so that they are able to offer children the personal support they need.</p>

Professor Munro's recommendations are wide-ranging and look at how to re-focus the child protection system on meeting the needs of the child, rather than complying with prescriptive rules and targets.</p>
	<p pid="a.1309W.0/2">I welcome Professor Munro's thorough analysis of the issues. It is important that we consider carefully, with professionals themselves, how best to respond to her proposals to bring about the radical, long-term reform needed. I have therefore announced that an implementation working group drawing together key individuals from the social work profession, local government, health, police, education and the voluntary sector will be formed. The Government will work closely with this group to develop a full response to Professor Munro's recommendations before the summer recess.</p>

	<p pid="a.1311W.9/1">We have had no discussions with banks on the provision of bank accounts for 16-year-olds who are to receive bursaries. Arrangements for young people to open bank accounts were discussed at the time of the introduction of the education maintenance allowance and are unchanged by the announcement of the 16-19 Bursary Fund. Young people aged 16 are able to open a basic bank account, which is offered by 16 members of the British Bankers Association. This account will allow for receipt of the bursary, including by cashless means, and will allow funds to be withdrawn via ATMs as well as via standing orders and direct debits where necessary. In the summer of 2011 the Money Advice Service will be publishing an interactive tool on their website which will allow young people to find out the forms of identification that are accepted by each bank offering the basic bank account.</p>

	<p pid="a.1327W.6/1">To monitor the situation in Eastern Congo, we work with non-governmental organisations and other local and international civil society groups, as well as the UN peacekeeping mission to the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), which is an important tool in monitoring human rights abuses. The UK also supports the work of Margot Wallstr&#246;m, the UN Special Representative on Sexual Violence in Conflict.</p>
	<p pid="a.1327W.6/2">Women continue to face extremely high levels of sexual and gender-based violence in DRC. We have consistently lobbied the DRC Government, both bilaterally and with our EU partners, to implement necessary reforms and tackle impunity. Our ambassador to DRC takes every appropriate opportunity to raise the issue of sexual violence against women with the DRC authorities. I visited the DRC in July of last year, and raised concerns about human rights with various DRC Government Ministers. I stressed that the DRC's human rights record must improve. I met Foreign Minister Thambwe and urged the Government of DRC to implement fully President Kabila's &#8220;Zero Tolerance&#8221; policy on perpetrators of sexual violence. In February I also welcomed the conviction of the senior commander, Lt. Col. Mutuare Daniel Kibibi, and eight other soldiers for their role in the mass rape in the town of Fizi, eastern DRC.</p>

This sets out our planned work for the coming year, and seeks to address the problem at all levels, including through security and programmes to support women in DRC. The document is available on the Foreign and Commonwealth Office website, as is &#8216;Human Rights and Democracy: The 2010 Foreign and Commonwealth Office Report&#8217;, in which DRC features as a country of concern:</p>

The question has been interpreted as asking for the volumes of crisis loan awards for alignment purposes as interim payments are different and do not come under the Social Fund remit. 4. The proportion of all crisis loan funding which was for alignment purposes is different to the proportion of awards because of the different award amounts given for different crisis loan applications. Awards for alignment purposes tend to be lower than those for other crisis loan awards. 5. Crisis loans for alignment purposes can be awarded prior to a new benefit claim or to the applicants first wage.

	<p pid="a.1332W.0/2">This assessment was prepared for the UK Government by the Health and Safety Commission and the Health and Safety Executive (HSE). It is available on the HSE website at:</p>
	<p pid="a.1332W.0/3"><a href="http://www.hse.gov.uk/aboutus/meetings/hscarchive/2007/060207/c20.pdf">http://www.hse.gov.uk/aboutus/meetings/hscarchive/2007/060207/c20.pdf</a></p>
	<p pid="a.1332W.0/4">The assessment concluded that while it was too early to assess the effect of the implementing regulations on occupational health and safety, as even if enough time had elapsed for potentially significant improvements to occur, it would be challenging to differentiate between the effects of the regulations, effects of other initiatives, e.g. targeted inspector activity, and background trends in improving health and safety.</p>
	<p pid="a.1332W.0/5">The UK will be required to undertake the next assessment of the implementation of the chemical agents directive later this year and HSE is currently considering the most appropriate way to do this.</p>

	<p pid="a.1335W.5/1">Representations have been received from both Shelter and Crisis on the direct payment of housing benefit for tenants in the private rented sector. Both Crisis and Shelter have stated that the reintroduction of tenant choice in deciding whether payments should be made to landlords would encourage landlords to stay in the housing benefit market. Shelter based their recommendation on a survey of claimants and a poll of landlords and they made these points in their response to the housing benefit reforms announced in the June 2010 Budget.</p>
	<p pid="a.1335W.5/2">Both organisations have also submitted responses to the Work and Pensions Select Committee and the Social Security Advisory Committee which highlighted this area.</p>

This work concluded that the existing legislative framework, established under the Health and Safety at Work etc Act 1974, is sufficient to manage the hazards associated with emerging energy technologies and did not identify a current need to extend the permissioning regime adopted in the offshore oil and gas sector to offshore wind development. HSE is supplementing this approach by working with industry to encourage the spread of relevant good practice developed by existing offshore industries into new energy sectors. The Government will continue to monitor the application of health and safety legislation to all areas of emerging energy to ensure that hazards are managed and controlled effectively.</p>

	<p pid="a.1338W.2/2">It is, however, important to the Government's approach that the personal independence payment assessment looks at disabled people as individuals and does not just label them by their health condition or impairment. That's why it is being designed to consider an individual's personal circumstances and the support they need, rather than basing eligibility on a specific medical condition.</p>
	<p pid="a.1338W.2/3">The new assessment better reflects our understanding of disability in the 21st century and will take account of physical, sensory, mental, intellectual and cognitive impairments. This will ensure that support is targeted on those disabled people whose impairments have the greatest impact on their ability to live independent lives. We will continue to work with disabled people and their organisations as the detail of the assessment criteria and its operation is developed and tested. We had many helpful responses to our public consultation from individuals with fibromyalgia and fibromyalgia support groups in Tonbridge, Eastbourne and Surrey and Sussex, and hope to continue to work with a broad range of groups going forwards.</p>

This Government believe all Departments, including non-departmental public bodies, need to show restraint in the current economic climate and that bonus payments need to better reflect the financial situation, the Government and the NDPB concerned. The Department, therefore, requested that Remploy apply the Government's bonus cap. A recent employment tribunal found that the previous administration's remuneration settlement in respect of commission payments had to be paid for contractual reasons.</p>

	<p pid="a.1340W.2/1">By April 2016, women's state pension age will have risen to 63 under the timetable legislated in 1995. The UK, like all other EU member states, is under an obligation to remove gender inequalities currently present in state pension ages.</p>
	<p pid="a.1340W.2/2">Directive 79/7 prohibits gender discrimination in social security, including state pensions. The directive allows the setting of state pension age to be a limited exception but this should be done in accordance with the principle that member states may only temporarily allow women to retire earlier than men, in order to allow member states to change gradually their pension systems so that equalisation is achieved.</p>
	<p pid="a.1340W.2/3">It has therefore been decided to equalise women's state pension age with men's state pension age before the increase to 66 can take place. This is why our proposed changes begin earlier for women than men.</p>

Non-continuation considers students who start in a given academic year and identifies whether they are still in higher education one year later, for full-time students, or two years later, for part-time students. Non-completion refers to projected outcomes over a longer period based on the current pattern of students' behaviour.

	<p pid="a.1351W.0/1">Of the four proposals currently in front of the World Intellectual Property Organisation (WIPO), two are for legally-binding treaties, and two are for non-binding recommendations to WIPO member states. No single document has so far gained consensus from all WIPO members. The European Union leads negotiations at WIPO on behalf of its member states, including the UK, and supports a non-binding approach. The UK is receptive to any reasonable way forward that will make a real difference to the lives of visually impaired people.</p>
