	<p pid="b.944W.6/1">Work associated with the appeal against the Information Commissioner's decision in favour of disclosure of the 2004 staff directory for the Defence Export Services Organisation (DESO) is being carried out by staff from a number of areas within the Ministry of Defence. The majority of the effort rests with the directorate which leads on policy issues relating to operation of the Freedom of Information Act 2000, but staff within DESO itself, from the directorate of legal services and the security directorate are also involved. This work is a normal part of the function and responsibilities of these staff, and it is not possible to attribute costs specifically relating to this appeal. Senior Counsel for the Ministry of Defence in this case is Mr. Jonathan Crow QC, who is supported by Ms Kate Gallafent. Further support is being provided by a solicitor in the Treasury Solicitor's Department. Information on the fees paid to Counsel in relation to this case is not recorded separately by the Department and it will take time to collate. I will write to the hon. Member when the figures are available.</p>
	<p pid="b.944W.6/2">The March 2004 edition of the DESO staff directory was widely circulated to the UK defence industry, to which nearly 2,000 copies were distributed. This edition, which did not carry a security classification, was distributed with no express restrictions on further circulation, unlike the most recent editions.</p>

	<p pid="b.946W.5/1">Decompression is a process designed to place individuals into a formal, structured and monitored environment in which to begin 'winding-down' and rehabilitating to a normal, routine, peace-time environment. Decompression is a discretionary activity conducted on a &quot;needs&quot; basis as judged by the in-theatre commander. It is conducted in-theatre, or at a location between theatre and the home base, and allows individuals time to begin rationalising their operational experiences in the company of their immediate comrades.</p>
	<p pid="b.946W.5/2">The unit chain of command will use this time to monitor and identify, based on the tempo of operations and knowledge of the soldiers concerned, those apparently most vulnerable to any form of post-operational stress, or stress related condition. Engagement with unit medical staff will be most important and a two-way passage of information between the chain of command and medical chain will be critical.</p>
	<p pid="b.946W.5/3">The policy is defined in a Permanent Joint Headquarters Deployed Operating Instruction and applies to all service personnel serving on PJHQ-commanded operations, whether regular or reserve. Currently, decompression for units returning from both Iraq and Afghanistan have been taking place in Cyprus, lasting for a period of between 36-48 hours, and involving significant numbers of the deployed force.</p>
	<p pid="b.946W.5/4">Reservists who are part of a formed unit will decompress with that unit. Those that are not considered to require to undergo decompression, they will receive briefings as part of the demobilisation package at either RTMC Chilwell (for Army and Royal Marine Reserves); HMS Nelson (for Royal Navy Reserves), or at their individual squadron (for RAF Reserves). The demobilisation process will include post-operation administration; a medical assessment; and further briefings on stress, the return to work and family, plus aftercare and welfare. This demobilisation period allows further social reintegration and observation, and is also the point where communications between the service and the individual (and their employer) is established. Thereafter, monitoring will take place through the chain of command of their parent reservist unit. The Royal Centre for Defence Medicine (RCDM) provides the same service for all personnel aeromedically evacuated from operations.</p>

A lessons learned exercise has also been undertaken and the improvements identified from this process have been implemented within the second, and final, tranche of the DEFRA mapping exercise (which is due for completion by the end of February).

	<p pid="b.948W.5/1">The Government believe that the third phase of the Energy Efficiency Commitment (EEC3) after 2008 could deliver savings of approximately 0.9 to 1.2 million tonnes of carbon (MtC) by 2010.</p>
	<p pid="b.948W.5/2">Discussions with stakeholders during 2006 have helped the Government to develop proposals for EEC3. An initial consultation took place between <phrase class="date" code="2007-07-31">31 July</phrase> and <phrase class="date" code="2006-10-23">23 October 2006</phrase>, and a summary of responses was published on <phrase class="date" code="2007-01-12">12 January 2007</phrase>. This exercise sought early views, which have helped to inform the statutory consultation we are launching in the spring.</p>
	<p pid="b.948W.5/3">Warm Front remains the Government's key programme for tackling fuel poverty in the private sector in England. 1.2 million vulnerable households have already been provided with assistance since 2000, and the scheme will continue to build on this progress. Warm Front is projected to deliver 0.5 MtC of carbon savings by 2010 through domestic energy efficiency improvements.</p>

	<p pid="b.949W.6/1">DEFRA supports a range of projects with the aim of increasing understanding of the environment in the education sector. The climate change champions competition was launched in January 2006 and nine champions have now been chosen; one from each region in England. During their term of office, they are spreading the message about climate change, and the role that young people can play in tackling it, throughout their respective regions.</p>
	<p pid="b.949W.6/2">The champions initiative is part of the larger climate change communications initiative (CCCI). Through the CCCI, 83 projects have been funded by the climate challenge fund, and 16 of these are aimed at young people. The Department for Education and Skills (DfES) has invited representatives from all the education-related climate challenge fund projects to a meeting. This will ensure that activities are as joined up as possible.</p>
	<p pid="b.949W.6/3">On <phrase class="date" code="2007-02-02">2 February</phrase>, the Secretary of State and the Education Secretary announced that Al Gore's film &quot;An Inconvenient Truth&quot; will form part of a climate change pack sent to secondary schools in England. DEFRA will be part of a sustainable schools year of action to support all schools in becoming models of sustainable best practice. Support materials will include teacher resource packs, a pupil &quot;detective kit&quot;, guidance for bursars and governors, and a new teaching award.</p>
	<p pid="b.949W.6/4">DEFRA is an active partner in the year of food and farming, a joint initiative with DfES, which will start this September for the 2007-08 school year. This initiative aims to educate children and young people about the origins of the food they eat and how it is produced. DEFRA is also a signatory to the learning outside the classroom manifesto, launched by DfES in November 2006.</p>
	<p pid="b.949W.6/5">Currently, there are approximately 1,000 farms in England providing educational access visits under agri-environment schemes (environmental stewardship and countryside stewardship). Farmers receive payments for opening their farms, free of charge, to schools for curricular studies and colleges and other special interest groups for formal or informal study. A wide range of organisations are involved in school visits to farms. However, DEFRA is the biggest single provider of visits, which offer ideal opportunities during the year of food and farming.</p>
	<p pid="b.949W.6/6">In addition, the waste and resources action programme (WRAP) runs the Recycle Now schools programme on behalf of DEFRA. This involves the &quot;Recycler&quot; robot, which can encourage primary school children to recycle from a young age and to take the recycling message home. The programme is also looking to develop resources that secondary schools can use.</p>
	<p pid="b.949W.6/7">The eco-schools programme provides a framework to enable schools to analyse their operations and become more sustainable. It promotes environmental awareness in a way that links to many curriculum subjects, including citizenship, personal and social and health education, and education for sustainable development. Eco-schools examine all their activities and implement ways of reducing their environmental impact; including litter, waste, energy, water, school grounds, healthy living, biodiversity and global perspectives.</p>

However, the majority of hunts have continued to operate within the law. Therefore, there has been no discernable adverse effect on rural employment, which remains above the national average, or on the rural economy as a whole. In addition, DEFRA has no evidence to suggest that there has been a significant change in the national fox population as a result of the Act, nor that the overall numbers of sheep being taken by foxes has increased substantially since it was introduced.</p>

	<p pid="b.957W.5/1">Phase 2 of the independent sector treatment centre (ISTC) programme was announced in May 2005. Any company interested in the programme was free to register an expression of interest, and complete a pre-qualifying questionnaire (PQQ), issued in late August 2005. Following this process, bidders were short-listed and issued with an invitation to tender (ITT). Bids were then returned for the Essex electives scheme.</p>

Subsequent policy documents have set out the reform programme clearly.</p>

A series of local meetings are ongoing between the Department, the preferred bidder on the Essex ISTC scheme (Mercury Health) and the local national health service, including the establishment of steering groups which will enable PCTs, as commissioners of local services, to engage with other relevant stakeholders on the proposed plans for the Essex ISTCs.</p>

The 2006-07 and 2007-08 revenue allocations separately identify funding to support the initiatives set out in the White Paper, &quot;Choosing Health: making healthy choices easier&quot;, such as sexual health modernisation and Chlamydia screening.

Rather we are interested in the real outcomes from local investment, and this is why we have introduced sexual health into the local delivery planning process and have now identified this area as a key priority. This will enable us to see where real improvements are being delivered in areas such as waiting times and rates of infections.</p>

	<p pid="b.961W.0/2">I understand that there are disputes between the Christian Union and the students' union in a very few universities; that the issues in dispute vary; and that they do not involve other Christian groups on campus. For these reasons, I do not believe that these very few cases represent deliberate or general discrimination against Christians.</p>
	<p pid="b.961W.0/3">Because there are different issues in each case it is important that these disputes are settled locally. I understand that the Christian think tank Ekklesia has studied these disputes and in its report has recommended internal mediation (for example through university chaplaincies) as a way forward. I think this is a helpful suggestion and is preferable to going to law.</p>
	<p pid="b.961W.0/4">We believe that legitimate faith groups on campus should be affiliated with the students' union provided that they are operating within the law and the students' union framework. Students' unions should be inclusive.</p>
	<p pid="b.961W.0/5">The Education Act 1994 requires university governing bodies to take such steps as are reasonably practicable to ensure the student union operates in a fair and democratic manner. I would expect them to do so in these cases or any others. It is important that universities maintain and support freedom of speech within the law.</p>

	<p pid="b.976W.9/1">Since July 2005 the UK has played an important role in promoting regional economic co-operation between Afghanistan and its neighbours. Under the G8 presidency the UK was instrumental in initiating the first Regional Economic Co-operation Conference (RECC) in Kabul in December 2005 aimed at developing economic ties and trade between Afghanistan and its neighbours. The event represented an important milestone in Afghanistan's progress towards greater regional economic integration. I had the pleasure of co-chairing proceedings alongside the then Afghan Foreign Minister Dr. Abdullah Abdullah. The UK was also a full participant in the second RECC hosted by India in November 2006 where I again represented the UK.</p>
