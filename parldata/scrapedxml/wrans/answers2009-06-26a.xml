Friend the then Chancellor of the Exchequer's statement on the five tests assessment in June 2003. In principle, the Government are in favour of UK membership; in practice the economic conditions must be right. The determining factor is the national economic interests and whether, on the basis of an assessment of the five economic tests, the economic case for joining is clear and unambiguous. Euro Ministers are responsible for Euro preparations in their Department and attend Euro Ministers Steering Group meetings as necessary. However, meetings are held only when necessary to discuss practical preparations to ensure that a smooth changeover would occur if and when the five tests had been met.</p>

The training, delivered on a part-time or full-time basis, will support people in progressing towards a full qualification.

	<p pid="a.1157W.4/5" class="indent">The Academic Department of Military Emergency Medicine (ADMEM) at the Royal Centre for Defence Medicine, Birmingham, has recently begun to collate amputation statistics on a quarterly basis. Their records show that, between <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-01">1 April 2006</phrase> and 31 march 2009, a total of 51 UK Service personnel have suffered amputations due to injuries sustained while on operation deployment on OP HERRICK. These amputations can range from the loss of part of a finger or toe up to the loss of entire limb(s). There is no consolidated record of the number or nature of the amputations for each patient and that information could only be collated at disproportional cost.</p>
	<p pid="a.1157W.4/6" class="indent">Prior to <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-01">1 April 2006</phrase>, comprehensive records were not held centrally and historic date could only be obtained at disproportionate cost.</p>

	<p pid="a.1162W.11/1">Having considered various options, on <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-01">1 March 2006</phrase>, the Secretary of State for Transport announced that the best way of delivering continuing value for money for the taxpayer in relation to the Channel Tunnel Rail Link (since renamed High Speed 1) would be for there to be an open, transparent and competitive process. The Government are currently engaged in a restructuring of London and Continental Railways. Following this, it is the Government's intention, as market conditions allow, to sell, via an open and competitive auction, a long-term concession for High Speed 1 in such a way as to maximise value for money for the taxpayer.</p>

'Lifting people, Lifting Places', published in May 2009, outlines how government can offer further support in the current economic climate, by developing employment opportunities in culture and the creative industries, measures to transform town centres and other approaches to building the new economy with culture and creativity at its heart.</p>

The Department's four main NDPBs have been working together to deliver objectives under the Regional Strategies area of work. For example, NDPB offices in the North West region have prepared a joint response to the Integrated Regional Strategy.</p>

	<p pid="a.1178W.6/1">DEFRA and its Executive agencies are committed to reducing their carbon emissions.</p>
	<p pid="a.1178W.6/2">Various energy efficiency projects have already been implemented across both the DEFRA and Executive Agency Estate including:</p>
	<p pid="a.1178W.6/3" class="indent">Installation of voltage regulation units. This technology significantly reduces energy consumption of a whole building by regulating the voltage level entering the building. Average electricity consumption has reduced by 11 per cent. as a result of installing this technology.</p>
	<p pid="a.1178W.6/4" class="indent">Other energy efficiency projects which have been implemented include upgrades to more efficient lighting, improvements to motor energy controls and gas boiler sequencing controls, all of which have delivered significant savings.</p>
	<p pid="a.1178W.6/5" class="indent">Thermal imaging surveys have been undertaken at a number of DEFRA laboratory sites. The results of the surveys will inform a programme of works to improve the thermal efficiency of buildings.</p>
	<p pid="a.1178W.6/6" class="indent">DEFRA is currently upgrading its electricity, gas and water meters to 'Smart meters' which will provide accurate and up to the minute consumption data. This data will be used to monitor and identify excessive consumption, providing a focus for strategic consumption reduction. The carbon Trust estimate that savings of between 5-10 per cent. can be achieved through the identification of waste through Smart metering.</p>
	<p pid="a.1178W.6/7">These measures have resulted in the DEFRA and Executive Agency Estate achieving accreditation under the Energy Efficiency Accreditation Scheme (EEAS) in 2007. DEFRA also achieved the Carbon Trust Standard in 2008 for its office estate. Both these awards were independently assessed and confirm that the Department is improving its energy efficiency and reducing carbon emissions.</p>
	<p pid="a.1178W.6/8">DEFRA is already exceeding the Sustainable Operations on the Government Estate (SOGE) target for reducing carbon emissions from offices. Its ongoing programme of investment on efficiency measures will ensure that the Department is in the best possible position when Carbon Reduction Commitment (CRC) begins in 2012. In addition, a 15 year Sustainable Built Environment Workplace Support (SBEWS) delivery partnership with Interserve plc, will deliver significant efficiency improvements, not just in energy but across the entire range of SOGE targets.</p>
	<p pid="a.1178W.6/9">The Department for Energy and Climate Change is currently leading work to define what is meant by carbon neutrality for Government and the private sector. Once this work is complete, Government will review the target for the central Government office estate to be carbon neutral by 2012 and the implications for departmental delivery.</p>

Friend the Secretary of State (Hilary Benn) was represented by Peter Unwin, Director General of DEFRA's Environment and Rural Group, at the opening of the new Three Mills Lock on World Environment Day. Three Mills Lock is a key piece of Olympic Park infrastructure and the largest mechanism of its kind built on London waterways for more than 20 years. It will help take lorries off local roads, reduce thousands of tonnes of CO2 and ease local congestion. It will also provide a green freight route for the redevelopment of East London, and open up the waterways for boaters, walkers and cyclists. Secretary of State supplied some quotes for a British Waterways media release.</p>
	<p pid="a.1181W.0/2">Lord Hunt attended the Basic 21 Sustainable School Awards, which took place at Austin Court, Birmingham and was part of a number of events to launch &quot;Green Day&quot; on World Environment Day. Green Day is a one-day event for schools about climate change, sustainability and the built environment, inviting 350 primary and secondary schools and nearly 100,000 pupils to become more sustainable in the run up to the UN Climate Change conference in Copenhagen later this year.</p>

The new guidance will include clear statements of expectations of those involved in supporting pupils with medical conditions, such as schools and primary care trusts. Importantly, this work will be done in collaboration with the Department of Health and other expert organisations, such as Diabetes UK, and will also involve: lobby groups; school and head-teacher representatives; as well as parents and children representatives.

	<p pid="a.1187W.5/1">The Government are committed to ensuring that pupils receive a balanced and inclusive curriculum and that schools take account of pupils' religious and cultural beliefs in all aspects of school life. The National Curriculum includes a detailed statutory inclusion statement, which sets out ways in which teachers should help all pupils to take part in the National Curriculum and to achieve the highest possible standards. Religious Education, which is a statutory part of the basic school curriculum, should be taught like any other subject in the curriculum, in an objective and inclusive way.</p>
	<p pid="a.1187W.5/2">Schools are subject to equalities legislation and the Department advises that they should be sensitive to pupils' religious and cultural needs in developing their policies. For example, School Governors must ensure that their uniform and appearance policies are fair and reasonable in accommodating cultural diversity.

	<p pid="a.1197W.3/1">The &quot;Delivering Better Skills for Better Places&quot; action plan was launched by the Housing Minister, John Healey, at the Chartered Institute of Housing Conference on <phrase class="date" code="2009-06-16">16 June</phrase>. The HCA (Homes and Communities Agency) Academy has led this work, with participation and support from over 20 different organisations across the sustainable communities sector. These bodies represent professions integral to successful place-making: regeneration, housing, planning, construction, economic development, architecture, urban design, landscape architecture, local government, property, surveying, civil engineering and sustainability. The action plan will build on many of the successful projects and national, regional and local initiatives already under way by some of the partner organisations. It aims to ensure alignment between these initiatives and available resources to deliver the objectives of the action plan. Each partner has been working towards similar ambitions and &quot;Delivering Better Skills for Better Places&quot; combines these energies. Such a co-ordinated approach (for example to recruitment and retention across the sector) has been designed to achieve better outcomes.</p>
	<p pid="a.1197W.3/2">The main aims of the action plan are to:</p>
	<p pid="a.1197W.3/3" class="indent">Attract new entrants and retain existing people in the core professions.</p>
	<p pid="a.1197W.3/4" class="indent">Develop generic skills in areas like tow carbon, climate change, empowerment, community cohesion, risk sharing, negotiation, process re-modelling, place leadership and partnership working.</p>
	<p pid="a.1197W.3/5" class="indent">Ensure technical and specialist skills like planning, urban design and skills for changing economic markets are updated in line with new processes, standards, legislation and economic conditions.</p>
	<p pid="a.1197W.3/6">The HCA Academy has allocated &pound;240,000 in each of the next two years to take forward this programme. This allocation will fund detailed research to give an up-to-date and comprehensive picture of employment flows in and out of the sector, and to measure skills gaps so that future actions can be better planned.

The aim of the Low Pay Commission (LPC) is to have a NMW that helps as many low paid workers as possible without having an adverse impact on inflation or employment. Neither the Department nor the LPC collects data on living costs as decisions on NMW rates take account of their effect on employment, inflation and competitiveness, not on living costs.

These include representatives from the voluntary and business sectors and also the police and armed forces (including those returning from active service in Afghanistan), in recognition of their enormous contributions to Northern Ireland Society.</p>
