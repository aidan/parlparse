	<p pid="a.829W.3/4" class="indent">The latest year for which figures are available is 2003. The attached table shows the numbers of deaths among residents of the Humberside police area where the underlying cause of death indicated a condition directly related to alcohol use in the years 1999 to 2003.</p>
	<p pid="a.829W.3/5" class="indent">The Office for National Statistics (ONS) definition of alcohol-related deaths only includes those causes regarded as being most directly due to alcohol consumption. Apart from deaths due to accidental poisoning with alcohol, this definition excludes external causes of death, such as road traffic deaths and other accidents, and alcohol-related suicides and homicides. Estimates of the annual total number of deaths in which alcohol has played a role can therefore vary widely depending on the criteria used. The definition used by ONS allows for consistent comparisons over time for those deaths where a clear association with alcohol consumption can generally be assumed.</p>

	<p pid="a.830W.5/1">The Treasury plays a leading role in the UK's EU policy on financial services, tax and certain aspects of social security provision.</p>
	<p pid="a.830W.5/2">Information on directives and regulations in the field of financial services can be found in the document &quot;The EU Financial Services Action Plan: Delivering the FSAP in the UK&quot;, published by HM Treasury in conjunction with the Financial Services Authority and the Bank of England in May 2004. The Financial Services Action Plan (FSAP) set out a programme of legislative and other action in the area of financial services. The above document sets out the purpose of FSAP and related measures, with a timetable for their implementation, and is available via the Treasury's public website.</p>
	<p pid="a.830W.5/3">Over the last two years, the Treasury has led on the implementation of a number of tax directives; of which the principal ones have been:</p>
	<p pid="a.830W.5/4" class="indent">The implementation of Directive 2003/93 removed VAT from the scope of the Mutual Assistance Directive (77/799) and introduced a separate regulation for the exchange of information on VAT by replacing Regulation 218/92 with the VAT Administrative Co-operation Regulation (1798/2003).</p>
	<p pid="a.830W.5/5" class="indent">The Energy Products Directive 2003/96 updated and replaced 98/81 and 92/82. The updates related to new energy products such as biodiesel being incorporated into duty suspension arrangements. Those parts of the EPD not previously implemented were implemented by The Biofuels and other fuel substitutes (Payment of Excise Duty etc.) Regulations 2004 and the Excise Warehousing (Energy Products) Regulations 2004.</p>
	<p pid="a.830W.5/6" class="indent">Directive 2003/92 amends the sixth VAT Directive (DIR 77/388), <phrase class="date" code="2003-10-07">7 October 2003</phrase>&mdash;changing the place of supply of gas and electricity so that supplies to taxable dealers take place (and are therefore taxed) where the dealer is established, and supplies to others take place where the gas or electricity is used and consumed.</p>
	<p pid="a.830W.5/7" class="indent">Directive 2002/38 amends the sixth VAT Directive (DIR 77/388), <phrase class="date" code="2002-05-15">15 May 2002</phrase> (implemented on <phrase class="date" code="2003-07-01">1 July 2003</phrase>)&mdash;changing the place of supply of electronically supplied services and broadcasting services, provided by non-EU businesses, so that supplies to taxable customers take place (and are therefore taxed) where the customer is established, and supplies to others take place where the broadcasting services are used and consumed or in the case of electronically supplied services, where the customer resides.</p>
	<p pid="a.830W.5/8" class="indent">Directive 2003/49 is concerned with a common system of taxation applicable to interest and royalty payments made between associated companies of different member states. The purpose is to allow for the flow of interest and royalty payments between companies defined in the directive situated in different member states without taxation in the country in which the payment arose.</p>
	<p pid="a.830W.5/9" class="indent">Directive 2003/93/EC amends Directive 77/799/EEC concerning mutual assistance by the competent authorities of the member states in the field of direct and indirect taxation. The purpose is to strengthen co-operation between tax administrations in member states. (This is linked to Council Regulation EC 1798/2003 on cooperation in the field of VAT.)</p>
	<p pid="a.830W.5/10" class="indent">Directive 2003/48/EC relates to taxation of savings income in the form of interest payments. The purpose is to combat tax evasion by individuals on cross-border savings income. Under the directive, information will be collected automatically about the payment of savings income to residents in certain other countries and exchanged with tax authorities in those countries. During a transitional period, until they implement automatic exchange of information, three member states&mdash;Austria, Belgium and Luxembourg&mdash;will instead apply a withholding tax on cross-border interest payments made to individuals. Council Decision 2004/587/EC set the date of application of Directive 2003/48/EC as <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-01">1 July 2005</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.830W.5/11" class="indent">Directive 2004/56/EC amending Directive 77/799/EEC has regard to mutual assistance by the competent authorities of the member states in the field of direct taxation, certain customs duties and taxation of insurance premiums. The purpose is to improve, expand and modernise the original rules.</p>
	<p pid="a.830W.5/12" class="indent">Directive 2004/66/EC amended Directive 2003/48/EC concerning taxation of savings income in the form of interest payments. The purpose is to allow for the accession of the new member states.</p>
	<p pid="a.830W.5/13" class="indent">2004/76 amending Directive 2003/49/EC concerning a common system of taxation applicable to interest and royalty payments made between associated companies of different member states. The purpose is to allow for the accession of the new member states.</p>
	<p pid="a.830W.5/14">EC regulations are, in general, directly applicable in the member states, without the need for further incorporation into national law. However, some regulations require UK measures to make them workable and enforceable. Some regulations enact small or technical amendments. Since <phrase class="date" code="2002-04-17">17 April 2002</phrase>, HM Treasury has implemented:</p>
	<p pid="a.830W.5/15" class="indent">Regulation 792/2002 amending Regulation No. 218/92, <phrase class="date" code="2002-05-15">15 May 2002</phrase> (implemented on <phrase class="date" code="2003-07-01">1 July 2003</phrase>), concerning the provision of a special scheme for non-EU businesses, making supplies of electronically supplied services, enabling VAT to be accounted for electronically in all member states.</p>
	<p pid="a.830W.5/16" class="indent">Council Regulation (EC) 859/2003 of <phrase class="date" code="2003-05-14">14 May 2003</phrase> extending the provisions of Regulation (EEC) 1408/71 and Regulation (EEC) 574/72 to cover nationals of third countries who are not already covered by the provisions solely on the grounds of their nationality. These regulations remove barriers to free movement of workers within the Community and provide for the co-ordination of member states' social security systems.</p>
	<p pid="a.830W.5/17">We do not hold information on the costs to public funds of implementation. regulatory impact assessments (RIAs) are produced for all proposals, including European legislation, likely to impose costs on business, charities or voluntary organisations. Copies of these are placed in the Libraries of the House, and on the Treasury's public website. In some cases, new directives and regulations may be deregulatory measures that impose no costs, or even reduce costs for business.</p>

	<p pid="a.835W.8/3" class="indent">As National Statistician, I have been asked to reply to your recent Parliamentary Question about unemployment in the Leyton and Wanstead Parliamentary Constituency. (208766)</p>
	<p pid="a.835W.8/4" class="indent">The estimates available relate to the twelve-month periods ending in February 1997 and February 2004, the latest period for which information is available. In these periods the numbers of unemployed people, who were resident in the Leyton and Wanstead Parliamentary Constituency, were 6,000 and 5,000 respectively.</p>
	<p pid="a.835W.8/5" class="indent">These estimates from the Labour Force Survey (LFS) are, as with any sample survey, subject to sampling variability and the estimates of changes over time for local areas are particularly affected.</p>
	<p pid="a.835W.8/6" class="indent">A more reliable indication of change between 1997 and 2004 at Parliamentary Constituency level is the number of people claiming Jobseeker's Allowance (JSA). The annual average number of people resident in the Leyton and Wanstead constituency claiming JSA benefits in 1997 was 4,158. The corresponding average for the first 11 months of 2004 was 2,310. Between the two years there was a fall of 44 per cent.</p>

	<p pid="a.847W.2/1">The Government's Market Transformation Programme estimates that consumer electronics, home computing equipment, domestic cooking equipment and office equipment left in stand-by mode produced approximately 650,000 tonnes of carbon (c6.7TWh) in the UK in 2003.</p>
	<p pid="a.847W.2/2">We are also aware that there is further energy consumption, for which we do not have firm estimates at present, from washing machines and dishwashers which are switched on awaiting use or after they have completed their wash cycles; consumer electronic equipment using external power supplies (e.g. domestic portable telephones) that continue to consume energy when plugged in but not in use; and domestic personal computer equipment where the stand-by facilities are not properly enabled. Taken together, these sources of consumption may bring the overall figure to around one million tonnes of carbon.</p>
	<p pid="a.847W.2/3">In order to try to tackle this problem the Market Transformation Programme (<a href="http://www.mtprog.com">www.mtprog.com</a>) has been encouraging manufacturers to reduce both the &quot;on&quot; and the stand-by power consumption of household appliances through the adoption of design improvements, voluntary codes of conduct, and best practice guidelines and targets. This approach has been fairly successful in respect of televisions: an EU-wide voluntary agreement will mean that the majority of new televisions sold in the UK now consume around 1 watt of power in stand-by mode rather than the 3&ndash;8 watts consumed by older models. Discussions are now under way to extend this agreement to cover other consumer electronics.</p>
	<p pid="a.847W.2/4">A similar agreement for external power supplies aims to encourage new power supplies consuming around half a watt in stand-by mode compared to the present average of just over 2 watts.</p>
	<p pid="a.847W.2/5">In addition, the Government's initiative on sustainable procurement, announced last autumn, includes a requirement for Government Departments which purchase computers and televisions to specify low stand-by power requirements.</p>

	<p pid="a.848W.0/1">As we set out in the 2003 Energy White Paper, one of the four goals of our energy policy is to put ourselves on a path to cut the UK's carbon dioxide emissions by some 60 per cent. by about 2050, as recommended by the Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution, with real progress by 2020.</p>

	<p pid="a.848W.3/1">In 2002, the Department published new Climate Change Scenarios in support of the UK Climate Impacts Programme (UKCIP). The scenarios were prepared by the Tyndall and Hadley Centres under contract to the Department and used the Hadley Centre's high resolution regional climate change model. They represented a significant step forward in providing a basis for assessing the potential impacts of climate change in different parts of the UK during this century.</p>
	<p pid="a.848W.3/2">The scenarios indicate that it is likely that:</p>
	<p pid="a.848W.3/3" class="indent">UK annual average temperatures will rise by between 2 and 3.5 degrees Celsius by the 2080s;</p>
	<p pid="a.848W.3/4" class="indent">High summer temperatures will become more frequent and very cold winters will become increasingly rare;</p>
	<p pid="a.848W.3/5" class="indent">Winters will become wetter and summers may become drier everywhere;</p>
	<p pid="a.848W.3/6" class="indent">Snowfall amounts will decrease throughout the UK;</p>
	<p pid="a.848W.3/7" class="indent">Heavy winter precipitation will become more frequent;</p>
	<p pid="a.848W.3/8" class="indent">Relative sea level will continue to rise around most of the UK's shoreline, with the South East expected to see the largest increases of between 26 and 86 centimetres by the 2080s;</p>
	<p pid="a.848W.3/9" class="indent">Extreme sea levels will be experienced more frequently.</p>
	<p pid="a.848W.3/10">These projections are based on four alternative scenarios of future global emissions of greenhouse gases and as such capture some of the uncertainty that surrounds our ability to predict future climate. However it is recognised that projections of climate change, especially at the regional level, are also subject to modelling uncertainties which are the focus of current research. Nevertheless the UKCIP scenarios provide a scientifically robust indication of the general trends in climate that are expected and a useful basis for assessing the potential risks and opportunities of climate change.</p>
	<p pid="a.848W.3/11">Further information is available in the full report in the Libraries of both Houses. The reports can also be found at <a href="http://www.ukcip.org.uk">www.ukcip.org.uk</a>.</p>

	<p pid="a.849W.3/1">The Government are satisfied that the current arrangements for collecting ozone data are more cost-effective than those applying previously, and meet scientific and public information needs.</p>
	<p pid="a.849W.3/2">The Met Office, for the UK Government, has collected Dobson Photospectrometer data since 1957. Measurements at Camborne were taken between 1957 and 1967 and then between 1989 and 2003. In the intervening period, measurements were taken at Bracknell, near Reading. There have been continuous measurements at Lerwick since 1957.</p>
	<p pid="a.849W.3/3">Ozone measurements are also available from satellites and give complete coverage for the UK, although a few local measurements in an area the size of the UK are needed to calibrate the satellite data and to provide long-term data for analysing trends.</p>
	<p pid="a.849W.3/4">At the renewal of the monitoring contracts in 2003, bidders were asked to propose a rationalisation of both the ozone and ultra-violet radiation (UV) monitoring networks. Following an analysis of network requirements, provided by Imperial College, it was decided to move measurements of ozone from Camborne to Reading, for the following reasons:</p>
	<p pid="a.849W.3/5" class="indent">There was a long record of UV measurements at Reading and co-location of the ozone and UV monitoring sites in the south was deemed to be useful.</p>
	<p pid="a.849W.3/6" class="indent">Ozone measurements had been made at Bracknell, near Reading, previously.</p>
	<p pid="a.849W.3/7" class="indent">Ozone measurements were also made in Valentia, Ireland, and that would be sufficient information, together with Reading, to provide cover for south west England.</p>
	<p pid="a.849W.3/8">A separate formal consultation was not undertaken but was not considered necessary as the open tender process, which included key players in ozone monitoring, sought guidance on the monitoring requirement.</p>
	<p pid="a.849W.3/9">The Met Office expressed the view to Defra that the measurements at Camborne should have been continued; but Defra, in reviewing all of the advice it had received, concluded that on balance relocation to Reading was the best option.</p>
	<p pid="a.849W.3/10">The daily ozone data are analysed on a weekly basis, and the results, including those covering the south-west, are placed on a publicly accessible website (<a href="http://www.airquality.co.uk/archive/ozone/">http://www.airquality.co.uk/archive/ozone/</a>). The record at Lerwick over the last 30 years shows a decreasing trend in overall ozone levels. However, there is some indication of ozone recovery in the last 10 years at both Lerwick and Camborne. If any short-term low or high ozone events occur, further analysis is carried out to ascertain the causes. Records are sent to international data centres where they are made available for studies to identify global ozone trends.</p>

	<p pid="a.851W.5/1">Demonstrating progress towards the EU's Kyoto Protocol target of a 8 per cent. reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2012 will be a priority for the UK's presidency of the EU later this year. We are taking every opportunity to raise the issue in discussions with other member states, and stressing the importance of implementing measures to meet their commitments. We will also press for harmonisation across member states with respect to the scope of the EU Emissions Trading Scheme for Phase 2 (2008&ndash;12).</p>
	<p pid="a.851W.5/2">The latest emission projections from member states suggest that a combination of existing domestic policies and measures, additional policies and measures which are already in an advanced state of planning, and emission credits gained through the Kyoto Protocol's project-based mechanisms will deliver a total EU-15 emissions cut of 8.6 per cent. by 2010. We will continue to review and monitor progress towards this goal.</p>

However, because of concerns over the reliability of the first set of data, the full data on reasons for exclusion, including those that were drug and alcohol-related, were not published in the Experimental Statistics First Release (ESR 01/2004), a copy of which is in the Library. The next Statistical First Release on exclusions will be published in May 2005.</p>
	<p pid="a.860W.5/2">Our guidance states that a head teacher can exclude a pupil permanently for supplying an illegal drug and that the Secretary of State would not normally expect the governing body or an appeal panel to reinstate such a pupil. Illegal drugs have no place in schools and harm children's learning, health and behaviour. We have made clear that we support head teachers and governing bodies together with local partners including the police in their efforts to tackle illegal drugs in schools.</p>

In addition to information on how to use ucasapply, schools were sent a questionnaire to gain feedback on their experience of usage. Of those schools that had used ucasapply, 71 per cent. of respondents felt they had all the information they needed, and over 56 per cent. felt that it had cut down the amount of time staff spent on administering applications compared with previous paper-based applications. Schools that have not yet used ucasapply have cited lack of time to learn how to use the online system as the main reason. UCAS has contacted those falling in this category and offered them further support.</p>

DFID's assistance will help the Palestinians develop a policing strategy, structures and management capacity to undertake such change. From January 2005, support is being co-ordinated by a European Union Co-ordination Office for Palestinian Police Support which is headed by the seconded UK Police Adviser.</p>

	<p pid="a.863W.9/1">In response to the tsunami disaster which followed the earthquake in South East Asia, the Department for International Development has committed &pound;75 million towards the immediate humanitarian needs. This assistance is being channelled through United Nations agencies, the Red Cross Movement, non-governmental organisations and by DFID direct action. To date, this includes the sum of &pound;4,665,090 for DFID donations in kind. Our total DFID bilateral aid in 2003&ndash;04 to the countries that have been affected by the tsunami was &pound;395,689,000. These are the latest figures available. DFID does not have bilateral aid programmes in all the stricken countries: a breakdown of assistance by country is detailed as follows.</p>
	<p pid="a.863W.9/2">On debt relief, Sri Lanka has been added to the list of countries eligible for the UK's multilateral debt relief initiative. The UK will pay 10 per cent. of its debt service costs to the International Development Association (IDA), which amounts to approximately $5.5 million in 2005, $5.8 million in 2006 and $6.2 million in 2007. Paris Club creditors have agreed not to expect repayments from affected countries that request it until the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund have completed a full needs assessment of their reconstruction and financing requirements. It is not possible to quantify the value of any relief at this stage as the technical terms remain to be discussed with those countries that apply.</p>

The planning arrangements for telecommunications developments were significantly strengthened in 2001 and include improved requirements for consulting local people about mast proposals. The changes to the GPDO were underpinned by revised guidance, set out in Planning Policy Guidance Note 8, Telecommunications. The changes to the planning guidance also underlined that school governors must be consulted on all proposals for new masts on or near a school or college. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister is currently considering the NRPB report on Mobile Phones and Health 2004 and will respond once we have considered them fully.</p>

It provides more detailed advice than is contained in Planning Policy Guidance Note 8 on Telecommunications (PPG8) about how local communities and particularly schools and colleges should be consulted in relation to telecommunications developments. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister has commissioned a study to assess the impact that the Code has had since its introduction, how local authorities have implemented the Code and how the public perceives its operation.</p>

Although in a particular case considerations of public interest may serve to protect private interests, the material question is not whether a particular development would cause financial or other loss to owners and occupiers of the neighbouring property, but whether the proposal would have a detrimental effect on the locality generally, and on amenities that ought, in the public interest, to be protected.</p>

	<p pid="a.872W.2/1">My right hon. Friends the Deputy Prime Minister and the Chancellor, in their initial response to Kate Barker's report in March 2004, accepted the case for increased investment in social housing and undertook to address this in the 2004 Spending Review.</p>
	<p pid="a.872W.2/2">The funding provided in the Spending Review 2004 is planned, along with efficiency improvements, to produce 75,000 social rented homes and 40,000 homes for essential public sector workers and low cost home ownership over the three years to 2007&ndash;08.</p>
	<p pid="a.872W.2/3">The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister does not set targets at local level. The Government believe that local authorities are best placed to carry out local housing needs assessments. The Government's policy on planning and affordable housing is clearly set out in planning policy guidance, which provides a strong framework for the provision of affordable housing and requires local authorities to undertake local housing needs assessments and formulate development plan policies to meet the community's needs for housing, including an element of affordable housing on suitable sites.</p>

	<p pid="a.872W.5/1">The arms length management organisations (ALMO), large scale voluntary transfer (LSVT) and private finance initiatives (PFI) for housing revenue account (HRA) housing programmes are intended to achieve the Government's decent homes PSA 7 target by December 2010 and to deliver wider improvements to social housing stock and services. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister will be tracking progress against the decent homes target through local authority, ALMO and registered social landlord (RSL) monitoring returns and the English house condition survey (EHCS).</p>
	<p pid="a.872W.5/2">In addition, each programme has its own monitoring and evaluation system to track annual progress and provide longer-term assessments of the outcomes and value for money of the different programmes. The monitoring and evaluation systems apply to LSVTs from the 2001 programme onwards, all ALMO rounds, and all PFI for housing revenue account schemes. The systems collect a range of data to track progress towards the decent homes target, delivery of promises to tenants, tenant satisfaction, delivery of housing services, and linkages to wider estate and area regeneration. Where possible, these systems are based on data that is already collected by individual schemes to reduce the burden of further data collection.</p>

	<p pid="a.873W.5/1">All local authorities are required to complete by July 2005 an options appraisal for the delivery of decent homes within their housing stock by 2010. This process will identify the most appropriate route, which may be to pursue a housing transfer. Based on recent trends it is estimated that this may bring forward between 50,000 and 150,000 dwellings transferring annually up to 2007&ndash;08. This number should then reduce annually as decent home delivery vehicles are put in place.</p>

	<p pid="a.881W.11/1">Experts do not know the underlying cause of prostate cancer. We do know that the largest risk factor is age, with family history, ethnicity, diet and some occupational factors also playing a role. There has also been an increase in the number of prostate cancer being detected. Experts do not know if this is due to an increased risk of prostate cancer or to an increase in testing for prostate cancer. The lengthening of life expectancy may also have a role in this increase.</p>
	<p pid="a.881W.11/2">We do know that prostate cancers can be broken down into slow growing, non-aggressive and fast growing, aggressive types. The vast majority of prostate cancers are slow growing and will not cause any harm to the man in his lifetime. The fast growing account for approximately 20 per cent. of prostate cancers and if left untreated will cause harm.</p>
	<p pid="a.881W.11/3">The dilemma has been that we do not know how to distinguish between the fast and slow growing types. That is why we promised to spend &pound;4.2 million on research into prostate cancer by 2003&ndash;4, which was achieved. This was part of the NHS prostate cancer programme, published in September 2000. In addition to enhancing research into prostate cancer, the Programme also aimed to improve the early detection of prostate cancer and to improve treatment and care for patients with prostate cancer.</p>
	<p pid="a.881W.11/4">Good progress has been made, and is reflected in the report 'Making progress on prostate cancer', published in November 2004. A copy is available in the Library.</p>
	<p pid="a.881W.11/5">We have also set up the prostate cancer advisory group (PCAG), chaired by Professor Mike Richards, the national cancer director. The overall remit of PCAG is to facilitate collaboration between the Department and patient and professional groups. PCAG is taking forward work on the pubic awareness of prostate cancer, information for prostate cancer patients, improving the treatment of prostate cancer, and developing a national prostate cancer website.</p>

	<p pid="a.888W.11/1">The answer is as follows:</p>
	<p pid="a.888W.11/2" class="italic">(a) Learndirect</p>
	<p pid="a.888W.11/3">In November 2003 the Department for Employment and Learning commissioned a review of its relationship with the University for Industry (UfI)/learndirect. The report, presented in May 2004, identified a number of positive findings; for example, that UfI/learndirect supported the widening access agenda. However, the review also identified several areas of major concern including poor support for learner tracking or progression, and a decrease in 'on-line' learning from 80 per cent. in 1999 to 20 per cent. in 2003&ndash;04.</p>
	<p pid="a.888W.11/4" class="italic">(b) Enterprise Ulster (EU)</p>
	<p pid="a.888W.11/5">A review of Enterprise Ulster commenced in September 2004 focusing on Enterprise Ulster's role and performance. The draft report is due to be presented to the Department in December.</p>
	<p pid="a.888W.11/6" class="italic">(c) Worktrack</p>
	<p pid="a.888W.11/7">An evaluation of Worktrack was completed in May 2002, which concluded that, with some modifications there was a continuing need for the programme, at that time. Since then, the economic climate has improved, unemployment is at a very low level and there are more job opportunities. The programme is therefore considered to have a lower priority than other competing demands. The costs of an employment placement under Worktrack are also high. There is other provision available to assist people into work and significant resources available to increase skills through higher and further education.</p>

The Department plans to commission an interim evaluation of the programme early in 2005&ndash;06 with a final evaluation to be carried out in 2006&ndash;07 financial year. Decisions about the future of TEP will be taken after full consideration of a final report.</p>

	<p pid="a.894W.8/1">During 2004 the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety was involved in a lengthy investigation into the illegal distribution and sale of unlicensed veterinary medicinal products, This investigation, undertaken with the Police Service of Northern Ireland, uncovered substantial evidence of an illegal manufacturing operation of these unlicensed medicines and also of a counterfeit product.</p>
	<p pid="a.894W.8/2">The products uncovered were mainly antibiotic preparations intended for food-producing animals. Their unauthorised use could pose a significant threat to human health through unacceptable levels of drug residues in food, and the potential for the growth of microbial resistance to essential human medicines. A file on this has now been passed for consideration to the Director of Public Prosecutions for Northern Ireland.</p>

	<p pid="a.897W.3/1">The National Radiological Protection Board's independent Advisory Group on Non-Ionising Radiation (AGNIR) recommended that the Home Office should ensure that emissions from Airwave handsets and vehicle-mounted sets are within international guidelines. Accordingly, the Home Office specified that the maximum transmission power levels should be either 1 Watt (for handsets) or 3 Watts (for vehicle-mounted sets). Independent checks have found that emission levels from Airwave equipment are within international guidelines.</p>
	<p pid="a.897W.3/2">We also commissioned a programme of research on the advice of AGNIR into the remaining areas of uncertainty surrounding the health and safety effects of the TETRA technology that underpins Airwave.

	<p pid="a.901W.2/1">There are two basic types of recording equipment that might be fitted to police vehicles: incident, or collision, data recorders (IDRs) and journey data recorders (JDRs). IDRs are fitted to a vehicle for the capture and short-term storage of data from on-board sensors. Their primary aim is to assist in establishing what occurred prior to and during a collision. They can be used to supplement physical evidence for incident reconstruction and act as an 'independent witness' in the event of a collision. JDRs give management information on a vehicle's performance. They are typically used by fleet managers to monitor vehicle usage and efficiency.</p>
	<p pid="a.901W.2/2">The fitting of such recording devices is a local operational matter. The Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) does however recommend that forces consider such a course. We welcome this. Several forces have fitted devices, some on a pilot trial basis and others as permanent attachments to their vehicles. Some are collecting data on their performance, though where their attachment is part of a package of measures it might be difficult to identify the performance of individual elements.</p>

	<p pid="a.913W.6/3">On <phrase class="date" code="2004-12-14">14 December 2004</phrase>, I met with my hon. Friend, the Member for Workington, to discuss the implications for benefit processing staff in Workington. Departmental officials have since visited West Cumbria and Carlisle and met with Public and Commercial Services (PCS) officials to respond to their suggestion for a second processing centre in Workington.</p>
	<p pid="a.913W.6/4">The Department cannot justify a second long-term benefit processing centre in Cumbria and needs to take a firm decision so we can deliver the planned business improvements. We therefore confirm our original decision to centralise benefit processing in Carlisle. We will continue to work closely with staff and the PCS to manage the transition and redeployment of staff affected.</p>

Friend the Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean discussed the Arab Human Development Reports and follow-up action with the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in November last year.

The Foreign and Commonwealth Office is supporting a number of UNDP programmes that help implement the recommendations contained in the reports.</p>

	<p pid="a.922W.5/1">Many of the recommendations remain to be addressed but we have seen some progress which has been mostly in terms of developing legislation.</p>
	<p pid="a.922W.5/2" class="indent">Recommendation B: Definition of Torture. The Supreme Court resolution 17 of December 2003 defined torture. The definition is that of the UN Convention Against Torture. The definition is not yet on the statute. The Interior Ministry (MVD) has told us they are prosecuting officials in accordance with the new definition anyway.</p>
	<p pid="a.922W.5/3" class="indent">Recommendation E: Independent investigation of all allegations of torture. This recommendation says all allegations should be independently investigated. The Uzbek authorities permitted independent investigation of the death in custody of Andrei Shelkavenko in May 2004 and in January 2005 have agreed to allow a US pathologist access in the investigation of the death in custody of Samandar Umarov. Torture was disproved in the Shelkavenko case. But there are still many more cases of alleged torture which are not yet being independently investigated.</p>
	<p pid="a.922W.5/4" class="indent">Recommendation O: Training for law enforcement agents regarding rights of those deprived of liberty. This has improved through projects implemented by the UN Development Programme and the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe with MVD investigators and the penitentiary system.</p>
	<p pid="a.922W.5/5">We recently received an update on activities implemented under the Uzbek National Action Plan on Torture through which Uzbekistan intends to carry out the recommendations of the UN Special Rapporteur. We are looking at this latest update with our EU partners to consider how we can work with the Uzbek Government to achieve further progress.</p>

	<p pid="a.924W.3/1">Both bilaterally and with EU partners, we have regularly and repeatedly drawn our deep concern about the NGO climate in Uzbekistan to senior level attention within the Uzbek Government. In a letter to Uzbek Foreign Minister Safayev of November 2004, my right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary reminded him that</p>
	<p pid="a.924W.3/2" class="indent">&quot;the activities of civil society groups are an essential part of a healthy democracy.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.924W.3/3">The EU, supported by the UK, issued a letter in December 2004 to Foreign Minister Safayev, which raised the repeated refusal to register Mothers Against the Death Penalty and Torture despite international recognition for its leader Tamara Chikunova.</p>
	<p pid="a.924W.3/4">We are aware of the constraints placed upon the NGO community in Uzbekistan by the Cabinet of Ministers' decree No. 56 and internal decree No.523. It has been and will continue to be a fundamental aspect of our policy towards Uzbekistan to press for a freer environment in which the local and international NGO communities and journalists can work.</p>
	<p pid="a.924W.3/5">In February 2004 the EU addressed a letter to the Minister of Justice, Mr. Polvon-Zoda, expressing concern that the government requirements for the registration of NGOs would prevent organisations such as Human Rights Watch, International Crisis Group and the Institute for War and Peace reporting from working and publishing. We will continue to stress the importance of putting in place procedures to allow the registration of both domestic and international NGOs.</p>

	<p pid="a.925W.0/2">The UK and others followed the case closely and believe that the serious allegations made against Ruslan Sharipov may have been politically motivated. Concerned by the charges and his possible treatment in prison, the EU, supported by the UK, raised the Sharipov case with Foreign Minister Safayev in January 2004.</p>
	<p pid="a.925W.0/3">In early 2004 he was transferred to an open prison and had his sentence reduced from four to just over three years. In March he was released on probation but was effectively under house arrest. In June he was due to be sent to Bukhara for the continuation of his sentence. Instead, he absconded to Moscow where he spent several months. In October he was granted asylum by the US.</p>

	<p pid="a.927W.2/1">Since the introduction of Commission Regulation 1400/2002, the UK new car retail market remains substantially the same in terms of how and by whom new cars are supplied to consumers. However, agreements between manufacturer and retailer, or car repair and service business, made under the regulations provide considerably more freedoms for business, for example, to retail more than one make of new car, or to trade only in cars and carry out no servicing. The full effects of these new freedoms will not be felt before October 2005, the date when car dealers can set up subsidiaries and warehouses within any territory within the EU. The new freedoms will take a considerable time to work through, depending as they do on non investment decisions by individual businesses, but the result should be greater freedom for car sales and aftermarket businesses to operate as they wish, more competition, and better choice for consumers.</p>

	<p pid="a.927W.5/1">There is more opportunity for business to compete in the market for repair and servicing new cars and more choice for consumers as to where they have their &quot;within-warranty&quot; new cars serviced as a result of the regulation. Any car repair or servicing business is free to become a part of any car manufacturer's or importer's approved repairer network, provided they meet the qualitative criteria set by the manufacturer. In addition, since the introduction of Commission Regulation 1400/2002 the Office of Fair Trading has ensured that manufacturers no longer include servicing ties to their approved repairer networks within the terms and conditions of new car warranties.</p>
