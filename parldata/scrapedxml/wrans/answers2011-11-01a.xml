	<p pid="a.490W.15/1">Latest figures derived from the Households Below Average Income series of surveys for the period 2007-08 to 2009-10 show that the proportion of children living in relative poverty in Wales stands at 25%.</p>
	<p pid="a.490W.15/2">The Government are firmly committed to the goal of ending child poverty in Wales and across the United Kingdom by 2020. The UK's first Child Poverty Strategy &#8220;A New Approach to Child Poverty: Tackling the Causes of Disadvantage and Transforming Families' Lives&#8221; sets out a new approach to tackling poverty for this Parliament and up to 2020. The strategy is clear that poverty is about far more than income.</p>
	<p pid="a.490W.15/3">The strategy demonstrates the Government's commitment to lifting people out not only of income poverty, but poverty of aspiration and poverty of outcomes. The strategy established a new suite of child poverty indicators against which progress will be monitored. These new indicators, in addition to those in the Child Poverty Act 2010, continue to recognise the importance of income, but also capture the broader understanding of both the causes and consequences of poverty.</p>
	<p pid="a.490W.15/4">We must also recognise that the Welsh Government have responsibility for a number of factors that affect child poverty and it is important that their strategy dovetails with ours especially given that Wales continues to show levels of child poverty well above the UK average.</p>

	<p pid="a.492W.6/1">Where a person is found not to be in need of international protection and they have no other lawful basis to remain in the UK, we expect them to leave the country. We would prefer such people leave voluntarily and we provide a number of comprehensive schemes to assist them with doing so, but if they fail to leave, we will enforce their departure.</p>
	<p pid="a.492W.6/2">Most people whose removal is being enforced leave on scheduled flights, but in the case of Sri Lanka, the UK Border Agency has also chartered two flights, one in June 2011 returning 26 people and a second in September 2011 returning 50. These were Sri Lankan nationals; the UK Border Agency only keeps records of nationality rather than ethnicity.</p>
	<p pid="a.492W.6/3">We monitor the conditions in countries across the world closely and only seek to return people where it is safe to do so and it would not put the UK in breach of its international obligations. The UK Border Agency does not routinely monitor the treatment of individual subjects once they are removed from the UK given they have been found not to be in need of international protection. However, in the case of Sri Lanka, we currently provide those being returned with the contact details of the high commission in Colombo.</p>

	<p pid="a.501W.2/1">As plant protection products (pesticides), both metaldehyde and methiocarb slug pellets are controlled under EU pesticides legislation. The Chemicals Regulation Directorate (CRD) of the Health and Safety Executive (the Government body responsible for regulating pesticides) carries out checks to ensure the risks that can arise from the use of these products are not unacceptable. This will include an assessment of the toxicity of each product and the ways in which spray operators, the public or environment, including wildlife, are exposed to them.</p>
	<p pid="a.501W.2/2">Controls extend to the use of pesticide products and CRD routinely restricts the way products can be used (for example specifying dose rates, timing and place of application) to ensure the protection of human health and the environment. Users are also legally obliged to take all reasonable precautions to protect the health of human beings, animals and plants. Advice on how this can be done is set out in a statutory &#8220;Code of Practice for Using Plant Protection Products&#8221; which, among other things, contains guidance on minimising the exposure of wild birds and mammals to pesticides.</p>

	<p pid="a.501W.5/1">Work on immuno-contraception in grey squirrels by the Forestry Commission's agency Forest Research ended in 2006-07. Field trials failed to produce an immune response that was powerful or long-lasting. Attention has now turned to another compound called DiazaCon which has shown promise as a fertility control agent. 'Proof of concept' enclosure studies between 2007 and 2011 confirmed an effect of DiazaCon on squirrel blood chemistry but the effect on reproduction was inconclusive. Further research is also needed to refine species-specific field delivery systems.</p>

	<p pid="a.501W.5/4">The cost of the studies on immuno-contraception totalled &#163;323,000 during the period 2002-07. They were funded by the Forestry Commission, DEFRA, the Countryside Council for Wales, Scottish Natural Heritage and Natural England. A total of &#163;282,000 has been spent on studies using DiazaCon from 2007-11 by DEFRA and the Forestry Commission.</p>

	<p pid="a.503W.5/1">The export of electronic waste from the UK is controlled by the EU Waste Shipments Regulation. Under the regulation, electronic waste may be exported for environmentally sound recovery. However, the export of any hazardous electronic waste to developing countries is prohibited. The competent authorities for the enforcement of the Waste Shipment Regulation in the UK are the Environment Agency in England and Wales, the Scottish Environmental Protection Agency and the Northern Ireland Environment Agency.</p>
	<p pid="a.503W.5/2">The competent authorities have adopted an intelligence-led approach to deal with illegal exports of waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE). This is delivering results by disrupting the flow of illegally exported WEEE, and is also resulting in enforcement actions against waste criminals.</p>
	<p pid="a.503W.5/3">Alongside the deterrent effect of its enforcement work, the Environment Agency recognises that cutting off the supply of WEEE to illegal operators at source is a key activity. It is working with waste producers and partner organisations in an effort to ensure that electronic scrap only enters recycling and reprocessing routes operated in accordance with the WEEE and other environmental regulations.</p>

	<p pid="a.504W.0/1">The UK is a party to the Basel convention on the control of transboundary movements of hazardous wastes and their disposal, the only global legal instrument on this issue. Our substantial input has helped the convention to agree a global guidance document on the management of computing equipment as part of the Partnership for Action on computer equipment, a multi-stakeholder partnership under the Basel convention. The convention is also working on a wider document to assist with the global policing of the transboundary movements of electronic waste.</p>
	<p pid="a.504W.0/2">The convention is implemented in the EU through the Waste Shipments Regulation, which is supplemented in the UK by the Transfrontier Shipment of Waste Regulations 2007. Under these regulations it is a serious criminal offence to export waste illegally, with the possibility of significant penalties for those convicted.</p>
	<p pid="a.504W.0/3">Tackling the illegal export of electronic waste is also a Key feature of the work being done by numerous EU and International bodies such as the European Union Network for the Implementation and Enforcement of Environmental Law, Interpol, Europol and the United Nations Environment programme. The UK competent authorities (the Environment Agency for England and Wales, the Scottish Environment Agency and the Northern Ireland Environment Agency) actively participate in numerous programmes and projects which carry out joint intelligence-led inspections and investigations, allow cross-border multi-agency sharing of intelligence, techniques and skills and improve business awareness of the controls which apply to the management of waste electrical and electronic equipment.</p>

	<p pid="a.504W.6/1">The collaborative UK Cetacean Strandings Investigation programme (CSIP), aims, among other things, to undertake surveillance on the incidence of exposure to environmental pollutants in stranded cetaceans.</p>
	<p pid="a.504W.6/2">Very few killer whales strand around the UK; only 23 strandings have been recorded out of nearly 10500 cetacean strandings in the UK since 1990. Of these, six have been examined at post-mortem. As such, there is insufficient data to make an adequate assessment of the possible effects polybrominated flame retardants (PBDEs) and other pollutants have on the heath of the killer whale population.</p>
	<p pid="a.504W.6/3">However, given that PBDE levels are now very low in porpoises, the risk to killer whales is likely to be quite small and declining as PBDE levels continue to drop in the marine environment.</p>
	<p pid="a.504W.6/4">Other brominated flame retardant compounds, such as hexabromocyclododecane (HBCD) and tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBP-A) have also been detected and monitored. Levels of these chemicals are still much lower than for polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs).</p>
	<p pid="a.504W.6/5">The 2010 report of the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea working group on marine mammal ecology concludes that PCBs, despite being banned for 30 years in Europe, remain the biggest chemical risk to marine top predators such as killer whales and inshore bottlenose dolphins in the North East Atlantic region rather than PBDEs or other brominated flame retardants.</p>

	<p pid="a.507W.3/11">New furniture was bought as part of a project to relocate CPS staff from two London buildings into a new site.

	<p pid="a.507W.3/12">The installation of new video conferencing systems at 13 CPS sites will reduce the need for staff to travel to meetings, cutting the cost of travel, hotel and subsistence. It is forecast that the initial investment in this equipment will be repaid and savings of at least &#163;242,000 achieved by 2014-15.</p>

	<p pid="a.507W.3/15" class="italic">Case Management System</p>
	<p pid="a.507W.3/16">The Case Management System (CMS) is a computerised system that holds the relevant particulars for a case, helps the case officer keep track of tasks and diary dates, enables them to create and store correspondence, record time and maintain a record of the case. It has been designed to allow the Litigation Group to handle increased case loads with the same resources. It provides better quality information and relieves case workers of much of the routine business of case management, releasing them to concentrate on providing legal support and service to our clients.</p>

	<p pid="a.507W.3/21">The Serious Fraud Office (SFO) has not made any individual payments for assets over the value of &#163;250,000 since May 2010. However as part of the implementation of its IT system, one intangible asset (IT software) has been implemented since May 2010. This intangible asset was being developed from June 2009 to March 2011.

	<p pid="a.510W.5/1">In September 2011 responsibility for administering the Gangmasters Licensing Authority (GLA) Tribunal transferred to the Ministry of Justice. The budget for the tribunal now sits within the Her Majesty's Courts and Tribunals Service (HMCTS) overall operating budget and it is difficult to identify separate resources precisely because they are shared across other parts of HMCTS operations. However, the anticipated running costs of the GLA tribunal cases are &#163;50,000 per annum. The majority of the costs are those of the tribunal panel members. Staff resourcing is provided by HMCTS, and a dedicated administrator in support of the panel equating to one half of an administrative officer full time post, is assigned to GLA tribunal duties.</p>

	<p pid="a.510W.11/1">The actual cause of deaths in prison, whether suicide, natural, self inflicted or murder, is determined at the inquest and may therefore be unknown for several years. This means that published numbers of deaths by apparent cause can change over time as inquests take place. In some cases the cause may never be clearly established.</p>
	<p pid="a.510W.11/2">The National Offender Management Service (NOMS) system of classifying deaths has evolved to help place reliable numbers of deaths in prison custody in the public domain without undue delay. Where, on the information available, the cause of death is not apparent the NOMS records the death as unclassified.</p>
	<p pid="a.510W.11/3">There are currently no unclassified deaths recorded for 2009. It has been possible following post mortem and other tests such as toxicology to classify all deaths in that year as either apparent self-inflicted, suspected natural causes, apparent homicide or other non natural.</p>
	<p pid="a.510W.11/4">For 2010, there are seven unclassified deaths recorded for which, on the information currently available, it is not possible to identify the apparent cause of death. The deaths took place at HMPs Bronzefield, Brixton (2), Holloway, Wealstun, Low Newton and Doncaster.</p>

	<p pid="a.519W.3/3">In reply to your recent Parliamentary Question about the Child Maintenance and Enforcement Commission, the Secretary of State promised a substantive reply from the Child Maintenance Commissioner.</p>
	<p pid="a.519W.3/4">You asked the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, how many non-resident parents resident in Bexleyheath and Crayford constituency have been subject to enforcement action for non-payment of child maintenance in each of the last five years.</p>
	<p pid="a.519W.3/5">Where a non-resident parent fails to pay maintenance, there are a number of enforcement actions available. Money can be taken directly from a non-resident parent's earnings if the non-resident parent is employed, money can be taken directly from a non-resident parent's bank or building society account, or action can be taken through the courts.</p>
	<p pid="a.519W.3/6">The most serious forms of enforcement are commitment to prison or disqualification from driving. The decision whether to implement, and the length of the order, is at the discretion of a Magistrates' Court (or Sheriff in Scotland) where they are satisfied that a non-resident parent has &#8220;wilfully refused or culpably neglected&#8221; to pay child maintenance&#8212;but this is not a criminal sanction.</p>
	<p pid="a.519W.3/7">It is not possible provide the number of enforcement actions specifically for non-resident parents who have failed to pay maintenance for children residing in Bexleyheath and Crayford constituency.</p>
	<p pid="a.519W.3/8">The total volume of enforcement actions carried out by the Child Support Agency is shown on page 23 of the June 2011 Quarterly Summary of Statistics (QSS), available at:</p>
	<p pid="a.519W.3/9"><a href="http://www.childmaintenance.org/en/publications/stats0611.html">http://www.childmaintenance.org/en/publications/stats0611.html</a></p>
	<p pid="a.519W.3/10">and in the House of Commons library. This shows that in the twelve months to March 2011 63,060 new deduction from earnings orders were sent to employers to take money from a non-resident parent's earnings or pension, over 18,000 liability orders were granted, over 11,000 cases were referred to bailiffs and 1,050 non-resident parents received immediate or suspended committal sentences.</p>

	<p pid="a.521W.2/1">I have visited both the Newcastle and Leven Remploy factories in the last six months. Also as part of the Sayce consultation, the Department held a series of six events where Remploy employees had an opportunity to directly contribute to the consultation in addition to written and online submissions. I attended the consultation event in Reading where I met and discussed the Sayce recommendations with employees. I have also held two briefing meetings for MPs.</p>
	<p pid="a.521W.2/2">No direct representations have been received from Remploy employees on the future of the business, although we have consulted on the recommendations of the Sayce report and have received almost 1,400 responses, including responses from Remploy employees. We will take time to analyse the consultation responses in detail and carefully consider the implications for future policy. We will publish a summary of responses received and a statement on future policy as soon as practicably possible.</p>

The figures from the Family Resources Survey are based on a sample of households which have been adjusted for non-response using multi-purpose grossing factors which align the Family Resources Survey to Government office region population by age and sex. Estimates are subject to sampling error and remaining non-response error. 3. The 'social rented sector' is defined as all cases where the local authority is the landlord, and all housing associations including New Town Development Corporations and the Scottish Special Housing Association except where accommodation is part of the job. 4. A Household is defined as a single person or group of people living at the same address as their only or main residence, who either share one meal a day together or share the living accommodation (ie a living room). A household will consist of one of more benefit units (ie two single adults in a two bed household would count as two benefit units, but only one household). 5. A benefit unit is defined as a single adult or a married or cohabiting couple and dependent children; from January 2006 same-sex partners (civil partners and cohabitees) are included in the same benefit unit. 6. For married or cohabiting couples, if either individual is classified as a pensioner, then the benefit unit is classified as a pensioner benefit unit and therefore excluded from this analysis. 7. Working age households are defined as households having at least one (possibly more) working age benefit units. 8. The employment status of adults has been defined using the Adult Employment Status&#8212;based on the ILO definition. <i>Source:</i> Family Resources Survey 2009/10</td> </tr>

	<p pid="a.523W.2/17"><i>(c)</i> The reassessment of existing incapacity benefits customers using the Work Capability Assessment (WCA) was rolled out nationally from February 2011.</p>
	<p pid="a.523W.2/18">Letters are being issued as planned to 11,000 claimants per week informing them that their reassessment is about to commence. To manage the process smoothly, volumes were gradually ramped up from the end of February, and the numbers reached 11,000 per week in May. As at the end of September 2011, approximately 128,000 WCAs have been completed for IB Reassessment claimants. After the WCA, the decision on entitlement to benefit is taken by a DWP Decision Maker.</p>
	<p pid="a.523W.2/19">No official statistics are available on WCAs completed for IB Reassessment claimants so the information on the number of WCAs completed above is from the Department's management information system. It relates to those assessments where Atos have made a recommendation based on either a face to face assessment or cleared by scrutiny of the customer's medical questionnaire. It does not include those customers whose WCA recommendations were returned to Jobcentre Plus because they had not complied with the process.</p>
	<p pid="a.523W.2/20">As it was never the intention to publish this management information, it has not been subject to the same rigorous quality assurance processes that are used for official statistics and as a result it should be used with a degree of caution. In addition, a monthly breakdown of the management information is not reliable because the data are captured by week. This means that for those weeks that cross over a month end the data cannot be attributed to any particular calendar month.</p>
	<p pid="a.523W.2/21">Due to the overall length of the incapacity benefits reassessment process, information on the entire process including the final outcomes and subsequent destinations of claimants being reassessed is not yet available. Individual level data are being collected, but it will take time to complete because of the overall length of the reassessment process. The Department plans to publish data on the outcomes of the reassessment process but only once it has been quality assured and is considered robust.</p>

	<p pid="a.525W.2/1">There are no plans to allow Work programme providers to share their performance data ahead of the publication of official Work programme statistics, nor do we intend to change the contract clause that prevents providers from publishing their performance data. This is essential to ensure that the publication of official information is properly managed in line with the UK Statistics Authority legislation. Early publication of providers' own performance data could undermine the principle of making the information available to all at the same time through the official publication process and also impact on the accuracy of the data.</p>
	<p pid="a.525W.2/2">The Work programme only started in June 2011, it lasts two years for each individual and, as providers only receive job outcome payments once a participant has been in employment and off benefit for up to 26 weeks, it will be 2012 before performance data start to be recorded. The intention is therefore to publish official statistics on referrals to the Work programme from spring 2012 and on job outcomes from autumn 2012.</p>
	<p pid="a.525W.2/3">In line with the Government's transparency agenda we have published providers' minimum service offers to all customers to ensure that customers are aware what they can expect, and that providers live up to what they have told us they will deliver.</p>

	<p pid="a.547W.2/1">While the process of bidding for public sector contracts will involve some administrative costs for both the public sector organisation and potential bidders, a number of new initiatives have been put in place. Firstly, all public sector opportunities can be found in one central place, Contracts Finder, which went live in January 2011. Also the Department has removed the need to undertake lengthy pre-qualification questionnaires for projects under &#163;100,000, which has shortened the procurement process, thus reducing the administrative and cost burden incurred by the supplier.</p>
	<p pid="a.547W.2/2">The public sector as a whole is also looking to shorten the time taken to conduct <i>Official Journal of the European Union</i> (OJEU) tenders with a number of measures being considered at present, to make the procurement process more effective and efficient. One of these is to conduct earlier market engagement before the procurement process even starts, to help shape actual requirements, which lead to better drafted statement of requirements, that are outcome based. Thus providing a clearer idea to suppliers about what is actually required.</p>

	<p pid="a.552W.12/2">The Department for Education has jointly funded with the Department of Health a programme of research as part of the Safeguarding Children Research Initiative. This comprises 12 major research studies which aim to support improvements in the early recognition of neglect and abuse.</p>
	<p pid="a.552W.12/3">Key findings from research on the impact of neglect, summarised in the forthcoming overview of studies in the Initiative 'Safeguarding Children Across Services: Messages from research on identifying and responding to child maltreatment', show that neglect can have serious long-term effects on children's cognitive, socio-emotional, and behavioural development. The stage of life at which a child experiences neglectful parenting is important, as is the duration of the experience.</p>
	<p pid="a.552W.12/4">Neglectful parenting can have an impact on early attachment and subsequent development. Children who receive care which is unpredictable, rejecting or insensitive are more likely to develop attachments which are less secure. Children who have experienced neglectful parenting may have poorer emotional knowledge and be less able to discriminate between different kinds of emotions.</p>
	<p pid="a.552W.12/5">Long-term neglect in the early years is linked with conduct disorder, eating disorders, attempted and actual suicide, substance misuse, aggression and violent behaviour. Lack of stimulation in early childhood can result in delayed speech and language problems. The consequences of neglect are also known to extend to physical and mental health and to persist into adult life.</p>
	<p pid="a.552W.12/6">A neglected child's system of response to stress develops abnormally and this in turn results in increased vulnerability to a range of psychological, emotional and physical health problems throughout the lifespan.</p>
	<p pid="a.552W.12/7">Both structural and functional abnormalities are found in neglected children's brains. Changes in the areas of the brain that are concerned with emotional life and its regulation (physical, behavioural, emotional and attachment systems), have potentially highly damaging and long-term effects for those suffering neglect.</p>
	<p pid="a.552W.12/8">The Department does not have an estimate of the cost of dealing with the impact of behaviour of children of long-term early years neglect.</p>

The findings from these trials will be used to inform, develop and strengthen the revised Working Together guidance on assessment.

	<p pid="a.567W.5/1">The Department does not hold data on the regional differences in the price of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG). The price of LPG is affected by a range of factors, including crude oil prices, refinery capacity, stock levels, distribution costs and increased demand for heating during winter.</p>
	<p pid="a.567W.5/2">The Competition Commission's 2006 investigation into domestic bulk LPG found that there were no distinct regional or local markets with prices being broadly similar in all regions of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. However, the CC did identify some features of the market that led to weak competition. As a result of its findings the CC made two orders. The Office of Fair Trading has a statutory duty to keep under review undertakings and orders following a Market Investigation Reference to the CC and consider whether these have been or are being complied with. In its recent off-grid energy market study, the OFT noted that the emerging picture on compliance with the orders is broadly positive and that the collective market shares of the big four suppliers had fallen from 90% to 85% while 10 smaller suppliers had grown their customer base by 10% or more since the orders were introduced. The OFT will keep compliance with the orders under review.</p>

The Building Regulations already set minimum standards of energy efficiency when property owners choose to install or replace fixed lighting systems.

The Regulations were amended in 2010 to strengthen standards and an impact assessment supporting these regulations can be found on my Department's website.</p>

It is an essential requirement for progress towards EU accession under the EU's Stabilisation and Association Process (SAP). We remain firmly supportive of the SAP, as well as other initiatives aimed at promoting co-operation. An important example of the latter is the EU-facilitated dialogue between Kosovo and Serbia, aimed at normalising co-operation between the two countries. We have also welcomed initiatives such as the 2010 Istanbul Declaration, establishing a mechanism for regular political dialogue between Serbia, Turkey and Bosnia and Herzegovina, and the Brdo process, established by Croatia and Slovenia as a forum for regional dialogue. We are also using UK conflict prevention funding to support regional projects.</p>

We recognise the importance of fostering collaboration between Government Departments, academia and industry in order to meet these challenges, and significant work already takes place in this regard that we would not wish to duplicate. For example, the Government's key needs for technical advice and related support on nuclear non-proliferation and nuclear security issues are met through the cross-government arrangements that were announced in the strategic defence and security review (SDSR). Co-ordination and oversight are provided through the Cabinet Office chaired counter proliferation committee, which reports to the National Security Council. My Department also engages with industry, science and academic forums on nuclear security best practice and professional development, notably as part of the Nuclear Security Summit process, and regularly briefs non-governmental organisations, industry, university students and international partners on this Government's non-proliferation and nuclear security priorities. In addition, the newly-formed cross-Whitehall International Civil Nuclear Group provides a focal point for relevant organisations, industry and UK posts overseas to foster collaboration and international partnerships.</p>

	<p pid="a.585W.3/1">Tibet was discussed at the last round of the UK-China Human Rights dialogue in January 2011, and the dialogue also included an expert workshop on minority rights and languages, an area of particular relevance to Tibet. Ministers have regularly raised our concerns about the human rights situation in Tibet with China at the highest political levels.</p>
	<p pid="a.585W.3/2">We are particularly concerned at recent reports that a nun and young monks, including Lobsang Kalsang, Lobsang Konchock and Kalsang Wangchuk, in Tibetan areas of Sichuan province have self-immolated. I have written to the Chinese ambassador in April this year raising my concerns regarding the situation at the Kirti monastery. More recently Foreign and Commonwealth Office officials have raised their concerns with the Chinese embassy in London and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Beijing, urging the Chinese Government to work with local monasteries and communities to resolve the grievances which have led to these self-immolations. Our embassy officials in China make regular visits to Tibetan areas, and have done so recently. We have kept in frequent contact with the Foreign Affairs Office in Sichuan and local Public Security Bureau offices regarding access to these areas.</p>
	<p pid="a.585W.3/3">Our consistent position has been that long-term stability can only be achieved through respect for human rights and genuine autonomy for Tibet within the framework of the Chinese constitution. Meaningful dialogue between the Dalai Lama's representatives and the Chinese authorities is the best way to make this happen.</p>

In addition, the Government have asked Dame Carol Black and David Frost to carry out an independent review looking at ways to reduce sickness absence which will report shortly and which will feed into the wider employment law review. Separately, Professor Ragnar Lofstedt is chairing the independent review of health and safety legislation, which is considering the evidence for reducing the burden of health and safety legislation on UK businesses.</p>

	<p pid="a.589W.6/1">The Department's August 2011 Small and Medium Enterprise (SME) Business Barometer Survey shows that 16% of SME employers (i.e. excluding sole traders) have tried to obtain external finance in the previous six months. The majority of SMEs seeking finance are able to obtain the finance they need, with a minority not being able to raise any finance. For instance, of those seeking finance, 21% were unable to obtain any finance from any source approached. This is at a similar level to the previous February 2011 Business Barometer Survey, and is equivalent to around 4% of all SME employers overall.</p>

	<p pid="a.591W.2/1">This Department has secured a reasonable outcome to European negotiations on the Consumer Rights Directive, whereby key existing UK consumer rights were protected and rights were even increased in some areas, notably to prevent over-charging for use of means of payment such as credit and debit cards. We will soon be consulting on how we implement this measure into UK law.</p>

We want well-informed, empowered consumers who can make good decisions such as finding the best credit card or loan deal and when to borrow and who to borrow from. In July we published our full response on personal insolvency issues and our interim response on consumer credit. We will publish our final response before the end of the year.</p>
	<p pid="a.591W.2/4">We have also just completed a consultation on the simplifying of the consumer landscape so that individuals are clearer about who to turn to for advice on consumer issues and to ensure that they are properly protected through consumer redress.

	<p pid="a.591W.5/1">The Artist's Resale Right (ARR) Directive was agreed in 2001, and implemented into UK law in 2006. Under the terms of the directive, the UK was able to delay the full implementation of the right (payments on the sales of works by deceased artists) until 2012. Without reopening the directive, there is no option to delay full implementation beyond that date.</p>
	<p pid="a.591W.5/2">An evaluation of the effect of extending the ARR to estates of deceased artists can be found on the independent study commissioned by the Government &#8220;Study into the effect of the UK art market of the introduction of the artist's resale right 2008&#8221;, which forecasts resale right payments to increase fourfold when payments to deceased artists commence in 2012. This is expected to reach some &#163;12 million a year in a market with an annual turnover of around &#163;8 billion.</p>

	<p pid="a.597W.3/1">The Department has examined as far as possible all of the comparable international evidence on labour market flexibility. The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) Jobs Study Review of 2006 summarises most of this evidence in &#8216;Boosting Jobs and Income&#8212;Policy Lessons from Reassessing the OECD Jobs Strategy&#8217; and I draw attention to some of the following conclusions in it, as follows:</p>
	<p pid="a.597W.3/2">&#8220;The experience over the past two decades shows that there is no single combination of policies and institutions to achieve and maintain good labour market performance. For example, it is not necessary that all individual policies are aimed at strong labour market performance, provided that adverse stances in some policy areas are more than compensated for by favourable settings in other areas, e.g. by exploiting policy interactions. This allows some scope to tailor policy packages to suit national preferences with respect to equity, risk-taking and other objectives. However, in practice there are few feasible policy combinations to achieve satisfactory employment outcomes&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="a.597W.3/3">The study also identified the UK as a &#8216;successful employment performer&#8217; and suggested that it fell into a group of countries that are &#8216;market reliant&#8217; which include light employment protection in its policy package. Australia, Canada, Japan, Korea, New Zealand, Switzerland and the United States are the other countries identified in this group by the OECD.</p>
	<p pid="a.597W.3/4">The OECD also identified another group of countries as &#8216;successful performers&#8217; with different but successful policy packages. These include Austria, Denmark, Ireland, the Netherlands, Norway and Sweden.</p>
	<p pid="a.597W.3/5">The Government, through its employment law and growth reviews aim to build upon this and foster greater employment and growth.</p>

	<p pid="a.610W.3/2">First, by focusing on the enforcement of the existing regulations, in particular during port state inspections where there is evidence that crew fatigue has the potential to affect the safe operation of ships;</p>

The MCA has been contributing expertise to the EU-funded &#8220;HORIZON&#8221; project which is examining the effects of fatigue on performance, and is expected to report early in 2012.</p>
