	<p pid="e.2W.0/1">The Malaysian Federal Constitution guarantees freedom of religion. However, Muslims are subject to Shari'a law with respect to family matters which includes apostasy. Muslims can only change their religion with the permission of a Shari'a Court who will often not allow this, and may order periods of rehabilitation and other penalties for those who attempt to do it. In addition, the application of Shari'a is a state, rather than federal matter and so varies around the country&mdash;the State of Negeri Sembilan allows apostasy. This complicated issue impacts on a minority of people who wish to leave Islam&mdash;a recent survey by an academic found that there were only 100 applications to the Shari'a Courts to apostatise between 1994-2003. The majority of applicants are from people who had previously converted to Islam for the purpose of marriage.</p>
	<p pid="e.2W.0/2">There are no anti-conversion laws in Indonesian civil law. The constitution of Indonesia guarantees freedom of religion.</p>
	<p pid="e.2W.0/3">There are anti-conversion laws in India. However, to date, nobody has raised with us specific cases of abuse, where anti-conversion laws have been used to prevent someone from willingly changing their religion.</p>
	<p pid="e.2W.0/4">There is no anti-conversion legislation in Pakistan, although converts from Islam to other religions are subject to various social pressures and harassment and the blasphemy laws are often abused in this context.</p>
	<p pid="e.2W.0/5">The Government, along with our EU partners, follow closely developments in states where anti-conversion laws exist. We condemn all instances where individuals are persecuted because of their faith or belief, wherever they happen and whatever the religion of the individual or group concerned. We urge all states to pursue laws and practices which foster tolerance and mutual respect and to protect religious minorities from discrimination.</p>
	<p pid="e.2W.0/6">The Malaysian Federal Constitution was amended in 2001 to provide against discrimination on grounds of gender.</p>
	<p pid="e.2W.0/7">The Malaysian Government ratified Convention on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) in 1995 and presented their first report to the CEDAW committee earlier this year. There are concerns that the rights of women in divorce and inheritance are not equal to those of men in the Shari'a Courts. There are also concerns that the proposed new Islamic Family Law Act will do little to alleviate this, with a widespread perception that it is even more detrimental to the status of Muslim women than existing laws, including making polygamy easier. However, the Government are re-examining the bill following concerns by non-governmental organisations and are consulting women's groups on the revision.</p>
	<p pid="e.2W.0/8">The Indonesian Government, through the Ministry of Women's Affairs, are actively working to increase the participation of women. In general, women play a significant and growing role in Indonesian society.</p>
	<p pid="e.2W.0/9">In India, there is increasing awareness of women's rights issues. The Government are working with a number of organisations, including the National Commission for Women, to highlight and address these issues. One example includes a sponsored visit to the UK earlier this year by the chairperson of the National Commission for Women.</p>
	<p pid="e.2W.0/10">We welcome the passing of the Women's Protection Bill in Pakistan, which marks a significant step forward on the &quot;enlightened moderation&quot; agenda. We will follow with interest the progress of further proposed reforms to improve women's rights.</p>

	<p pid="e.3W.2/1">We want to encourage China to act as a responsible member of the international community and support its closer integration into the international system, including through multilateral institutions such as the World Trade Organisation (WTO). To that end, Ministers raise WTO issues regularly in bilaterals with their Chinese counterparts, as indeed I did in July in my visit to China. Most recently, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry visited China from 26 to <phrase class="date" code="">30 November</phrase>. He emphasised the need for China to play an active role in the current WTO round and to continue opening up its markets.</p>
	<p pid="e.3W.2/2">The WTO is an important pillar of the multilateral system and we encourage all WTO members to abide by their WTO obligations. At the EU General Affairs and External Relations Council on 11 to <phrase class="date" code="">12 December</phrase>, EU Foreign Ministers adopted conclusions welcoming the Commission Communication &quot;EU-China: Closer Partners, Growing Responsibilities&quot; and the Commission working paper &quot;Competition and Partnership&quot;. The Commission documents stress the mutual benefits of enhanced trade and economic relations between the EU and China, and the importance of China fully implementing its WTO obligations. The UK worked with other member states to ensure that the Conclusions reflect our position.</p>

	<p pid="e.16W.5/1">Darlington has benefited greatly since 1997 from Government support for its transport needs.</p>
	<p pid="e.16W.5/2">Between 1997 and March 2006 Darlington borough council received around &pound;22.2 million in block grant for capital investment for its local transport plans. An assessment of Darlington's second Local Transport Plan running until 2011 and a further funding package of support was published in a written statement by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State on <phrase class="date" code="2006-12-18">18 December 2006</phrase>, <i> Official Report, </i>columns 132-33WS.</p>
	<p pid="e.16W.5/3">In April 2004, Darlington was allocated &pound;3.24 million over five years as a Sustainable Travel Town. In October 2005 the borough was awarded Cycling Demonstration Town status and allocated &pound;1.5 million over three calendar years.</p>
	<p pid="e.16W.5/4">In the whole of the North East region a total of &pound;457 million has been set aside over the next 10 years for local authority major schemes and Highways Agency schemes of regional importance.</p>
	<p pid="e.16W.5/5">In the advice from the North East to Government on the allocation of these funds, a &pound;33 million scheme to improve the bus network across the Tees Valley, including Darlington, was identified as a priority. The Government have not yet approved this scheme but have confirmed that it would expect it to be added to the regional programme subject to the promoters producing a satisfactory business case that demonstrates value for money and deliverability.</p>
	<p pid="e.16W.5/6">Darlington has benefited from rail and trunk road improvements both across the North East and nationally, but funding for these is neither recorded nor allocated on an individual transport authority level.</p>
	<p pid="e.16W.5/7">The borough has also received very substantial central funding through revenue support grant. This is not allocated by the Government between individual council services.</p>

This is part of a framework of measures aiming to reduce the need to travel and promote more sustainable transport choices, thereby tackling urban congestion. Government policy on out-of-town shopping is therefore consistent with the Eddington study, which identifies this as a priority.</p>

	<p pid="e.19W.0/1">The number of patients removed from waiting lists rose steadily throughout the 1990s, peaking in 1999 then falling and stabilising. The waiting list rules are clear that patients should be removed from lists if they are no longer waiting or are unavailable for treatment. Patients should also be removed from a provider's list when they are transferred to a different provider for treatment.</p>
	<p pid="e.19W.0/2">The trends in self-deferrals and suspensions closely follow the trend in the inpatient waiting list. The list peaked in 1998, as did self-deferrals, with suspensions peaking in 1999. The reductions in recent years reflect improved management by the National Health Service, which has contributed to the smaller waiting lists and faster times that patients experience today.</p>
	<p pid="e.19W.0/3">The unusually high rates of growth in other referrals, those not from general practitioners or general dental practitioners, in the first three years of the period are likely to reflect improvements in data quality resulting from better recording of this type of activity.</p>
	<p pid="e.19W.0/4">Since 1998-99 the average growth in other referrals is 6 per cent. This growth may be explained by the increasing specialisation of consultants, with more patients being referred from consultant to consultant, and by increases in referrals to consultants from the likes of physiotherapists.</p>

The Department has supported primary care trusts through guidance on local programmes of improvement, published in November 2005.</p>
	<p pid="e.19W.3/2">The Department is spending &pound;1.7 million in 2006-07 on the &quot;Know your Limits&quot; campaign, which seeks to prevent binge drinking. The Home Office is contributing additional funding.</p>
	<p pid="e.19W.3/3">The Department plans to spend &pound;1.5 million in 2006-07 and &pound;1.7 million from 2007-08 on trailblazer projects to develop interventions and brief advice for hazardous and harmful drinkers in primary care, accident and emergency, and criminal justice settings.</p>
	<p pid="e.19W.3/4">We estimate that &pound;217 million was spent on alcohol treatment by PCTs and local authorities in 2003-04.</p>
	<p pid="e.19W.3/5">We have previously announced that &pound;15 million has been included in PCTs' general allocations from 2007-08 to help improve local arrangements for commissioning and delivering alcohol interventions.</p>
	<p pid="e.19W.3/6">Spending on prevention of alcohol-related disorder is a matter for the Home Office. Funding for school and college-based education is a matter for the Department for Education and Skills.</p>

	<p pid="e.23W.0/1">Carisoprodol, brand name Carisoma, is a muscle relaxant authorised as an add-on therapy to the symptomatic treatment of acute musculoskeletal disorders associated with muscle spasm. Clinical trials carried out by the marketing authorisation holder for carisoprodol were evaluated at the time of licensing to ensure that it met appropriate standards of safety, quality and efficacy to justify its use as a muscle relaxant. Full guidance on prescribing and the use of carisoprodol, including possible side- effects, is provided in the product information for prescribers, the Summary of Product Characteristics, and the patient information leaflet.</p>
	<p pid="e.23W.0/2">Since the marketing of carisoprodol, although no formal research has been commissioned, the Commission on Human Medicines (CHM) and the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) have kept under review its safety in routine clinical practice.</p>
	<p pid="e.23W.0/3">Up to <phrase class="date" code="2005-11-29">29 November 2005</phrase>, a total of 31 reports of suspected adverse drug reactions (ADRs) have been received in association with carisoprodol. The majority of these (28 out of 31 reports) were received prior to 1982. Of the 31 reports, a total of 20 reports describe suspected side-effects from using carisoprodol that are not listed in the patient information leaflet. Urticaria, three reports, and chills, two reports, are the only unlisted suspected side-effects associated with carisoprodol reported in more than one patient. It is important to note that a report of a suspected ADR does not necessarily mean that the drug caused it.</p>
	<p pid="e.23W.0/4">In June 2005 the MHRA was alerted to concerns about the effect that an individual's genetic makeup may have on how they metabolise carisoprodol and that this may have implications for the likelihood of experiencing potential side-effects associated with its use. Following a review of the available data, the Summary of Product Characteristics and the patient Information leaflet have been updated to reflect these new data and to add a warning that patients who are so called &quot;poor metabolisers&quot; for a specific enzyme, Cytochrome 2C19, involved in the metabolism of carisoprodol may be at an increased risk of certain side-effects such as drowsiness.</p>
	<p pid="e.23W.0/5">In parallel with this action, the overall balance of risks and benefits of carisoprodol has been raised at European level. The MHRA in conjunction with its European counterparts is currently re-evaluating the risk and benefits of carisoprodol and considering what implications this may have for its clinical use. As soon as the European review is completed the results will be made publicly available.</p>
	<p pid="e.23W.0/6">The use of carisoprodol in the UK is limited and the British National Formulary, a joint publication of the British Medical Association and the Royal Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain, advises doctors that carisoprodol may not be considered as a drug of first choice although its use may be justifiable in certain circumstances.</p>
	<p pid="e.23W.0/7">The length of time for the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) to re-evaluate a drug by completing of a risk: benefit review depends on the public health impact of the safety or efficacy concerns and is commensurate with the need for a thorough evaluation of the available data.</p>

	<p pid="e.24W.5/1">The Child Health Interim Application (CHIA) is currently live in 10 primary care trusts (PCTs) in the London area. Supporting manual systems continue to operate for some aspects of the system's functionality, which remain under development. Software to enable PCTs to generate COVER reports from the live system is expected to be deployed into the live system in April 2007. Meanwhile, COVER reports for each PCT, using live CHIA data, are being produced centrally on a quarterly basis in line with Health Protection Agency submission requirements. However, due to a backlog of data, which have not yet been loaded on to the CHIA system, some PCTs have requested their data are not published until local data quality queries have been addressed.</p>
	<p pid="e.24W.5/2">Successful deployments of child health systems by the national programme for information technology have already taken place in 48 PCTs across the programme's north-east and eastern cluster areas. The system enables production of the required statutory reports, and a robust data migration and checking procedure is in place, ensuring successful migrations of demographic and clinical data to the new system, which provides a fully integrated patient record across primary care. Experience has shown that the key variable around successful implementation and operation is the quality of local record keeping standards and processes.</p>

This is because monitoring the effectiveness of programmes of this nature is best done locally, by NHS trusts, working with their partners and stakeholders. However, the National Primary Care Research and Development Centre, was funded to carry out an in-depth evaluation of the Evercare pilot, the precursor to the community matron service.

	<p pid="e.33W.0/1">The August 2006 audit of waiting times for genito-urinary {GUM) clinics, for which data are available showed that 13 per cent. of attendees were offered an appointment within two weeks (0 to 13 days). The percentage of patients that were not seen within two weeks (0 to 13 days) and not offered an earlier appointment is 12 per cent. This compares to 29 per cent. of attenders not seen within two weeks in May 2004. Good progress is being made to our target of access to GUM clinics within 48 hours: the August audit showed that 57 per cent. of patients were seen within 48 hours and this rose to 65 per cent. in the November audit which has just been published.</p>

	<p pid="e.37W.2/1">As the report states, accident and emergency (A and E) units are not always the best places to treat heart attack and stroke victims.</p>
	<p pid="e.37W.2/2">For treatment of heart attack, the key facility required is a catheterisation laboratory. The Department and the new opportunities fund have provided funding of &pound;125 million to build 90 new or replacement catheterisation laboratories in England, increasing the capacity previously available by more than 50 per cent. The emerging findings from our national study of primary angioplasty show that the best times are achieved by ambulance paramedic triage and taking patients direct to the catheterisation laboratory without going via the A and E department.</p>
	<p pid="e.37W.2/3">It is more appropriate for stroke victims to be taken directly to a stroke unit rather than to an A and E unit. Early analysis of best evidence provides an estimate that to provide immediate scanning for all stroke patients and increase uptake of thrombolysis to 4 per cent., currently being achieved by the centre with the highest thrombolysis rate in England, will cost &pound;6.7 million to &pound;8.7 million. To increase uptake to 10 per cent. (currently being achieved by leading centres around the world) the estimated cost is &pound;10.9 million to &pound;12.9 million. However, analysis also demonstrates that this investment will result in considerable long-term savings, and allow a significant number of stroke patients not only to survive, but to live fully independent lives.</p>

	<p pid="e.37W.5/1">The national service framework for coronary heart disease set a target that thrombolysis, treatment with clot-busting drugs, should be given to heart attack patients within 60 minutes of calling for professional help. Good progress has been made with meeting this target but there has been less progress in reducing the time from pain to call. Public awareness of symptoms is a key issue here. The Department is supporting the British Heart Foundation's recently launched campaign to raise awareness of heart attack symptoms. Primary angioplasty is most effective when delivered within three hours of onset of symptoms but will provide some benefit up to 12 hours after they have developed.</p>
	<p pid="e.37W.5/2">Thrombolysis for stroke patients must be delivered within three hours of onset of stroke. The licence for the thrombolytic drug for stroke is only for delivery within three hours. It must be noted that a stroke may not involve pain so increasing awareness of the symptoms of stroke is an important part of delivering thrombolysis. The Department is currently supporting the Stroke Association FAST campaign which provides a clear and simple test to identify a stroke.</p>

	<p pid="e.40W.2/1">Tackling MRSA is a priority for Government and the national health service. We have set a target to halve the number of MRSA bloodstream infections by 2008 and each acute trust has its own target. The Department and its partner organisations have developed a range of mutually reinforcing activities that ensure combating the spread of MRSA is embedded in everyday procedures and policies, in particular:</p>
	<p pid="e.40W.2/2" class="indent">all acute trusts are signed-up to the 'Saving Lives' package of best practice which, if implemented in full, should combat MRSA spread in the acute sector. It is supplemented by the 'Essential Steps' initiative, designed for non-acute care settings;</p>
	<p pid="e.40W.2/3" class="indent">mandatory MRSA surveillance, which continues to be developed/enhanced;</p>
	<p pid="e.40W.2/4" class="indent">the first ever national hand hygiene programme for hospital staff 'cleanyourhands', has progressed to its second year;</p>
	<p pid="e.40W.2/5" class="indent">a root cause analysis tool was published in September 2006 to help trusts investigate and better understand how and why MRSA bloodstream infections occur and hence where they should focus their action to prevent them;</p>
	<p pid="e.40W.2/6" class="indent">a statutory code of practice which requires NHS bodies to have appropriate management and clinical governance systems in place to deliver effective infection control came into force on <phrase class="date" code="">1 October</phrase>;</p>
	<p pid="e.40W.2/7" class="indent">enhanced advice on screening patients at risk was published on <phrase class="date" code="">16 November</phrase>; and</p>
	<p pid="e.40W.2/8" class="indent">acute trusts have been invited to apply for additional capital resources to help tackle healthcare associated infections, with &pound;50 million set aside for this purpose.</p>
	<p pid="e.40W.2/9">Additionally, tailored support is available for those trusts in the most challenging positions. Improvement teams will during 2006-07, work with about 50 trusts, so as to help identify those issues that prevent reduction in infections at the local level, and help them develop action plans to speed up and sustain progress.</p>

	<p pid="e.47W.0/1">The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) is the United Kingdom regulatory authority with responsibility for the licensing and control of medicines on the UK market.</p>
	<p pid="e.47W.0/2">In the UK, medicinal products on the UK market are controlled under the Medicines Act 1968 and supporting regulations. The Act places controls on the sale, supply, distribution and manufacture of medicinal products in the UK. It also places a statutory duty on the Secretary of State for Health to enforce, or secure the enforcement of, the provisions of the Act. Section 8 contains rights of entry, powers to inspect products and equipment, to take samples and to seize products and documentation in order to ascertain whether or not there may have been a contravention of the legislative requirements. MHRA guidance on the legislative requirements is available in the &quot;Rules and Guidance for Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and Distributors 2002&quot; and on the MHRA website at <a href="http://www.mhra.gov.uk">www.mhra.gov.uk</a>. No specific MHRA guidance is issued to retailers.</p>
	<p pid="e.47W.0/3">Medicinal products which do not meet the regulatory requirements cannot be guaranteed for their safety, quality or efficacy and may pose a significant risk to public health and their sale or supply may constitute a criminal offence. Products suspected of breaching these legislative requirements can be inspected, sampled and seized under powers available under section 8 of the Act. If it is not known whether or not a product offered for sale is falling outside licensing requirements, a sample can be taken and submitted for analysis.</p>
	<p pid="e.47W.0/4">Enforcement officers at MHRA carry out investigations into suspected illegal activity involving medicines on a UK-wide basis. If products in stock at a retail outlet are found to be illegally on sale, they can be seized and removed from the premises. The products seized from Hedonic in Southsea were in response to an adverse drug reaction report for a product on sale for humans and containing Benzyl Piperazine (BZP) a derivative of a veterinary product, Piperazine. MHRA investigations are continuing.</p>

	<p pid="e.52W.3/1">National health service bodies are legally autonomous and it is for them to take steps to reduce carbon dioxide emissions where local circumstances permit. To help in this process the Department has issued guidance for the NHS, set out in &quot;Encode&quot;, on a range of steps to improve energy and carbon efficiency. The NHS is also subject to mandatory energy and carbon targets, set by the Government in April 2001. These require it to achieve efficiency savings of 15 per cent. energy, or 0.15 million tonnes carbon, from a base year of March 2000 to March 2010.</p>

Such emissions cover water vapour, carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, ozone and chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs). The Department's estates returns information collection (ERIC) database only collects information from which to calculate energy, carbon dioxide and equivalent carbon emissions.</p>

	<p pid="e.57W.6/3">The rise in costs to 2004-05 was due to a change in the numbers used for population.

	<p pid="e.61W.11/1">National health service resource allocation is based on the principle of weighted-capitation, whereby resources are distributed between areas on the basis of the relative needs of their populations.</p>
	<p pid="e.61W.11/2">The weighted-capitation formula is continuously overseen by the Advisory Committee on Resource Allocation (ACRA). ACRA's role is to ensure equity in resource allocation. ACRA is an independent body which has NHS management, general practitioner, and academic members. Prior to each allocations round, ACRA agrees a work programme to support the revenue allocations to primary care trusts (PCTs). On completion of the work programme, ACRA makes recommendations to Ministers on possible changes to the weighted-capitation formula. Decisions on changes to the weighted-capitation formula are made prior to each allocations round.</p>
	<p pid="e.61W.11/3">Since 1997 the following changes have been made to the weighted capitation formula:</p>
	<p pid="e.61W.11/4" class="italic"> 1997-98 changes to the weighted capitation formula</p>
	<p pid="e.61W.11/5">In 1997-98 two changes were made to hospital and community health services allocations:</p>
	<p pid="e.61W.11/6" class="indent">community health services were weighted for additional need;</p>
	<p pid="e.61W.11/7" class="indent">the staff market forces factor (MFF) was revised.</p>

	<p pid="e.61W.11/11" class="indent">the emergency ambulance cost adjustment (EACA) was introduced.</p>

	<p pid="e.61W.11/13" class="italic"> 1999-2000 changes to the weighted-capitation formula</p>
	<p pid="e.61W.11/14">Prior to 1999-2000, there were separate funding streams for HCHS, prescribing and general practice infrastructure (GMSCL). In 1999-2000 these became a single unified allocation.</p>
	<p pid="e.61W.11/15">In addition, an English language difficulties adjustment (ELDA) was introduced as a supplement to the formula, for the extra costs of interpretation, advocacy and translation services.</p>

	<p pid="e.61W.11/19">Four main changes were made to the weighted-capitation formula in 2002-03:</p>
	<p pid="e.61W.11/20" class="indent">a new general medical services non-cash limited (GMSNCL) component was introduced;</p>
	<p pid="e.61W.11/21" class="indent">the additional need adjustment in the new GMSNCL component replaced the existing additional need adjustment in the general medical services cash limited (GMSCL) component;</p>

	<p pid="e.61W.11/25">In November 1998, Ministers announced a wide- ranging review of the weighted-capitation formula. The main objective for this review was &quot;to contribute to the reduction in avoidable health inequalities&quot;. The review was carried out under the auspices of ACRA. The new formula replaced both the existing formula and the HIA, and has been used for the 2003-04 to 2005-06 and the 2006-07 and 2007-08 allocations rounds.</p>
	<p pid="e.61W.11/26">Three main changes were made to the weighted-capitation formula for the 2003-04 to the 2005-06 allocations round:</p>

	<p pid="e.61W.11/32">The following changes were made to the weighted-capitation formula for the 2006-07 and 2007-08 revenue allocations:</p>

	<p pid="e.63W.2/1">The Government are serious about tackling alcohol misuse and reducing alcohol-related harms. The Know Your Limits campaign focuses on young people who are binge drinkers, because research shows that 18 to 24-year-olds are most likely to drink irresponsibly and cause harm to themselves and others. It aims to ensure that sufficient information exists to help everyone to become more aware of the risks to individual health and personal safety that alcohol misuse can bring, and to make informed choices on the basis of that information.</p>
	<p pid="e.63W.2/2">The campaign is designed also to reach a secondary audience of hazardous, harmful, dependent, and pregnant drinkers. These groups are being targeted through public relations and stakeholder work. Literature advising people how to drink sensibly has been produced by the Department, which targets these audiences.</p>

	<p pid="e.64W.8/1">Information on the number of children prescribed Ritalin (methylphenidate) is not collected.</p>
	<p pid="e.64W.8/2">In March 2006, the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) published guidance on the use of drugs to treat Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). NICE has estimated that around 5 per cent. of school-aged children meet the diagnostic criteria for ADHD, equivalent to 366,000 children and adolescents in England and Wales, but not all these children will require medication. In the year to <phrase class="date" code="2006-08-31">31 August 2006</phrase>, 384,000 prescriptions for methylphenidate were dispensed in England to children aged 0 to 15 years and those aged 16 to 18 years in full time education.</p>
	<p pid="e.64W.8/3">We have no evidence to suggest that inappropriate prescribing of methylphenidate is widespread. NICE has recommended that drug treatment for ADHD should only be initiated by an appropriately qualified healthcare professional with expertise in ADHD and should be based on a comprehensive assessment and diagnosis. Continued prescribing and monitoring of drug treatment may be performed by general practitioners, under shared care arrangements.</p>
	<p pid="e.64W.8/4">Methylphenidate is classified under the Misuse of Drugs Regulations 2001 as a schedule 2 controlled drug. As such, it is subject to additional restrictions in its use, for example it must be kept in a secure place that meets the requirements of the Safe Custody Regulations 1973. Amendments to the Misuse of Drugs Regulations in July 2006 brought in a standard prescription form for private prescribing of schedule two and three controlled drugs. Thus, the national data will now cover both national health service and private prescribing of methylphenidate by prescriber but not by patient.</p>

	<p pid="e.67W.0/2">However, there will be PCTs that do contribute to the specific funding of projects such as the sexual assault referral centres (SARCs) which are funding jointly by the police and health service locally and involve voluntary sector partnerships.</p>
	<p pid="e.67W.0/3">The statutory health services for children will also have in contact with them children who have been sexually abused and exploited for example through CAMHS (child and adolescent mental health services).

	<p pid="e.67W.3/1">The most recent estimate of the burden of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) in the United Kingdom comes from a study published in the <i> British Medical Journal</i> in July 2004. The study conducted in two large hospitals in Merseyside, suggested that ADRs account for 6 per cent. of hospital admissions. This is a similar estimate to a number of studies worldwide, including figures from the United States. The study did not differentiate between prescribed and unprescribed medicines; however the majority of ADRs were associated with prescribed medicines. The projected annual cost of such admissions to the national health service (NHS) is &pound;466 million.</p>
	<p pid="e.67W.3/2">This study highlights the importance of effective systems for monitoring and responding to issues relating to the safety of medicines, a process called 'pharmacovigilance'. This study, which was funded by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency {MHRA), underlines the Agency's commitment to improving the evidence base for pharmacovigilance in the UK. As part of this commitment to improving pharmacovigilance, the MHRA is working to strengthen and widen access to the Yellow Card Scheme for reporting suspected ADRs. Access has recently been widened to allow patients to report.</p>

	<p pid="e.69W.6/1">In 2006-07 the Department decided to issue the education and training (MPET) budget, which provides a significant contribution to hospital training grade doctor budgets, as part of a bundle of central budgets to strategic health authorities (SHAs). The bundle included money to fund workforce programmes, the quality and outcomes framework, clinical excellence awards as well as other miscellaneous programmes. This has provided the SHAs with the maximum flexibility to determine locally their own priorities, including investment in education and training.</p>
	<p pid="e.69W.6/2">The MPET budget was not cut in the 2006-07 allocations, in fact, allowing for inflation, it was broadly similar to the level of funding in 2005-06. However, within the overall resources allocated, it is up to each SHA to determine their own priorities including how much is invested in education and training.</p>
	<p pid="e.69W.6/3">The NHS South East Coast reports that it has agreed a reduction across all devolved central budgets, including MPET. Although the SHA has identified budgets that will receive a reduced allocation, it has not been prescriptive in terms of how the savings are made.</p>

We assess progress is being made against these objectives, especially in areas such as the development of democracy, the fostering of minority rights (87 women sit in the Afghan Parliament) and the development of a legitimate economy: for example, the International Monetary Fund estimated Afghanistan's economic growth averaged around 22 per cent. between 2002 and 2004, 8 per cent. in 2004-05 and up to 14 per cent. in 2005-06. The security situation has also developed substantially with the expansion of the International Security Assistance Force across the entire country, a development in which the British armed forces played a substantial role.</p>

The Government require assurance that any prospective change of ownership of Devonport Royal Dockyard Ltd.

On this basis the Government need to assess whether the planned separation of KBR from Halliburton would be acceptable. MOD is now in active discussion with KBR to ensure that the UK's essential security interests are protected. The ability for Devonport Management Ltd. to bid freely for defence contracts is a key element of these interests.</p>

	<p pid="e.84W.3/1">The total number of value for money exercises the Ministry of Defence has conducted on the use of management consultants and professional advisors in the last five years is not held centrally and could be only at disproportionate cost.</p>
	<p pid="e.84W.3/2">However, it is a requirement that before any engagement of management consultants or professional advisers within the Department, there is close scrutiny whereby managers have first to consult internally to ensure that the expertise is not available. Once this avenue has been explored, managers must raise a full business case explaining why there is a requirement to procure the work. The business case must state the impact of not doing the work and include a value for money assessment.</p>
	<p pid="e.84W.3/3">Departmental guidance makes it clear that external assistance should be used only when all other options for getting the task completed internally have been considered and rejected.</p>
	<p pid="e.84W.3/4">With effect from <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-01">1 April 2006</phrase> arrangements have been introduced across the Department to tighten up the process of procuring consultancy even further, to ensure that MOD's internal consultancy resources are considered before engaging external assistance.</p>
	<p pid="e.84W.3/5">The same principles apply to buying in external assistance as apply to buying any other goods or services for the MOD. These include securing best value for money; ensuring probity and accountability; enabling competition wherever possible; and ensuring compliance with the relevant provisions of UK and EU law.</p>

In cases of death in service, the bereaved family is allocated a visiting officer by the services to help the family and act as a link to the various civilian, charitable and other service support agencies.

Under the War Pensions Scheme, the MOD also funds the individual costs of war pensioners undergoing &quot;remedial treatment&quot; at treatment centres run by the Ex-Service Mental Welfare Society (Combat Stress) for conditions related to their individual pensioned disablement. Through the Veterans Challenge Fund, the Department also funds a number of projects run by service charities and others designed to improve the information available to service leavers on help available or, more directly, to meet welfare needs in areas such as homelessness.</p>

	<p pid="e.89W.8/1">As at mid-November 2006, 120 claimants had been paid under the Ex Gratia Payment Scheme for former Far East Prisoners of War and civilian internees, on the basis that they met the 20-year residence criterion. Five claims had been rejected on the grounds that the claimant was unable to prove internment. No claims have been rejected for failing to meet the residency criterion; the nine claims that might currently fall into this category are being held pending a review of the way that the criterion is working that I will shortly be undertaking, taking account of the views of the Association of British Civilian Internees Far East Region (ABCIFER). 47 other cases remained under consideration.</p>
	<p pid="e.89W.8/2">Employment overseas can count towards the 20-year qualifying period where there is reasonable evidence that the individual was expected to return to the UK. However, it does not count where there was no reasonable evidence that they would return to the UK, including cases where the individual was locally employed; this is because the close link to the UK, which is an overall requirement of the scheme, is not considered to have been demonstrated. It would be inconsistent with the fundamental principles of the scheme to allow such service to count and, were we to do so, it would have very significant financial implications for the eligibility criteria for the military side of the scheme.</p>
	<p pid="e.89W.8/3">To respond to concerns that a number of those who do not qualify under the ex gratia scheme may be suffering hardship, officials have investigated the feasibility of providing financial assistance to a charity supporting such individuals. The charity has recently indicated that it is not able to accept the support offered to limitations in the terms of its deeds.</p>

	<p pid="e.91W.0/2">Devonport Royal Dockyard is a strategic asset that plays a direct role in maintaining the UK's nuclear deterrent. The Government require assurance that any prospective change of ownership of Devonport Royal Dockyard Ltd (DRDL) or any new influence or control should not adversely affect the essential security interests of the UK. On this basis the Government need to assess whether the planned separation of KBR from Halliburton would be acceptable. MOD is now in active discussion with KBR to ensure that the UK's essential security interests are protected. The ability for Devonport Management Ltd. to bid freely for defence contracts is a key element of these interests.</p>

	<p pid="e.91W.7/1">Between <phrase class="date" code="2003-01-01">1 January 2003</phrase> and <phrase class="date" code="2006-06-30">30 June 2006</phrase>, 1,897 UK service personnel (regular and reservists) who deployed to Iraq on Operation Telic were diagnosed at a DCMH with a mental health condition thought to be related to their deployment. This represents around 1.5 per cent. of personnel deployed to Operation Telic over the same period. Of this number, 278 fulfilled the diagnostic criteria for Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. This represents around 0.3 per cent. of personnel deployed to Operation Telic over the same period.</p>
	<p pid="e.91W.7/2">Figures for the quarter <phrase class="date" code="">1 July</phrase>-<phrase class="date" code="2006-09-30">30 September 2006</phrase> are not yet available.</p>
	<p pid="e.91W.7/3">The figures do not include any personnel who have received treatment for a mental health condition since leaving the armed forces. This is because on leaving the armed forces, or on demobilisation for reservists, it is the long established practice that responsibility for medical care passes to the NHS. To collate figures on medical treatment received by every veteran would require an examination of the records of every NHS trust (and every independent healthcare provider) in the country and could therefore be done only at disproportionate cost.</p>
	<p pid="e.91W.7/4">At a time when personnel have been deployed to other operational theatres before or after deployment to Iraq and Afghanistan, it is becoming increasingly difficult to attribute a subsequent mental health condition (which in some cases might not present itself until some time after the person's deployment ends) to service on a specific deployment. We therefore have not conducted a similar collation for Afghanistan. The Department is currently reviewing its methods of collating figures on service personnel diagnosed with a mental health condition.</p>

	<p pid="e.92W.2/1">There is significant interdependency between weather forecasting and climate research and significant financial efficiencies are derived from collocation of these programmes within the Met Office. As a result the Met Office has a world leading capability in weather forecasting and climate research.</p>
	<p pid="e.92W.2/2">The Met Office's Unified Model is used for both numerical weather prediction and climate modelling as well as a variety of related research activities, and shared development of the model brings huge benefits to both disciplines.</p>
	<p pid="e.92W.2/3">Significant value for money is also derived by maximising the utilisation of the Met Office's supercomputing capacity. Weather forecasting requires short bursts of supercomputing capacity, allowing climate research activities to be scheduled when the supercomputer would otherwise be idle.</p>
	<p pid="e.92W.2/4">Climate change research also benefits from ready and efficient access to global observational data collected by the Met Office for its global weather forecasting capability and by utilising research of atmospheric processes carried out by the Met Office's research aircraft.</p>

	<p pid="e.92W.5/1">The Met Office's Hadley Centre provides advice on the impacts of climate change to a number of Government Departments, including MOD and Defra. The Hadley Centre provided extensive input to the Stern Review about climate impacts and helps develop scenarios of future climate change for the UK Climate Impacts Programme (UKCIP). In addition, the Hadley Centre's model for tides and storm surges in European coastal waters helps the UK improve its plans for protecting against changes in extreme sea levels.</p>
	<p pid="e.92W.5/2">The Hadley Centre also takes a lead in international science, and is central to the production of the forthcoming Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report on &quot;Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="e.92W.5/3">The Hadley Centre has developed a regional climate modelling system, Providing Regional Climates for Impacts Studies (PRECIS) that is available free of charge to developing countries, enabling them to produce high resolution climate change scenarios and assess regional vulnerability to climate change. There are currently over 190 users of PRECIS from more than 60 countries worldwide.</p>
	<p pid="e.92W.5/4">The Hadley Centre is expanding its programme of research into the impacts of climate change. The research has both a global and UK focus. The main areas are currently water resources, flood risk, agricultural yields, natural ecosystems, sea level rise and human health.</p>

	<p pid="e.97W.3/1">We continue to support and have made progress on the &quot;13 Practical Steps&quot;, agreed at the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty Review Conference in 2000, which are applicable to the UK. These are listed in 2000 Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, Final Document, a copy of which is available in the Library of the House. The 13 steps are:</p>
	<p pid="e.97W.3/2" class="indent">1. The early entry into force of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT).</p>
	<p pid="e.97W.3/3" class="indent">2. A nuclear testing moratorium pending entry into force of the CTBT.</p>
	<p pid="e.97W.3/4" class="indent">3. The immediate commencement of negotiations in the Conference on Disarmament on a non-discriminatory, multilateral, and effectively verifiable fissile material cut-off treaty. The negotiations should aim to be concluded within five years.</p>
	<p pid="e.97W.3/5" class="indent">4. The establishment in the Conference on Disarmament of a subsidiary body to deal with nuclear disarmament.</p>
	<p pid="e.97W.3/6" class="indent">5. The principle of irreversibility to apply to all nuclear disarmament and reduction measures.</p>
	<p pid="e.97W.3/7" class="indent">6. An unequivocal undertaking by nuclear-weapon states to eliminate their nuclear arsenals.</p>
	<p pid="e.97W.3/8" class="indent">7. The early entry into force and implementation of START II, the conclusion of START III, and the preservation and strengthening of the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty.</p>
	<p pid="e.97W.3/9" class="indent">8. The completion and implementation of the Trilateral Initiative between the United States, the Russian Federation, and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).</p>
	<p pid="e.97W.3/10" class="indent">9. Steps by all nuclear-weapon states toward disarmament including unilateral nuclear reductions; transparency on weapons capabilities and Article Vl-related agreements; reductions in non-strategic nuclear weapons; measures to reduce the operational status of nuclear weapons; a diminishing role for nuclear weapons in security policies; the engagement of nuclear-weapon states as soon as appropriate in a process leading to complete disarmament.</p>
	<p pid="e.97W.3/11" class="indent">10. The placement of excess military fissile materials under IAEA or other international verification and the disposition of such material for peaceful purposes.</p>
	<p pid="e.97W.3/12" class="indent">11. Reaffirmation of the objective of general and complete disarmament under effective international control.</p>
	<p pid="e.97W.3/13" class="indent">12. Regular state reporting in the NPT review process on the implementation of Article VI obligations.</p>
	<p pid="e.97W.3/14" class="indent">13. The development of verification capabilities necessary to ensuring compliance with nuclear disarmament agreements.</p>
	<p pid="e.97W.3/15">We have signed and ratified the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban treaty, continued to observe the moratorium on nuclear weapons testing, continued to press for the negotiation in the Conference on Disarmament, without preconditions, of a fissile material cut-off treaty whilst maintaining our moratorium. We have demonstrated our commitment to the irreversibility of nuclear disarmament. We continue to reiterate our unequivocal undertaking to accomplish the total elimination of our nuclear arsenal leading to nuclear disarmament and have undertaken several unilateral steps towards nuclear disarmament including reductions in warhead numbers, increased transparency by publishing historical accounting records of our defence fissile material holdings and reduced the operational status of our deterrent.</p>
	<p pid="e.97W.3/16">All fissile material no longer required for defence purposes is under international safeguards. We continue to reaffirm our commitment to achieving the general and complete disarmament objectives of Article VI. We report regularly in a number of different formats and fora on the progress we have made under Article VI. We have pursued a widely welcomed programme to develop UK expertise in methods and technologies that could be used to verify nuclear disarmament. Finally, we produced a series of working papers culminating in a presentation at the 2005 NPT&mdash;non-proliferation treaty&mdash;Review Conference. The Atomic Weapons Establishment continues to undertake research in this area.</p>

	<p pid="e.101W.6/2">The Defence Industrial Strategy (DIS) recognises that long-term value for money is the bedrock of the Ministry of Defence's procurement policy, while delivering the equipment and capability the armed forces needs.</p>
	<p pid="e.101W.6/3">Open and fair competition both at prime and subcontract level remains one of the key mechanisms by which we achieve this. MOD rules require procurements to be advertised in either the <i> Official Journal of the European Union</i>, the MOD Contracts Bulletin or the European Defence Agency's Electronic Bulletin Board. All tenders are evaluated on the same basis and against the same award criteria.</p>
	<p pid="e.101W.6/4">The DIS also recognises that competition is not always appropriate in achieving long term value for money but must be used intelligently alongside other options, having considered the nature of the marketplace. This assists in militating against the possibility of dominant private sector companies winning most or all outsourced defence business unless won in open and fair competition. A Key role of the new Defence Commercial Director is to ensure that particular companies do not achieve a dominant position that is not in the UK's interest.</p>

The Armed Forces Pension Scheme 75 (AFPS 75) is, and always has been, non-contributory and unfunded. The military salary was introduced in 1970 and from 1971 the Armed Forces Pay Review Body (AFPRB) began to make recommendations regarding military salary following consideration of civilian comparators.</p>
	<p pid="e.102W.2/2">In 1981 the AFRPB recommended, following a Government Actuary's report, that the value of the AFPS 75 pension should be taken into consideration as part of overall earnings for service personnel during the process of remuneration comparison and in judging the appropriate levels of military salaries. As a result an adjustment was introduced by the AFPRB in making their overall pay recommendations to reflect the non-contributory value of AFPS 75 benefits as compared with the contributory pension benefits of comparator employees.</p>

	<p pid="e.111W.2/1">The Ministry of Defence has undertaken a number of Environmental Impact Assessments (EIAs) in connection with the Trident nuclear weapons system. During the deployment of Vanguard Class submarines, EIAs are conducted whenever there is a requirement to do so, for example prior to the discharge of bilge water. Such EIAs are not published as to do so could enable deductions to be made on the operational location of the submarines and would, or would be likely to, prejudice the security of the United Kingdom.</p>
	<p pid="e.111W.2/2">For the infrastructure facilities required to support the maintenance of the system, an EIA was undertaken for Faslane and Coulport entitled &quot;Proposed Development at the Clyde Submarine Base (Faslane and Coulport) Environmental Impact Assessment&quot;. This was published in May 1984. The MOD also lodged an EIA in support of the D154 Project in Devonport with Plymouth City Council in 1994. No EIAs have yet been completed in respect of decommissioned redundant submarines.</p>

In addition, the survey of smaller music venues published on <phrase class="date" code="2006-12-07">7 December 2006</phrase> suggests that many premises previously restricted to operating under the &quot;two in a bar&quot; rule can now offer a greater choice of live music for consumers by putting on more than two musicians.</p>

A councillor making a representation, who is also a member of the licensing committee, would be expected to disqualify themselves from any involvement in the decision-making process affecting the premises licence.</p>
	<p pid="e.116W.2/2">Councillors are subject to the code of conduct for local authority members. The code includes rules on members' personal and prejudicial interests. A member has a prejudicial interest in an issue when they have an interest which a member of the public would reasonably regard as so significant that it would be likely to prejudice the member's judgment of the public interest. A member with a prejudicial interest in an issue is required to withdraw from the meeting where it is being discussed. The Department for Communities and Local Government is currently reviewing the code of conduct, and intends to consult shortly on a draft revised code. This will include proposed changes to the rules on prejudicial interests which will support members' advocacy role.</p>

	<p pid="e.117W.6/2">In October, I received from Jack Lemley his views on the progress of the Olympic delivery programme, drawing attention to the discussion at the Olympic Delivery Authority's (ODA) board meeting on <phrase class="date" code="">28 September</phrase> of land remediation on the Olympic Park site. I was already aware of the ODA board discussions and the progress of ongoing site investigations within the park.</p>
	<p pid="e.117W.6/3">As Sir Roy McNulty, acting chair of the ODA, said in his statement issued on <phrase class="date" code="">5 December</phrase>, the Stratford site is complex and much of the land will need remediating before construction. This was known from the very start of the bid process. For that reason, the London Development Agency (LDA) have had an expert team carrying out soil investigation work over recent months.</p>
	<p pid="e.117W.6/4">At the September ODA board meeting chaired by Mr. Lemley, there was a detailed presentation, which included an update from the LDA's contractors currently on site. This presentation set out for the board the site investigations undertaken to date. These investigations have identified a variety of contaminants, such as metals and hydrocarbons, which are common on sites that have this kind of former industrial use. The expert team indicated that the levels of contamination assessed to date were in line with expectations and that the time allowed for remediation appears to be adequate.</p>
	<p pid="e.117W.6/5">The site investigation contractors have now investigated the majority of the land. The remaining land the ODA does not yet have access to because it is still occupied by businesses and residents who, with the exception of a very few, will be relocated by July 2007 subject to confirmation of the compulsory purchase order. The LDA, with an expert team advising, and the interim ODA team (as it was at that time), had previously identified the technologies required to tackle the contamination and have some of the best contractors available with these technologies ready to treat the soil when the site becomes available.</p>

	<p pid="e.118W.2/2">Before engaging KPMG the Department had already opened discussions within Government, in autumn 2005, on the VAT status of the Olympic Delivery Authority (ODA). Our expectation was that ODA would be able to recover its VAT, in common with a number of other bodies which have functions akin to those of local authorities. As part of their work KPMG estimated the amount of VAT to be recovered. DCMS received KPMG's initial assessment of ODA's potential VAT costs in December 2005 and received revised estimates in March, May and August 2006. The Government are continuing to discuss the VAT status of the ODA.</p>

There are also further funding requirements, not yet translated into firm costs, which are a matter for discussion in Government.

HM Treasury were key members of the steering group, having been involved closely with the development of the Olympic bid since its inception. The steering group, which held its first meeting on <phrase class="date" code="2005-10-31">31 October 2005</phrase>, also included membership from DCLG, GLA, LOCOG, interim ODA and KPMG. There were regular and ongoing discussions between officials of my Department and the Treasury, and across Government, about the findings of the cost review as they emerged and as they were revised as part of the ongoing work. Ministers have meetings regularly on a wide range of issues. As was the case with previous Administrations, it is not the Government's practice to provide details of all such meetings.</p>

The numbers of cameras in use has risen from 12 in 1997 to 90 now, and the control room has been linked to the Shop Link and Nightsafe initiatives which have targeted, respectively, small business and retail crime and violent alcohol-related crime.</p>

	<p pid="e.134W.0/1">It is not necessarily straightforward to say that an arrest is made on the basis of DNA evidence, as police investigations will often involve looking at several different types of evidence including DNA, and an arrest may be made on the basis of the whole package of evidence. We are, however, aware of two cases in which arrests were made on the basis of mistaken DNA evidence since the establishment of the NDNAD in 1995.</p>
	<p pid="e.134W.0/2">In October 1997 a bloodstain from the burglary of a dwelling was matched to a Mr. K who was arrested by the Metropolitan Police. In fact samples provided by Mr K. and Mr. H had been accidentally switched in the laboratory. Mr K. began legal action against the Forensic Science Service but did not complete it within the legally prescribed period.</p>
	<p pid="e.134W.0/3">In August 1999, Mr. E was arrested on the basis of a DNA sample found in a burglary 150 miles from his home. He was suffering from Parkinson's disease and could not have got to the crime scene unaided. This was an SGM match&mdash;use of the more discriminating SGM plus technique (explained as follows) showed the first match was incorrect and the charges were dropped.</p>
	<p pid="e.134W.0/4">These errors must be seen in the context of almost 300,000 matches between crime scenes and individuals during the period 1998-99 to 2005-06. Use of DNA profiling is an extremely reliable technique.</p>
	<p pid="e.134W.0/5">Continuous quality monitoring of suppliers is carried out through the NDNAD's supplier accreditation section, and barcode and electronic document scanning systems are used in laboratories to minimise the possibility of human error.</p>
	<p pid="e.134W.0/6">The SGM technique introduced in 1995 looks at six areas of DNA plus the area showing the person's sex and has a one in 50 million chance of being incorrect (the odds are very probably much better than this).</p>
	<p pid="e.134W.0/7">Home Office Circular 58/2004 and the ACPO DMA Good Practice Guide advise that where a match of a crime scene to an individual involves an SGM profile, strong consideration should be given to upgrading the SGM profile to SGM Plus to ensure that there is still a match.</p>
	<p pid="e.134W.0/8">If a person is to be charged on the basis of a DNA match, the CPS require that there must be supporting non-DNA evidence available to be used in evidence. No-one is ever prosecuted solely on the basis of a DNA match; the DNA evidence is one piece of the information that the courts would require for a successful prosecution.</p>

The allocated budget for England and Wales from 2002-03 was as follows: 2002-03&mdash;&pound;6,355,000; 2003-04&mdash;&pound;7,145,000 (&pound;6 million allocated to the Violence Against Women Initiative, &pound;1 million allocated to a national awareness raising campaign, and &pound;145,000 allocated for domestic violence victims with no recourse to public funds); 2004-05&mdash;&pound;1,650,000 (&pound;1.1 million allocated to the Home Office Regional Directors fund for local delivery of support for victims of domestic violence and their children, &pound;500,000 allocated to a national awareness raising campaign, and &pound;50,000 allocated to implement the Domestic Violence, Crime and Victims Act 2004); 2005-06&mdash; &pound;5,500,000 (&pound;3 million allocated to the Home Office Regional Directors fund for local delivery of support for victims of domestic violence and their children, &pound;1 million to support the development of the Specialist Domestic Violence Court Programme, &pound;1 million to fund a variety of projects including a matrix of national domestic violence helplines, and &pound;500,000 allocated to a national awareness raising campaign which rolled out between 2005-06 and 2006-07); 2006-07&mdash;&pound;6,000,000 (&pound;3 million allocated to the Home Office Regional Directors fund for local delivery of support for victims of domestic violence and their children, &pound;1 million to support the Specialist Domestic Violence Court Programme, &pound;1 million to develop Independent Domestic Violence Advisors services for Specialist Domestic Violence Court Programme areas, and &pound;1 million to fund a variety of projects including a matrix of national domestic violence helplines).</p>
	<p pid="e.135W.2/3">These budgets contribute towards the delivery of the National Delivery Plan for Domestic Violence, a cross-Government plan which focuses on a range of key work objectives from early intervention and prevention through to developing a co-ordinated community response to tackling domestic violence. The budgets for the next five years are not yet confirmed. However, the effective prevention, and tackling, of domestic violence continues to be a Government priority.</p>

	<p pid="e.136W.0/2">The civil action to which my hon. Friend refers was brought by 197 prisoners who claimed that their drug detoxification treatment was inadequate. The claims were not pleaded on the basis that their access to illegal drugs had been denied.</p>
	<p pid="e.136W.0/3">Legal advice, obtained from counsel, the Treasury Solicitor and Home Office legal advisers, was that the standard of care the claimants received fell short of acceptable medical standards and the Prison Service's guidelines for dealing with opiate dependent prisoners. On the basis of legal advice it was decided to settle these cases out of court in order to minimise costs to the taxpayer. Each case was settled for &pound;3,807.10 excluding costs giving a total figure of &pound;749,998.70. The Prison Service has yet to receive the full bill of legal costs incurred in handling this matter. I am not aware of any outstanding cases.</p>

A Council Act of <phrase class="date" code="2003-11-27">27 November 2003</phrase> (OJ C two, 6.1.2004, p.1) recommended adoption by the member states of a Protocol amending the Convention including certain of its provisions relating to the computerised system of collected information. These would, among other matters, speed up the arrangements for creating analysis work files. The Protocol is expected to come into effect in the first half of 2007. Certain provisions enabling Europol to operate the Protocol are included in two draft Council Decisions now under consideration in the Europol Management Board. These deal with aspects of processing of personal data and the rules applicable to analysis work files. The Government supports the purposes of the draft Council Decisions subject to consideration of the awaited Opinion on data protection matters of the independent Joint Supervisory Body established under the Convention. The draft Council Decisions and the Joint Supervisory Body's Opinion will be deposited with the parliamentary scrutiny committees in the usual way.</p>

	<p pid="e.137W.2/6">Police can issue fixed penalty notices of &pound;80 for offences of criminal damage (limited to damage under &pound;500) and (retail) theft (under &pound;200) which will normally have victims. However, guidance to the police makes it clear that cases of criminal damage over &pound;300, and thefts over &pound;100, should normally be dealt with by the courts: PNDs should only be issued in exceptional circumstances with the agreement of the victim/retailer. The guidance also states that police should seek and record the victim's views and consult them about the potential issue of a PND, including the effect on the victim's claims for compensation.</p>

(Only 1 per cent. requested a court hearing.) 42 per cent. of PND recipients had a fine of one and a half times the penalty registered against them as they failed to pay the penalty or request a court hearing within the 21-day suspended enforcement period. Once registered, these fines fall into the HMCS fine enforcement and collection systems. The courts are currently achieving an overall payment rate for fines of 95 per cent.</p>

	<p pid="e.141W.8/2">The National Identity Scheme is the result of a process of continuing development and consultation, beginning several years before the Identity Cards Act received Royal Assent in March 2006. The consultation paper, &quot;Entitlement Cards and Identity Fraud&quot;, was published in July 2002 and invited views on whether a scheme should be implemented and if so, how. As a result of responses received during the six month consultation period, the Government announced their decision to introduce a scheme in &quot;Identity Cards: The Next Steps&quot;, published in November 2003. A draft Bill was then published and consulted on before the first Identity Cards Bill was introduced to Parliament in November 2004. The scheme has continued to develop as the legislation has undergone parliamentary scrutiny and following Royal Assent.</p>
	<p pid="e.141W.8/3">The Regulatory Impact Assessment of the Identity Cards Bill set out other initiatives which were under way with the objectives of tackling illegal immigration and illegal working, security and organised crime, identity fraud and improving the administration of public services. The National Identity Scheme is not intended to be the sole method of solving any of these problems and other initiatives will continue alongside the scheme which will complement these other initiatives, not replace them.</p>

In our current plans, it is only if a probation board or trust is failing, by not adequately protecting the public and addressing offending behaviour, and has failed to improve sufficiently despite support, that we will consider competing an entire probation service.</p>

	<p pid="e.148W.2/1">The Offender Management Bill contains a range of measures aimed at more effective and efficient management of offenders in custody and the community. These include new arrangements for the provision of probation services. These proposals were initially outlined in a consultation paper, &quot;Restructuring Probation to Reduce Re-offending&quot;, which was published in October 2005. A total of 748 written responses were received, the majority of those coming from probation service interests, including the National Association of Probation Officers and a number of individual members of staff. The Prison Governors' Association did not submit a formal response to the consultation paper.</p>
	<p pid="e.148W.2/2">The consultation paper, &quot;Youth Justice&mdash;the Next Steps&quot;, published in September 2003, sought opinions on whether suitable young people could be placed in open and semi-secure, as well as closed, conditions in different types of establishments, as is now proposed in Clause 25. Neither prison governors nor the probation service were specifically consulted on these proposals.</p>
	<p pid="e.148W.2/3">No other measures in the Bill were the subject of formal consultation.</p>

	<p pid="e.156W.2/1">The National Probation Service has two accredited programmes for domestic violence (DV) perpetrators. All accredited programmes have in place monitoring systems to ensure that they are delivered properly. They have a complementary programme of research which will allow evaluation of the effectiveness of the programme. The monitoring includes assessment of perpetrators, supervision of programme facilitators, attendance monitoring, and video recording of all programmes sessions.</p>
	<p pid="e.156W.2/2">The Home Office is planning two studies: a process evaluation (which will aim to assess whether programmes are being delivered as intended by all probation areas; assess whether data is being collated and to what quality; make an assessment of readiness for a full-scale outcome evaluation; and provide recommendations for operational and design improvements to the DV programmes) and a study of desistance (which will aim to provide some in-depth explanatory information on how DV programmes assisted a small number of offenders to desist from crime after completing their order).</p>
	<p pid="e.156W.2/3">In the longer term, an independent evaluation of the outcomes is planned, which will use reconviction rates, police call-out data, victim reports and psychometric assessment as outcome measures. This will not begin until we are confident the programmes are being implemented satisfactorily.</p>

	<p pid="e.159W.8/1">Protecting the public from the harm caused by sex offenders is a priority for this Government. The means of tackling sex offending are constantly developing, and we work together with the front-line agencies to review their effectiveness and, where necessary, make improvements.</p>
	<p pid="e.159W.8/2">Since the establishment in 1997 of a notification requirement for sex offenders to register with their local police (sex offender registration) there have been a number of major developments in measures to monitor sex offenders in the community. The notification requirements themselves have been strengthened by part 2 of the Sexual Offences Act 2003, and in 2001 we introduced statutory multi-agency public protection arrangements (MAPPA) across England and Wales to enhance risk assessment and management of serious sexual and violent offenders. Similar arrangements are being introduced in Scotland and Northern Ireland.</p>
	<p pid="e.159W.8/3">The MAPPA were further strengthened by the Criminal Justice Act 2003 and, in 2005, ViSOR (the violent and sex offender register) was successfully rolled out to the police service with plans to extend to the prison and probation services (local authority criminal justice social work departments in Scotland). ViSOR currently provides a national database of intelligence about the behaviour, residence and identity of sexual offenders and will include violent offenders by December 2007.</p>
	<p pid="e.159W.8/4">The Home Secretary has commissioned a review of the management of child sex offenders in the community, in order to identify additional public protection measures. The review is due to report in the new year.</p>

	<p pid="e.164W.0/1">Many disabled people, including some with Asperger's syndrome, make very effective use of the mainstream job placing services provided by Jobcentre Plus. For those who need more support, Jobcentre Plus provides a range of specialist disability measures for those disabled customers who cannot be helped by these services. Disability employment advisers and incapacity benefit personal advisers can help to find suitable local employment.</p>
	<p pid="e.164W.0/2">People with Asperger's syndrome may make use of the Access to Work programme, if they need help with the additional costs, caused by their disability, of travelling to work, or can be helped through the provision of a support worker. A support worker can help in a number of ways, for example as a job coach to provide help in breaking a job down into simple steps to make learning easier or as a mentor, advocate or counsellor.</p>
	<p pid="e.164W.0/3">WORKSTEP. People with Asperger's syndrome may also make use of this programme of supported employment which can provide tailored support to find, and retain jobs for disabled people who have more complex barriers to finding and keeping work. WORKSTEP provides the support and opportunity for people to progress to open employment where this is the right option for the individual. Longer-term support continues to be available for those who need it.</p>
	<p pid="e.164W.0/4">In addition, new deal for disabled people (NDDP) is a voluntary initiative offered to customers on a disability or health-related benefit. A network of providers offer support and services to those on eligible benefits who want to enter work, with the aim of achieving lasting, paid employment. NDDP is available to customers across the full range of health conditions and disabilities, including those with Asperger's syndrome.</p>
	<p pid="e.164W.0/5">Our highly successful Pathways to Work services, currently operating in 20 Jobcentre Plus districts, help people with a range of health conditions and disabilities. The Pathways to Work programme is primarily aimed at new incapacity benefit customers, but is also available to existing benefit customers on a voluntary basis.</p>

	<p pid="e.166W.8/1">The Department for Work and Pensions recognises the valuable efforts of carers in supporting sick or disabled family members, friends and neighbours.</p>
	<p pid="e.166W.8/2">Depending upon their circumstances, carers have access to the full range of social security benefits. In particular, through payment of carer's allowance, the Department provides income maintenance support to over 450,000 carers providing at least 35 hours of care per week for severely disabled people receiving attendance allowance, or the equivalent rates of the disability living allowance care component, or a constant attendance allowance paid under the industrial injuries disablement benefit or war pension schemes. Around 216,000 low-income carers are supported through the carer premium in income support and income-based jobseekers allowance, while a further 195,000 receive the carers additional amount in pension credit.</p>
	<p pid="e.166W.8/3">We are continuing to make it easier for carers to claim their benefit entitlements. Since December 2003, carers have been able to make electronic claims for carer's allowance. Next month, we are introducing a shortened claim form for pension-age carers, which will make it easier for them to claim carer's allowance and, subsequently, the carer's additional amount in pension credit.</p>
	<p pid="e.166W.8/4">The Pensions Bill, introduced on <phrase class="date" code="2006-11-28">28 November 2006</phrase>, contains a number of initiatives to help carers build up better entitlement to state pensions. It includes a new 'carers credit' for those caring for severely disabled people for at least 20 hours a week, a reduction to 30 in the number of qualifying years needed for a full basic state pension, and changes to make it easier for carers to accrue the second state pension. The reduction in qualifying years for the full basic state pension will particularly help carers with gaps in their work records.</p>
	<p pid="e.166W.8/5">Working age carer's allowance claimants who wish to combine caring and work have access to a range of support and services available from Jobcentre Plus, for example through the New Deal or a voluntary work focused interview with a trained personal advisor.</p>
	<p pid="e.166W.8/6">As with all our policies, the Department will continue to regularly evaluate its support for carers.</p>

	<p pid="e.168W.5/4" class="indent">The Child Support Agency has six targets set by the Secretary of State for 2006/07, which were published in the Agency's Business Plan, a copy of which is available in the House of Commons Library, or on the internet via the following link:</p>

	<p pid="e.168W.5/6" class="indent">It should be noted that there was an error in the published definition of the debt target, which incorrectly stated that the performance level of 40 per cent should be achieved over the financial year 2006/07 as opposed to the quarter ending March 2007, as was originally intended. The correct definition of this target is, therefore, that: &quot;The Agency will collect arrears equivalent to 40 per cent of the amount accruing due to non-payment of regular maintenance between <phrase class="date" code="2007-01-01">1 January 2007</phrase> and <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-31">31 March 2007</phrase>.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="e.168W.5/7" class="indent">The Agency's latest performance against these targets was published in tables 2.1, 3, 7.2, 8.1,12, and 17 of the September 2006 Child Support Agency Quarterly Summary Statistics, a copy of which is available in the House of Commons Library, or on the internet via the following link:</p>

	<p pid="e.169W.5/2">At the outset of a claim for benefit steps are taken to confirm that the address provided exists and is correct, by matching the details provided with historical data held within the Department. Decision notices issued when entitlement is established, and annual award notices issued when benefit rates change include written reminders of the need for customers to notify changes of address. In addition to this when it is known that an address is out of date and the customer is in receipt of benefit, steps are taken to obtain the correct address details.</p>
	<p pid="e.169W.5/3">If an address could not be traced banks would be contacted to suspend payments and data matching takes place with organisations such as Royal Mail re-direct. Change of address details notified to one part of the Department are shared with other agencies within the Department through cross-benefit computer systems. These systems also hold addresses from Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs (HMRC), where many customers in receipt of child benefit, child tax credits and new tax credits are also customers of this Department.</p>
	<p pid="e.169W.5/4">The Department has a dedicated team, who are responsible for the quality and integrity of personal details data held within the Customer Databases Programme, and is constantly seeking new ways of maintaining all personal data, including up to date addresses. In order to maintain correct address details and up to date postcodes, the Post Office Address File is run against the DWP Customer Databases on a quarterly basis.</p>
	<p pid="e.169W.5/5">Work is currently under way with HMRC on a project set up to examine taxpayer's out of date address data, which is then checked through Post Office Redirect and credit reference data, with any new addresses found notified from HMRC to DWP. There are safeguards in place to ensure that correct addresses for customers in receipt of benefit are not overwritten by this data without confirmation that the individual has moved.</p>

	<p pid="e.173W.5/1">Since 1997 the Government have significantly extended and improved civil rights for disabled people in areas such as employment, education, access to goods and services and transport, most recently through the Disability Discrimination Act 2005 which met our commitment to put in place a comprehensive and enforceable set of rights for disabled people. Disabled people in Clwyd, South will have benefited from these significant improvements in disability rights.</p>
	<p pid="e.173W.5/2">The number of disabled people in Clwyd, South claiming disability living allowance or attendance allowance, and thus benefiting from the enhancement of independence and social integration that these benefits provide, has increased by almost 24 per cent. from around 6,200 in May 1997 to about 7,700 in May 2006. These include some 20 disabled three and four-year-old children who are unable, or virtually, unable to walk and are currently receiving the disability living allowance higher-rate mobility component following the Government's decision in 2001 to reduce the lower age limit for entitlement from five to three years of age<sup>(1)</sup>.</p>
	<p pid="e.173W.5/3">Through Jobcentre Plus, we are promoting work as the best form of welfare for people of working age. Since 1997 the number of long-term unemployed in Clwyd, South has fallen by 64 per cent. and the number of young people that are long-term unemployed by 47 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="e.173W.5/4">Our new deals have helped lone parents, the young unemployed, the long-term unemployed, disabled people, the over-50s and partners of unemployed people to move from benefit into work. Nationally over 15 million people have been helped into work by the new deals, with over 3,700 in Clwyd, South.</p>

	<p pid="e.174W.5/3">In order to consider what reduction there would be in the income-related benefits, we would need data on the income distribution of those benefiting from FAS, the tax brackets they are in and their benefit entitlements. We do not hold such data. We cannot use the data held on income distribution over the whole of the pensioner population, as we cannot know if this relatively small group of people are typical of the entire population.

	<p pid="e.175W.0/2">There was, and is, no specific benefit legislation to cover weavers. When deciding entitlement to benefits, weavers are treated in the same way as any other worker whose employment is seasonal.</p>
	<p pid="e.175W.0/3">In any case of seasonal employment, the Department looks at the pattern of employment over a recognisable cycle, usually one year. If the average number of hours worked each week of this cycle is 16 or more the person is treated as in remunerative work for the whole of the period, and not entitled to benefit.</p>
	<p pid="e.175W.0/4">If the average number of hours worked over the cycle is less than 16 per week the person may be entitled to benefit, depending on their income. Seasonal self-employed workers have their income, less any allowable deductions, averaged over the period of the work cycle to determine a weekly amount of earnings. An amount, usually &pound;5 for a single person, is disregarded each week.</p>
	<p pid="e.175W.0/5">The Harris Tweed weavers are designated as self-employed as, while they are provided with yarn to weave the tweed, they work on a self-employed rather than an employed basis. They cannot therefore be counted as unemployed during periods when they have no work.</p>

	<p pid="e.178W.11/2">The transfer of disability living allowance for those customers who choose to use the Motability scheme is executed by a unit within the Disability and Carers Service at a cost of &pound;3.7 million per year.

	<p pid="e.178W.11/4">In addition, the lease of cars under the Motability Scheme, and the end of lease sale of Motability vehicles are value added tax (VAT) zero-rated. Motability vehicles are also exempt from insurance premium tax. These reliefs are worth around &pound;240 million and &pound;8 million respectively per year. VAT zero-rating also applies to the supply of certain adapted motor vehicles for the use of disabled wheelchair users.</p>

	<p pid="e.191W.5/1">The information requested is in the following table. The package of reforms in the White Paper &quot;Security in Retirement: Towards a New Pension System&quot; is designed to:</p>
	<p pid="e.191W.5/2" class="indent">promote personal responsibility: tackling the problem of undersaving for retirement;</p>
	<p pid="e.191W.5/3" class="indent">be fair: protecting the poorest, and being fair to women and carers, to savers, and between generations;</p>
	<p pid="e.191W.5/4" class="indent">be simple: clarifying the respective roles of the State, the employer and the individual;</p>
	<p pid="e.191W.5/5" class="indent">be affordable: maintaining macro-economic stability and striking the right balance for provision between the State, the employer and the individual; and</p>
	<p pid="e.191W.5/6" class="indent">be sustainable: setting the basis of an enduring national consensus, while being flexible to future trends.</p>
	<p pid="e.191W.5/7">The reforms to state pensions will provide a solid foundation for private saving, both by limiting the spread of pension credit entitlement and by delivering a simpler and more predictable state pension outcome. Under the proposed reforms, even with the standard guarantee credit linked to earnings to protect the poorest, only 6 per cent. of pensioner households will be eligible to guarantee credit only, with 94 per cent. of pensioner household above the level where private saving income is taken into account pound for pound in pension credit. Furthermore, those with private savings of less than &pound;15,000 could take them as a lump sum under the trivial commutation rules.</p>
	<p pid="e.191W.5/8">The total number of pensioner households under the White Paper reforms is lower than the total number under the current system because of the phased increase in the state pension age starting in 2024.</p>
	<p pid="e.191W.5/9">It cannot be assumed that all those with 100 per cent. marginal deduction rates are in receipt of the guarantee credit only. People on both guarantee credit and savings credit who qualify for additional amounts and are on the savings credit maximum will also have 100 per cent. marginal deduction rates.</p>
	<p pid="e.191W.5/10">Numbers and proportions of pensioner benefit units in 2050 that will face: <i> (a)</i> a 100 per cent. marginal rate of pension credit withdrawal if the White Paper reforms are implemented and <i> (b)</i> a 40 per cent. marginal withdrawal rate if they are not.</p>

Care should be taken when interpreting these projections as they are subject to a margin of uncertainty. The projections are based on long run simulations of the incomes of individuals under a set of assumptions including life expectancy, partnership formation, earnings growth, employment rates, state and private pension accumulation.<br/> 3.

The estimates assume that the minimum age at which people can claim pension credit rises in line with women's state pension age.<br/> 6. Projections under the White Paper proposals assume: continued earnings uprooting of the standard guarantee credit; the savings credit maximum is uprated by earnings from 2008 and then by prices from 2015; earnings uprating of the basic state pension from 2012; and measures to improve coverage of state pensions described in the White Paper. Figures exclude the effect of Personal Accounts.<br/> 7.

	<p pid="e.193W.11/1">We value the important role that employers with occupational pension schemes play in encouraging individuals to save for their retirement. That is why the White Paper &quot;Security in retirement: towards a new pensions system&quot; announced a rolling deregulatory review of private pensions regulation to investigate further ways to lighten the regulatory burden on business, with a view to encouraging and strengthening existing provision.</p>
	<p pid="e.193W.11/2">We also said that we would remove some of the administrative complexity by abolishing contracting out for defined contribution schemes, and by allowing occupational pension schemes to convert guaranteed minimum pension rights into scheme benefits by offering the actuarial equivalent in exchange. Measures to achieve this are contained in the Pensions Bill recently introduced in Parliament.</p>
	<p pid="e.193W.11/3">We are determined that alongside the introduction of personal accounts, employers should be supported in continuing to provide occupational pension schemes. We will help by making the exemption process for high quality schemes as simple and straightforward as possible.</p>
	<p pid="e.193W.11/4">The Government have also lightened the regulatory burden imposed by the tax rules on schemes, and employers providing them, by bringing in key legislation in the Finance Act 2004 to replace the complex pension tax rules with one simplified regime from April 2006. Employers providing registered pension schemes for their employees continue to receive full tax relief on the value of contributions they make to those schemes.</p>

	<p pid="e.200W.5/1">The White Paper &quot;Security in Retirement: Towards a New Pensions System&quot; states that the earnings link will be restored to the basic state pension. The objective is that this will be done, subject to affordability and the fiscal position, in 2012 but in any event at the latest by the end of the next Parliament. We have said that we will make a statement on the precise date at the beginning of the next Parliament.</p>

	<p pid="e.207W.0/2">38 per cent. of lone parents who have had contact with Employment Zone (EZ) advisers in Great Britain and 36 per cent. of lone parents who have had contact with EZ advisers in London have moved into work.</p>
	<p pid="e.207W.0/3">Nine reports on EZs<sup>(1)</sup> and 23 reports on NDLP<sup>(2)</sup> have been published and are available in the Library. A list of the most recent reports is reproduced in the list.</p>
	<p pid="e.207W.0/4">Latest available data indicate that the cost of helping lone parents into work is around &pound;1,900 per person through EZs and around &pound;600 per person through NDLP. Direct comparisons cannot be drawn between the costs of helping someone into work through EZs and NDLP. EZs operate in some of the most disadvantaged areas in the country while the New Deals operate nationally. In London EZ areas, employment support is provided to lone parents through EZs rather than through NDLP. Outside London, lone parents in EZ areas are offered help through NDLP at their first work-focused interview (WFI), but can choose between EZ and NDLP support if they continue to claim income support and have a second WFI. This increases the likelihood of such EZ participants requiring additional, and thus more costly, support to help them into work.</p>

	<p pid="e.208W.5/2">Estimates of take-up of pension credit administered by the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP), as well as local authority administered housing benefit and council tax benefit, can be found in the DWP publication series entitled: &quot;Income Related Benefits Estimates of Take-Up&quot;.

However, the pensioners' income series indicates that 98 per cent. of pensioner benefit units were in receipt of some state pension in 2004-05. Those not in receipt may include pensioners who are deferring their state pension and those who have mis-reported the source of their income.</p>

	<p pid="e.211W.6/2">It is currently not possible to define those off duty due to other reasons. This is because DSA uses separate computer systems that cannot link these events. DSA plans to introduce a system that will allow for this information to be retrieved in April 2007.</p>

	<p pid="e.223W.5/1">Funding for schools is a shared responsibility between central and local government. The majority of funding is provided by central government, with local authorities (LAs) providing the rest. In 2006-07, for the first time, schools received their funding from a Dedicated Schools Grant (DSG) rather than as part of the local government settlement. The DSG is a ring-fenced grant and must be used for schools' budgets. It is for each LA to distribute funding using a locally agreed formula, and for schools' governing bodies to decide how to spend the available resources.</p>
	<p pid="e.223W.5/2">Support for children with special educational needs (SEN) accounts for a high proportion of all education expenditure. We do not hold information centrally about expenditure on attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, but information collected from LAs shows planned expenditure on the education of children with SEN of &pound;4.5 billion in 2006-07. This is about 13 per cent. of all education spending.</p>
	<p pid="e.223W.5/3">In addition, schools and LEAs can use their School Development Grant to support SEN. SDG is allocated to schools and LAs to spend on teaching and learning according to their own needs and priorities. Total SDG for 2006-07 is almost &pound;2 billion and schools will see an increase over their 2005-06 SDG allocations of at least 3.4 per cent. per pupil in 2006-07 and 3.7 per cent. in 2007-08.</p>

	<p pid="e.225W.5/1">We have no plans to undertake research into the possible effect on levels of obesity of the changes to the availability of drinks provided in schools. Nor do we have plans to commission research into <i> (a)</i> the (i) prevalence and (ii) cause of dehydration among school children and <i> (b)</i> its effects on school children.</p>
	<p pid="e.225W.5/2">The new Education (Nutritional Standards for School Lunches) (England) Regulations 2006, introduced in September 2006, limit the range of drinks available in schools to plain water (still or sparkling); skimmed or semi-skimmed milk; fruit juices; yogurt drinks with less than 5 per cent. added sugar; or combinations of these drinks; and require drinking water to be provided free of charge to registered pupils on school premises. Subsequent regulations to be introduced in September 2007 will extend these requirements to ensure that drinks throughout the school are consistent with those served at lunch; and that drinking water is provided free of charge at all times of the school day.</p>
	<p pid="e.225W.5/3">The Government's strategy on obesity addresses the issue through a wide range of programmes to encourage children, parents, and parents-to-be to develop and maintain a healthy lifestyle, to increase their levels of exercise, and to eat healthily. Setting statutory nutritional standards in schools is one action in our approach to support healthy eating and drinking.</p>

	<p pid="e.226W.2/1">Information on the number of children aged under one who were taken into care on an interim or full care order or under a police or emergency protection order in each year since 1992 is shown in Table 1. This information is not available prior to 1992. Of these, 3,000 children who were taken into care aged under one subsequently returned home between 2001 and 2006 to live with parents, relatives or other person with parental responsibility (excluding residence orders and special guardianship orders). Information on whether a child returned to live with their parents, relatives or other person with parental responsibility has only been collected since <phrase class="date" code="2000-04-01">1 April 2000</phrase>. There is no comparable information prior to 2000.</p>
	<p pid="e.226W.2/2">In the case of all children subject to a care order, the reason they have become looked after is because the courts will have taken the view that the 'significant harm' threshold set out in the Children Act 1989 had been crossed. Information on the number of children looked after by local authorities who were placed in care aged under one in 1996 and in 2006 and for what reasons, is shown in Tables 2 and 3. The 'category of need' codes record the main reason why a child is being provided with services. This provides a further insight as to why a particular child is being looked after. Information on 'category of need' was first collected in April 2000 and provides further information as to why a child is being looked after. Data on 'category of need' is not strictly comparable with the 'reason for being looked after' information that was collected prior to <phrase class="date" code="2000-04-01">1 April 2000</phrase>.</p>

	<p pid="e.230W.9/3" class="indent">I am writing in response to your recent Parliamentary Question that asked what percentage of pupils in further education in Lincolnshire received the educational maintenance allowance in each year since 2004.</p>
	<p pid="e.230W.9/4" class="indent">Information on the number of young people who have applied, enrolled and received Education Maintenance Allowance (EMA) is available at Local Authority level. EMA take-up is defined as young people who have received one or more EMA payment in the academic year.</p>
	<p pid="e.230W.9/5" class="indent">The National EMA scheme was phased in over time to successive 16-year old age groups. 2004/05 was the first year of National EMA and therefore we can only give data for 16 year olds in that year. Of those that were in full time education in the Lincolnshire Local Authority area, some 49.6% received one or more EMA payment.</p>
	<p pid="e.230W.9/6" class="indent">This percentage is based on the participation estimates of 16 year olds in full time education that are outlined within the Statistical First Release 13/2006. In 2004/05 the amount of 16 year olds in education was 6300. However it should be noted that not all those in full time education would have been eligible for EMA on income grounds. At present we are unable to give similar percentages for 2005/06 as the sub-national participation estimates for 2005 are not currently available. They are due to be published in June 2007.</p>

	<p pid="e.262W.2/1">People 1st (the Sector Skills Council for the hospitality, leisure, travel and tourism industries) recently undertook a comprehensive Skill Needs Assessment as part of their 'Sector Skills Agreement' (SSA) process. This is a major DfES policy area designed to create a demand led system of education and training.</p>
	<p pid="e.262W.2/2">The Sector Skills Agreement has five stages, the first of which is the Skills Needs Assessment. This Assessment, undertaken between May and November 2005, looked at the current and future skill needs of the sector through extensive consultation with employers regionally, by industry and across the four UK nations. The research identified management and leadership, customer service and chefs skills as the priority skill areas.</p>
	<p pid="e.262W.2/3">Linked to this, retention was also identified as a priority. The industry has high staff turnover rates, which cost the sector nearly &pound;1 billion each year. The full report and a summary can be found at <a href="http://www.people1st.co.uk">www.people1st.co.uk</a>.</p>
	<p pid="e.262W.2/4">The second stage is an assessment of the supply of learning, which People 1st undertook between January and June 2006 (consulting with both employers and learning providers). The research revealed the sector employs a high percentage of students and international workers, has weak progression routes, and the majority of employers are confused about both what support is available and how to access it.</p>
	<p pid="e.262W.2/5">The third stage looked at the gap between supply and demand, and is being used to inform the final two stages which involve working with employers and delivery partners to finalise the agreement. Further details will be available when these discussions have concluded.</p>
	<p pid="e.262W.2/6">This research has underpinned the series of Skills Summits that DCMS held with People 1st. These summits are overseeing the development of a National Skills Strategy for the sector (the England arm of the Sector Skills Agreement), which is due for completion in March 2007.</p>
	<p pid="e.262W.2/7">I recently chaired the third summit in this series and launched the UK Skills Passport. The Passport will benefit both employers and employees by providing an entire system of career development and training, and signposting industry to qualifications and funding that meet their needs. A fourth Skills Summit will take place later this spring.</p>

The number of breeds with natural bobs is small and I think it extremely unlikely that an owner of such a dog would be prosecuted under the tail docking ban. Should such a case be brought before the courts, the burden of proof lies with the prosecution to prove that an offence has been committed, and evidence from a veterinary surgeon or breed society is likely to establish the necessary facts.</p>

	<p pid="e.266W.8/1">For the Great Britain routine herd testing programme for bovine tuberculosis (bTB), the Government uses the single intradermal comparative cervical tuberculin (SICCT) test (commonly known as the &quot;skin test&quot;). For reasons outlined, it is not possible to give a precise figure for the number of false positive results obtained from these bTB tests.</p>
	<p pid="e.266W.8/2">When the skin test is applied to cattle in bTB-free herds in Great Britain, there is less than a one in 1,000 chance that a non-infected animal will be wrongly classified as a reactor. This is known as the test's false positive rate. An alternative way of defining this is to say that the skin test has a specificity in excess of 99.9 per cent. Although the probability of getting at least one false positive result increases with the size of the herd being tested, it would be extremely rare to find more than one false positive in a herd.</p>
	<p pid="e.266W.8/3">It is important to bear in mind that failure to confirm the disease by post-mortem examination at the slaughterhouse, or by culturing the causative bacterium in the laboratory, does not mean that the animal was not infected with bTB. In the early stages of this infectious disease, it is not always possible to see lesions with the naked eye and, owing to the fastidious nature of the organism, it is not possible to culture it from tissue samples in every case. Therefore, it is not correct to consider all skin test reactors that fail to disclose disease in the slaughterhouse or in the laboratory as false positives. The ease with which lesions of bTB can be detected at slaughter depends on the stage of infection, with lesions being harder to find in the early stages of bTB (that is, when most animals are detected using the skin test).</p>
	<p pid="e.266W.8/4">The following table shows, for 2004, 2005 and the first six months of 2006, the total number of test reactors slaughtered and the number of such reactors that had demonstrable evidence of infection at post-mortem examination and/or bacteriological culture.</p>

	<p pid="e.271W.6/1">Assuming 100 per cent. compliance with the regulations, the Department has estimated that the cost of collection and disposal of all fallen stock in the UK is just over &pound;50 million per year. However, about &pound;30 million of that cost is accounted for by arrangements for testing of cattle for bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), and the costs are borne by the Government.</p>
	<p pid="e.271W.6/2">The voluntary National Fallen Stock Scheme (NFSS) also benefits from &pound;20 million of Government funding over four years to November 2008, to assist with the costs to the industry of complying with the regulations. From November 2004 when the scheme started to November 2006, &pound;11.5 million of Government funding had been given, with farmers who were members contributing just over &pound;14 million.</p>
	<p pid="e.271W.6/3">However, it should be recognised that many livestock producers were already disposing of their fallen stock by means other than burial before the regulations came into force. In such cases implementing the regulations did not impose an additional cost.</p>

	<p pid="e.272W.5/1">DEFRA funds most of the Environment Agency's (EA) flood-related work and grant aids individual capital improvement projects undertaken by local authorities and, in low-lying areas, internal drainage boards.

	<p pid="e.272W.5/2">Local authority expenditure on flood risk management (including levies to the EA and internal drainage boards) is largely supported by the local government funding mechanisms operated by the Department for Communities and Local Government (DCLG).</p>

	<p pid="e.273W.0/4">The Animal Welfare Act 2006, which will come into force in April 2007, introduces a duty on people responsible for an animal to take such steps as are reasonable to ensure its welfare. This new power will apply to gamebirds reared for sporting shooting prior to their release, and to gamebirds reared for meat.</p>
	<p pid="e.273W.0/5">We have no plans to introduce regulations for the rearing of gamebirds. We do, however, propose to use powers under the Animal Welfare Act to produce a Code of Practice, which will provide guidance on accommodation and management methods, including aggression reduction. Specifically on the issue of raised laying units, before considering regulation or a ban on the system, I believe that it is important I obtain an independent view on this method of housing gamebirds. To that end, the Farm Animal Welfare Council's study of the system and its report will be fundamental in informing my decision on their future. As you are aware, I have particular concerns surrounding the use of raised laying units and will not hesitate to take appropriate action if, following the report, I believe that the bird's welfare is compromised. Any code would be subject to public consultation and endorsement by Parliament.</p>
	<p pid="e.273W.0/6">At present, all animals, including gamebirds reared for sporting purposes, are covered by the Protection of Animals Act 1911. Under this Act it is an offence to ill-treat or cause unnecessary suffering to any captive or domestic animal. In addition, gamebirds reared for slaughter for food would be covered by the Welfare of Farmed Animals Regulations.</p>
	<p pid="e.273W.0/7">There are no specific stocking densities of gamebirds required under present law.</p>

	<p pid="e.286W.5/1">The Recycling Credits scheme was reformed through section 49 of the Clean Neighbourhoods and Environment Act 2005 (CNEA). Changes to the Scheme increase the flexibility of payments from waste disposal authorities (WDAs) to waste collection authorities (WCAs) in two-tier areas by giving them the option to jointly agree alternative arrangements. These changes have been in effect since April 2006. The CNEA also clarified that recycling credits can be paid for reuse activity and that reuse should be treated in the same way as recycling for the purposes of the scheme.</p>
	<p pid="e.286W.5/2">Local authorities (LAs) have the power to pay credits to third parties for the recycling and reuse activity they carry out. These payments are at the discretion of individual LAs so that they can take account of local circumstances. The Government introduced updated guidance in April this year, which gives greater encouragement to LAs to adopt good practice. The guidance strengthens the existing presumption that LAs will consider applications for credits from third parties which meet certain criteria and consider the social, environmental and economic benefits associated with community recycling.</p>
	<p pid="e.286W.5/3">The guidance makes it clear that credit values should be the same for reuse as they are for recycling and disposal credits for third parties should be calculated on the same basis as credits for waste collection authorities.</p>

	<p pid="e.289W.2/1">The decision to end the adjudication scheme was not taken lightly. The Scheme supports the Code of Good Practice for agri-environment schemes and diversification projects within agricultural tenancies. It is administered by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors and was set up in December last year, with the intention that it would continue for a period of four years. However, since its launch in December 2005, there has not been a single application for the Scheme.</p>
	<p pid="e.289W.2/2">Given the current financial constraints within DEFRA, it would not have been a sensible use of public money to allocate funds for a further three years to a scheme in which there has been no interest. Therefore, we decided reluctantly that the Scheme should be closed at the end of 2006.</p>
	<p pid="e.289W.2/3">The closure of the Scheme does not affect the validity of the Code of Good Practice, which stands in its own right and gives useful and informative advice to tenants and landlords contemplating diversification activities. The Code is available from the DEFRA website at:</p>

	<p pid="e.294W.11/1">The Department tried to negotiate a settlement through a schemed approach based on the Claims Handling Agreement (CHA). The Department agreed with the Claimants Group (CG) on taking mixed workers&mdash;those who had worked both underground and on the surface&mdash;into the scheme. The Department offered that any surface worker in a dusty job&mdash;with agreement on what these were&mdash;could go through the medical assessment for chronic bronchitis and temporary exacerbation of asthma which provides for low levels of compensation (on the lines of the tariffs now operating in the fast track scheme). And any surface worker with a pneumoconiosis reading (which the Department's claims handlers, Capita, took as a proxy for a marker of exposure to dust) could go through the full medical assessment and have access to higher levels of compensation for Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD).</p>
	<p pid="e.294W.11/2">This proposal was submitted to the CG on <phrase class="date" code="2000-07-17">17 July 2000</phrase>. The CG rejected the Department's position in a counter proposal on October 2000.</p>
	<p pid="e.294W.11/3">The CG was in favour of further joint studies and the House was informed in March 2001. As a result of these further studies and developments over the next four years, the Department's position is now that 'it cannot scheme compensation' to surface only workers for COPD.</p>

	<p pid="e.300W.5/19">The contribution of renewables to total UK primary energy demand has grown from 1.3 per cent. in 2003 to 1.5 per cent. in 2004 and 1.7 per cent. in 2006. Thermal renewable sources appear to make a larger contribution to energy supplied by renewables when measured in primary energy terms because, by definition, the primary inputs of non-thermal sources such as wind and hydro are equal to the electricity produced and there are thus no conversion losses.</p>

It is possible that section 216 may also apply to new businesses run by directors of other insolvent companies which have no connection with the activities of the previous businesses and consequently would not be considered to be &quot;phoenix&quot; companies. Section 216 applies to any director of an insolvent company, independently of any wrongdoing.

	<p pid="e.314W.5/1">The aim of Regulation (EC) No. 2006/2004 is to formalise and improve co-operation arrangements between member states' consumer enforcement authorities, in order to better combat cross-border frauds and scams. Its focus is on practices that affect the collective interest of consumers, rather than complaints affecting only individuals, and its scope is limited to the 15 pieces of EC consumer protection legislation named in the annex to the regulation.</p>
	<p pid="e.314W.5/2">Basic details of alleged infringements such as business names and details of the complaint will be transmitted from one country's Single Liaison Office to another's and then on to the relevant enforcer by means of a secure database.</p>
	<p pid="e.314W.5/3">Access to the database is limited to enforcers designated as competent authorities and national Single Liaison Offices (in the UK, the Office of Fair Trading). Single Liaison Offices will only have access to information relating to requests for mutual assistance which have not been given confidential treatment. Non-EU countries do not have access to the database. The regulation does anticipate entering into arrangements with third (that is, non-EU) countries but none are in place at present, and any future arrangements should have appropriate safeguards.</p>
	<p pid="e.314W.5/4">Data held on the database will be subject to the provisions and protections of the Data Protection Act 1998 (DPA). While the regulation requires us to prevent the subject access provisions of the DPA from being used by business to obstruct the proper functioning of the regulation, we are satisfied that this fact should not cause problems in practice because appropriate safeguards have been built in.</p>

	<p pid="e.321W.14/1">The safe and expeditious recovery of our forces returning from operational theatres is a high priority. Troop movement is generally working well and between April and December 2006, 80 per cent. of RAF operational passenger air transport flights were on time or delayed by less than three hours. For Iraq this figure was 86 per cent. and for Afghanistan it was 75 per cent. Recent improvements to the Afghanistan air-bridge include refurbishment of the runway at Kandahar Airfield, which was completed in November 2006. This now allows troops to fly from an airport closer to the majority of deployed locations, reducing in-theatre journeys by up to 24 hours.</p>

	<p pid="e.324W.6/1">The effective management of stores involves the assimilation of considerable quantities of information from a wide variety of sources. The MOD currently operates six major supply systems, seven major inventory systems and six major warehousing systems. Currently there is considerable integration within the single services and some integration across the services.</p>
	<p pid="e.324W.6/2">In the light of experience during operations in Iraq in 2003, the Support Chain Programme was established to modernise and make significant improvements in the integration of the different information systems used for the management of stores, to drive forward change in logistic and engineering information systems and to provide a robust governance framework for the management of new projects and existing systems.</p>
	<p pid="e.324W.6/3">The programme is focusing initially on delivering improved operational capability to the front line, with major changes to base systems following on later.</p>
	<p pid="e.324W.6/4">Under the Support Chain Programme the six major supply systems are due to be reduced to one over the next few years. Work is also in hand to achieve similar reductions in inventory and warehousing systems. The programme will integrate both legacy and future information systems to retain coherence. To assist this, work is also under way to modernise the means by which applications are able to communicate with one another, with modern technology allowing for the creation of more flexible and intelligent networks. The ultimate aim is to move to a position where MOD is operating a fully integrated stores management system working right across defence, including industry.</p>

	<p pid="e.341W.5/1">The National Institute for Health and Clinical Effectiveness (NICE) published a health technology appraisal on statins in January 2006. This took account of all available evidence and concluded that it was effective to intervene with statin therapy in patients who scored a 20 per cent. or greater 10-year risk of developing cardiovascular disease, regardless of the starting cholesterol.</p>
	<p pid="e.341W.5/2">NICE is currently working on a guideline on lipid control, due for publication next year, which is also looking at the issue of risk assessment.</p>
	<p pid="e.341W.5/3">There are a number of different risk assessment tools for coronary heart disease (CHD) in use in England. Most of them derive from the Framingham prediction equations, which estimate CHD risk based on patients' age, gender, blood pressure, total cholesterol, high-density cholesterol, presence of diabetes and smoking habit. Relative risk reductions in CHD events in the statin trials appear similar regardless of baseline risk and baseline cholesterol except where baseline cholesterol is less than 5.0 mmol/l when the relative risk reduction is less. This implies that the best way to target patients for cholesterol control and statin therapy to reduce CHD risk is to calculate absolute risk.</p>

The Department has not made an assessment of the proportion of dental providers who are likely to fulfil their annual service commitments. It is for primary care trusts, working with dental providers, to monitor and manage contract performance locally.</p>
	<p pid="e.343W.5/2">For dentists previously working under the old general dental services contract, the new annual service level is based on the weighted courses of treatment paid for during a 12-month reference period (October 2004 to September 2005), but with a reduction of five per cent. By removing the old fee-per-item system of payment, the new arrangements have also been designed to support dentists in carrying out simpler courses of treatment. Dentists should, therefore, generally have the opportunity to carry out fewer and simpler courses of treatment compared with the reference period, enabling them to devote more time to preventative care and to manage their workload more effectively over the course of the year.</p>

	<p pid="e.347W.2/1">National health service trusts and primary care trusts (PCTs) are responsible for the provision of health care services in their areas. Regular re-appraisal of their service provision should be carried out to reflect changing demands of health care and consequently the whole or parts of hospital sites may become surplus to their requirements. Under guidance provided by the Department's publication Estatecode, such property should be offered to other local trusts to determine whether these assets could be re-used by them for the provision of health care services. This policy accords with the Government's requirement to make better use of surplus public sector land.</p>
	<p pid="e.347W.2/2">The centrally funded equipment programme is now complete, and there are currently no plans to install a new centrally funded CT scanner at the Frenchay Hospital site. It is the responsibility of the local PCTs to ensure that service requirements in the area are met, and that all decisions are based on local priorities and available resources. NHS South West has reported that the North Bristol Trust is planning to provide a new mobile CT scanner, which can serve more than one site in the Bristol area so as to maximise the use of the facility.</p>

	<p pid="e.351W.0/1">The National Institute for Health and Clinical Effectiveness (NICE) published a health technology appraisal (HTA) on statins in January 2006. This took account of all available evidence and concluded that it was both clinically-effective and cost-effective to intervene with statin therapy in patients who scored a 20 per cent. or greater 10-year risk of developing cardiovascular disease (CVD), regardless of the starting cholesterol. This updates the national service framework for coronary heart disease (CHD) which had set the threshold for intervention at a 30 per cent. 10-year risk of CHD, both by lowering the intervention threshold and by including the range of vascular conditions&mdash;including cerebrovascular disease&mdash;which are together termed CVD.</p>
	<p pid="e.351W.0/2">More details can be found on the NICE website at:</p>
	<p pid="e.351W.0/3" class="indent"><a href="http://www.nice.org.uk">www.nice.org.uk</a></p>
	<p pid="e.351W.0/4">Cost-effectiveness estimates vary as costs change. The cost of generic statins came down sharply while the HTA was in preparation and has dropped again since its publication. The NICE website therefore includes a tool which the national health service can use to determine current cost-effectiveness in their local health economies.</p>

	<p pid="e.353W.0/1">The Government have raised concerns about the use of organs from executed prisoners for transplantation with the Chinese government on a number of occasions, most recently at the last round of the UK-China Human Rights Dialogue in July 2006. The Government welcomed the regulation, which came into effect in China on <phrase class="date" code="2006-07-01">1 July 2006</phrase>, banning the sale of organs and introducing medical standards for organ transplants. But we remain concerned that the regulations do not comply with the requirement for donation to be based on full, free and informed consent, as set out by the World Medical Association and the World Health Organisation.</p>
	<p pid="e.353W.0/2">We have received no evidence to date to substantiate media reports of large-scale organ harvesting in China. The Chinese government has denied such allegations.</p>

	<p pid="e.357W.8/1">The Government view credible elections in Sierra Leone in July this year as crucial to consolidating the post-conflict peace and stability there. Practical support to Sierra Leone's National Electoral Commission (NEC) is a high priority and we have committed &pound;4 million to the UN Development Programme's &quot;basket fund&quot;, which finances the NEC and contributes to the cost of the elections. It is essential that Sierra Leoneans should be able to participate fully in the elections and that the result should reflect their choices. To this end, the UK is implementing a &pound;2.5 million programme of electoral support that will provide training for political parties, strengthen the capacity of national and local media to cover the elections and address the gender disparity surrounding elections. Our high commission in Freetown is also working with the full range of political and civil society to support free and credible elections.</p>
	<p pid="e.357W.8/2">Effective election monitoring will also play an important role in the elections. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office and the Department for International Development (DFID) received representations on this issue from the interim leader of the People's Movement for Democratic Change, Charles Margai, during his December tour of the UK. Our high commission and the DFID office in Freetown have also discussed election monitoring with the main political parties, the NEC, local and international non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and international partners, in order to assure adequate coverage before and during the polls.</p>
	<p pid="e.357W.8/3">Our &pound;2.5 million electoral programme will support a coalition of national election monitors, the &quot;National Elections Watch&quot;, which intends to host observers in every polling station in Sierra Leone. DFID will also be funding international election observers through the National Democratic Institute (NDI), an international NGO with expertise in election issues. NDI will host two observer missions prior to elections, one during the voter registration period and another during the campaign period, and one mission of 34 observers on election day. UK Government election observers will also be deployed for the critical phases of the electoral process and for the elections themselves. We have also called, in the EU Africa Working Group, for the deployment of an Election Observation Mission. Additionally, we are also engaging wider partners, including the UN, the Commonwealth Secretariat and the Carter Centre, to push for international support for the election monitoring effort.</p>

We are not aware of any recent public statements by President Yoweri Museveni of Uganda, on Zimbabwe's land policy. But independent surveys of the fate of Zimbabwe's agricultural population tell a tragic story: 75 per cent. of farm workers and their dependants have been forced out of their farmland homes. These people, who number at least two million, now live marginal lives without income, access to proper shelter, food or medicine. We fear that many of these people have died. We are concerned that the Gazetted Land Act, which Mugabe signed into law in December, will be used as an unjust pretext for further intimidation and attacks on farmers, with more damage to Zimbabwe's economy.</p>

The new Planning Policy Statement No. 25 directs development away from these areas through a sequential, risk-based approach.

	<p pid="e.372W.2/1">Since 1997, Liverpool has seen significant improvements in housing, infrastructure and economic and social development. Last year (2005-06) through New Heartlands, the Housing Market Renewal (HMR) scheme, there were in excess of 1,300 new homes constructed and over 1,600 homes refurbished in Liverpool. There was also an additional &pound;10.5 million of private sector funding invested within the Liverpool pathfinder area, of which &pound;4.2 million went specifically into HMR projects.</p>
	<p pid="e.372W.2/2">Liverpool John Lennon airport, one of the fastest growing airports in the UK, received European objective 1 funding towards increasing terminal capacity and improving passenger and public transport facilities. The airport is a key economic driver in the regeneration of the area, and direct on and off-site employment at the airport has risen from 500 employees in 1997 to 2,350 in 2005.</p>
	<p pid="e.372W.2/3">Under the 2000-06 Programme of European objective 1 funding in Merseyside, over 1,700 projects have been approved, in excess of 37,000 jobs have been created and over 6,000 business start-ups have been assisted.</p>
	<p pid="e.372W.2/4">Social improvements are demonstrated by the city's progress towards narrowing the gap against key national floor target indicators. Particular progress has been made in education, housing and liveability, which has seen the gap reduce from 11.3 in 2003-04 to 8.6 in 2004-05. Furthermore, the overall Liverpool employment rate has increased at a higher rate than the UK average, 1.3 per cent. compared to 0.3 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="e.372W.2/5">In addition, GVA growth in Liverpool (1998 to 2003) outstripped the national average rate. Liverpool has also seen a significant expansion in knowledge-based employment and benefited from substantial private sector investment in its tourism infrastructure.</p>
	<p pid="e.372W.2/6">The total funding Communities and Local Government has invested in Liverpool for regeneration projects since 1997 is in excess of &pound;670 million. Additionally Liverpool is also eligible to benefit from a further &pound;393.3 million which Communities and Local Government has invested into the wider Merseyside region. The European objective 1 programme (2000-06) also provides a further &pound;910 million for investment in Merseyside and Liverpool will benefit from this investment.</p>
	<p pid="e.372W.2/7">We do not hold the total figures of regeneration spend for Liverpool in every funding stream since 1997 on an annual basis. However, the following table details the main regeneration funding since 1997, available directly to Liverpool or from which Liverpool can benefit.</p>

	<p pid="e.376W.9/1">The &quot;responsibility to protect&quot; concept, endorsed at the 2005 UN World Summit, made clear that individual states hold the primary responsibility to protect their own populations from genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity. The international community also confirmed its readiness to act, collectively, to prevent and stop such crimes, through the United Nations. Such action includes using appropriate diplomatic, humanitarian and other peaceful means, including sanctions. On a case by case basis, should peaceful means be inadequate and national authorities manifestly fail to protect their populations, the UN Security Council may authorise the use of force.</p>
	<p pid="e.376W.9/2">Since the World Summit, the UN Security Council has adopted resolutions on the Protection of Civilians in Armed Conflict and on Darfur, both of which refer to the World Summit agreement on the responsibility to protect. In addressing the situation in Darfur, we have also used diplomacy and applied political pressure; reminded the Sudanese Government of their own responsibility to the people of Darfur; worked through the Security Council to apply sanctions; referred the situation in Darfur to the International Criminal Court; and are working on UN support to the African Union Mission in Sudan.</p>
	<p pid="e.376W.9/3">Through the Global Conflict Prevention Pool, the UK is also supporting an NGO network to raise the profile of responsibility to protect with national governments and civil society, particularly in Africa.</p>
	<p pid="e.376W.9/4">The Government will continue to advocate appropriate and speedy responses&mdash;bilaterally, within the EU and UN, and at the Security Council&mdash;to protect vulnerable populations against genocide, war crimes, crimes against humanity and ethnic cleansing.</p>

	<p pid="e.380W.2/1">We welcome any serious attempt at getting AIDS drugs more accessible and affordable for those who need them. Partnerships between employers, unions and manufacturers are an integral part of what is needed to see progress in tackling HIV and AIDS in developing countries.</p>
	<p pid="e.380W.2/2">We have not made a detailed assessment of the impact of the outcome of the International Federation of Chemical, Energy, Mine and General Workers' Unions talks with pharmaceutical companies on the availability of affordable HIV/AIDS treatments. We would certainly encourage the pharmaceutical sector to do all it can to make essential drugs more easily available and affordable to poor countries.</p>
	<p pid="e.380W.2/3">This is why in 2005, the Department for International Development (DFID) published a framework for good practice in the pharmaceutical industry to help increase access to essential medicines that treat diseases of poverty including HIV/AIDS in all developing countries. DFID continues to subscribe to the framework's principles and welcomes all efforts to improve both access and affordability, including through differential pricing and negotiating agreements to lower the price of HIV/AIDS treatments. Our support to UNITAID, the new drug purchase facility, is helping to do this, most recently with the assistance of the Clinton Foundation.</p>
	<p pid="e.380W.2/4">We hope that it will be possible for both parties to reopen negotiations at some stage in the future, given the potential benefits overall. Trade Unions as well as companies play a vital role in efforts to tackle AIDS. Working with employees in large, small and medium sized companies, in the formal and informal sectors&mdash;and in the public and private sectors&mdash;Trade Unions can support the implementation of effective company work place policies. In turn this will ultimately reduce the impact of AIDS on employees and businesses.</p>

	<p pid="e.382W.8/1">DFID currently provides development assistance to three Overseas Territories, Montserrat, St. Helena (including Tristan da Cunha) and Pitcairn. Following completion of Gerald's airport in 2005, the next priority for improving transport links to Montserrat will be the improvement of the port at Little Bay. The project is currently at the design stage. It is expected to be jointly funded by DFID and the European Union (EU), and may include an extension to the existing jetty and construction of a breakwater. The cost will depend on the options selected, but could be up to &pound;10 million.</p>
	<p pid="e.382W.8/2">In March 2005, I announced the development of air access for St. Helena, through construction of an airport on Prosperous Bay Plain, and introduction of scheduled flights. The new airport will both meet our commitment to maintaining access, and contribute to economic regeneration through tourism. The project includes significant funding for tourism marketing. The project budget cannot be divulged in order not to prejudice the current procurement competition for the construction works. We also plan, with joint funding from the EU, to develop Jamestown Wharf. Currently the Wharf is the single point of entry to the island for all cargo and passengers. The proposed project addresses the need to improve cargo operations and to develop safe landing facilities for St. Helenians, business visitors and tourists. Costs will be about &pound;11.5 million.</p>
	<p pid="e.382W.8/3">In Tristan da Cunha, DFID, with joint EU funding, is currently rehabilitating Calshot harbour. Repairs to Tristan's harbour and breakwater were last carried out over 10 years ago and continuous wave action and storm damage now threaten to cause permanent damage to the island's only point of entry. Total project cost is about &pound;3 million.</p>
	<p pid="e.382W.8/4">Plans for the construction of a breakwater on Pitcairn, again with joint EU funding, are well advanced. Consultants have been appointed to prepare a detailed design and costing, estimated to be about &pound;6 million. A breakwater would provide more predictable and safer access to Pitcairn Island through Bounty Bay. This in turn will promote tourism on the island by increasing the opportunities for cruise ships, yachts and other ships to disembark passengers.</p>

	<p pid="e.383W.2/1">Projects funded by DFID by themselves have a very small effect on global emissions. They are part of a much wider development effort. We are therefore supporting developing countries to develop energy strategies to improve access to services while taking climate change into account. DFID's work with the World Bank and other development agencies allows us to influence these processes to the sustainable benefit of the poorest people in developing countries.</p>
	<p pid="e.383W.2/2">DFID is providing assistance to the World Bank and other regional development banks to develop a framework for accelerating public and private investment in low carbon energy in developing countries. We have committed &pound;6.9 million over three years from 2005 to support this work.</p>
	<p pid="e.383W.2/3">DFID has committed &pound;140 million to the Global Environment Facility fourth replenishment (2006-10), making the UK the fourth largest donor. A third of the Global Environment facility's funding is used to address climate change. In China for example, GEF is providing more than &pound;18 million to help reduce China's heavy reliance on coal by helping to install five wind farms (190 mega watts) and 200,000 solar-powered systems.</p>

	<p pid="e.386W.0/1">DFID has substantial programmes of co-operation with China in support of achievement of the millennium development goals in three areas: health (TB and HIV and AIDS), basic education, and water resource management, water supply and sanitation. The environmental impact on development is a strong theme throughout, but particularly in the water area.</p>
	<p pid="e.386W.0/2">DFID also works with China on international development issues, and is involved with the UK-China sustainable development dialogue. This is led by DEFRA, but with strong support from DFID. The four priority themes agreed with the Chinese for the next two years are natural resource management (especially forests, water and soils); sustainable consumption and production; capacity building for sustainable development; and sustainable urban communities. All of these themes address the environmental impacts of development, and involve collaboration and technical exchanges between different departments in the UK and China, as well as a range of small projects involving government, NGOs and the private sector.</p>
	<p pid="e.386W.0/3">Finally, DFID is a key participant in the UK-China working group on climate change, and plays a particularly strong role in promoting the need to adapt to the anticipated impacts of climate change, through both projects and dialogue.</p>

	<p pid="e.387W.8/1">DFID does not maintain an agreed list of 'states affected by conflict'. We do have a list of 'fragile states' which we are currently reviewing, as countries frequently move in and out of fragility and conflict, and political circumstances in a country can rapidly change. This list will include countries that are generally recognised to be conflict-affected. Detail on DFID's current definition and list of fragile states can be found in DFID's policy paper, &quot;Why We Need to Work More Effectively in Fragile States&quot;, page 7 and Annex 1, which is available in the House of Commons Library.</p>
	<p pid="e.387W.8/2" class="italic"> (a) Education</p>
	<p pid="e.387W.8/3">The UK announcement in April to provide &pound;8.5 billion over the next 10 years in support of education will contribute to international efforts to achieve universal primary education by 2015. The Education for All Fast Track Initiative's (FTI) Education Programme and Development Fund will help assist conflict affected states prepare education sector plans for donor support. The FTI is currently piloting support in DRC, Haiti, Liberia, Somalia and Sudan.</p>
	<p pid="e.387W.8/4">DFID also supports the direct provision of education in a number of countries affected by conflict through United Nations agencies and international non-governmental organisations (INGOS). For example in Somalia DFID has a 3-year partnership with the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) and United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO) to increase children's access to education, with a strong focus on getting girls into school. In Burma our partnership with Save the Children UK supports early childhood education which provides safe schooling for young children in some of the poorest conflict-affected communities.</p>
	<p pid="e.387W.8/5" class="italic"> (b) Health</p>
	<p pid="e.387W.8/6">DFID is already providing much more aid to the health sectors in fragile states, with expenditure more than doubling between 2003-04 and 2005-06. Examples include a joint programme for HIV/AIDS in Burma. This has attracted increased funding and made possible a larger-scale national response. In Afghanistan, a multi-donor trust fund, the Afghanistan Reconstruction Trust Fund (ARTF) is helping to build government systems while at the same time raising additional finance for basic services such as health, education and water and sanitation that are focused on the poor.</p>
	<p pid="e.387W.8/7">DFID also contributes to Global Health Funds and Partnerships. An example, the Global Fund to fight AIDS, TB and Malaria, has committed US $ 1.5 billion in 142 grants in fragile states, accounting for over one-third of total commitments.</p>

	<p pid="e.388W.8/1">The Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) signed up to the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) in March 2005. Since then important progress has been made in implementing EITI in the DRC. A multi-stakeholder national EITI Committee was established by Presidential Decree in November 2005 charged with ensuring the DRC implementation process complies with EITI criteria. In February 2006, the DRC Government named members of the EITI Committee and allocated a budget for its operations from the Government's finances. In addition, an EITI baseline study for the exploitation of copper, cobalt and diamonds is currently underway.</p>
	<p pid="e.388W.8/2">However, a lot more work will be needed before EITI is fully implemented in the DRC. Continued political commitment from the newly-elected DRC Government as well as capacity building and improved co-ordination within relevant DRC Government institutions will be crucial. Strong engagement from civil society, private sector and wider international community stakeholders will also be required.</p>
	<p pid="e.388W.8/3">Support for EITI implementation forms an important plank of DFID's planned support in the minerals sector in DRC. Over coming months, DFID will be working with all EITI stakeholders to develop a package of support aimed at ensuring EITI is successfully implemented in the DRC.</p>

	<p pid="e.391W.0/1">Aid is classified as poverty reduction budget support (PRBS) if it is merged with other domestic resources and accounted for alongside the rest of the partner Government's expenditure through their reporting and accounting systems and reports of the Auditor General. Sector budget support is aid that is earmarked for expenditure either in a particular sector, sub sector, programme, or set of expenditure lines. The general principle is that this is aid which is spent using national or sub-national financial management, procurement and accountability systems.

	<p pid="e.391W.3/1">In DFID's 2006 White Paper on International Development, &quot;Making governance work for the poor&quot;, we made a commitment to support special initiatives to get more girls into school. We have just published the first Progress Report of DFID's 2005 girls' education strategy 'Girls' education: towards a better future for all' which provides more details. Copies of the report are being placed in the Library.</p>
	<p pid="e.391W.3/2">The UK's &pound;8.5 billion funding commitment to education in developing countries will mainly be used to support partner Governments with predictable funding against which they can prepare ambitious 10 year education sector plans to achieve the education millennium development goals. The plans will focus on investment in schools, including recruiting and training more teachers, getting more pupils, including girls and disadvantaged children, into and completing school and improving the quality of education. So at least half of this funding will benefit girls directly or indirectly.</p>
	<p pid="e.391W.3/3">The development of education sector plans is being led by the developing countries, with donors including the UK contributing. Individual allocations of the &pound;8.5 billion, including special initiatives for girls, will be decided at country level.</p>

	<p pid="e.392W.8/1">Improved access to reliable and affordable energy supplies and services is essential for the achievement of international development goals. The poorest countries and regions of the world, such as sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, have the least access to electricity and to sustainable clean fuels for cooking and heating.</p>
	<p pid="e.392W.8/2">DFID has been actively engaged with the EU Energy Initiative for Poverty Eradication and Sustainable Development (EUEI) since it was launched in 2002. This has the primary aim of improving access to affordable and sustainable energy services to the poor. Alongside five other European Union member states, DFID is providing grant funds to an EUEI technical assistance programme, which is helping developing countries and regional organisations in Africa to prepare energy policies. In addition, DFID supported the launch in 2006 of a &euro;220 million EU Energy Facility, funded from the 9<sup>(th)</sup> European Development Fund, to improve access to energy in rural areas, mainly in Africa.</p>
	<p pid="e.392W.8/3">DFID contributes to the Energy Sector Management Assistance Programme (ESMAP), which is managed by the World Bank on behalf of the donors. The goal of the programme is to provide energy solutions to reduce poverty, through improved access to sustainable energy services. New policies and plans for the greater use of renewable energy and improved energy efficiency in developing countries are significant aspects of the programme.</p>
	<p pid="e.392W.8/4">DFID is also working closely with the World Bank and the regional development banks on a new Investment Framework for Clean Energy and Development. The World Bank and other International Finance Institutions have approved or are developing their Investment Frameworks and these will be implemented in 2007. These new frameworks include measures to help countries move towards lower carbon energy sources, to reduce the growth of greenhouse gas emissions, to adapt to the effects of climate change and to access new carbon credit financing. The World Bank has accepted an offer from DFID of a technical assistance grant to help them implement actions on climate change and clean energy and we are in discussion with the other IFIs on similar support.</p>
	<p pid="e.392W.8/5">DFID is launching in 2007 a new five-year Energy Research Programme to improve access to energy supplies and services in support of development. This is expected to include the application of renewable energy and other sustainable technologies. This new research programme will build on earlier DFID funded work on renewable energy technologies.</p>

	<p pid="e.396W.8/1">The most recent reliable unemployment data available for Iraq comes from the Iraq Living Conditions Survey carried out in 2004 by the Iraqi Ministry of Planning and Development Cooperation/United Nations Development Programme. There is no other more recent comparable survey. The 2004 survey found that the core unemployment rate in Iraq was just over 10 per cent. (using the International Labour Organisation definition i.e. looking for but unable to find employment). In 2004, Iraq had a working age population of 16.4 million, but only 6.7 million (41 per cent.) were working or actively seeking work. 6 million of these were employed, leaving 700,000 (around 10 per cent.) unemployed. Unemployment was highest in Baghdad at 13.5 per cent., then the South at 10.8 per cent.; then 9.1 per cent. in the North and the lowest in the centre at 8.2 per cent. The survey also notes that workforce participation is higher in rural areas than urban areas.</p>
	<p pid="e.396W.8/2">Available data show that Iraq has always had a very low workforce participation rate, in line with other countries in the region. This can be attributed to low participation rates among women (common to other countries in the region) and young men. Young men constitute 15 per cent. of the economically inactive (i.e. above 15-years-old but not seeking employment). The majority of young economically inactive men (68 per cent.) claim they are studying and thus not available to work. 20 per cent. claim that there are no jobs available and have therefore given up looking for work.</p>
	<p pid="e.396W.8/3">Ongoing violence in Iraq makes job creation difficult, and in particular discourages private investment which could boost employment. DFID is working with the Iraqi Government to ensure that when the security situation improves, the economy is stable and in a position to grow and to generate new jobs.</p>

	<p pid="e.397W.5/1">A review took place in 2004 of the DFID-funded Self-Build Materials Grant project, designed to help people to construct their own houses in Montserrat in the aftermath of the volcano crisis. The review concluded that, whilst the project appeared to have benefited those people who received support, it was poorly managed locally and inadequately monitored by DFID.</p>
	<p pid="e.397W.5/2">DFID and the Government of Montserrat (GoM) agreed an action plan in early 2005, comprising a series of measures to avoid similar problems arising in future projects. An internal DFID review in early 2006 concluded that satisfactory progress was being made against the plan.</p>
	<p pid="e.397W.5/3">The investigations into the Materials Grant project have had no direct impact on the provision of budgetary aid to Montserrat. We are however helping to strengthen financial management systems across GoM. DFID reviewed development assistance for housing projects on the island at the end of 2005, and agreed to provide &pound;1.9 million (EC$9 million) over a three year period to support the provision of housing for the mentally challenged, other vulnerable groups and low-income households at the Lookout housing estate, with the appointment of a housing adviser to help GoM to implement its new housing strategy.</p>

	<p pid="e.397W.8/1">Following the signing of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement (<phrase class="date" code="2006-11-21">21 November 2006</phrase>) by the Seven Party Alliance and the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoists) and subsequent Agreement on the Monitoring of Arms and Armies (<phrase class="date" code="2006-11-28">28 November 2006</phrase>), the combatants of the Maoist People's Liberation Army (PLA) are moving to 28 military camps (or cantonments) around Nepal. The Agreements state that here they would be registered by the UN and have their weapons locked up and monitored by the UN. After the holding of Constituent Assembly elections, scheduled for June 2007, these combatants would either be integrated into the Nepal Army or helped reintegrate back into civilian life.</p>
	<p pid="e.397W.8/2">The Maoists have already moved several thousand of their combatants to the sites of these proposed camps. Given that infrastructure has not yet been set up, the conditions at these sites are extremely basic. As an interim measure, the GON has provided funds directly to the Maoists to enable them to purchase food and basic plastic sheeting shelter for their combatants. Due to Maoist sensitivities and the desire of GON to lead this process, donor projects cannot go to sites and make unilateral assessments.</p>
	<p pid="e.397W.8/3">However, given the importance of the success of the cantonments of PLA to the peace process, several donors, including DFID have offered the services of their rural infrastructure programmes located in the districts where camps are to be constructed to assist with setting up the camps. Assessments of need are being undertaken now, and the first proposals for providing immediate support are being developed.</p>
	<p pid="e.397W.8/4">DFID is working with the Government of Nepal to come up with appropriate and affordable solutions for establishment and management of the camps. Given the sensitivities of the parties involved, achieving consensus on the way forward is slow, but progress is being made.</p>

	<p pid="e.403W.2/32" class="indent">SCAs directly inform DFID policies and programmes. In Nepal, the SCA led to DFID's policies and programmes fundamentally changing. New staff were recruited, new offices opened and new programmes developed to focus on the issues of social exclusion, an underlying cause of the Maoist insurgency. In Yemen the SCA helped identify and prioritise the need to strengthen access to justice, and led to the development of a new security and judicial reform programme. In the Balkans, the SCA process helped refocus the UK assistance programme, for example increasing support to final status talks in Kosovo.</p>
	<p pid="e.403W.2/33" class="indent">The SCA process 'joins up' thinking across UK Government Departments. The majority of SCAs have been conducted in partnership with the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) and the Ministry of Defence (MOD). This has helped develop a shared understanding of the factors underpinning violent conflict. For example, in Sri Lanka the SCA process brought together the UK's diplomatic, defence and development work and led to a unified policy framework focused on conflict prevention and peacebuilding.</p>
	<p pid="e.403W.2/34" class="indent">The SCA process strengthens coordination between different donor agencies. For example, the SCA for the North Caucasus was widely disseminated and used by other international actors to inform the strategy of moving incrementally from humanitarian assistance to reconstruction and development aid.</p>

This is our call to others&mdash;both international donors and governments in developing countries&mdash;to encourage them to do more.

	<p pid="e.405W.11/2">Our message is that governments and the international community must organise themselves better and be held to account more effectively. To make this work we have stated that there should be one annual report to monitor progress towards achieving the water and sanitation Millennium Development Goal targets and one high-level global annual meeting to agree action. At the country level there should be one national water and sanitation plan, one co-ordinating group and one lead United Nations body for water and sanitation, identified at a national level.</p>
	<p pid="e.405W.11/3">We will be following up this call for action over the coming months.</p>

	<p pid="e.407W.2/1">Close co-operation between the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank improves the effectiveness of their support for poverty reduction and stability. We welcome the External Review Committee on Fund-Bank collaboration established by Rodrigo De Rato and Paul Wolfowitz in March 2006.</p>
	<p pid="e.407W.2/2">This has provided the opportunity to feed in UK views on how they can strengthen co-operation. Our contributions have been based around three themes. The first is to stress that there are important roles and responsibilities for both the Fund and Bank in both middle and low income countries. The second is to highlight areas where the Fund and Bank can make a more effective contribution through joint work. We have identified debt sustainability, financial sector strength, public expenditure management, and economic policy and growth, as the most critical issues. Both institutions also have an important contribution to make in supporting country-led poverty reduction strategies. The third theme is to highlight the need for a strong co-operative culture in both institutions so that there is consistent and effective collaboration in all developing countries. This requires a strong and sustained commitment from the management of the Fund and Bank. The UK continues to engage with the Committee and our international partners to exchange views and provide feedback on the extent to which the Fund and Bank are working together effectively in country.

	<p pid="e.408W.2/1">The World Bank is recognised as a leader in the field of measuring and managing for results. It was charged under the Marrakech Action Plan with developing a global good practice guide, and has developed an approach which aims to (i) strengthen countries' capacity to manage for results; (ii) enhance the Bank's own effectiveness in results management and (iii) coordinate various efforts at establishing a more results-based approach. The International Development Association (IDA), the Bank's concessional lending arm, was the first international financial institution to introduce a results measurement system (RMS). It tracks both country outcomes and the Bank's contribution to those outcomes. At the country level 14 indicators have been identified for monitoring, covering economic growth and poverty reduction, public financial management, investment climate, infrastructure, and human development. Within the Bank, a steering group has been established to promote broader awareness of the agenda and to identify specific systemic improvements that will enable the results-based system to be effective.</p>
	<p pid="e.408W.2/2">Maintaining and improving the Bank's focus on country-level results is a key objective of the UK's current three-year strategy for the World Bank. It is also one of the performance criteria which DFID is monitoring to assess progress against DFID's 2005-08 public service agreement target for improving the effectiveness of multilateral agencies. We will continue to use every opportunity to promote this and encourage further progress by the Bank. These include discussions in Washington and in our work with the Bank in poor countries. The latest major discussion on the results-based approach was in Washington at the IDA 14 Mid-Term Review meeting in November 2006. The Bank produced a paper on experience to date, noting areas where good progress had been made, and areas were this had been more limited&mdash;particularly in respect of developing the capacity of poor countries. The UK, and many other countries, recognised the Bank's commitment to results and acknowledged progress. We also noted that there was still much to do, and that sustained efforts would be required, in a range of areas, to make the results-based approach effective.</p>

	<p pid="e.408W.5/1">The global economy has become increasingly integrated in recent years and as it continues to change, it is important that in both their function and governance the multilateral institutions are modernised to respond to those changes. Through reform the legitimacy and effectiveness of both institutions can be strengthened.</p>
	<p pid="e.408W.5/2">The UK has been committed to the strengthening of developing country say in the governance of the IMF and World Bank for a number of years. The Government have reiterated that commitment in the White Paper on International Development published in July 2006.</p>
	<p pid="e.408W.5/3">Within the IMF, the UK welcomes the first steps towards reform and the timetable for further reform set out in the resolution agreed by Governors of the IMF in September 2006, to be completed, at the latest, by the autumn of 2008. The UK has given strong support and equal weight to both objectives of IMF reform: realigning member country shares to reflect global economic changes and strengthening the voice and participation of low income countries. The UK has been clear that reform must increase the voting share of low income countries as well as that of underweighted emerging market economies and we continue to emphasise this. In particular, the UK believes a stronger voice for low income countries requires a substantial increase in the share of basic votes which are assigned equally to all IMF members. These necessary governance reforms should be complemented by continued modernisation of the IMF's instruments to ensure its continued effectiveness with the entire membership. To this end, the UK also supports proposals to reinforce the IMF's crisis prevention role through a new framework for surveillance, with an emphasis on multilateral surveillance, and by expanding the IMF's range of instruments for crisis prevention.</p>
	<p pid="e.408W.5/4">The 2006 White Paper on International Development acknowledges the critical role which the World Bank plays in providing development assistance to developing countries. It also makes clear that the World Bank must reform if it is to remain relevant in a changing world. Four priorities are identified for the Bank:</p>
	<p pid="e.408W.5/5" class="indent">play a leading role in providing more long-term, predictable funding for developing countries;</p>
	<p pid="e.408W.5/6" class="indent">find new ways to work with middle income countries as they still face major development changes and are shaping the wider world;</p>
	<p pid="e.408W.5/7" class="indent">help tackle the global challenges facing developing countries&mdash;focusing urgently on a financing framework for clean energy and adaptation to climate change, and forging a new international framework to help developing countries tackle corruption and improve their governance;</p>
	<p pid="e.408W.5/8" class="indent">help developing countries obtain more influence in the World Bank, where they are weakly represented on the boards, with voting rights decided by financial contributions. This balance must change. The Bank must do more to support developing country priorities and not impose policy conditions in areas like privatisation and trade liberalisation. And if their members demand it, the Bank should be ready to change how members are represented, and how decisions are made&mdash;for example through greater voting rights for poor countries. There also needs to be greater transparency in the way that the World Bank and IMF operate. More World Bank analysis should be disclosed. I am pleased that in the recent discussions on conditionally, the Bank agreed to improve its practice in this area. And the practice of picking the heads of both institutions based on nationality should end&mdash;presidents should be chosen on merit.</p>
	<p pid="e.408W.5/9">We are actively pursuing these reforms in collaboration with like-minded partners.</p>

	<p pid="e.410W.2/1">I have not had such discussions, but I applaud the work of those who are campaigning for increased women's access to sanitary products in Zimbabwe and wish them every success in their fund-raising. The high cost and limited availability of these products is symptomatic of the dramatic economic decline in Zimbabwe in recent years. Along with others in the international community, we have made clear our deep concern about the policies of the Government of Zimbabwe which shows no interest in discussions about the fundamental policy reforms which are needed. Meanwhile, DFID's top priorities are to tackle HIV and AIDS, currently causing over 3,200 deaths per week; and assisting over a million people living in dire poverty, many of whom will face serious food shortages in the coming months. All of DFID's assistance is delivered through NGOs and UN agencies&mdash;none of our funding is channelled through the Government of Zimbabwe.</p>

	<p pid="e.429W.2/3" class="italic"> Letter from Karen Dunnell, dated <phrase class="date" code="2007-01-08">8 January 2007</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="e.429W.2/4" class="indent">As National Statistician, I have been asked to reply to your parliamentary questions about unemployment. (109240,109243).</p>
	<p pid="e.429W.2/5" class="indent">The Office for National Statistics (ONS) compiles statistics of unemployment for parliamentary constituencies from the annual local area Labour Force Survey (LFS) and the Annual Population Survey (APS) following International Labour Organisation definitions.</p>
	<p pid="e.429W.2/6" class="indent">Table 1, attached, shows the number of unemployed people, aged 16 to 24 and aged 25 and over, resident in the Wellingborough constituency for the 12 months ending in February 1997 from the annual local area LFS and for the 12 months ending in June 2006 from the APS. Table 2 shows corresponding unemployment rates which are defined as the number of unemployed expressed as a percentage of the economically active population in the relevant age group.</p>
	<p pid="e.429W.2/7" class="indent">As these estimates are for a subset of the population in a small geographical area, they are based on very small sample sizes, and are therefore subject to large margins of uncertainty. In this case, the sample sizes are not sufficient to give an accurate estimate of even the direction of the change over the period.</p>
	<p pid="e.429W.2/8" class="indent">ONS also compiles statistics for local areas of people claiming Jobseeker's Allowance (JSA). Table 3, attached, shows the annual average number of people aged 18 to 24 and aged 25 and over, resident in the Wellingborough constituency, claiming JSA for the 12 months ending in November 1997 and November 2006. Sub-regional claimant count data is not seasonally adjusted and thus comparisons between different months may cause distortions. Annual averages are shown to remove seasonally and years ending November are shown to include the latest month's data in the comparison.</p>

HM Revenue and Customs already places a significant proportion of its internal guidance on VAT on its website. Making available any further information on extended verification procedures would be likely to prejudice the assessment and collection of VAT.</p>

	<p pid="e.431W.12/2">None. Those involved in the design of official publications are encouraged to minimise the cost, the size and the environmental impact of their publications. Her Majesty's Stationery Office will often remind Departments of the need for economy in the production of their publications. The overall aim for any publication, though, must be that it is both readable and accessible to all who will have a need or interest in its content.</p>
	<p pid="e.431W.12/3">The size of margins is one aspect in the design of any publication which will also be affected by the page size, the length of the publication, typeface, typesize and line and paragraph spacing.</p>
	<p pid="e.431W.12/4">Margins may also be affected by the nature of the printing process to be adopted and the size of the publication which will determine whether a larger inside margin is required to allow for binding.</p>
	<p pid="e.431W.12/5">Margins are very important for readers, providing space to hold each page without hiding any of the text and providing a resting spot for a reader's eyes. Long lines of type can also be difficult and tiresome to read. It is very easy for readers to get lost making the transition from the end of one line of text to the beginning of the next. Where lines are lengthened, it is generally necessary to increase the space between lines and the overall result is no saving in paper.</p>

	<p pid="e.440W.2/1">Quarterly snapshots are published showing the number of people detained under Immigration Act powers on the last Saturday of each quarter. As at <phrase class="date" code="2006-09-30">30 September 2006</phrase>, there were no persons recorded as being under 18, detained solely under Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Act 2006 powers, who had been detained for more than 28 days.</p>
	<p pid="e.440W.2/2">The number of children detained with their families solely under Immigration Act powers will change from day to day. However, internal management information shows that, as at <phrase class="date" code="2006-08-31">31 August 2006</phrase> there were three minors, and as at <phrase class="date" code="">31 October</phrase> there were three minors detained with their families under Immigration Act powers, who had been detained for more than 28 days. These individuals were all detained as part of families whose detention as a group was considered necessary. These figures do not constitute part of national statistics as they are based on management information. This information has not been quality assured under national statistics protocols and should be treated as provisional.</p>
	<p pid="e.440W.2/3">Minors are detained only in two limited circumstances: first, as part of a family group whose detention is considered appropriate; secondly, when unaccompanied, while alternative care arrangements are made and normally just overnight. Whilst the detention of families with children is very regrettable, it nevertheless remains necessary in appropriate cases in order to maintain an effective immigration control and to tackle abuses of the asylum system.</p>
	<p pid="e.440W.2/4">Information on the number of persons detained is published in the quarterly asylum bulletin, on the Home Office Research, development and statistics directorate website at <a href="http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/immigration1.html">http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/immigration1 .html</a></p>

We have also released &pound;221 million by ensuring applicants are given the right status, clearing older cases out of the system and improving processes to cease support efficiently and &pound;63 million by increasing the use of more efficient pre-planned initial accommodation rather than expensive emergency accommodation.</p>

	<p pid="e.449W.11/1">Many terrorist groups on the list of proscribed organisations are based abroad but have used the UK for funding purposes. Proscribing such organisations and seizing their funds can severely limit their operations, as all aspects of terrorist activity cost money and such organisations are often dependent upon funds raised in foreign countries, including the UK. Operations involving the seizures of cash have a dual effect of both preventing terrorist attacks and disrupting the flow of terrorist funds.</p>
	<p pid="e.449W.11/2">The national terrorist financial investigation unit is the UK's law enforcement agency responsible for the investigation of terrorist finance and therefore plays the leading role in identifying funds associated with terrorism. Such funds are liable to seizure and forfeiture as set out in various legislation, including the Terrorism Act 2000 and the Anti-Terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001.</p>

	<p pid="e.453W.6/2">At the start of the Home Detention Curfew Scheme in January 1999, there were three electronic monitoring contractors operating across England and Wales. New contracts were negotiated in 2005 resulting in two contractors taking over the operation. The contractors are responsible for all electronic monitoring schemes, including that of Home Detention Curfew. Release and Recall Section within the National Offender Management Service is responsible for the recall of offenders who have been released on HDC whereas the responsibility for breaching curfew orders falls to the courts.</p>
	<p pid="e.453W.6/3">The contractors are required to notify Release and Recall Section of breaches of the curfew condition by offenders on Home Detention Curfew. Figures for breaches are broken down annually. While reconfiguring this information into quarters would incur disproportionate cost, the following table provides the total number of offenders recalled to custody by Release and Recall Section for breaching the conditions of Home Detention Curfew since the scheme was first introduced in January 1999.</p>
	<p pid="e.453W.6/4">Release and Recall Section notifies the police in every case where an offender is recalled to custody, and have a target to do this within 24 hours of being notified by the contractor of the breach of curfew. Throughout the entirety of the scheme there has been almost 100 per cent. compliance with the target.</p>
