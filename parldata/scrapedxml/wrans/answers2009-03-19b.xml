	<p pid="b.1285W.3/1">The latest adult reoffending statistics for England and Wales, 'Reoffending of adults: results from the 2006 cohort', were published on <phrase class="date" code="2008-09-04">4 September 2008</phrase>. These indicate that there has been significant success in reducing reoffending. Between 2000 and 2006 the number of offences committed by offenders commencing court orders under probation supervision has fallen 23.4 per cent. from 158.8 to 121.7 offences per 100 offenders.</p>
	<p pid="b.1285W.3/2">Re-offending data for North Liverpool and Salford are not yet available due to the need for a large number of sentenced offenders (where enough time has elapsed since the sentence was given to measure reoffending) and time to collect the data. Data on the compliance of all sentences for the Salford Community Justice Initiative are not available for similar reasons.</p>
	<p pid="b.1285W.3/3">Data on compliance of sentences for the North Liverpool Community Justice Centre are not available for similar reasons. However, anecdotal information published in an evaluation of the key components of the Centre, published in October 2007, reported that staff at the centre perceived that the increase in support and the offenders' enhanced sense of accountability had improved compliance.</p>
	<p pid="b.1285W.3/4">To date no assessment has been made of the effects of the Community Justice Centre in North Liverpool and the Salford Community Justice initiative on sentencing.</p>
	<p pid="b.1285W.3/5">Evidence of public perceptions of the Criminal Justice System (CJS) in North Liverpool was published in October 2007 as part of a survey of local residents over the period June 2005 to January 2007. This showed that although confidence in the CJS had decreased, it had not dropped as sharply as confidence in the CJS recorded by the British Crime Survey for Merseyside as a whole over the same period. This suggests that the centre had helped to increase confidence locally so that the decline was not as large as it was in other areas. There has been no assessment of the effects of the Salford Community Justice initiative on public perceptions of the CJS.</p>
	<p pid="b.1285W.3/6">The Criminal Statics Annual Report published by the Ministry of Justice for 2007, gives the percentage of defendants bailed to attend magistrates' courts, who then failed to appear at 11 per cent. Attendance rates data are not available for the North Liverpool and Salford community justice projects</p>
	<p pid="b.1285W.3/7">The Ministry of Justice published three evaluation reports in October 2007. These were a qualitative evaluation of the key components of North Liverpool, a qualitative evaluation of the implementation of the Salford project, and the results of a survey, carried out in three waves over time, of the perception of local residents in North Liverpool. There are no evaluations or assessments of the 11 newer projects.</p>
	<p pid="b.1285W.3/8">The 13 community justice courts in England and Wales are located at Birmingham, Bradford, Plymouth, Hull, Leicester, Merthyr Tydfil, Middlesbrough (Teesside Magistrates' Court) Nottingham, North Liverpool, Salford, and three locations in London, Haringey, Newham (Stratford Magistrates' Court) and Wandsworth (South Western Magistrates' Court).</p>

	<p pid="b.1298W.5/2"><i> </i>Following the publication of the Nation's Commitment: Cross Government Support to our Armed Forces, their Families and Veterans, the MOD has continued to work with other Departments and the devolved administrations to deliver the commitments made. To address problems caused by mobility, the Government have increased recognition for service children in the Schools Admissions Code, ensured that families on NHS waiting lists will not be disadvantaged by service moves and given service spouses and partners early access to new deal to help them stay in employment.</p>
	<p pid="b.1298W.5/3">A number of measures have been introduced to help service families access accommodation. Priority status for affordable housing schemes has been extended to service families in England, Scotland and Wales and to injured personnel for access to adapted affordable housing schemes; both remain for 12 months after leaving the service to help transition to civilian life. Service families applying for social housing on leaving the service will now be treated on a par with civilians in the area that they are serving.</p>
	<p pid="b.1298W.5/4">The MOD and single services have increased by 20 per cent. the number of specialist welfare support staff over the last year, doubled the grant to help units support families of deployed personnel and provided better internet access and cheaper telephone minutes to deployed personnel.</p>

	<p pid="b.1298W.8/2"><i> :</i> The MOD takes the care and welfare of all injured service personnel very seriously, and we regularly assess ways in which we can improve the care we provide. During the last 12 months, we have completed a review of our rehabilitation services, which led to the announcement in May 2008 of an additional &pound;24 million of funding, over the next four years, for the Defence Medical Rehabilitation Centre at Headley Court. The recent Healthcare Commission report into the Defence Medical Services also highlighted the exemplary level of operational healthcare and rehabilitation services.</p>
	<p pid="b.1298W.8/3">We look forward to the relocation of the Royal Centre for Defence Medicine's clinical facilities from Selly Oak to the new NHS hospital being built for the University Hospital Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust, which will start admitting patients in 2010 and will be Europe's largest and most modern critical care teaching hospital. Casualties from operations overseas will be treated in a modern military ward within the trauma and orthopaedics division of the trust, which will have special features for the exclusive use of military patients.</p>
	<p pid="b.1298W.8/4">In line with our commitment in last year's Service Personnel Command Paper, we have doubled the upfront lump sum payment for the most serious injuries under the Armed Forces Compensation Scheme (AFCS). All recipients, according to the severity of their injuries, will have an uplift of at least 10 per cent. in upfront lump sum payments. We also intend to confer additional benefits to extend this effect to those who have already made claims under the scheme.</p>

	<p pid="b.1300W.3/1">The Ministry of Defence does not discipline its employees for reasons of illness. It has a range of restoring efficiency procedures to restore and maintain acceptable levels of attendance and deals with staff whose excessive sickness absence and attendance record has become a cause for concern. Employment can be terminated where patterns of irregular attendance from staff becomes unacceptable, or where long-term sickness absence persists and there is no prospect of a regular return to work. Some staff may also qualify for ill health retirement in certain circumstances, under the terms of their pension scheme.</p>
	<p pid="b.1300W.3/2">In the period March 2008 to February 2009, the MOD dismissed 59 civilian employees for unacceptable attendance, 29 for long-term sickness absence and granted ill health retirement to a further 157 employees. A monthly breakdown of this is as follows:</p>

Finished admission episodes are counted against the year in which the admission episode finishes. Admissions do not represent the number of inpatients, as a person may have more than one admission within the year.<br/> <i> Primary diagnosis</i><br/>  The primary diagnosis is the first of up to 20 (14 from 2002-03 to 2006-07 and 7 prior to 2002-03) diagnosis fields in the Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) data set and provides the main reason why the patient was admitted to hospital.<br/> * Eating disorders are classified between the following ICD10 codes;<br/> F50.0 Anorexia nervosa<br/> F50.1 Atypical anorexia nervosa<br/> F50.2 Bulimia nervosa<br/> F50.3 Atypical bulimia nervosa<br/> F50.4 Overeating associated with other psychological disturbances<br/> F50.5 Vomiting associated with other psychological disturbances<br/> F50.8 Other eating disorders<br/> F50.9 Eating disorder, unspecified<br/> F98.2 Feeding disorder of infancy and childhood<br/> F98.3 Pica of infancy and childhood<br/> <i> Assessing growth through time</i><br/> HES figures are available from 1989-90 onwards. The quality and coverage of the data have improved over time. These improvements in information submitted by the NHS have been particularly marked in the earlier years and need to be borne in mind when analysing time series.<br/> Some of the increase in figures for later years (particularly 2006-07 onwards) may be due to the improvement in the coverage of independent sector activity.<br/> Changes in NHS practice also need to be borne in mind when analysing time series. For example, a number of procedures may now be undertaken in outpatient settings and may no longer be accounted for in the HES data. This may account for any reductions in activity over time.<br/> Pri<i> mary Care Trust (PCT)/SHA data quality</i><br/> PCT and SHA data was added to historic data years in the HES database using 2002-03 boundaries, as a one-off exercise in 2004. The quality of the data on PCT of treatment and SHA of treatment is poor in 1996-97, 1997-98 and 1998-99, with over a third of all finished episodes having missing values in these years. Data quality of PCT of general practitioner (GP) practice and SHA of GP practice in 1997-98 and 1998-99 is also poor, with a high proportion missing values where practices changed or ceased to exist. There is less change in completeness of the residence-based fields over time, where the majority of unknown values are due to missing postcodes on birth episodes. Users of time series analysis including these years need to be aware of these issues in their interpretation of the data.<br/> <i> Data quality</i><br/> HES are compiled from data sent by more than 300 NHS trusts and PCTs in England. Data is also received from a number of independent sector organisations for activity commissioned by the English NHS. The NHS Information Centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies and the effect of missing and invalid data via HES processes. While this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain.<br/> <i> Ungrossed data</i><br/> Figures have not been adjusted for shortfalls in the data, i.e. the data are ungrossed.<br/> <i> Small numbers</i><br/> To protect patient confidentiality, figures between one and five have been suppressed and replaced with &quot;*&quot; (an asterisk). Where it was possible to identify numbers from the total due to a single suppressed number in a row or column, an additional number (the next smallest) has been suppressed.<br/> <i> Source:</i><br/> Hospital Episode Statistics (HES), The NHS Information Centre for health and social care</td> </tr>

We are currently increasing our antiviral stockpile to ensure that there will be enough to treat up to 50 per cent. of the population in a pandemic, the reasonable worst case scenario of the number of people likely to exhibit symptoms of pandemic influenza. This stockpile is due to be in place by April 2009.</p>

	<p pid="b.1310W.5/1">The average daily number of available acute beds in wards open overnight per 1,000 of local population in each strategic health authority (SHA) area is shown in the following table. The current 10 SHAs were established on <phrase class="date" code="2006-07-01">1 July 2006</phrase>. Prior to this there were 28 SHAs. Data for 1997-98 to 2001-02 has been mapped to the 28 SHAs that were established on <phrase class="date" code="2002-04-01">1 April 2002</phrase> as Office for National Statistics population estimates have been produced at this level.</p>
	<p pid="b.1310W.5/2">Bed numbers have fallen because hospitals are dealing with patients more efficiently and more people are treated in primary care settings&mdash;experts all agree that this is the best way to deliver health care to patients.</p>
	<p pid="b.1310W.5/3">Advances in medical technology and shorter stays for routine operations mean fewer beds are needed across the service&mdash;this is part of a long-term downward trend in the average length of stay in hospital. But where the NHS needs more beds, there are more beds. For example, in day surgery, the number of day-only beds has increased by more than 47 per cent. since 1997-98, and we now have 55 per cent. more critical care beds and 116 per cent. more intermediate care beds than we had in 2000.</p>

	<p pid="b.1314W.2/2">The Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA) in partnership with professional bodies and other stakeholders, including patient groups and representatives of the NHS, has developed a national strategy to significantly reduce the incidence of multiple births resulting from IVF and related treatments. This strategy is known as the &quot;One at a Time&quot; campaign and includes promoting greater use of single embryo transfers (SET) where this is clinically appropriate for individual patients, leaving scope for the exercise of clinical discretion. The Department has observer status on the stakeholder group.</p>
	<p pid="b.1314W.2/3">The HFEA has required all licensed treatment centres to have in place a documented multiple births minimisation strategy, and to send a copy to the HFEA.</p>
	<p pid="b.1314W.2/4">The Department has established an expert group on commissioning NHS infertility provision to identify the barriers to the implementation of the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) fertility guideline in England and to help NHS commissioners to progress towards full implementation of the guideline. The expert group produced an interim report in August 2008, which recognised that patients are more likely to accept SET if they are assured that provision of services is established in line with the NICE guideline.</p>

	<p pid="b.1317W.5/1">It is for primary care trusts in partnership with local stakeholders, including practice based commissioners, local government and the public to determine how best to use their funds to meet national and local priorities for improving health and to commission services accordingly. This process provides the means for addressing local needs within the health community including the provision of prosthetic services for former service personnel.</p>
	<p pid="b.1317W.5/2">The current operating framework for the national health service requires commissioners to take account of military personnel, their families and veterans when commissioning services in their area. It is anticipated that those who use prostheses leaving the armed services to the NHS will be in single figures per year. The NHS will need to provide prosthetic maintenance to a service veteran that is equivalent to that previously enjoyed while the individual was serving and this is clinically appropriate.</p>

	<p pid="b.1320W.10/1">Parliament decided in passing the Further and Higher Education Act 1992 that universities should be autonomous and that Ministers should have no role in deciding how individual subjects and courses are funded. This independence is a great strength of our world class sector. But it also means that judgments have to be made by universities themselves in developing their own priorities and sense of mission.</p>

The Department communicates routinely with Ofsted and other inspectorates from across the Department.

	<p pid="b.1322W.2/2">A number of countries, including Sweden and Denmark, are using the conceptual framework which underpins the Integrated Children's System to develop their systems for assessing, planning, intervening and reviewing in respect of children who would be defined as children in need or looked after children. Each country has developed its own technology to enable social workers to record their work in electronic case records. Training courses for social workers in countries such as Denmark and Sweden have a strong pedagogic, child development and skills focus which enables them to make best use of the conceptual framework which is integral to the Integrated Children's System and its underpinning processes. In Sweden, an outcomes focus served to highlight the fact that even in a country with very high levels of universal services the health outcomes of looked after children were poorer than for those of other children.</p>
	<p pid="b.1322W.2/3">One of the benefits of the international collaboration on ICS has been the shared learning about implementation of such systems.</p>
	<p pid="b.1322W.2/4">In Australia, Barnardos have major projects involving the use of the Assessment Framework and Looking after Children Exemplars. They have designed and built their own IT systems for their practitioners to record their work with children and families. Their researchers and staff involved in implementing the projects have made positive comments about the use of the conceptual model that underpins ICS. In particular, that it helps staff focus on identifying the needs of individual children and on improving their outcomes.</p>
	<p pid="b.1322W.2/5">The following quote was made by one of the managers responsible for supporting the implementation of the Australian Barnardos project SCARF in a family support setting:</p>
	<p pid="b.1322W.2/6" class="indent">&quot;Firstly, workers became confident in using a common language, that is, they mean the same thing when they speak about such notions as strengthens, needs, risk of harm, or good enough parenting. Establishing a common language has had the effect of improving communication and reducing the chance of erroneous decisions in case management. Secondly workers using SCARF reported that they paid more attention to the effect their work had on the needs of the children rather than looking at its impact on the parent or carer.&quot;</p>

The PCeU will act as the central unit for the police on promotion of standards for training, procedure and response to e-crime. It will bring together forces, the National Police Improvement Agency and other groups to develop training and to coordinate activity to build up the skill levels within policing. Outside of this, the Serious Organised Crime Agency will continue its on-going work to tackle the international and serious organised crime groups operating on the internet, supporting the NFRC and PCeU where appropriate.</p>
