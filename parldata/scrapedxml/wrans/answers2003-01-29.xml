A risk assessment was included during the bid evaluation process for the first competition of the Wattisham air traffic contract, and that process identified areas of concern in all bids.

	<p pid=".858W.3/1">Under the Reserve Forces (Safeguard of Employment) Act 1985, an employer must take into his or her employment, under the same conditions of service as they were previously serving, those former employees who have been called-out as reservists who make a written application at the end of a period of called-out service. If this is not reasonable and practical, the reservist must be reinstated on the most favourable terms of service available.</p>
	<p pid=".858W.3/2">Under the Act, where an employer fails to reinstate a reservist, the reservist may apply to a reinstatement committee. These committees, appointed by the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, have the power to compel an employer to reinstate an employee and/or order the employer to pay appropriate compensation. Failure to comply with an order of a reinstatement committee is a criminal offence and an employer may be fined on conviction.</p>
	<p pid=".858W.3/3">The Act confers no powers on the Ministry of Defence to take measures against employers who fail to re-instate a reservist.</p>

	<p pid=".858W.6/2">Any decision to seek legal advice is a matter for the individual, and the Ministry of Defence is not in a position to offer legal advice in individual cases. However, The Forces Law Network, an association of solicitors with experience of the needs of service personnel, can provide independent legal advice. Advice on how to apply for reinstatement, and what to do if any employer fails to honour his/her legal obligations, is available to reservists at both unit and regional level. In addition, the SaBRE (Supporting Britain's Reservists and Employers) campaign can answer general queries about the provisions of the Act.</p>

	<p pid=".859W.8/1">Breathing Apparatus Rescue Teams (BARTs) and Rescue Equipment Support Teams (RESTs) have been assembled by withdrawing individuals from almost every unit of the Royal Navy and Royal Air Force. Recognising the important contribution the teams have played during the national firefighters dispute, every effort is made to preserve the capability of BARTs and RESTs. Recently, six RAF and 124 Royal Navy personnel have been withdrawn from Operation FRESCO as a direct consequence of deployments to the Gulf. During the course of the industrial action, the Ministry of Defence has maintained a programme of replacing personnel who needed to be withdrawn for various reasons, including the Gulf deployment, in order to ensure that the overall fire and rescue capability remains broadly constant. As this is a rolling programme, there is no direct correlation between those personnel stood down from Operation FRESCO due to their deployment to the Gulf and those personnel (or their parent units) from across the Royal Air Force and Royal Navy being trained as replacements.</p>

	<p pid=".860W.11/1">It is recognised that, increasingly, systems which include commercial off-the-shelf software will be offered to the Ministry of Defence by potential contractors for defence applications. This can be beneficial in reducing development times and costs, but can give concern as off-the-shelf software may be of uncertain origin and not stringently tested prior to release. Projects are therefore treated on a case by case basis. The security requirements of each system will be specified in the design documents. When a commercial off-the-shelf product (e.g. an operating system) is to be used with specified security features, it is required to undergo security evaluation.</p>

	<p pid=".864W.5/1">Railtrack have, at various stages, made 47 separate applications in regard to the Thameslink 2000 project, many of which replaced or varied earlier ones. They first applied in November 1997 for an Order under the Transport and Works Act (TWA) and for planning permission, together with applications for listed building consent (LBC) and conservation area consent (CAC). These proposals were modified by further applications in 1998 and 1999 for LBC and CAC and, in September 1999, for an amending TWA Order and related planning permission. In October 2000, while the public inquiry was underway, Railtrack submitted a further tranche of amending planning and LBC applications. The position concerning the applications is therefore a complex one which has involved many changes.</p>
	<p pid=".864W.5/2">The inspector who held the public inquiry provided a report in January 2002, followed by supplementary reports in May and June 2002. These were published in July 2002. In summary, he concluded that whilst the scheme would bring very substantial transportation, regeneration and economic benefits, there were three key deficiencies in the scheme&mdash;at London Bridge and Blackfriars stations and in the Borough High Street area&mdash;which required resolution before a decision could</p>
	<p pid=".864W.5/3">appropriately be made on the scheme as a whole. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister has since been giving careful consideration to the inspector's conclusions and to the many representations which have been received since the inquiry closed. These include a letter of <phrase class="date" code="2002-10-31">31 October 2002</phrase> from the Strategic Rail Authority who proposed that the scheme be split into two phases and asked for approval to be granted subject to conditions to deal with the outstanding issues identified by the inspector.</p>
	<p pid=".864W.5/4">We are today informing Railtrack that a decision on the scheme is to be deferred pending the submission and consideration of fresh applications aimed at addressing the deficiencies identified by the inspector, an amended Environmental Statement and a proper examination of the SRA's proposal to split the project into two phases. This will require a re-opening of the earlier inquiry.</p>

However, the report focused only on a small number of very early PFI pathfinder schools. Since those early days, as the report itself made clear, we have continuously refined and improved the schools PFI process in the light of experience. Over 500 schools are now covered by PFI deals, representing over &pound;1.3 billion of private sector investment. Another 400 PFI schools are in procurement or provisionally approved.

	<p pid=".865W.6/1">The Private Finance Initiative (PFI) has significant merits. For example, it allows for risk sharing with the private sector. The public sector does not pay anything until construction work on the school building is complete and the school is receiving the contracted service. New schools are generally completed on time and are then maintained to a high standard over the whole life of the contract. This prevents the deterioration of the schools estate which has been so common in the past. Also, teaching professionals can focus on teaching without the distractions of facilities management and poor accommodation.</p>
	<p pid=".865W.6/2">Using the PFI to fund the building of schools has so far meant that an extra &pound;1.3 billion has been invested to provide better conditions for pupils and teachers in over 500 schools. Transforming school accommodation is helping us to raise educational standards.</p>
	<p pid=".865W.6/3">As far as individual PFI projects are concerned, each one is assessed at the outset to ensure it will provide best value over the whole life of the contract. Further checks are made at various points during the procurement process to ensure that value for money for the public sector is delivered. Once the project is operational and transactions appear in the local authority's accounts, the authority's auditors will give an opinion on whether these have been compiled in accordance with the relevant accounting standards.</p>

	<p pid=".869W.0/1">A local authority, governing body or foundation body must obtain the Secretary of State's consent before disposing of any playing field that has been used for the purposes of a maintained school within the preceding 10 years. This applies to both continuing and closed schools.</p>
	<p pid=".869W.0/2">Applications to dispose of school playing fields are assessed against three main criteria. These are:</p>
	<p pid=".869W.0/3" class="indent">(i) schools' needs: that playing field provision and curriculum requirements at the school making the disposal, and at other schools in the local area, will be met;</p>
	<p pid=".869W.0/4" class="indent">(ii) community needs: that community use of school playing fields is taken into account, with alternative facilities made available if necessary; and</p>
	<p pid=".869W.0/5" class="indent">(iii) finance: that any sale proceeds are re-invested to provide new or improved sports facilities at schools, or are used otherwise to help raise standards by providing better educational facilities.</p>
	<p pid=".869W.0/6">The criteria are set out in the Department's Guidance 0580/2001: The Protection of School Playing Fields and Land for City Academies. The criteria enable the Secretary of State to take into account the team game playing field provision at other local schools. This is to ensure that where there are surplus fields at one school, other local schools are given the opportunity to use those surplus fields. The School Playing Fields Advisory Panel provides advice on the extent to which applications meet the published criteria. The Secretary of State has no influence over what happens to a school playing field once consent has been given to its disposal. Any future development is a matter for the local planning authorities.</p>

	<p pid=".871W.3/1">There is no routine year-on-year monitoring of birds on Countryside Stewardship special projects. However, there are some data available regarding those special projects that are specifically targeted at particular bird species. For example a report published by RSPB in 2001 showed cirl buntings had increased by 83 per cent. on land under Countryside Stewardship scheme agreements, compared with an increase of only 2 per cent. on non-agreement land.</p>
	<p pid=".871W.3/2">At present, only provisional results for regional bird data are available. Indicators have been developed based on on-going research by RSPB/BTO on behalf of DEFRA. These provisional estimates show that between 1970 and 1999 the Woodland species population index increased in the North East, North West, Yorkshire and the number, East Midlands and the West Midlands. The woodland species population index declined in the East, South East and South West regions. For the five regions where estimates are available, the Farmland species population indices decreased over the period.

	<p pid=".873W.0/1">There are no statutory standards for compost, although by virtue of Best Value Indicator BV82b, compost counts towards local authority statutory targets for recycling and composting. The Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP), in close co-operation with the Composting Association, has developed a BSI Publicly Available Specification (PAS) for compost. The delivery of this PAS for compost should help to create markets for organic waste derived products by creating confidence in the product. Achieving the PAS will depend on, for example, the suitability of the feedstock and the composting process used. We expect the EU Commission to issue a proposal for a Bio-waste Directive later this year; this should contain harmonized EU standards for composting.</p>

The Environment Agency has a general supervisory duty over all matters relating to flood defence and they are also responsible for flood forecasting and flood warning arrangements. In respect of Pitton, Salisbury district council and Wiltshire county council have responsibilities as flood defence and highways authorities respectively.</p>
	<p pid=".874W.2/2">I understand that flooding in Pitton is due to a combination of high groundwater and springflows. The Agency has exercised its supervisory power by producing reports into the flooding that occurred in 1995 and 2000. Following the 1995 report, Salisbury district council undertook some works with Defra grant aid. I understand that all the authorities have signed up to an action plan following the 2000 report.</p>

	<p pid=".879W.8/2">I have had frequent discussions with my EU counterparts and other Foreign Minister colleagues on Iraq in the run-up and in the margins of the General Affairs and External Relations Council on 27&ndash;<phrase class="date" code="2005-01-28">28 January</phrase>; I shall continue these contacts.</p>
	<p pid=".879W.8/3">EU Foreign Ministers were united on Iraq at the General Affairs and External Relations Council on <phrase class="date" code="2005-01-27">27 January</phrase>. We reaffirmed our view that UN Security Council resolution 1441 represents a final opportunity for Iraq to resolve the crisis peacefully. We urged Iraq to engage in full and active co-operation with the weapons inspectors and provide them, without delay, with all additional and complete information on questions raised by the international community. The question of an EU Common Position did not arise.</p>
	<p pid=".879W.8/4">The full conclusions of the Council on Iraq are as follows:</p>
	<p pid=".879W.8/5" class="indent">&quot;The Council, deeply concerned about the situation in Iraq, reaffirms that its goal remains the effective and complete disarmament of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction. The Council fully supports the efforts of the UN to ensure full and immediate compliance by Iraq with all relevant resolutions of the Security Council, in particular with UNSCR 1441 of <phrase class="date" code="2002-11-08">8 November 2002</phrase>. The resolution gives an unambiguous message that the Iraqi government has a final opportunity to resolve the crisis peacefully.</p>
	<p pid=".879W.8/6" class="indent">The Council therefore urges the Iraqi authorities to engage in full and active co-operation with UNMOVIC and IAEA. The Iraqi authorities must, as an imperative, provide the inspectors, without delay, with all additional and complete information on questions raised by the international community. The Council expresses its appreciation for the work accomplished by the inspectors so far and reiterates its confidence and full support for Dr. Blix and Dr. El Baradei to complete their mission in accordance with UNSCR 1441. It welcomes their intention to continue and intensify their operations.</p>
	<p pid=".879W.8/7" class="indent">The Council recalls that it stands ready to engage all necessary efforts to answer the needs of UNMOVIC and IAEA in personnel and practical means.</p>
	<p pid=".879W.8/8" class="indent">The Council underlines the fundamental importance of preventing the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction in accordance with the relevant international instruments. The Security Council has a key role to play in these endeavours.</p>
	<p pid=".879W.8/9" class="indent">The Council reaffirms the role of the UNSC in the implementation of UNSCR 1441. The responsibility of the UNSC in maintaining international peace and security must be respected.&quot;</p>

To this end all the 'blue light' emergency services have been provided with suitable personal protective equipment to protect them against the effects of contamination in the event of a bio-terrorism attack. Protocols for washing down and decontamination of emergency service and national service personnel, the public and premises have been developed with the fire service. The NHS already has in place sound working procedures to deal with biological agents, the spread of infectious diseases and to deal with contaminated equipment and premises. The advice of the Advisory Committee on Dangerous Pathogens will be sought on how to tackle any new risks from dangerous pathogens should they emerge.</p>

	<p pid=".886W.8/1">My right hon. Friend, the Secretary of State for Health represented the United Kingdom for the Health element of the first day of the Employment, Social Policy, Health and Consumer Affairs Council in Brussels on <phrase class="date" code="2002-12-02">2 December 2002</phrase>; the consumer affairs items were also taken on that day.</p>
	<p pid=".886W.8/2">The main health business of this Council related to tobacco. The Council reached qualified majority on a First Reading Deal on the Tobacco Advertising Directive. He emphasised that the UK supports European Union legislation on tobacco advertising, having strong domestic legislation in place. He made clear the Government's determination to ensure the legal victories secured by the tobacco companies over previous European legislation would not be repeated with this Directive. He therefore voted against the Directive because he did not think that the drafting of some provisions was good enough or that it went as far as it could in some areas (for example by not covering cigarette papers).</p>
	<p pid=".886W.8/3">A Council Recommendation on the prevention of smoking and on initiatives to improve tobacco control was adopted by a qualified majority, with support from the UK. The Commission also gave an update on the World Health Organisation Framework Convention on Tobacco Control.</p>
	<p pid=".886W.8/4">Member States set out their positions on the pharmaceuticals reviews with a discussion on three key outstanding issues in the European Medicines Evaluation Agency (EMEA) Regulation. There was no vote on this item. On scope, the UK was amongst several Member States who spoke out against extension of the centralised procedure for human medicines, and in favour of a choice for companies. Others supported the Commission. Most felt that Member States should appoint at least one member to the management board. Many were willing to consider also accepting representatives of patient groups or the European Parliament. A majority of Member States and the Commission were able to accept the Presidency compromise of a single renewal of an authorisation after five years.</p>
	<p pid=".886W.8/5">Council adopted a Recommendation on the prevention and reduction of risks associated with drug dependence. Council Conclusions on action against obesity were adopted unanimously. The UK voted in favour of both of these items.</p>
	<p pid=".886W.8/6">The Presidency presented a progress report on negotiations on a Directive setting standards of quality and safety for the donation, procurement, testing, processing, storage and distribution of human cells and tissues. The Commission said that they would look carefully at the changes in scope the Council was proposing in relation to the medicinal products and medical devices Directives.</p>
	<p pid=".886W.8/7">The Commission updated the Council on the high level process of reflection on patient mobility and health care development, and on the programme of co-operation on bioterrorism and health security. The Commission will be tabling a proposal to set up a network centre for disease control in May 2003, to be set up in 2005. The aim is to enhance the EU capacity to prevent the spread of communicable diseases, working closely with Member States' own institutions.</p>
	<p pid=".886W.8/8">The Commission reported that it had established a working group, to consider the quality of information on internet sites in the health sector. The group, consisting of representatives from government, Non-Government Organisations and industry, has reported and agreed actions including measures on transparency, privacy and accountability. The Commission will monitor work through the E-Europe 2005 ActionPlan.</p>
	<p pid=".886W.8/9">Items under any other business included an information paper from Ireland on post-polio syndrome. There was also a brief discussion on the follow-up to the G10 initiative on the pharmaceutical industry. A Commission communication, was under preparation, and should issue in May 2003. Italy announced they would have an Informal Ministerial meeting on this during their Presidency. Finally, there was a presentation from Belgium on their candidate for the Director-Generalship of the WHO, Peter Piot.</p>
	<p pid=".886W.8/10">The consumer part of the Council met with minimal discussion over a short agenda.</p>
	<p pid=".886W.8/11">The Council adopted a Resolution on Community consumer policy strategy 2002&ndash;06 without debate, endorsing the aims and objectives of the Commission's strategy as published in May 2002, namely a high common level of consumer protection, effective enforcement and the involvement of consumer organisations. The UK voted in favour, as did all other Member States.</p>
	<p pid=".886W.8/12">The Council and the Commission endorsed the Presidency's conclusions on a joint Commission-UK seminar held in November on using consumer statistics to inform and prioritise consumer policy. In accordance with the conclusions, the Commission will take forward technical work on definitions and the comparability of consumer statistics.</p>
	<p pid=".886W.8/13">As an information point only, the Council took note of a Commission presentation on the preliminary results of the European Extra-Judicial Network (EEJ-Net), the EU network of clearing houses designed to facilitate and resolve cross-border, out-of-court consumer disputes.</p>
	<p pid=".886W.8/14">Finally, Greece informed the Council that it wanted to contribute to the consumer agenda during its forthcoming Presidency by strengthening its involvement in the internal market. It highlighted in particular a seminar on the Commission's Green Paper of 2003, and a Ministerial conference on unfair trading to be held on <phrase class="date" code="2003-05-07">7 May 2003</phrase>.</p>

	<p pid=".892W.0/1">I am placing in the Library of the House copies of the following documents: the Medicines Control Agency's letters to interest groups about kava-kava; a summary of the responses received in response to the Agency's public consultation (ML&quot; 286); copies of responses to the consultation received where permission has been received from the author; papers considered by the Committee on Safety of Medicines (CSM) and by the Medicines Commission; minutes of the meetings of the CSM held on <phrase class="date" code="2001-12-12">12 December 2001</phrase>, <phrase class="date" code="2002-07-10">10 July 2002</phrase> and <phrase class="date" code="2002-10-16">16 October 2002</phrase>; minutes of the meeting of the CSM's working group held on <phrase class="date" code="2002-03-12">12 March 2002</phrase>; the final regulatory impact assessment (RIA).</p>
	<p pid=".892W.0/2">Some of the papers considered by the advisory committees have been anonymised under the Code of Practice on Access to Government Information, as have parts of the minutes of meetings, under exemptions 10, 13, 14 and 15 of the code.</p>

	<p pid=".892W.0/4">We will review all other documents sent and received by the MCA relating to kava-kava to assess what, if any information is subject to non disclosure under the code and seek permission for disclosure from external parties where necessary. The main categories into which these additional documents fall include: factual advice sought from and given by the MCA following inquiries from a wide range of external parties, including members of the public, about the regulatory position of kava-kava and the progress of consideration of safety issues; legal advice sought by and given to the MCA; factual information exchanged between the MCA and the Food Standards Agency, other Government Departments, regulatory authorities elsewhere in the European Union, papers reflecting policy advice to and discussion with Ministers. Some of these categories of information will be exempt from disclosure under the code.</p>
	<p pid=".892W.0/5">In relation to kava-kava medicines with a marketing authorisation, exemptions 10, 13 and 15 of the code apply. This information remains confidential and publication would be premature while the issues are still under consideration; however, the advice will be published (some papers may be anonymised) once a regulatory decision has been made.</p>

	<p pid=".893W.2/1">Single rubella vaccine and single measles and mumps vaccines are licensed in the United Kingdom. However, the pharmaceutical companies that hold the UK marketing authorisations for single measles and mumps vaccines do not manufacture the products for, or market them in, this country and the vaccines being prescribed and administered are imported unlicensed medicines. Licensed single rubella vaccine is currently available in the UK. However, unlicensed rubella vaccine may also be imported on occasions when the licensed vaccine is unavailable.</p>
	<p pid=".893W.2/2">An unlicensed medicine, such as a single vaccine, may only be imported in accordance with The Medicines (Standard Provisions for Licences and Certificates) Amendment Regulations 1999 No. 4. An importer must hold the appropriate Wholesale Dealer's or Wholesale Dealer's Import Licence issued by the Medicines Control Agency (MCA), and is required to notify the MCA on each occasion that they intend to import such a product. Importation may proceed unless the importer has been informed by the MCA that it objects to importation. The MCA may object and prevent importation if it has concerns about the safety or quality of the product, or if there is an equivalent licensed medicine available. The maximum quantity that may be imported per notification is defined in the regulations.</p>

	<p pid=".895W.3/1">Midwives provide the majority of care for pregnant mothers as well as advice and support on healthy lifestyles including alcohol and substance misuse. Specialist staff may also be attached to antenatal clinics.</p>
	<p pid=".895W.3/2">The Department produces health promotion resources which are targeted at pregnant women to reduce drinking and increase awareness of risk to the unborn child, e.g., Drinking for two. A recent survey indicated that 30 per cent. of women gave up drinking during pregnancy and around 70 per cent. of those who did drink, drank less than one unit per week on average.</p>
	<p pid=".895W.3/3">Specialist alcohol treatment services provide support and treatment for people with more serious alcohol problems, including pregnant women. There are around 475 specialist alcohol treatment services in England, providing treatment worth approximately &pound;95 million per year.</p>
	<p pid=".895W.3/4">Obstetric and substance misuse services exist throughout the country. The Department of Health's Drug Misuse and Dependence&mdash;Guidelines on Clinical Management (Clinical Guidelines) recommends different approaches to deliver care to pregnant drug misusers, such as specialist midwives, or drug dependence staff attached to the antenatal clinic. The type of service in each area will depend on local circumstances, the number of pregnant drug misusers presenting for care, expertise of the obstetric and primary care services, and availability of specialist or shared-care support.

	<p pid=".897W.5/1">There are no plans to vaccinate the whole population as a contingency measure against the threat of a bio-terrorist incident involving smallpox. Mass vaccination of the population could be justifiable if there was a smallpox attack or outbreak but it would not be acceptable to expose people to the risk of vaccination in the absence of any possible exposure to the smallpox virus. This is consistent with the approach recommended by the World Health Organisation.</p>
	<p pid=".897W.5/2">Smallpox vaccine has a much higher rate of serious complications than vaccines that are in regular use today. Certain groups are at even higher risk, such as those with weak immune systems or with severe eczema.</p>
	<p pid=".897W.5/3">We have already announced that a small number of key frontline national health service staff and a small number of military personnel who would provide the first response in the event of a confirmed, suspected or threatened release of smallpox will be vaccinated shortly. We are discussing with other Government Departments how to identify key workers in the emergency services and agreeing circumstances and timing under which they might be vaccinated.</p>
	<p pid=".897W.5/4">Our contingency plans for dealing with smallpox are detailed in the draft guidelines on smallpox available on <a href="http://www.doh.gov.uk/epcu/cbr/biol/smallpoxplan.htm">http://www.doh.gov.uk/epcu/cbr/biol/smallpoxplan.htm</a>.</p>

	<p pid=".899W.3/3" class="indent">There were no anticipated additional allocations from the Department of Health during the financial year. However, there was an assumption made of slippage in-year of &pound;2.5 million, i.e., allocations received in 2002&ndash;03 but against which expenditure would not be incurred recurrently until future years. This forecast slippage was at the same level as previous years.</p>
	<p pid=".899W.3/4" class="indent">The uplift for primary care prescribing costs assumed by Worcestershire health authority was 11 per cent. on the 2001&ndash;02 forecast outturn of these costs. This was in line with national guidance. The HA also proposed making efficiency savings of 3.6 per cent., giving a net increase of 7.4 per cent. As required by national guidance, where prescribing costs efficiency savings were planned, this was supported by an action plan prepared by the HA.</p>
	<p pid=".899W.3/5">The chief executive designate for the new strategic health authority (StHA) played an active part in the local discussions and agreements with primary care groups and national health service trusts, and agreement of service and financial frameworks (SaFFs) was an important element of the franchise plan for the chief executive of the StHA.</p>
	<p pid=".899W.3/6">In addition the Department of Health, both at regional office and national levels, had an overseeing role for the whole SaFF process in particular and to ensure that all key targets were planned to be met.</p>

	<p pid=".900W.2/2">The Department has not collected figures on a trust-by-trust basis, as work force planning of this kind is the responsibility of local trusts. However, the Department's guidance makes clear that compliance with the EWTD will be achieved only by trusts employing a wide range of solutions and maximising the skills and experience of their whole workforce. This is part of the bigger challenge of modernising the NHS and the guidance will help contribute to finding solutions that work in different specialties, in different hospitals.</p>
	<p pid=".900W.2/3">The guidance also makes clear that changes to the working practices of both medical and non-medical staff, and building on the increases in consultant and specialist registrars, will allow trusts to meet their objectives under the Directive.</p>

	<p pid=".908W.5/1">Original research into the likely level of demand for Criminal Records Bureau (CRB) checks was undertaken by the Home Office and CRB. Two comprehensive market research studies were carried out by Coopers Lybrand (1996) and Accent Market Research (March 2000) to determine who would use the service and what likely levels of take up were anticipated. These studies were validated by the Labour Force Survey carried out between September and November 1999. A telephone survey with existing checkers was carried out to validate the baseline information created from the above research. In December 2001, Capita Account Managers conducted their own research to determine which Registered Bodies were likely to be major users of the service and there is ongoing joint Capita and CRB forecasting work based on latest actual demand and outputs from a forecasting model.</p>
	<p pid=".908W.5/2">An analysis of legislation and its likely impact on CRB demand was also undertaken. The analysis looked at whether or not legislation would increase the number of sectors eligible for CRB checks or whether or not the impact would be neutral. It was determined that the outcome was likely to be neutral.</p>
	<p pid=".908W.5/3">The original concept for the CRB was based on a call-centre, telephone-based and online application route, with capacity to deal with individual paper applications. That arrangement was expected to be convenient for applicants and would reduce errors. It was also in line with the Government's e-government objectives. Market research was undertaken by Rosslyn Research in 2000 to establish employer's requirements in terms of service standards.</p>
	<p pid=".908W.5/4">However, during extensive consultation with registered bodies and employers from January to June 2001, there was strong pressure from them to introduce a full-scale paper-based application. Consequently, in May 2001, the CRB agreed to introduce more extensive capacity to deal with paper-based applications.</p>

This research corroborates a number of other independent studies which have looked at the scale of migration flows after enlargement. These have been summarised in reports by the European Commission in 2000 and the former Department for Education and Employment in 1999. None of this research has been able to predict exact numbers expected from specific countries or ethnic groups to the UK.</p>

	<p pid=".913W.10/1">The Children Act 1989 requires that the court's paramount consideration must be the welfare of the child. Judges are guided by a list of factors set out in section 1(3) of the Act, known as the 'welfare checklist'. The court has the discretion to take into consideration all the facts and circumstances of the individual case when deciding any question concerning the child, including issues of contact and residence.</p>
	<p pid=".913W.10/2">Any person (including grandparents) may, provided that the permission of the court is obtained, apply to the court for an order for residence or contact with a child. This requirement is designed as an early filter for those applications the court feels would not to be in the best interests of the child. Experience suggests that grandparents (or other interested relatives) do not usually experience difficulty in obtaining permission where their application is motivated by a genuine concern for the child.</p>

Experience has shown that grandparents, or wider family members, do not usually experience difficulty in obtaining leave when the application is motivated by genuine concern for the child.

	<p pid=".925W.6/2">The Government recognise that trade reform can have significant adverse effects on particular sectors and groups, especially in the short-term. This is why it is important that trade reform is accompanied by complementary policies to manage the process of change and integration into the world trading system. This may include some measures to promote indigenous industrial development. But the evidence of the benefits of specific tariff protection is mixed so the Government do not see it as a particularly useful tool to foster economic growth and therefore poverty reduction. Greater protectionism by developing countries limits the opportunities for poor countries to trade both with each other and with developed countries, excluding them further from the benefits of international trade.</p>
	<p pid=".925W.6/3">The Government also believe that existing WTO agreements should take better account of countries' specific development needs. Therefore, within the current Doha Development Agenda negotiations we support the further development of Special and Differential Treatment provisions to assist developing countries to integrate into the world trading system.</p>

	<p pid=".926W.5/1">The objectives set out in the United Kingdom Space Strategy 1999 to 2002, 'New Frontiers', were: to help industry maximise profitable business opportunities in the development and exploitation of space systems which improve the quality of life and enhance choice for consumers; to pursue the highest quality astronomy and space science; to improve our understanding of the Earth's environment and natural resources; to foster the development of innovative technology, its commercial exploitation and its application to research; and to communicate the results and their significance to a broad audience.</p>
	<p pid=".926W.5/2">I am satisfied that we have made good progress towards each of these objectives. The Strategy included a large number of key actions to monitor the implementation of the Strategy. Details of the actions and progress made have been made publicly available on the BNSC website: <a href="http://www.bnsc.gov.uk">www.bnsc.gov.uk</a></p>
	<p pid=".926W.5/3">These long-term objectives have been further refined. I published a new draft Strategy for public consideration on <phrase class="date" code="2003-01-22">22 January 2003</phrase>, <phrase class="offrep" id="wms/2003-01-22.13WS"><i>Official Report</i>, column 13WS</phrase>. This further focuses on the use of space systems throughout the economy. Copies of the draft Strategy have been placed in the Libraries of both Houses and the text is available on the BNSC website. We aim to publish the final Strategy later this year.</p>

	<p pid=".928W.8/4" class="indent">Since the M60 opened m October 2000, there have been no recorded occurrences of flooding caused by either failures of the motorway drainage system or overflow from external water courses. What has happened is that during periods of intense rainfall, excess water can collect on the surface of the carriageway. Whilst we are not aware of any accidents that have occurred as a result, there are anecdotal reports from drivers that this is a matter of concern.</p>
	<p pid=".928W.8/5" class="indent">The section of motorway between Denton and Medlock was designed on behalf of the Highways Agency by Mouchel Consulting Ltd. The remaining length to Hollinwood was the subject of a Design and Build contract undertaken by Balfour Beatty who used Gifford and Partners to advise on the design.</p>
	<p pid=".928W.8/6" class="indent">At present, we are not aware of any design faults to which the excess water could be attributed. However, mindful of our duty of care towards motorway users, suitable warning signs were erected in Autumn last year. Additionally, and working with Greater Manchester Police, we have made use of variable message signing which is currently being used to good effect by encouraging drivers to slow down and take extra care in wet conditions.</p>

	<p pid=".930W.8/3" class="indent">I have been asked by the Transport Minister, David Jamieson, 10 reply to your recent Parliamentary Question asking for a list of road quietening schemes that are being examined by his Department in Hull and the East Riding.</p>
	<p pid=".930W.8/4" class="indent">The Highways Agency is working to achieve the Government's commitment to deliver the target of resurfacing 60% of the trunk road and motorway network with low noise surfacing by 2011. This includes resurfacing all concrete roads. Within Hull and the East Riding there are two sections of concrete roads, both on the M62 Motorway, between Gilberdyke and Newport, and Balkholme and Gilberdyke. Some preliminary design work has been undertaken on schemes for these sections of road. There is also a section of concrete carriageway on the Ml8 Motorway between Junctions 6 and 7, which falls partly within the East Riding. The timing of resurfacing work will depend on when road maintenance is required.</p>
	<p pid=".930W.8/5" class="indent">In addition, the Agency regularly reviews the trunk road and motorway network to identify the need for maintenance. At present, we envisage undertaking the following maintenance schemes within the next four years and will be considering the use of quieter surfaces:</p>
	<p pid=".930W.8/6" class="indent">M62</p>
	<p pid=".930W.8/7" class="indent">Junction 35 to Langham</p>
	<p pid=".930W.8/8" class="indent">A63</p>
	<p pid=".930W.8/9" class="indent">M62 to South Cave</p>
	<p pid=".930W.8/10" class="indent">South Cave to Welton</p>
	<p pid=".930W.8/11" class="indent">Western Interchange to Brighton Street</p>
	<p pid=".930W.8/12" class="indent">I hope this is helpful. If you would like any further information you may wish to contact the Agency's Area Manager for Hull and the East Riding, Mick Spink, on 0113 283 5397, or you can email him at mick.spink@highwavs.gsi.gov.uk</p>

	<p pid=".932W.9/1">The level of resource consumption estimated for 2001 -02 for the Office of Government Commerce (OGC) in the latest H.M. Treasury Departmental Report (Cm5425) was &pound;88 million, reducing to a planned -&pound;5million in 2002&ndash;03. The actual level of resource consumption in 2001&ndash;02 was &pound;6million. The change between the estimated and actual outturns for 2001&ndash;02 is largely accounted for by a revaluation to and change in timing of the run down of some of the provisions the OGC holds in respect of its obligation to dispose of the Government's remaining surplus Residual Civil Estate. The change in the timing will also affect the outturn for 2002&ndash;03 where it is now anticipated that the likely outturn will be some &pound;50 million. Such fluctuations in the valuations of and timing for the sale of the remaining surplus Estate, which reflect market conditions and opportunities, can be expected to continue in the future, although on a smaller scale as the size of the remaining Residual Estate continues to reduce. The actual change in resource consumption between years also reflects a reduction in the level of income the OGC generates .</p>

	<p pid=".938W.5/2">The objective of our policies is to help jobless people, particularly the most disadvantaged, move into and remain in employment. Initiatives such as the New Deals and Work Based Learning for Adults are helping to achieve this. Some of those helped into work by government programmes may change their jobs or occupations at a later date. However, the skills and confidence they have gained through participation in our programmes will stand them in good stead in the current dynamic labour market. Success, therefore, should be measured by the improvement in the level of employment. This has increased by 1.3 million since 1997 and now stands at 27.8 million.</p>
	<p pid=".938W.5/3">There has been no specific research into the length of time individuals stay in a particular occupation after receiving Government subsidised training. However, we have commissioned a study into Work Based Learning for Adults that will examine the impact of a subsidised training programme on client outcomes.</p>

The accepted means for determining competence is for operatives to be assessed against recognised national standards on a five-yearly cycle. Standards were originally set under a Health and Safety Commission Approved Code of Practice (ACOP). All Transco engineers engaged in safety work in domestic premises hold valid certificates of competence under one or other of these schemes, and accordingly, meet the registration conditions laid down by the Council for Registered Gas Installers (CORGI).</p>
