	<p pid=".379W.3/1">Social statistics available for Iraq are currently limited and unreliable. DFID is considering ways in which to assist building statistical capacity in Iraq and has made available &pound;30 million to the UN, including for statistical support, through the International Reconstruction Fund Facility For Iraq.</p>
	<p pid=".379W.3/2">The UN is working with the Iraqi Central Statistics Organisation and Ministries to develop up to date statistics. A United Nations Development Plan (UNDP) survey of Living Conditions of Iraqi Households is due to be completed in November this year and will include economic indicators such as income, day to day expenditures, availability of health and education facilities and access to public services. A World Food Programme Baseline Food Security Assessment, due next month, is likely to produce estimates of the amount of poverty in Iraq.</p>
	<p pid=".379W.3/3">In early July, peak production was averaging around 4,500 MW, just above pre war production levels. Progress has not been as rapid as planned, primarily as a result of sabotage and security constraints. High summer demand due to increased temperatures has resulted in reduced hours of electricity supply to most areas of Iraq. Significant programmes of long-term rehabilitation of electrical infrastructure continue.</p>
	<p pid=".379W.3/4">Estimates suggest that immediately after the conflict, 60 per cent. of urban and 30 per cent. of rural populations had access to safe water. Considerable work has taken place since the end of the conflict to improve the quantity, quality and reliability of water supplies. There are no reliable statistics of current coverage, but informal estimates by the former Coalition Provisional Authority (South) indicate that, in the south, coverage has increased by 10&ndash;15 per cent. since May 2003. Water quality and volume in Basra is expected to exceed pre-conflict levels during the summer of 2004.</p>
	<p pid=".379W.3/5">The joint UN and World Bank Needs Assessments of last year estimated that of the 70 per cent. of the Iraqi population that live in urban areas, 30 per cent. live near the poverty line. Approximately 60 per cent. of the population is dependent on free food rations under the Public Distribution System (PDS). Poverty in southern Iraq is particularly serious. A 2003 World Food Programme study on chronic poverty calculated that approximately 21 per cent. of Iraq's centre/south population were chronically poor or unable to meet their basic needs over long periods of time, even after assistance provided through PDS.</p>

	<p pid=".380W.5/1">The Department for International Development (DFID) is supporting a number of initiatives on developing trade and regional integration between African countries. As part of the G8 Africa Action plan DFID has committed to support African efforts to advance regional economic integration and intra-African trade, including the development of regional institutions. This includes support for the work of the Trade and Regional Integration Department at the UN Economic Commission for Africa, and the Africa Union's Trade, Customs and Immigration Ministerial Committee.</p>
	<p pid=".380W.5/2">DFID is also supporting the regional economic communities in Africa to implement free trade areas and customs unions. One example is the &pound;12 million regional trade facilitation programme to help expand trade in Southern Africa, and improve the incomes of poor people by increasing economic opportunities in the region. The programme will cover the Southern Africa Development Community (SADC) and Common Market for Eastern and Southern African (COMESA) secretariats and member states.</p>
	<p pid=".380W.5/3">The Economic Partnership Agreements (EPAs) which are currently being negotiated between the EU and the African Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries also offer an opportunity to promote regional integration in Africa. One of the key objectives in the Cotonou agreement for EPAs is the development of trade between neighbouring countries. The UK is pressing the European Commission to ensure EPAs progress towards this objective as well as supporting capacity building in African countries to purse this in the negotiations.</p>

	<p pid=".384W.2/1">Every day, about 1,700 children become infected with HIV. There are an estimated 2.1 million children under age 15 living with HIV in the world today. The vast majority of these are in developing countries.</p>
	<p pid=".384W.2/2">Including children with HIV in treatment and care programmes is critical. Brazil has successfully implemented antiretroviral (ARV) treatment for children and adolescents as part of its national treatment policy. A number of other countries, including Uganda, Zambia, and South Africa, are beginning to enrol large numbers of children with HIV in their programmes.</p>
	<p pid=".384W.2/3">However, the absence of specially designed drugs for children causes problems. Many ARVs are not available in paediatric formulations that can be given to small children as a liquid, and tablets are often not manufactured in small enough doses for a child's body weight, requiring pharmacists and doctors to guess how to break up tablets or dose according to weight.</p>
	<p pid=".384W.2/4">The UK, through its recently published strategy on HIV and AIDS and DFID's new policy on HIV and AIDS treatment and care, has committed to support research into paediatric treatments including paediatric ARVs, and future treatment options. Indeed, the new HIV and AIDS Strategy prioritises the needs of children alongside those of women and vulnerable and marginalised groups. The UK has committed &pound;150 million over the next three years on work to respond to the needs of orphans and other children made vulnerable by HIV and AIDS. DFID has also endorsed UNICEF's Strategic Framework on Orphans and Vulnerable Children. We will work to ensure children have access to treatment and care.</p>

	<p pid=".393W.2/2">All DFID's development initiatives with a spend of more than &pound;1 million are subject to environmental screening, which is also advised for projects of less than &pound;1 million where there is a likelihood of significant environmental impacts. Where appropriate, screening will initiate a more comprehensive appraisal and assessment for policies, plans and programmes. The procedures, and guidance on the screening process, are detailed in DFID's Environment Guide (2003), which is available on the Department's public website <a href="http://www.dfid.gov.uk">www.dfid.gov.uk</a>.</p>
	<p pid=".393W.2/3">In the last year, the rate of application of environmental screening to projects has almost doubled (from 34 per cent. in 2002&ndash;03 to 62 per cent. in 2003&ndash;04), following a review and strengthening of the procedures. A new team has been established within DFID to monitor and strengthen these procedures.</p>

During 2003 and 2004, the Commission secured agreement on the scope of the review, established a scientific expert group to agree its terms of reference and established scientific expert sub-groups to conduct reviews and draft reports for evaluation of each access rule.

	<p pid=".400W.2/1">The value of beef exports from the UK to France in 1995 was &pound;250 million. However a large proportion of this was in the form of carcase beef from Over Thirty Month cattle. Exports of such beef are not permitted under the EU rules of the Date-based Export Scheme (DBES). Trade would also have been affected by factors such as the exchange rate, consumer confidence in France and the need for any UK slaughterhouses wishing to export to be approved under the stringent requirements of the DBES.</p>
	<p pid=".400W.2/2">Compensation for losses resulting from the ban must be sought by those directly affected. It is not for the Government to seek compensation for damages to UK interests because it is not directly involved from a legal point of view. We would provide full support in terms of information and practical assistance to those who wish to seek compensation (although, as a matter of policy, we will not provide funding or detailed legal advice).</p>

	<p pid=".401W.0/1">As I explained in the written statement that I made earlier today on this subject, I have concluded, in the light of results from this season's monitoring of the UK element of the offshore bass fishery, that current levels of bycatch in the fishery as a whole may constitute a threat to the common dolphin population. In the course of this research conducted by the Sea Mammal Research Unit on our behalf, 169 dolphin casualties were observed. It has also become clear from our research that exclusion devices which previously showed some potential in reducing bycatch are not currently sufficiently developed to reduce bycatch to more acceptable levels in the immediate future.</p>
	<p pid=".401W.0/2">Community action to address this problem is needed. We will therefore be requesting that the European Commission introduce emergency measures to close the fishery while more permanent measures are developed. If the case for emergency action is not accepted then I will consider other options, including restricting the number of vessels allowed into the fishery and seeking a ban on pair trawling within 12 miles of the UK.</p>

	<p pid=".403W.8/1">The Government accepted 101 of the 105 recommendations in the report of the Policy Commission on the Future of Farming and Food. These are being taken forward through the Strategy for Sustainable Farming and Food. However, the onus is not on Government alone to deliver these changes: many of the Commission's recommendations were targeted wholly or partly at industry, which has a pivotal part to play in this process.</p>
	<p pid=".403W.8/2">We are making good progress towards delivering the Strategy's objectives, most significantly through implementation of the Common Agricultural Policy reform agreement in June 2003. The deal will provide a more sustainable basis for European agriculture and reflect the wider environmental and rural development objectives which society seeks to achieve. The decoupling of payments will break the link between subsidy and production, so the farming industry will be free to react directly to market signals, not encouraged to follow the unsustainable production patterns of the past. CAP reform is expected to deliver significant economic benefits for the UK. These are estimated at between &pound;400 million to &pound;550 million a year at present exchange rates. The introduction of the Single Payment means that farmers will be freed from many of the bureaucratic rules associated with production linked subsidies and will have greater opportunity to restructure their businesses to best meet the needs of the market. We estimate that overall there will be an increase in farm incomes up to &pound;150 million which represents around 5 per cent. of UK Total Income From Farming in 2003.</p>
	<p pid=".403W.8/3">Enhancing our environment is central to the vision set out in the Strategy. A new agri-environment scheme, Environmental Stewardship, is being introduced in England in 2005 and this includes the new Entry Level Stewardship (ELS). The ELS will be at the heart of improving farming's environmental performance. It will be open to applications from all farmers, enabling them to deliver what society wants: the sustainable management of our countryside as a whole.</p>
	<p pid=".403W.8/4">A series of initiatives in the food chain is designed to achieve a more efficient and competitive supply chain. These include the Food Chain Centre and English Farming and Food Partnerships, two industry bodies set up with Government support to increase competitiveness and encourage co-operation.</p>
	<p pid=".403W.8/5">The Government recognise the need for smarter regulation of agriculture, focusing on outcomes rather than processes in order to minimise burdens on the industry. We are working to join up regulatory requirements into a whole farm approach which will reduce bureaucracy. The Whole Farm Appraisal is one of the key initiatives being developed to assist the farming industry in streamlining regulation; this has been successfully piloted and will be launched in autumn 2005.</p>
	<p pid=".403W.8/6">Other initiatives being taken forward to deliver the Strategy include the establishment of a Non-Food Crops Centre to provide information and advice on non-food crop production; work on animal health and welfare, including the recent launch of the Animal Health and Welfare Strategy; consultation on the goals and priorities for the Food and Health Action Plan under the &quot;Choosing Diet&quot; strand of the Department of Health's &quot;Choosing Health?&quot; consultation and delivery of a Learning Skills and Knowledge programme.</p>
	<p pid=".403W.8/7">The Government announced a sum of &pound;500 million to implement the Strategy as part of the 2002 Spending Review, in addition to existing spending by Defra and other Government Departments which is already being used to deliver aspects of the Strategy. This sum covers a number of major aspects of the Strategy. These include the new Environmental Stewardship Scheme and the IT system to underpin all the England Rural Development Programme schemes; improvements in livestock traceability and other major animal health and welfare measures, and the new food chain initiatives.</p>

	<p pid=".404W.2/1">The latest available data on farm incomes is for the 2002&ndash;3 farm accounting year from the Farm Business Survey. This survey covers around 2200 full time farm businesses in England, of which around a fifth are classified as dairy farms. Based on this survey data, the average net farm income of dairy farms in 2002&ndash;3 was &pound;18,300 and 80 per cent. of dairy farm businesses showed a positive net farm income. Net farm income is defined as the return to the farmer and spouse for their manual and managerial labour and on the tenant type capital of the business. It does not include the cost of farmer and spouse labour.</p>
	<p pid=".404W.2/2">Dairy farm incomes are forecast to rise slightly in 2003&ndash;4, principally due to an increase in milk prices although higher feed prices during the latter part of the year offsets some of this increase.</p>

	<p pid=".407W.2/1">The Department has undertaken a number of estimates of the national costs associated with flooding. The impact of flooding will vary from case to case. However, the national level estimates have shown that in most cases flood damage estimates are dominated by damage to residential, commercial and industrial property and its associated contents. Work to evaluate other impacts includes:</p>
	<p pid=".407W.2/2" class="indent">recent research by the Flood Hazard Research Centre (FHRC) at Middlesex University which suggested that emergency response costs are probably some 11 per cent. of physical damage costs;</p>
	<p pid=".407W.2/3" class="indent">the FHRC also provides guidance on assessing the benefits to recreation of flood defence and coast protection works;</p>
	<p pid=".407W.2/4" class="indent">research lead by Risk and Policy Analysts Ltd. has identified the average value of health and stress due to flooding at &pound;200 per household per year for those in high risk areas.</p>
	<p pid=".407W.2/5">There have been many studies of the value of other environmental impacts, including a current study by the University of East Anglia that will report in 2005 on the functional value of wetlands. Current Defra guidance suggests that appropriate water level management for wetlands can have a benefit of between &pound;175 and &pound;300 per hectare per year. In the latest national assessments these figures were used to quantify environmental benefits from increased flooding of some lower grade agricultural land.</p>

These figures include funding for projects to protect against coastal erosion but many of these also provide significant benefits in terms of reducing risk of flooding from the sea.</p>
	<p pid=".408W.5/3">Further Government support was provided by the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister's local government funding system. This supported, among other things, levies paid by local authorities to the EA which funded the balance of the cost of EA improvement projects after Defra grant.</p>

	<p pid=".413W.5/1">All milk imported into the UK from other EU member states must have been produced in accordance with the Community rules laid down in Council Directive 92/46/EEC. All milk and milk products placed on the market in the EU must conform to the requirements of that Directive irrespective of whether they originate from new or existing member states. Community rules permit random spot checks at destination on milk imported into the UK from other EU member states. Plants in the new member states which could not meet the requirements of Directive 92/46/EEC on accession were granted transitional status and allowed to place products on their domestic market for a limited period as long as they bore a special health mark which identified them as being only for the domestic market.</p>

	<p pid=".413W.5/3">Ensuring that all member states comply with their Community obligations in properly implementing and applying the Directive is the responsibility of the European Commission, whose Food and Veterinary Office carries out regular programmes of inspection visits to all member states. All milk imported into the UK from third countries must come from EU approved establishments in approved countries and must be accompanied by appropriate animal and public health certification signed by a veterinarian of the competent authority. The milk must enter via an approved Border Inspection Post (BIP) where it is subject to veterinary inspection to ensure that conditions of import have been complied with and to ensure that it has remained in a satisfactory condition during transport. The checks ensure that all the required documentation is correct and applies to the consignment in question. 50 per cent. of consignments of milk imported for human consumption are also given a physical check which can include taking samples for laboratory analysis.</p>

	<p pid=".415W.5/1">All Defra's new policy proposals or changes in policy which were likely to have a direct or indirect impact (whether benefits or cost) on business, charities and the voluntary sector were the subject of Regulatory Impact Assessments (RIAs). In accordance with Cabinet Office guidelines, these were required to include the full range of potential impacts on all stakeholders, including environmental impacts where relevant. Separate environmental appraisals were not required. All completed RIAs were published on Defra's website at <a href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/corporate/ria/default.htm">http://www.defra.gov.uk/corporate/ria/default.htm</a>.</p>
	<p pid=".415W.5/2">In 2002&ndash;03, 26 RIAs were published on Defra's website. Of these nine included consideration of environmental impacts. However in the other 17 the policy assessed was considered not to have significant environmental impacts, indicating that environmental appraisal would not have been necessary. This is in accordance with departmental guidance. In 2003&ndash;04 <sup>1</sup> , 41 RIAs were published on Defra's website, and 21 included consideration of environmental impacts. A further 18 were considered not to have significant environmental impacts.</p>

	<p pid=".420W.9/1">The Central Point of Expertise on Timber Phase 1 is: <i>(a)</i> reviewing existing guidance to establish robust contract definitions for legal and sustainable timber; <i>(b)</i> devising a methodology for assessing whether individual certification schemes meet UK Government requirements for identifying legal and sustainable timber and <i>(c)</i> undertaking such assessments for five certification schemes. This work will result in revised guidance that will be communicated by email to heads of procurement and environmental managers in central Government departments, to the devolved administrations and to the Improvement Development Agency. In addition the revised guidance will be published on a CPET web site that will be publicised by a press release. Future phases of the CPET service will build on this work and it is expected that a similar communication strategy will be adopted.</p>

	<p pid=".421W.5/7">Whether all the services outlined above would be covered by CPET Phase 2 has yet to be decided. That decision will depend on resource availability. The CPET is a new concept and investment has to be soundly based. The full CPET service is being created in phases so that experience gained can be applied to future development. The detailed plans and resource allocation for Phase 2 will be considered in the autumn of 2004 with a decision expected by the end of November 2004. The resource implications of expanding the CPET client base beyond central Government buyers will need careful consideration. The extent to which a CPET could generate income from fees, sponsorship and other commercial activities is one of a number of options that will be investigated.</p>

	<p pid=".425W.2/1">Wheat prices rose sharply last year as a response to the lower than expected harvest in central and southern Europe, but have since fallen to more normal levels in response to the gradual improvement in the supply situation and forecasts for the level of the harvest in 2004. In this immediate pre-harvest period, there is a certain amount of price volatility as old stocks are run down and the trade waits for more certainty about the availability and quality of the new harvest. Quotes for feed wheat currently range from &pound;88.50-tonne spot July to &pound;65.50-tonne at harvest.</p>

	<p pid=".432W.6/1">If the Civil Partnership Bill is enacted same-sex couples, whether they have formed a civil partnership or are living together as civil partners, will be treated in the same way as opposite-sex couples in the income-related benefits. It is possible that DWP will realise some savings as a result.</p>
	<p pid=".432W.6/2">There is very little information about the number of same-sex couples in this country. The Labour Force Survey suggests that there are about 50,000 cohabiting same-sex couples in the UK, very few of whom are pensioners.</p>
	<p pid=".432W.6/3">However, there is likely to be some under-reporting, because individuals' reluctance to disclose information about their personal circumstances. Further, the Department does not have any statistical information about individuals currently receiving income related benefits who are cohabiting with someone of the same sex. Savings are, therefore, difficult to assess with any degree of confidence and it has not been possible to include estimates in the Regulatory Impact Assessment of the Civil Partnership Bill.</p>

Since the DWP was formed in 2001&ndash;02 its resource accounts have been qualified in both 2001&ndash;02 and 2002&ndash;03 due to:</p>

	<p pid=".441W.5/1">The Department for Work and Pensions does not set a target of 14 days for deciding new claims; the regulations require a claim to be decided within 14 days of the relevant information having been received or as soon as reasonably practicable thereafter. The Department launched national Performance Standards in April 2002, which set a standard of 90 per cent. of new housing benefit claims to be decided in 14 days, but these are not mandatory. In the fourth quarter of 2003&ndash;04 (the most recent data available) the national average performance was 75 per cent. of new claims decided within 14 days with 23 per cent. of local authorities currently meeting or exceeding the 90 per cent. standard.</p>

	<p pid=".457W.5/1">The Health and Safety Executive (HSE) will not be setting a maximum working temperature, as, due to the diversity of workplaces and work activities, it would be impractical to do so. Temperature is but one of a range of environmental and personal factors that thermal comfort in the workplace is dependant upon. Other factors include ventilation, humidity, radiant temperature, clothes worn, and the type of work involved. However, HSE do have plans to explore ways in which more guidance can be provided on the assessment and control of thermal comfort, and officials are currently considering possible approaches to a proposed dialogue on the matter with social partners.</p>

Free and democratic elections were held in 2001 which resulted in the formation of a Provisional Kosovo Government (PISG). In November 2003, the UNSC set out key standards that the PISG needed to reach for a process on final status to begin. The UN Secretary General, consulting the Contact Group, will assess progress in a formal review in 2005.</p>
	<p pid=".464W.2/2">The UK continues to be a leading partner in Kosovo working closely with the UN Mission in Kosovo, the EU and the Contact Group to build a Kosovo based on the rule of law. I welcome the <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-14">14 July</phrase> Joint Declaration by Kosovo Serb and Albanian leaders pledging to work together on reconciliation, return of displaced Serbs and reform of local self-government.</p>
	<p pid=".464W.2/3">Since the establishment of UNMIK in 1999, the UK has provided over &pound;50 million and over 100 seconded staff. We have contributed over &pound;115 million to programmes to help develop policy, strategy and operational systems in key areas such as public administration, social policy and health care reform.</p>

	<p pid=".471W.2/4" class="indent">The latest year for which figures are available is 2002. The number of deaths contributed to by MRSA, by hospital, for this year is given in the table attached. This table includes hospitals where there were five or more deaths for which MRSA was recorded as a contributory factor. Where the number of deaths was less than five the number of deaths has not been provided, to minimise the risk of disclosure of confidential information.</p>
	<p pid=".471W.2/5" class="indent">I am also placing in the House of Commons library a table showing all the establishments recorded by ONS as general hospitals or multi-function sites during 2002 at which there was:</p>

	<p pid=".471W.2/7" class="indent">either no deaths where MRSA was a contributory factor, or fewer than five such deaths.</p>
	<p pid=".471W.2/8" class="indent">It should be noted that it is not possible to put a firm figure to the number of people who die from MRSA because people are often very sick with a number of other conditions so the contribution of MRSA to the outcome in any particular case is uncertain. The underlying causeof death is most often the disease or injury which led them to be admitted to hospital, rather than the MRSA which may have complicated the course of the illness. Internationally accepted guidance from the World Health Organisation on the completion of death certificates requires only those conditions that contribute directly to death to be recorded.</p>

	<p pid=".473W.2/1">I understand from the FSA that in the case of pension compensation cases which are part of the formal Pensions Review, recompense is not normally payable in the form of cash but by addition to the individual's pension. The term &quot;redress&quot; is apposite rather than the term &quot;compensation&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".473W.2/2">Where a loss has been caused by non-compliant advice and reinstatement into the original pension scheme is available at fair cost, then an offer of reinstatement must be made.</p>
	<p pid=".473W.2/3">Otherwise, the normal method of redress is by topping-up the individual's personal pension. The value of pension and other benefits that would have been available from the original pension scheme, is compared with that from the personal pension after allowing for any relevant differences in the individual's pension contributions. The shortfall in value is added to the personal pension as redress.</p>
	<p pid=".473W.2/4">As the level of benefits and risks differ between pension arrangements the method of working out the value of benefits needs to allow for this. Under the Pensions Review, which reviewed sales of personal pensions between <phrase class="date" code="1988-04-29">29 April 1988</phrase> and <phrase class="date" code="1994-06-30">30 June 1994</phrase>, and which is now virtually complete save for relatively few difficult cases, the following method and checks applied:</p>
	<p pid=".473W.2/5" class="indent">To ensure that benefits provided by the personal pensions were equivalent in value to those provided by the original pension scheme, the method of valuation was specified in regulatory provisions using actuarial methodology together with assumptions about future investment return, inflation and longevity.</p>
	<p pid=".473W.2/6" class="indent">These assumptions were based on independent actuarial advice, confirmed by the actuarial profession and regularly reviewed.</p>
	<p pid=".473W.2/7" class="indent">Where other assumptions were needed about the individual's particular situation, either standard amounts were specified in the regulator's provisions or sufficiently important assumptions were required to be disclosed to the individual so that he or she could question them and provide further information if available.</p>
	<p pid=".473W.2/8" class="indent">Firms were required to confirm that the redress complied with the regulatory provisions for each case and also to carry out audits of their review process and results.</p>
	<p pid=".473W.2/9" class="indent">In addition, firms were subject to supervisory checks by the regulators.</p>
	<p pid=".473W.2/10" class="indent">If a consumer was not content with the offer made and was unable to resolve his or her concerns with the firm, he or she had the right to complain to the relevant Ombudsman, the normal time scales for complaints having been waived.</p>
	<p pid=".473W.2/11">General pensions complaints are dealt with by the Financial Ombudsman Service for solvent firms and by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme for firms that are unable to meet claims against them.</p>

	<p pid=".480W.9/2">The European Commission estimates that in the 10 years after 1992 the internal market created 2.5 million jobs in the EU and increased its GDP by &euro;877 billion. This amounts to an average &euro;5,700 of extra income per household (source: European Commission (2002) &quot;The Internal Market&mdash;10 Years without Frontiers&quot;). In addition to increased jobs and prosperity, the Commission report points to benefits to consumers from the increased choice, price competition, and product quality and innovation in the world's largest single market. For example, according to a Commission survey, 80 per cent. of EU citizens believed that the internal market has led to wider choice and 67 per cent. that it had led to improved quality.</p>

	<p pid=".480W.12/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid=".480W.12/2">British exporters have benefited from reduced compliance and development costs, resulting from the removal of frontier controls and from rules that allow goods to be traded across the EU rather than complying with 25 different sets of national laws. The 1988 Cecchini Report (&quot;The Cost Of non-Europe&quot;) estimated the cost saving to EU business of removal of internal frontier controls alone in a Union then consisting of 12 members states at &euro;8 billion. In its report, &quot;The Internal Market&mdash;10 Years without Frontiers&quot; (European Commission (2002)), the European Commission notes that before the frontiers came down, the tax system alone required 60 million customs clearance documents annually: these are no longer needed. The Commission's report notes how a strong, competitive internal market has helped firms become more productive and efficient and so enhanced their ability to compete in global markets. It sets out benefits to consumers from the greater prosperity, choice, price competition and product innovation that the world's largest internal market brings.</p>

	<p pid=".483W.2/1">The Ministry of Defence was originally excluded from the administration cost control regime because it could have discouraged inter-changeability between Service and civilian personnel. The Ministry of Defence is not exempt from the administration costs efficiency target announced in the 2004 Budget. This target applies to all departments and MOD will be required to freeze the equivalent of its administration budget over the Spending Review years.</p>

	<p pid=".501W.6/1">The Department does not collect this data. Schools do not identify themselves as schools selecting by aptitude in their annual returns to the Department. The admission authority for any school which can identify itself as having a specialism may introduce 10 per cent. selection by aptitude as part of its published admission arrangements. Such arrangements are subject to local consultation, and any objections may be referred to the Schools Adjudicator.</p>
	<p pid=".501W.6/2">Schools are not required to identify themselves as having selection by aptitude as part of their annual returns to the Department, and so we do not have an exact figure for the number of schools taking advantage of this provision. However, based on research carried out in 2001 by Anne West of the LSE, we estimate that just under 6 per cent. of schools in the specialist schools programme select any pupils on the basis of aptitude for the specialism, and that overall around 2 per cent. of all secondary schools do.</p>

	<p pid=".505W.2/1">The design and management of the Post Office card account is an operational matter for the Post Office. I understand from the company that the application process is as simple as possible within the legal and regulatory requirements for the banking industry. I also understand that the account opening process is no more onerous than that for a bank account with a financial institution. We have not seen any real evidence that the process for opening a Post Office card account is difficult. Already, over 2.8 million card accounts have been opened.</p>
	<p pid=".505W.2/2">While there has been no problem with the opening of the account, the Government have identified a problem that too many customers were failing to pass on their Post Office card account details to DWP or the Inland Revenue, so making it impossible for those Departments to pay money into the new account. Having identified the problem, solutions are being put in place, including the creation of a pre-populated bank account details form (with the account number, sort code and mandate for the spending Department to credit the account) which will be given to customers at their local post office when they collect their card. By signing the forms there and then customers can start receiving benefits into their card account much quicker.</p>

Summing these estimated costs to all businesses of employment legislation introduced since 1997, produces a figure of &pound;5.1 to &pound;5.6 billion a year of policy costs (such as the cost to employers of paying the national minimum wage), but just &pound;32 to &pound;39 million per year of on-going 'implementation' costs (the administrative or 'red-tape' costs). Small firms might account for &pound;1.5 to &pound;1.6 billion of the policy costs and &pound;9 to &pound;11 million of implementation costs. At the same time, it should be remembered that there are very significant benefits to small firms associated with these changes to employment legislation.</p>

	<p pid=".509W.8/2">There are some 79,000 Vibration White Finger (VWF) claims waiting to be settled. The average time taken from registration of claim to settlement is around 2.5 years and is dependant on the factors mentioned above.</p>

	<p pid=".513W.11/1">Mercosur, the Common Market of the South, was created by Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay in March 1991. In 1996 association agreements were signed with Bolivia and Chile establishing free trade areas with these countries; Mexico and Venezuela have recently expressed interest in joining the group. Expansion of Mercosur would be a decision for the full members. The UK favours the process of deeper regional integration since we believe this creates greater possibilities for economic growth and poverty reduction.</p>

	<p pid=".515W.2/1">The Regional Development Agencies (RDAs) have been set a framework of challenging targets which they must demonstrate their contribution to. Under the three-tier target framework, tier 1 targets restate their statutory purposes. Tier 2 are regional outcomes of interest to the funding Departments. Tier 3 are targets for direct outputs, achieved through RDA programme spend. These are listed as follows.</p>
	<p pid=".515W.2/2" class="indentitalic">Tier 3 outputs:</p>
	<p pid=".515W.2/3" class="indentitalic">(i) Employment Opportunities;</p>

	<p pid=".515W.2/12" class="indent">Leverage through RDA funding and activity x pounds private sector investment benefiting residents of the most deprived wards</p>
	<p pid=".515W.2/13">Each RDA has the same core targets, though the numbers differ region by region, and activities aimed at meeting them and addressing regional needs are described in the Regional Economic Strategy developed with regional stakeholders.</p>
	<p pid=".515W.2/14">As set out in the Devolved Decision Making Review (March 2004), the DTI, working in partnership with other Government Departments, is coordinating the implementation of a new approach to tasking the RDAs in time to come into effect from April 2005.</p>
	<p pid=".515W.2/15">The new framework will help the RDAs and Departments to work on regional priorities in a way that also serves national interests more effectively. It will provide clearer direction by simplifying targets and making them more relevant to what the Agencies are trying to do.</p>

	<p pid=".516W.5/1">Our overall target is that by 2010, 10 per cent. of the UK's electricity should come from renewable sources. ODPM are currently reviewing their national guidelines which help set out planning guidance for local authorities on renewable energy development. Responses to their consultation and the new planning guidance, PPS 22, are being analysed and final publication of PPS 22 is due in the summer.</p>
	<p pid=".516W.5/2">At a regional level the Southwest Government Office have planning guidance in the shape of RPG 10&mdash;produced in 2001 and informed by PPS 22's predecessor. This sets an indicative target of 11&ndash;15 per cent. of electricity from renewables by 2010&mdash;just under 600MW of capacity. The regional office then worked with individual counties to agree indicative targets at the county level and incorporate them into individual renewable energy strategies; for example, Devon has a 151 MW indicative target. These were based upon detailed resource and character assessments of the landscape but the indicative targets are not split by technology. RPG 10 is due to be updated by the Regional Spatial Strategy in 2005&mdash;which will be informed by PPS 22. No guidelines have been issued in respect of renewable energy provision for any individual development.</p>

The report finds that: &quot;In most cases the WTR were not seen as a major business issue. However, the interviews produced some evidence of working time reduction arising from the Regulations and examples were given of operational benefits including more efficient ways of working and the positive impact on worker flexibility and efficiency of reduced working hours. Where a negative impact was cited it was most commonly in relation to increased labour costs, however only one company identified substantial costs which were directly associated with the WTR.&quot; (page 9).</p>

Since 1990 this work has been contracted out to Devonport Management Limited in Plymouth. As part of this process, the submarine's reactor is defuelled at the earliest practicable opportunity and the fuel&mdash;High Level Waste (HLW)&mdash;is removed for long term storage at British Nuclear Fuels plc at Sellafield.</p>

PFI, partnering and prime contracting are the procurement options being considered. PFI will only be pursued if it can be demonstrated that it offers the most effective procurement strategy.</p>

	<p pid=".529W.10/1">The Legal Services Commission (LSC) monitors whether costs claimed by suppliers are reasonable, either by individual bill submitted (for civil representation) or by auditing a sample of files (for controlled work under an LSC contract). At some stage, virtually all suppliers in receipt of public funding will have had their bills reduced, either by the LSC or by the court through its assessment process.</p>
	<p pid=".529W.10/2">The LSC does not record costs in a way which enables them to identify the total cost for over-toiling in each year. Neither does it distinguish between those firms that have stopped doing work because the LSC has actively terminated contracts, and those firms that have withdrawn voluntarily. The LSC may terminate contracts for a range of reasons including over-toiling.</p>
	<p pid=".529W.10/3">The LSC carries out cost compliance audits on all firms who are contracted with them to measure whether the suppliers are claiming correctly on their files. This is an objective audit where LSC compares what is claimed by the suppliers against what is actually evidenced in those files. Where a supplier is confirmed as 'category 3'&mdash;the lowest rating under the LSC's cost assessment audit&mdash; the Commission recovers the amounts claimed from the supplier. In 2003&ndash;04, the LSC recovered in excess of &pound;7 million from 711 suppliers as a result of these audits.</p>

The normal retirement age for all other staff is 60, although even then all staff may stay on beyond 60 if there are sound business reasons. The DCA board has recently agreed that the normal retirement age should be increased to 65 for all staff with effect from <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-01">1 April 2005</phrase>, subject to consultation with the departmental trade unions.

	<p pid=".533W.5/1">The Legal Services Commission (LSC) had debts due to it at the end of the financial year 2003&ndash;04 of &pound;262 million. Much of this debt (around 72 per cent.) is secured by the registration of a statutory charge against property and is not, generally, immediately collectable. The LSC allows the funded client to postpone the operation of the charge, subject to certain conditions, and the debt is not repayable until the property is sold or upon the death of the client.</p>
	<p pid=".533W.5/2">Cases relating to the statutory charge have since 1988 attached interest. The rate of interest is linked to the Bank of England base rate and currently stands at 5 per cent. simple interest. &pound;50 million of the gross debt due to the Commission relates to interest.</p>
	<p pid=".533W.5/3">Other debts due to the LSC are normally immediately repayable and are pursued by a dedicated debt recovery team. In 2003&ndash;04, the LSC successfully recovered &pound;28 million worth of debt. Some of these debts may be owed by funded clients (e.g. unpaid contributions towards funding legal aid) and are difficult to recover given the limited financial circumstances of the clients.</p>

	<p pid=".535W.2/1">This information is not collected centrally. Individual Electoral Registration Officers may keep historical records of the number of postal voters in their registration area, though separate records are not kept of long-term postal voters and those for one election only. It is possible to apply for a postal vote at any time, and figures are not maintained on a yearly basis. Available statistics show that at the 2001 general election, 1,758,055 postal votes were issued in total (3.9 per cent. of the electorate) compared to 937,205 (2.1 per cent. of the electorate) at the 1997 general election.</p>

	<p pid=".537W.8/1">UK assistance to the UN Mission in the Democratic Republic of Congo (MONUC) has increased since UN Security Council Resolution 1279 of November 1999, as exigencies have dictated. Figures for 1999 are not readily available, but available figures from 2001 to UN Security Council Resolution 1493 of July 2003 show that UK commitment to MONUC has:</p>
	<p pid=".537W.8/2">In monetary terms, increased from &pound;10.7 million in 2001&ndash;02 to &pound;18.5 million in 2002&ndash;03. In the period after Resolution 1493, i.e. in 2003&ndash;04, the UK's monetary contribution amounted to &pound;33.8 million. It is expected to total approximately 28.7 million in 2004&ndash;05. These figures are for the UK's assessed contribution to MONUC through the UN only.</p>
	<p pid=".537W.8/3">In addition to the UK's assessed contribution to MONUC through the UN, the UK also gives additional and voluntary assistance to MONUC's peacekeeping activities. In 2001&ndash;02, the UK contributed &pound;588,000 in additional assistance to MONUC, and &pound;669,000 in 2002&ndash;03. In the period after Resolution 1493, i.e. in 2003&ndash;04, the UK contributed &pound;1.8 million (including &pound;1.1 million to an EU peace support operation). The UK will likely contribute an additional &pound;1 million to the peacekeeping effort in the Democratic Republic of Congo in 2004&ndash;05.</p>
	<p pid=".537W.8/4">In terms of manpower, the UK had six officers in MONUC from 2000 to 2003, now reduced to five. The UK currently has five troops serving with MONUC. The UK also contributed a Royal Engineer squadron and two aircraft to the EU peace support operation to DRC (an interim measure lasting from June-September 2003). Also as part of the EU operation, the UK deployed staff to assist in the operation's headquarters in Paris and Entebbe. In total, the UK contributed 120 staff to the operation.</p>

	<p pid=".547W.11/1">The UK is represented in the Quartet (UN, US, EU, Russia) through the EU. We, EU partners and other Quartet members have made clear that Prime Minister Sharon's plan to withdraw from Gaza and part of the West Bank would provide a rare moment of opportunity in the search for peace in the Middle East. At the same time they have said that all final settlement issues, including borders, are to be decided through negotiations between the parties. The UK fully supports this position.</p>

For example the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO), through its Embassy in Washington, works closely with contacts in the US and Whitehall Departments on various US-led international technology partnerships. One example is the International Partnership for a Hydrogen Economy. We are also working to engage with the US on sustainable energy through the Commission on Sustainable development (CSD).</p>
	<p pid=".550W.2/3">The FCO has also, in co-operation with other government departments, secured US sign-up to the Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Partnership (REEEP). I launched the REEEP in London in October 2003 with my right hon. Friends the Secretaries of State for Trade and Industry (Patricia Hewitt) and Environment (Margaret Beckett) and had a bilateral discussion with US Department of Energy Assistant Secretary David Garman. In April this year Paula Dobriansky (Under Secretary of State for Global Affairs) formally signed the US government up as a partner of the Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Partnership and agreed to contribute $50,000 a year to help fund the REEEP's International Secretariat in Vienna. Larisa Dobriansky (US Department of Energy) is also a representative on the REEEP Governing Board.</p>

We encouraged them to take further steps to improve the situation of women in Turkey including through the provision of shelters, further training of the judiciary in adopting sentences commensurate with the gravity of the offence, and training of the police and gendarme in how to respond immediately and effectively to violence against women.

	<p pid=".551W.2/1">We remain seriously concerned by reports of religious intolerance and human rights abuses against Christian and other religions in Turkmenistan. Religious freedom is guaranteed under the Turkmen constitution, but the requirement for religious groups to register remains a major obstacle. Religious activity in Turkmenistan remains tightly controlled and even registered religions are at best tolerated by the state.</p>
	<p pid=".551W.2/2">The UK actively supports the promotion of human rights including freedom of thought, conscience, religion and belief. We remain in close touch with representatives of religious groups and NGOs in Turkmenistan to promote freedom of religion. We are aware of a number of prominent human rights cases, including allegations of religious persecution and imprisonment. We are also aware of raids on premises used by Christians, in particular, prior to autumn 2003, although none have so far been reported to our embassy in 2004. We condemn all instances where religious groups are persecuted because of their faith or belief, wherever they happen and whatever the religion of the individual or group concerned. Our ambassador in Turkmenistan together with EU and US colleagues, regularly raises specific cases of religious persecution with the Turkmen Government, and takes every opportunity to urge the pursuit of laws and practices that foster tolerance and mutual respect.</p>
	<p pid=".551W.2/3">The recent decision by the Turkmen Government to decriminalise unregistered religious activity is a positive development and we welcome the registration of two religious minorities: the Baha'is and the Seventh Day Adventists.</p>
	<p pid=".551W.2/4">We will continue to monitor the situation closely and push for further progress on this issue.</p>

Six core accessibility indicators have been agreed, which include access to education and health care (two indicators each) and access to jobs and major retail centres. Each English Local Transport Authority outside London will report against these indicators as part of their next Local Transport Plan. The indicators and the findings of the pilots will also inform the development of planning policy guidance.

	<p pid=".554W.0/3">In the Thames Gateway the Government will also be issuing guidance to local delivery vehicles that are currently being established in priority development areas. This guidance will focus on the development of sustainable communities in line with the principles set out in &quot;Sustainable Communities : building for the future&quot;, including the need to work with relevant local service providers to plan for the delivery of schools, healthcare provision and good quality public spaces alongside housing growth.</p>

The bulk of the latter funding is provided through the Regional Housing pots to the Housing Corporation's main investment programme and to local authorities, following recommendations made by the Regional Housing Boards.

	<p pid=".564W.2/1">The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister set out a radical reform programme in our &quot;Sustainable Communities Plan&quot;, which was published on <phrase class="date" code="2003-02-05">5 February 2003</phrase>, to increase the provision of affordable housing, including through increased investment, improvements to the planning system and the establishment of four growth areas to provide an additional 200,000 homes. As a result of the Spending Review announced last week, the Government will more than double spending on new affordable housing since 1997 up to &pound;2.25 billion. This funding will provide an extra 10,000 social rented homes a year by 2008&mdash;a 50 per cent. increase&mdash;to help tackle homelessness.</p>
	<p pid=".564W.2/2">The private rented sector also has an important role to play in providing affordable accommodation for those who cannot afford to buy their own homes, the growingnumber of students and single person households. The sector offers a flexible form of tenure to young professionals. It contributes to greater labour market mobility, the efficient functioning of the housing market and to the success of the wider economy.</p>
	<p pid=".564W.2/3">The Government believe that there is scope for the private rented sector to make a bigger contribution to meeting individuals' housing needs. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister is seeking to encourage this including through consultation on the promotion of investment in commercial property and the private rented sector by removing the tax disadvantages currently faced by institutions. In addition, the Housing Bill seeks to raise quality, especially of management, in some of the worst parts of the private rented sector, where the most vulnerable members of society frequently bear the brunt of some of the poorest conditions and services.</p>
	<p pid=".564W.2/4">The Office of the Deputy Prime Ministers proposed update to Planning Policy Guidance Note No. 3 (PPG3) titled &quot;Influencing the size, type and affordability of housing&quot;, due to be published in October 2004, includes the requirement that local planning authorities should address the housing requirements of the whole community by ensuring a better match between a community's housing needs and supply. It requires that all local planning authorities must have policies on affordable housing to help deliver affordable housing where it is needed. Local authorities are increasingly looking to the private rented sector as a means of meeting housing need.</p>

Projects that the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister (ODPM) is funding in the Thames Gateway have been selected against thematic objectives, one of which is &quot;to implement a consistent policy of quality design&quot;. We have also increased funding for the Commission for Architecture and the Built Environment (CABE), who launched the Growth Areas Housing Quality Forum in March 2004 to disseminate best practice on housing design. Major developments in the Thames Gateway, such as the Greenwich Millennium village, have already used urban design codes to provide certainty to developers and the community as to what constitutes acceptable design quality. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister is in the process of identifying other potential sites in the Gateway to pilot further urban coding schemes.</p>

	<p pid=".573W.0/2">We estimate that between 50,000 and 70,000 self-contained gas cartridge guns have been sold in the UK. Not all will still be in circulation but because they were not previously subject to control it is not possible to say how many might have been destroyed or otherwise disposed of before the new laws came into effect. I understand from the Association of Chief Police Officers that as at <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-30">30 April</phrase> a total 5,791 guns had been entered on certificate and a further 1,524 had been surrendered for destruction. Separate information on the number of late applications is not available. It is for the police to determine in individual cases whether the circumstances warrant acceptance of a late application. Owners have already had over three months in which to either surrender their guns or apply for a certificate. Those who have failed to do so are committing an offence although the Association of Chief Police Officers have advised that where somebody voluntarily comes forward to surrender a gun which they have only just learned has been banned, it will often be sufficient to seize the gun and not to prosecute.</p>

In framing sentencing guidelines, the council must, among other things, take account of the cost of different sentences and their relative effectiveness in preventing re-offending.

It is addressing the Government's target of increasing the energy efficiency on its estate in terms of kWh used per square metre of building floor area by 15 per cent. by 2010&ndash;11, relative to 1999&ndash;2000.</p>
	<p pid=".590W.5/2">The Department actively improves the energy efficiency of its estate. A switch off campaign is currently in progress across the Central London and Croydon estates, which encourages staff to switch off lights and computer equipment when not in use. There is a contractual requirement to achieve energy consumption at least 10 per cent. below the targets in the Government's energy efficient best practice programme energy consumption guide at the Department's new headquarters building at 2 Marsham street. In September 2003, The Prison Service was re-accredited under the National Energy Foundation's scheme for energy efficiency.</p>

It is not possible to break down these figures further into the categories requested.</p>
	<p pid=".593W.2/2">The primary purpose of the amnesty was to enable people to surrender illegally held guns and ammunition. Given the stricter laws which were being introduced in relation to the possession of air weapons and imitation firearms in a public place without reasonable excuse, it also provided an opportunity for young people, and others, to hand in guns which, while not illegal, were perhaps being held for criminal or anti-social purposes, or were no longer wanted. It was for individual forces to determine the procedures to be adopted for the surrender of all such items.</p>

	<p pid=".593W.5/1">Police issue fixed penalty notices (FPNs) for traffic offences under the powers set out in Part III of the Road Traffic Offenders Act 1988, as amended by the Road Traffic Act 1991. Fixed penalties are currently available for about 150 different traffic offences.</p>
	<p pid=".593W.5/2">Where a driver is detected committing a fixed penalty offence, the police will decide what action to take in the particular case. The driver may be given an informal warning or issued with a fixed penalty notice or reported for prosecution. The police operate to Association of Chief Officer of Police (ACPO) guidelines advising on what course of action might be appropriate but it is in law ultimately a matter for the individual officer's decision.</p>
	<p pid=".593W.5/3">Fixed penalty notices for traffic offences may be issued using one of four different procedures. One involves fixing the FPN to the vehicle. This is normally used for parking offences. The FPN may be issued to the driver at the time of the offence in two sets of circumstances: one for non-endorsable offences, such as failure to wear a seat belt, the other for an endorsable offence, such as speeding. For endorsable offences, the driver has to produce his driving licence at the roadside or later at a police station. The fourth procedure is used to deal with offending drivers detected by automatic speed camera and involves sending a conditional fixed penalty offer to the person identified by the vehicle number plate as being the registered keeper.</p>
	<p pid=".593W.5/4">Police may also issue fixed penalty notices for disorder offences. Guidance has been provided by the Secretary of State for police, community support officers and persons accredited by a Chief Constable under community safety accreditation schemes under section 6 of the Act. Supplementary guidance has also been provided on the issue of fixed penalty notices to persons aged 16 and 17-years-old since the scheme was extended to them in January 2004. Copies of the guidance are available on the Home Office website at: <a href="http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/crimpol/police/penalty/index.html">http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/crimpol/police/penalty/index.html</a></p>
	<p pid=".593W.5/5">The main police operational guidance is currently being revised and a new version will be provided to the police and published shortly. The Home Office continues to take feedback from the police on the operation of the fixed penalty notice for disorder scheme so that guidance may be updated as and when necessary.</p>

	<p pid=".596W.5/1">We have looked at schemes in other countries but the experience of ethnic minorities in other countries depends on a range of factors which are not necessarily comparable. These include:</p>
	<p pid=".596W.5/2" class="indent">(i) whether the scheme is voluntary or compulsory;</p>
	<p pid=".596W.5/3" class="indent">(ii) what police powers exist to require a person to produce an identity card or otherwise identify themselves;</p>

	<p pid=".596W.5/5" class="indent">(iv) what use the private sector makes of the card scheme; and</p>
	<p pid=".596W.5/6" class="indent">(v) what legal safeguards are in place to outlaw unlawful discrimination.</p>
	<p pid=".596W.5/7">We have announced that we are building a base for a compulsory scheme. One of the advantages of a compulsory scheme is that any requirement to produce a card would not be discriminatory as everyone would have one. We have said that there will be no new power for the police to stop someone and demand to see their card. Our draft Bill does allow public services to specify how a card might be produced but Parliament will have to approve the rules on a case-by-case basis. There are also provisions to guard against 'compulsion by the back door' by prohibiting organisations from making an ID card the exclusive means of proving identity in advance of the scheme being compulsory.</p>
	<p pid=".596W.5/8">Finally the administration of the scheme and how it is used to verify identity by public services will be bound by the Race Relations (Amendment) Act 2000.</p>

	<p pid=".597W.6/1">Government seeks to educate computer users about the risks of fraud facilitated using the internet. The Home Office website provides advice on avoiding internet fraud, while the Department of Trade and Industry has a campaign entitled &quot;Don't be a Mug&quot; advising on scams and rip-offs, including internet scams.</p>
	<p pid=".597W.6/2">The Home Office has recently launched the 'e-tailing mini site', which forms part of the Crime Reduction Website. This provides information to help both businesses and consumers protect themselves specifically when using the internet. We have also recently published, jointly with APACS, a leaflet on safe credit card use. This includes a section on using cards safely over the internet.</p>
	<p pid=".597W.6/3">The Home Office is represented on an industry-led Steering Group which aims to tackle 'Card Not Present' (CNP) fraud (which includes fraud over the internet). We support practical measures being introduced by the industry to increase levels of security for internet transactions. These include Address Verification Services (AVS), Card Security Code (CSC), Mastercard Secure Code and Verified by Visa which are already making a significant impact on CNP Fraud.</p>
	<p pid=".597W.6/4">There is no specific organisation which has a specific mandate to combat fraud where it is facilitated utilising the internet.</p>
	<p pid=".597W.6/5">There are however a range of specialist units within forces which investigate fraud cases, regardless of the media used to commit or facilitate the offence, consulting computer crime units as appropriate in cases where technical expertise is required. Where cases involve serious and organised computer-enabled criminality at national and international levels the case may be dealt with by the National Hi Tech Crime Unit (NHTCU) within the National Crime Squad.</p>
	<p pid=".597W.6/6">The West African Organised Crime Section of the National Criminal Intelligence Service investigates cases of advance fee fraud&mdash;in which letters are widely distributed by post, fax and email&mdash;which commonly lead to fraud, personal identity theft and corporate impersonation. They also deal with cases of website spoofing and obtaining goods by deception by West African criminal groups.</p>
	<p pid=".597W.6/7">Law enforcement is also engaged in public awareness and education campaigns. For instance in October 2003 NHTCU issued advice together with the British Bankers Association and Association of Payment and Card Services (APACS) on how the public could avoid phishing attacks.</p>

	<p pid=".602W.9/2">The Government firmly believes that users of the internet should be able to control what they see, and in particular what children are able to see, online. We support the development of a range of products and approaches to achieve this. Tools to enable such control can be applied by use of specific filtering software or by use of an Internet Service Provider which offers access controls as part of the internet connection &quot;package&quot;. Pre-loaded safety software, pre-set at point of sale to a high safety level, would be one of these options. We are currently working with the British Standards Institute to develop a BSI &quot;kitemark&quot; for filtering products, which could help guide consumers in their choices. This development follows initial work done by the Task Force on Child Protection on the Internet.</p>

	<p pid=".606W.12/1">As announced by my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary in his statement to the House on <phrase class="date" code="2004-06-22">22 June 2004</phrase>, following publication of Sir Michael Bichard's Report, the Government shall introduce the first national police intelligence computer system. Entitled &quot;Impact&quot;, it will ensure that all forces use the same system to manage and share intelligence information. In the following debate, in answer to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1136" name="Mark Oaten">the hon. Member for Winchester (Mr. Oaten)</phrase>, the Home Secretary indicated Impact could be in operation in two years, building on the Police Local Exchange (PLX) which should be available next spring. In the meantime three phases are being taken forward. Firstly, Impact will combine intelligence and data from forces' operational systems to deliver real data sharing. This is happening as we speak and progress is encouraging. Secondly, Impact will have analysis tools to pick out patterns of crime. Thirdly, it will enable specific police operations, within and between forces, through briefing and tasking functions. The Police Information Technology Organisation is now undertaking a full feasibility study of the requirements and solutions to build a technical demonstrator by next spring.</p>

	<p pid=".613W.6/1">The Home Office's National Probation Directorate (NPD) has commissioned one study that looked at the relationship between case management and accredited programme completion in the Probation Service. The research was conducted by Oxford University and it was managed and published by the National Probation Directorate in 2004. The Home Office's Research, Development and Statistics Directorate (RDS) has evaluated it. The published findings &quot;Think First Prospective Research Study: Effectiveness and Reducing Attrition&quot; are available on the National Probation Service website (<a href="http://www.probation.homeoffice.gov.uk">www.probation.homeoffice.gov.uk</a>).</p>
	<p pid=".613W.6/2">The research found that good case management was associated with improved completion rates of the Think First programme. Of greatest value was when case management involved intense supervision around the start of the programme, support with personal problems, and frequent contact after completion of the programme to assist offenders in using what had been learnt.</p>
	<p pid=".613W.6/3">NPD is planning to carry out a study to look at the impact of the Think First programme on reconviction rates (an established proxy measure for re-offending). The results should be available in 2005.</p>
	<p pid=".613W.6/4">Also, the Home Office RDS is carrying out a systematic review of the international evidence in what works in offender management in the delivery of correctional services to reduce re-offending. The results from this are expected to be available in 2005.</p>

The non-prison estate has only been collecting water consumption figures for key office buildings since 1999&ndash;2000, when these figures were included in the annual &quot;Sustainable Development in Government&quot; annual reports (previously known as the Greening Government annual report). As these reports only required consumption per staff member figures, information on consumption prior to 2001&ndash;02 was not retained. The figures are set out in the table.</p>

	<p pid=".623W.2/1">The Department has not recently commissioned or undertaken a national review of the contribution of art therapy. Primary care trusts (PCTs) have the responsibility for improving the health of the community, securing the provision of high quality services and integrating health and social care locally. They are also responsible for addressing the service needs of their local communities and developing the workforce they require to deliver services. In commissioning services, PCTs need to plan local services near to patients and ensure that they are identifying the health needs of patients and securing services for them. It is for PCTs, in partnership with strategic health authorities and other local stakeholders, to determine how best to use their funds to meet national and local priorities for improving health, tackling health inequalities and modernising services.</p>

	<p pid=".628W.5/1">The gross and net fees paid to dentists for the provision of general dental services (GDS) represent the main element of primary dental care costs and are the data most readily available by health authority area. Data since 1997 is shown in the table. These figures exclude some payments to dentists such as commitment payments, maternity and seniority payments as well as superannuation payments made on their behalf. There is a discontinuity in the figures for Hampshire and Worcestershire in the middle of 2002&ndash;03 because of the change in health administration areas.</p>
	<p pid=".628W.5/2">Community, personal and hospital dental services have not been included in this table; these are directly commissioned by individual health authorities from locally managed resources rather than funded from a central national budget as is the case with the GDS.</p>

The Food Standards Agency (FSA) carries out ad-hoc surveys, in close co-operation with local authorities, to check the accuracy of certain aspects of labelling, for example where new methodology is being employed to tackle suspected food problems.</p>

The cost of conducting elections is a matter for each NHS organisation applying for NHS foundation trust status. These costs will not be entirely additional as they will replicate some current activity that trusts are already doing around informing the public, patients and staff about issues affecting each trust.</p>

	<p pid=".634W.2/1">Allergic reactions following exposure to natural rubber latex have risen significantly over the past 10 years, particularly within healthcare occupations and this prompted action by the Department and the NHS Purchasing and Supplies Agency to remove powdered latex gloves, (the biggest cause of latex sensitisation), from sale to national health service employers. This action has reduced significantly the incidence of latex allergy, and has been followed up by the Department and the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) issuing a latex toolkit. The toolkit covers issues concerning latex allergy, including what steps employers and employees should be taking to avoid it in the workplace. It also includes comprehensive advice on single-use glove selection, taking into account the importance of infection control. The toolkit can be found at: <a href="http://www.hse.gov.uk/latex">www.hse.gov.uk/latex</a></p>

	<p pid=".636W.2/2">The National Health Service Information Authority (NHSIA) has reached a settlement with Electronic Data Services Corporation (EDS), following mediation, without admission of liability on either side. The terms provide for the payment by the NHSIA of outstanding invoices. They further provide that should EDS make redundancies as a consequence of the change of service provider, the NHSIA will indemnify the actual costs incurred. The NHSIA will also make payments in respect of costs relating to the conclusion of the project. Further details of the settlement are covered by a legally-binding confidentiality agreement.</p>
	<p pid=".636W.2/3">The exact costs are not yet known, but will be clarified when the contract ends in October.</p>

	<p pid=".642W.0/1">In May 2003, the Government's independent scientific advisory committee, the Committee on Safety of Medicines (CSM), established an expert working group on the safety of Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) because of continuing concerns about withdrawal reactions and possible suicidal behaviour associated with these products. The expert working group is still considering evidence regarding the safety of all SSRIs (including paroxetine). The group is expected to report on its findings later this year, and its report will be made available to the public with copies placed in the Library.</p>
	<p pid=".642W.0/2">In June 2003, the CSM considered newly received clinical trial data for paroxetine in children and adolescents and, on the basis of these data and advised that paroxetine should not be used in patients under 18 years of age in the treatment of major depressive illness, because of evidence of an increased risk of suicidal behaviour and a lack of efficacy in this population group. This advice was communicated to prescribers and patients in June 2003 and again in December 2003.</p>
	<p pid=".642W.0/3">In March 2004, the CSM issued advice to remind prescribes of the recommended starting and daily doses of paroxetine, as stated in the summary of product characteristics for this medicine.</p>
	<p pid=".642W.0/4">A Europe wide review of the risks and benefits of paroxetine has also been undertaken by European Committee for Proprietary Medicinal Products (CPMP), with the United Kingdom in the lead. This review included an assessment of whether some young adults as well as those in the under 18 patient group may have an increased risk of suicidal behaviour when using this drug. No strong evidence has been found to support an increased risk and the CSM and the CPMP have advised that the balance of risks and benefits for paroxetine in the treatment of major depressive illness and anxiety disorders in patients of 18 years or older is favourable.</p>
	<p pid=".642W.0/5">The CPMP has recommended that patients at high baseline risk of suicidal behaviour should be closely monitored during treatment with paroxetine. These include patients with a known history of suicidal behaviour or thoughts prior to starting treatment, and possibly young adults as a patient group. In April, a summary of the opinion of the CPMP referring to the need for monitoring during paroxetine treatment of patients at risk of suicidal behaviour, including those with a history of suicidal behaviour and young adults was released by both the European Medicines Agency and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).</p>
	<p pid=".642W.0/6">The CPMP review and recommendations are now being considered by the European Commission, with final decisions expected in the near future. When decisions have been reached by the Commission, a review of the evidence will be made public. If necessary, the product information for prescribers and patients will be updated and communicated, with details harmonised across the European Union.</p>
	<p pid=".642W.0/7">The MHRA emphasises that the patient information leaflet for Seroxat currently advises that symptoms of depression, including suicidal behaviour, may increase in the first few weeks of treatment and that patients should seek urgent medical attention if they have any distressing thoughts or experiences during this initial period or at any other time.</p>

	<p pid=".643W.8/1">The only vaccine currently used in the United Kingdom routine childhood immunisation programme that contains a mercury compound is the diphtheria, tetanus and whole cell pertussis (DTwP) vaccine which is given combined with haemophilus influenzae type B vaccine. The mercury is present as ethylmercury in the excipient thiomersal (also known as thimerosal). As with all medicinal products, vaccine safety is continually monitored by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) with advice from the independent expert advisory body, the Committee on Safety of Medicines (CSM). The MHRA and CSM have thoroughly reviewed the safety of mercury-containing vaccines, including alleged links with neurodevelopmental disorders, on a number of occasions.</p>
	<p pid=".643W.8/2">In 2001, the CSM conducted a major review of the available evidence and has since then considered new data as it has emerged. In 2003, following a review of further studies, including two UK studies involving more than 100,000 children, CSM advice was placed on the MHRA website at <a href="http://medicines.mhra.gov.uk">http://medicines.mhra.gov.uk</a>. Further studies from Denmark involving almost half a million children and a study from the United States have also specifically investigated the suggested link between mercury-containing vaccines and autism. None of these studies have found any evidence of a causal association with autism.</p>
	<p pid=".643W.8/3">On the basis of the available data, the CSM's advice remains that there is no evidence of harm from the very small quantities of thiomersal contained in some vaccines, with the exception of possible hypersensitivity reactions (typically skin rashes or local swelling at the site of injection). This view concurs with that of the World Health Organisation, the United States Institute of Medicine and the European Medicines Agency (EMEA).</p>
	<p pid=".643W.8/4">There is a global goal to minimise environmental exposure to mercury compounds. In line with this and despite the strong evidence supporting the safety of thiomersal in vaccines, the EMEA continues to promote the development of vaccines without thiomersal or with the lowest possible levels of thiomersal. However, the EMEA acknowledges that during some manufacturing processes, the use of mercury compounds is necessary and in such cases, residual levels might be present in the final vaccine product.</p>

	<p pid=".645W.2/1">The funding of medical training salary costs is resourced through a central overall funding allocation that makes no distinction between full-time and part-time trainees. The distribution of funding between full-time and part-time training at local level is the responsibility of the respective strategic health authorities (SHAs). No figures are held centrally for the local breakdown of resources; the total funding provided to SHAs in 2004&ndash;05 was &pound;3.8 billion.</p>
	<p pid=".645W.2/2">In addition and to support the introduction of the new contract, funding of &pound;7 million in each of the years 2002&ndash;03 and 2003&ndash;04 was exceptionally provided to support the salary costs of part-time trainees. This was during a short period when new pay rates for full-time trainees were being progressively introduced and new part-time salaries, introduced in full in one step, were high by comparison; this is no longer the case.</p>

	<p pid=".648W.0/1">It has long been central to UK transport policy that users should pay the full costs, including those of security. Organisations delivering training in air cargo security are required to be approved in that role by the Department, and to that end the instructors are required to have attended an air cargo managers course and are then provided with a training pack setting our the UK National Aviation Security Training Programme, with objectives and teaching points to ensure that the training, when they are accredited, represents a proper understanding of how responsibilities for air cargo security should be discharged.</p>
	<p pid=".648W.0/2">For shipping freight companies it is part of the Port Facility Security Officer's (PFSO) responsibilities, under the International Ship and Port Security (ISPS) Code, to ensure that appropriate training is conducted by their security staff.</p>

	<p pid=".651W.11/1">Cycle routes are in the main the responsibility of local highway authorities. A cycle route will often consist of a variety of linked highways such as dedicated cycle tracks, cycle lanes on the carriageway and the use of roads designated as suitable for cycle routes. Sustrans, the Transport charity, predict that the National Cycle Network will consist of 10,000 miles by the end of 2005. In addition local authorities forecast building over 6,000 miles of new cycle lanes and cycle tracks over between 2001&ndash;02 and 2005&ndash;06.</p>
	<p pid=".651W.11/2">We have a safer cycling programme, which is a package of measures including improved infrastructure&mdash;better cycle routes, off road cycle tracks, cycle lanes, advance stop lines, toucan crossings etc., better driving standards by improving training and testing for motorists, and publicity aimed both at drivers and cyclists. It also covers the promotion of measures which cyclists can take to protect themselves, such as taking cycle training, making themselves conspicuous and wearing a cycle helmet.</p>
	<p pid=".651W.11/3">We have also recently published an &quot;Action Plan for Walking and Cycling&quot;, which sets out more than 40 actions from across Government to make cycling and walking easier, safer and more attractive, enabling people to get around more by foot and by bicycle. One of the actions will be to fund new sections of the National Cycle Network to link with existing safe cycling and walking routes to schools.</p>

	<p pid=".652W.5/1">The Department has not carried out any formal assessment of the problems caused by cyclists cycling illegally on footpaths and footways (the pavement) and we have no plans to commission specific research into the subject. We are however aware from our post bag that many pedestrians, particularly elderly and disabled people are concerned at the danger and inconvenience caused by cyclists who cycle illegally on footpaths and pavements.</p>
	<p pid=".652W.5/2">While we do not condone it, we believe that some cyclists cycle on the pavement because they feel safer there than cycling on heavily trafficked roads. We hope that as facilities for cyclists and cyclist training improve, cyclists will feel safer on the road and that the number of cyclists using footpaths and footways illegally will reduce.</p>
	<p pid=".652W.5/3">Local Transport Note 2/86 (Stationery Office) concerns Shared Use by Cyclists and Pedestrians. This advises local highway authorities that such shared use facilities are not a general or area-wide remedy to cycle safety problems but should be confined to specific links in cycle routes and quiet footways along heavily trafficked roads. The guidance also advises that shared use may be unacceptable if significant use is made of a pedestrian facility by disabled, blind or partially sighted or elderly people.</p>

The table sets out payments by three of the Department's Agencies which were made in out of court settlements following the commencement of legal proceedings finalised in the financial year 2003&ndash;04. Disproportionate costs would be incurred in identifying generally ex gratia and other settlement payments. However, maladministration claims against the Maritime and Coastguard Agency have been settled for a total of around &pound;0.5 million, including one case finalised at the very beginning of the current financial year. These claims followed on from a ruling by the Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration in an earlier similar case that there had been maladministration in the carrying out of certain statutory functions relating to the safety of vessels.</p>

Increased train weight arising from safety and other design features and the wider use of air conditioning and power operated doors have tended to increase the power needs of modern trains. But current and future developments should offset that. For example, future technology in body construction is expected to lead to lighter trains which draw less power and regenerative braking, which produces new power during the braking process, is already being introduced where practicable.</p>

	<p pid=".675W.0/1">Most staff in the Department for Transport are located in about 100 larger properties while the remainder are located in relatively small properties belonging to the agencies. Consequently, the most significant sustainable development operational impacts of the main office estate are typically in respect of utility use, waste, paper, procurement and travel.</p>
	<p pid=".675W.0/2">On the non-office estate there are also few sites that might be considered to have significant sustainable impacts beyond the typical and these are:</p>
	<p pid=".675W.0/3" class="indent">The Air Accidents Investigation Branch at Farnborough that handles crash wreckage from civil aircraft accidents and serious incidents within the UK, which they investigate.</p>
	<p pid=".675W.0/4" class="indent">The Maritime and Coastguard Agency Maritime Rescue Sub Centres and Co-ordination Centres which are manned and operational 24 hours a day and include air-conditioned emergency operational areas, rescue equipment, emergency generators etc.</p>
	<p pid=".675W.0/5" class="indent">The 24 acre Driving Standards Agency's training residential centre at Cardington.</p>
	<p pid=".675W.0/6" class="indent">Vehicle Inspectorate's goods vehicle testing stations provide statutory testing of vehicles.</p>
	<p pid=".675W.0/7" class="indent">The 100 HA motorway maintenance depots which provide a base from which to undertake routine motorway maintenance, and especially winter maintenance and could include one or more rock salt storage barns, a number of winter maintenance vehicles, weighbridge and washdown areas, and diesel fuel tanks.</p>
	<p pid=".675W.0/8">The sustainable impacts at these sites vary considerably depending on the nature of the work undertaken at them but are likely to cover such aspects as biodiversity, estates management, control of pollution, handling hazardous substances or waste and the discharge of water.</p>

Following negotiations we have, since 1999, transferred around 2,000kms of these non-strategic roads to local highway authorities&mdash;about 20 per cent. of the original network. The data have not been adjusted to take this into account. We would hope to complete the transfer of the remaining non-strategic roads, another l,000kms, over the next two years.</p>
