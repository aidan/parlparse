Two examples are, exempting small shops from the new EU unit pricing requirements and exempting employers with 20 or fewer employees from the trade union recognition procedures in the Employment Relations Act.</p>

	<p pid=".456W.6/5" class="indent">There is only limited information available for some of these topics.

Annex A contains information by social class. Annex B contains information by ethnic group and Annex C contains information by geographic location.

	<p pid=".456W.6/8" class="indent">It is not possible to present the number of live births per 1,000 teenage women by social class as population estimates by social class are not available. Also social class is only available in England and Wales and Northern Ireland by father's social class, so it is not possible to derive social class for registrations where only the mother's name is recorded. In England and Wales a 10 per cent. sample of the fathers' occupation and employment status is used to determine social class. For Scotland births within marriage are categorised to social class of the father; social class of the mother is used to categorise births outside marriage.</p>
	<p pid=".456W.6/9" class="indent">The number of live births to teenage women are given in the following tables for 2000, the latest year for which information is available for the United Kingdom. Data for England and Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland are presented separately because of differences between the constituent countries in the way social class is allocated (see above).

	<p pid=".473W.3/2">The fourth Preparatory Committee meeting for the World Summit on Sustainable Development gives us a basis for the final run up to Johannesburg. Progress was made on a programme of action, which includes the importance of sanitation in eradicating poverty and meeting the Millennium Development Goal on safe drinking water. Broad agreement was also reached on key issues such as the urgent need to restore fish stocks and address illegal fishing, and on the important role non-governmental actors can play in achieving sustainable development. The meeting also recognised the need for a strong focus on Africa.</p>
	<p pid=".473W.3/3">Other difficult issues remain outstanding, such as how the summit can address trade and finance issues to complement the Monterrey Consensus and the Doha Development Agenda. There are also specific targets on sanitation, biodiversity loss and energy, which have yet to be agreed. The UK will continue to work constructively with partners to ensure a successful outcome for Johannesburg, including concrete actions and coherent work programmes on energy, water and sustainable patterns of consumption and production.</p>

	<p pid=".476W.2/1">There is an agreement in place with the Association of British Insurers member companies that during 2002, other than in exceptional circumstances, they will continue to provide flood cover for domestic properties and small businesses which they currently insure. Cases where there is an alleged breach of this agreement will be investigated by the ABI.</p>
	<p pid=".476W.2/2">The insurance industry is a competitive one. Government have no plans to intervene in the market either generally or with individual companies. While recognising concern about the recent announcement by Esure, I understand their position to be that they will not provide cover to new clients in areas at risk of flooding. This decision is not a breach of the ABI agreement which relates only to renewal of existing policies. It is also my understanding that as a relatively newly formed company, Esure have few existing clients in the floodplain.</p>
	<p pid=".476W.2/3">While no formal assessment has been made, I am aware that there could be a significant impact if insurers were to withdraw cover for households and businesses at risk of flooding. The Government are therefore working hard with the industry to try to ensure the continued, widespread availability of affordable flood cover beyond the end of 2002. There have been regular meetings with the insurance industry, at both ministerial and official level, to consider their calls for increased investment in flood and coastal defence, controls on development in areas at risk of flooding, simplified arrangements for implementing flood defences and better information on real flood risk. I expect to meet again with the industry later in the summer.</p>

	<p pid=".479W.2/1">We are taking a number of steps to reduce the possibility of a further outbreak of foot and mouth disease through initiatives covering prevention; disease surveillance and contingency planning.</p>
	<p pid=".479W.2/2">On <phrase class="date" code="2002-03-28">28 March</phrase> the Government launched an action plan to reduce the risk of plant and animal disease entering the country illegally and threatening our agricultural and horticultural industries. A copy of the action plan can be found in the House Libraries. As recommended by the Policy Commission on Food and Farming, the action plan commits the Government to undertake a risk assessment of the threat posed by contaminated illegal meat imports. This is well under way and due to report in the autumn. The information provided by the risk assessment will help inform decisions about the nature of risks from imports so that resources can be efficiently targeted. Along side the risk assessment, work is being carried out to improve publicity and raise awareness of the risks posed by personal imports. Other work is concerned with improving detection and a pilot detector dog scheme will be operational later in the year.</p>
	<p pid=".479W.2/3">We attach great importance to veterinary surveillance for the early detection of new or exotic diseases/ infections, including foot and mouth disease. Work on a strategy to enhance veterinary surveillance was curtailed last year because of the foot and mouth epidemic. This work has resumed and a strategy document is now in early draft form and will be issued for public consultation later this year.</p>
	<p pid=".479W.2/4">In the event of a future outbreak of foot and mouth disease our ability to quickly contain and eradicate the disease will be vital. DEFRA has already published an interim operational contingency plan to support the European Union approved strategic plan, veterinary instructions and local plans that already existed. This draws extensively on experience of the 2001 outbreak and DEFRA will develop this further to achieve better emergency preparedness, taking full account of the recommendations of the independent inquiries.</p>
	<p pid=".479W.2/5">Additionally, preventive measures introduced during the 2001 outbreak remain in force, for example the ban on feeding pigswill to livestock and the 20 day standstill on the movement of livestock.</p>

	<p pid=".479W.5/2">The creation of a development box would be one way of giving effect to the important Declaration made at Doha last year that special and differential treatment for developing countries must be an integral part of all elements of the WTO agriculture negotiations. Current proposals for such a box contain several elements, including provision for developing countries to reduce tariffs more slowly, extension of the safeguard mechanism and maintaining the flexibilities agreed in the Uruguay Round. We will actively consider these ideas in the negotiations.</p>

	<p pid=".480W.2/3">We estimate that, in 2000, a notional UK family of four paid &pound;4-&pound;5 per week in higher food prices as a result of the CAP. UK taxpayers do not contribute specifically to the CAP; rather they contribute to the EU budget as a whole. Total EU payments in 2000 were approximately &pound;51 billion (euro 83 billion), of which around &pound;25 billion (euro 40.5 billion) was spent under the CAP. The UK currently provides around 13.5 per cent. of total budgetary contributions.</p>

	<p pid=".481W.8/1">Action under the national scrapie plan is being rolled out in full consultation with the sheep industry and other stakeholders. The first phase of the plan commenced in July 2001 with the launch of the genotyping scheme for purebred registered flocks. A second genotyping scheme for purebred non-registered flocks was launched in January 2002, extending the national scrapie plan to all purebred sheep flocks. At that time we also announced that any flock that had had scrapie, regardless of whether or not it was a purebred flock, could join the existing plan.</p>
	<p pid=".481W.8/2">We are currently working on proposals for a specific scheme under the national scrapie plan to cover flocks that have had scrapie. Informal but detailed discussions on these proposals have already taken place with stakeholder representatives and we expect to publish proposals for formal public consultation later this year. We continue to involve all sheep industry stakeholder organisations&mdash;including the breed societies, farming unions and the National Sheep Association&mdash;as well as other stakeholders in all stages of our consultations. This will remain the case for any further schemes under the national scrapie plan.</p>

Since January 2002 some 93,000 sheep have been tested under the plan. Of these 36 have died or have had to be destroyed following problems with the administration of the bolus.

	<p pid=".483W.0/2">Through its breeding schemes the national scrapie plan aims to increase genetic resistance to TSEs by increasing the prevalence of the ARR allele. At present participation in the plan is voluntary and it is only rams with the genotypes which are the most susceptible to TSEs (those carrying the VRQ allele) which must be culled or castrated by those farmers who choose to join. Other susceptible genotypes in participating flocks are to be phased out over time. It is clearly in the interest of sheep farmers to convert their flocks to a TSE-resistant basis as quickly as possible and it should be possible for the vast majority, if not all, of them to do so over a planned time scale. If there were any breeds where the existence of the ARR allele is absent or so low as to make this impossible, the Government would of course take that into account. We have initiated, as part of the national scrapie plan, a rare breeds survey to obtain better information on the distribution of genotypes in rare breeds.</p>

	<p pid=".485W.5/1">The Environment Agency has estimated that there may be some 300,000 hectares of land in the UK affected to some extent by industrial or natural contamination. However, much of this contamination will be relatively minor. It is not possible to estimate the value of this land because the total is not derived from an assessment of individual sites and value depends on site-specific factors such as land use or planning permissions.</p>
	<p pid=".485W.5/2">Under Part IIA (&quot;contaminated land&quot;) of the Environmental Protection Act 1990, local authorities are under a statutory duty to inspect their areas to identify contaminated land as defined in the Act. Broadly speaking, this is land which poses an unacceptable risk to human health or the environment in its current circumstances. This is an ongoing duty, which came into effect in April 2000 in England and more recently in Wales. It involves detailed risk assessments and determinations on a site-specific basis. The regime is described in DETR Circular 02/2000, &quot;Contaminated Land&quot;. The Environment Agency will include data in its periodic State of Contaminated Land reports, the first of which for England is due to be completed this summer. I will arrange for a copy to be placed in the Library.</p>

	<p pid=".487W.6/1">Whereas the closure of branches of the major clearing banks in rural areas can sometimes lead to inconvenience for those who cannot easily travel to the nearest town, there are more rural post offices than rural branches of all the banks combined. Post offices are therefore well placed to provide banking services, and access to banking in rural areas is improving as more banks turn to the Post Office to provide their customers with convenient access. The Government are strongly supporting the Post Office in its plans to help reduce financial exclusion through innovative banking schemes and has made clear that it is prepared to provide funding for 'universal banking' on the basis of a robust business case.</p>

	<p pid=".500W.3/1">The Benefit Fraud Inspectorate's (BFI) report on Allerdale borough council was published today and copies of the report have been placed in the Library.</p>
	<p pid=".500W.3/2">This follow up inspection report shows that since the first inspection in October 1999 the council had made substantial progress in most areas of administering benefits. However, further improvements were still needed in counter fraud and overpayment.</p>
	<p pid=".500W.3/3">Allerdale had been struggling to bring work backlogs under control but the second inspection found work had been reduced to manageable levels through close management and monitoring of the situation.</p>
	<p pid=".500W.3/4">A significant increase in the number of staff in housing benefit administration and the appointment of a senior fraud officer as well as a restructuring of the teams in line with BFI's first recommendations had brought about a major improvement.</p>
	<p pid=".500W.3/5">In the fraud team, the long-term absence of a fraud officer had adversely affected the quantity and quality of investigations. BFI noted that the management was addressing the problems during the on-site phase of the inspection.</p>
	<p pid=".500W.3/6">The first inspection had also recommended the appointment of an overpayment officer. The council had done this and taken other positive steps to managing overpayment better. The situation has improved but further improvements are necessary to, in particular, improve debt recovery.</p>
	<p pid=".500W.3/7">Progress since the first inspection had been positively supported by greater involvement of Members and senior management in housing benefit administration and counter fraud work.</p>
	<p pid=".500W.3/8">Allerdale administered some &pound;19 million in housing benefits in 2000&ndash;01.</p>
	<p pid=".500W.3/9">The report makes recommendations to help the council address weaknesses and to improve the administration of housing benefit and council tax benefit, as well as counter fraud activities.</p>
	<p pid=".500W.3/10">My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State is now considering the report and will be asking the council for its proposals in response to the findings and recommendations of the BFI.</p>

	<p pid=".508W.15/1">The potential role of light rail schemes in integrated transport strategies is summarised in paragraphs 107&ndash;08 of my Department's Guidance on Full Local Transport Plans, as follows:</p>
	<p pid=".508W.15/2" class="indent">&quot;107. Light rail, and similar rapid transit systems, can have an important role to play in delivering integrated transport in major conurbations. Experience from existing light rail schemes shows that they can be effective in providing a high quality public transport option in densely used transport corridors and in encouraging motorists to switch from their cars.</p>
	<p pid=".508W.15/3" class="indent">108. However the capital costs of light rail schemes are high, particularly compared to bus priority measures and modest guided bus schemes which may offer a more cost-effective alternative. Therefore if authorities with to develop light rail schemes, they will need to be able to demonstrate that they represent good value for money, form an essential part of a local integrated transport strategy and that the objectives of that strategy cannot be met in better ways. It will also be important to show that a light rail scheme is fully integrated with other public transport modes in the area and that appropriate traffic managements schemes are to be introduced so that light rail has priority over other road space users and that the road decongestion benefits of the light rail scheme are maintained over a long period. We would also expect local authorities to develop public-private partnerships to take forward such schemes where this is necessary to secure Best Value and to consider private finance arrangements under which the maximum degree of responsibility for constructing, managing and operating the project is taken on by the private sector.&quot;</p>

	<p pid=".510W.9/2">Agreements between Railtrack and other persons regarding new freight connections to Railtrack's network are subject to the approval or discretion of the rail regulator under section 17 or 18 of the Railways Act 1993. The rail regulator has issued directions to Railtrack under section 18 for 31, six and four new connection agreements with Railtrack in each of the last three calendar years. Any such connection is subject to the Railways Act 1993, Railway Group Standards, the Railways and Other Transport Systems (Approval of Works, Plant and Equipment) Regulation 1994, the Transport and Works Act 1992, and Part G of the Railtrack Track Access Conditions. Railtrack publishes guidance for anyone seeking to connect to its network in a publication entitled &quot;A Guide to Freight Connections&quot;. The latest edition was published in October 1998.

	<p pid=".515W.8/2">Restrictions on the use of red diesel and other 'rebated oils' are contained in the Hydrocarbon Oil Duties Act 1979, and published in Customs and Excise Public Notice 75 &quot;Fuel for Diesel Vehicles&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".515W.8/3">This legislation was not changed after the shortages in fuel supplies that occurred in September 2000, though for a brief period at the time motorists were permitted to use red diesel, provided that duty at the full, road fuel, rate was paid.</p>

	<p pid=".518W.5/3">In the early years and child care field, a number of survey series have been introduced since 1997. The topics covered include parents of three and four-year-old children and their use of early years services, parents' demand for child care, and the child care work force. The data collected include gender, age, ethnicity and disability, and analyses are published accordingly where sample sizes allow.</p>
	<p pid=".518W.5/4">Since 1997 the Department has developed and implemented a &quot;Pupil Level Annual Schools Census&quot; (PLASC) collecting far more detailed data than hitherto from maintained schools. Data were collected for all maintained school pupils for the first time in January 2002, and are being linked with their Key Stage and examination achievements as they occur. These data will allow far more detailed investigation of the impact of gender, ethnicity, special educational needs and other factors on the experiences and achievements of school pupils, and new analyses or series will be published from this source in due course.</p>
	<p pid=".518W.5/5">Since 1997 the Department has introduced several new statistical series on young people and adults embarking on Government supported training, their qualification achievements and subsequent destinations.

	<p pid=".525W.2/1">Parents have an important role to play in supporting their children's learning at home to improve their academic performance. At a general level, for example, parents can discuss the school day with their child so they can praise and encourage them for good results and help them through any academic or other problems they might have. Parents can provide support with homework set by the school where it is appropriate; indeed our national homework guidelines for schools, published in 1998, emphasise, among other things, that schools should ensure they work closely with parents and ensure that they are given guidance about how best to help their children. A survey my Department published this April found that 76 per cent. of parents believe helping their children with homework is extremely important.</p>
	<p pid=".525W.2/2">A great deal of work has been carried out by my Department to help parents become more involved, based on the strategy for involving parents which was first described in the 1997 White Paper &quot;Excellence in Schools&quot;. This strategy comprised three strands: providing information to parents, giving parents a more effective voice, and encouraging families to learn together. Resources which have been produced for parents as part of this strategy include the Parents' Centre website, the Learning Journey parents' guides to the curriculum, and the &quot;Parents + Schools&quot; magazine, as well as several hints and tips booklets produced as part of publicity campaigns including the National Year of Reading, Maths Year 2000, and the Dads and Sons campaign.</p>
	<p pid=".525W.2/3">Of course there are also many specific activities that parents can carry out: for younger children, reading with them and to them, playing number games or helping them with spellings; for older children, giving advice on how to organise their time, giving them support with using the internet, and encouraging children to engage in activities of general educational benefit, such as reading, and visiting museums and galleries. Underlying all these and many other activities is the idea that parents have a responsibility to show children that they believe in the value of education and learning, both for their own sake and as a means to achieving greater success in later life.</p>

	<p pid=".534W.5/1">Since July 2000, the British high commission has been running its sterling post account using the parallel rate of exchange, and charging for some of its consular and visa services using the parallel rate. It has held charges for other consular and visa services at the official rate. Initially, the two rates were broadly similar. But since February 2001, the parallel rate has diverged increasingly from the official rate, and the Zimbabwe dollar is now trading on the parallel market at around 10 times the official sterling rate of exchange. In financial year 2001&ndash;02, this resulted in an under-recovery by the FCO of around &pound;422,000 in consular fees.</p>

Under the present system it is for primary care trusts to plan and arrange the services available to people in their care, as they are closest to the people they serve and so best placed to respond sensitively to their needs.</p>

	<p pid=".554W.6/1">Violence against any member of staff working in the national health service is unacceptable. Significant action has been taken at both national and local levels to tackle the problem of violence as part of the cross-Government NHS zero tolerance zone campaign. This includes the issuing of new sentencing guidelines to magistrates courts, the publication of new guidelines on the withholding of treatment from violent and abusive patients and, for the first time ever, the allocation of central funding to support the large number of local initiatives being introduced to protect staff. A distance learning package developed specifically to support nurses in dealing with violence has also been issued jointly with the Royal College of Nursing.</p>
	<p pid=".554W.6/2">Information on the levels of violent incidents by individual staff group is not collected centrally, but may be held at a local level by NHS employers. The results of the 2000&ndash;01 survey of reported violent or abusive incidents, accidents involving staff and sickness absence in NHS trust and health authorities, in England, have been placed in the Library, along with a report setting out the Government's proposed action in the light of the findings.</p>
	<p pid=".554W.6/3">&quot;Delivering the NHS Plan&mdash;next steps on investment, next steps on reform&quot; included the commitment to ensure that all general practitioners have access to secure services for the treatment of violent patients, and the Government will be providing extra resources to primary care trusts to deal with violent patients.</p>
	<p pid=".554W.6/4">Officials have worked closely with the Royal College of Nursing, UNISON and other staff representative bodies on the development of each stage of the zero tolerance campaign, and will continue to do so.</p>

	<p pid=".555W.2/1">The Government recognise that education and the science base are important factors in maintaining the attractiveness of the UK as a location for the research and development (R&amp;D) pharmaceutical industry. Last year the Government published, jointly with the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry, a set of competitiveness and performance indicators which will be used to monitor trends in UK competitiveness as a location for the R&amp;D pharmaceutical industry. Baseline data collected show that in the late 1990s the number of graduates in medical sciences from UK universities was similar to that in Germany and rather greater than in other European countries. Data also show that the UK Government spends more on R&amp;D in health fields than does any other European Government.

Other EU member states are supporting the UK's initiative on this issue. In addition, the recent adoption of a harmonised definition of meat across Europe for food labelling purposes means meat products will declare and quantify their meat ingredients on a common basis, making it easier for consumers to compare products and make better informed choices.</p>

The purpose of this is to elicit their knowledge, attitudes and understanding of the immunisation programme. The information gained from this exercise is then used to inform our communications with health professionals and parents.</p>

	<p pid=".567W.5/2">The main Government agency for research into the causes of and treatments for disease is the Medical Research Council (MRC) which receives its funding via the Department of Trade and Industry. The Department funds research to support policy and the delivery of effective practice in the national health service.</p>
	<p pid=".567W.5/3">The Department and MRC spend for 2001&ndash;02 is estimated at &pound;2.2 million on research into multiple sclerosis. This includes spend on basic work on a whole range of autoimmune disease.</p>
	<p pid=".567W.5/4">We are not making funds available directly for increasing awareness of primary progressive multiple sclerosis. The Department and the drug manufacturers have, however, agreed on an innovative way to secure disease modifying therapies on behalf of multiple sclerosis (MS) patients. The scheme allows patients with MS meeting the criteria of the association of British neurologists to be treated cost-effectively on the NHS. The scheme started on <phrase class="date" code="2002-05-06">6 May 2002</phrase> and is backed by statutory directions to ensure there is no postcode prescribing of these treatments.</p>

We are now considering the next stage of work, which includes selecting and appointing an external reference group and developing further the communication and consultation strategy. We expect to publish the NSF in 2004 and to start implementation in 2005.</p>

	<p pid=".571W.0/2">At present the Department and its executive agencies have a normal staff retirement age of 60 and do not consider applications for employment from those over that age. However, the Department is now involved in a centrally led initiative, Winning the Generation Game, which will examine age-related issues such as flexible retirement beyond the normal retiring age of 60. The Department would expect that its non-departmental public bodies (NDPBs) would also wish to adopt any revised policy the Department itself adopted as a consequence of that initiative. The following policies on retirement age apply in the Department's NDPBs:</p>
	<p pid=".571W.0/3" class="indent">Commission for Health Improvement (CHI)</p>
	<p pid=".571W.0/4" class="indent">CHI does not set a particular retirement age for any of its employees. It would however anticipate that most staff would choose to retire by the age of 60 as this is the age at which they could retire without losing any pension benefits. CHI will consider applications for employment from people of any age and does not have a policy of not considering applicants over a certain age.</p>
	<p pid=".571W.0/5" class="indent">General Social Care Council (GSCC)</p>
	<p pid=".571W.0/6" class="indent">The retirement age for GSCC employees is 65 years of age for both men and women. The GSCC policy allows staff to continue to work beyond the usual retirement age following an annual review on retirement date. Decisions to continue employment are authorised by the chief executive or one of the directors. The GSCC currently has two staff employed over the age of 65, one male and one female. The GSCC has no upper age limit for the appointment of staff. All appointments are made on the assessment of the applicant's competence to undertake the job.</p>
	<p pid=".571W.0/7" class="indent">Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA)</p>
	<p pid=".571W.0/8" class="indent">The normal retirement age for HFEA employees is 60. The retention of any employee beyond that age is a matter for the chief executive's discretion. These principles also apply to the HFEA's recruitment policies.</p>
	<p pid=".571W.0/9" class="indent">National Biological Standards Board (NBSB)</p>
	<p pid=".571W.0/10" class="indent">The NBSB has a normal retirement age of 60. However, this is not a maximum retirement age. The board operates a policy whereby, in exceptional cases, staff may be asked to work beyond their normal retirement age. There is no policy of not considering applications for employment by persons over a particular age. The board's policy on retirement age is currently under review.</p>
	<p pid=".571W.0/11" class="indent">National Care Standards Commission (NCSC)</p>
	<p pid=".571W.0/12" class="indent">The normal age of retirement for the majority of employees at the NCSC is 65, although some staff who transferred from local authorities and health authorities carried forward existing contracts enabling them to work beyond 65 at the employer's discretion. The Commission does not put an age limit on its consideration of applications for employment.</p>
	<p pid=".571W.0/13" class="indent">National Radiological Protection Board (NRPB)</p>
	<p pid=".571W.0/14" class="indent">NRPB's normal retirement age is 60, but in the event of ill health, redundancy, limited efficiency or to remedy defects in the staffing structure an earlier retirement date may be effected. At present, NRPB employs people up to age 60.</p>
	<p pid=".571W.0/15" class="indent">Public Health Laboratory Service (PHLS)</p>
	<p pid=".571W.0/16" class="indent">While the policy of the PHLS does normally require staff to retire at age 65, the service has been flexible where necessary, consistent with both the wishes of the individual and the needs of the PHLS. The PHLS recognises, however, that it is becoming apparent that the significant shortfalls in various professional groups of employees will require a further review of its position to ensure that the service's professional standards are maintained. Although the service does not normally appoint new staff aged over 65, there is no PHLS policy of not considering applications from people over a particular age.</p>
