	<p pid="a.1439W.3/1">The Electoral Commission informs me that in April 2008, it introduced a three stage approach to handling potential breaches of the party and election finance laws. First, it conducts an initial assessment using set criteria to determine whether the matter should become casework. Second, the vast majority of matters that become casework are dealt with as 'case reviews'. Finally, a small number of cases, where the matter is more complex, or may involve the use of statutory powers, are dealt with as 'investigations'.</p>

Over that period, initial assessments were completed in an average of 11 days against a seven day target. The Commission has met the seven day target for matters assessed since July 2009. It also conducted 49 case reviews, which were completed in an average of 69 days against a target of 90 days. The Commission undertook two investigations, which averaged 386 days, against a target of completing 90 per cent. of investigations within 180 days.</p>

	<p pid="a.1440W.5/1">The Department for Culture, Media and Sport is indeed willing to consider the introduction of some flexibility on the period of notice required for a temporary event notice (TEN) under the Licensing Act 2003. We are currently developing a proposal, in discussion with a group of stakeholders, that would give the police discretion to validate a TEN for an event that they consider to be low-risk when that TEN was otherwise invalid because it was issued without the minimum notice. We hope to commence a three-month consultation on this proposal, along with other simplification proposals, before the end of the year.</p>
	<p pid="a.1440W.5/2">We do not hold figures on the number of voluntary organisations that did not submit TENs within the 10 day time limit. However, the consultation will include an impact assessment containing a broad estimate of the number of events that may be affected by the proposed change, and the estimated economic impact. The consultation will invite comment on these estimates.</p>

	<p pid="a.1449W.5/1">No such estimate has been made. For most cattle compulsorily slaughtered on TB control grounds, DEFRA has received a net payment from abattoirs rather than incurred a cost.</p>
	<p pid="a.1449W.5/2">Meat Hygiene Service officials inspect carcasses of such cattle when slaughtered in licensed abattoirs, a small proportion of TB affected cattle are condemned as unfit for human consumption e.g. if TB lesions are identified in more than one part of the carcase. In such cases DEFRA does makes a payment to the abattoir to cover its disposal costs. It is not possible to provide details of slaughter costs in the form requested: typically an abattoir will receive batches of cattle being slaughtered on disease control grounds rather than single animals&mdash;if one (or more) of these animals is condemned, the cost to DEFRA will be offset by the total salvage value received from those passed as fit for human consumption.</p>

	<p pid="a.1453W.5/1">DEFRA's progress in implementing the 12 recommendations in the Glover Report is:</p>
	<p pid="a.1453W.5/2">R1. By 2010, contract opportunities above &pound;20,000 across the whole public sector should be advertised electronically with standard indicative contract value ranges, and accessible through a single, free, easy to search online portal.</p>
	<p pid="a.1453W.5/3" class="indent">This is being implemented as part of the DEFRA's Integated Commercial Strategy and will go live in 2010.</p>
	<p pid="a.1453W.5/4">R2. Government should issue all tender documentation electronically by 2010 and this should be kept as brief as possible. Businesses should be permitted to tender electronically for all public sector contracts by 2010; no &quot;paper only&quot; tenders should be required after this date, with an ambition for all tenders to be electronic by 2012.</p>
	<p pid="a.1453W.5/5" class="indent">This too will be implemented as part of our Integrated Commercial Strategy We are planning to be fully compliant well in advance of the 2012 deadline.</p>
	<p pid="a.1453W.5/6">R3. Details of contract awardees should be published online in a standard format within 48 days of contract signature, accessible via the single portal by 2010.</p>
	<p pid="a.1453W.5/7" class="indent">DEFRA has dedicated procurement pages on its external website and will include information on contracts awarded. It is DEFRA's intention to provide this information through the cross Government online portal.</p>
	<p pid="a.1453W.5/8">R4. Tendering opportunities thought especially suitable for SMEs or consortia of SMEs should be flagged by the procurer during the advertising process. Government should provide strategic and detailed guidance for procuring authorities on assessing suitable contracts for flagging, based on risk, value and market maturity.</p>
	<p pid="a.1453W.5/9" class="indent">Tendering opportunities for Government contracts are governed by the principles of Managing Public Money and the public procurement directives. DEFRA very much welcomes the participation of SMEs either individually or collectively. It is a key element of our Integrated Commercial Strategy to maximise the diversity of our supplier base including SMEs or consortia thereof and the structuring of all procurements will be done in such a way as to encourage this. We will also be encouraging prime contractors to optimise the use of SMEs in their sub-contracting.</p>
	<p pid="a.1453W.5/10">R5. Qualification criteria that are not specific to a sector should be standardised and incorporated in all pre-qualification questionnaires so that businesses do not need to repeatedly submit the same core information in different formats.</p>
	<p pid="a.1453W.5/11" class="indent">DEFRA has included this as a requirement within the Integrated Commercial Strategy. Technical solutions for storing and disseminating supplier data and criteria are being considered as part of this process. It is expected that this will be fully in place by late autumn 2010.</p>
	<p pid="a.1453W.5/12">R6. Procurers should give businesses the opportunity to provide details of all previous relevant experience when bidding for contracts, not just public sector experience. This should be taken into account when selecting successful tenderers.</p>
	<p pid="a.1453W.5/13" class="indent">DEFRA has already introduced this within current tender processes.</p>
	<p pid="a.1453W.5/14">R7. Procurers should ensure that, where they rely on a particular accreditation scheme or standard as part of the process of prequalification or contract award, that they take a flexible approach. Businesses should be given the opportunity to provide evidence that they can meet the contract requirements by reference to other similar equivalent accreditations or standards they may already hold&mdash;especially where these have been recognised or required by other public sector procurers.</p>
	<p pid="a.1453W.5/15" class="indent">DEFRA has already introduced this within current tender processes.</p>
	<p pid="a.1453W.5/16">R8. Departments should use their Innovation Procurement Plans to set out how procurement aligns with their overall commercial strategy, encourages innovation and gives advanced notice of long-term procurement plans.</p>
	<p pid="a.1453W.5/17" class="indent">DEFRA is finalising an Innovation Procurement Plan and expect to be able to issue this as part of its Integrated Commercial Strategy. Innovation in procurement is itself one of the key objectives of developing this strategy.</p>
	<p pid="a.1453W.5/18">R9. Government should encourage wider use of outcome-based specifications across the public sector, as a means of driving innovation.</p>
	<p pid="a.1453W.5/19" class="indent">DEFRA has already introduced this within current tender processes.</p>
	<p pid="a.1453W.5/20">R10. Government should expect and enable prime contractors to make their subcontracting opportunities accessible through the single, online portal created in Recommendation 1.</p>
	<p pid="a.1453W.5/21" class="indent">DEFRA will be encouraging this as part of its Integrated Commercial Strategy.</p>
	<p pid="a.1453W.5/22">R11. Through contract management, Government should ensure that SMEs and other firms acting as sub-contractors obtain contract conditions, including promptness of payment terms that are no worse than those applicable to the prime contractor.</p>
	<p pid="a.1453W.5/23" class="indent">DEFRA already includes this requirement within all major contracts and is incorporating it into standard terms and conditions for all contracts.</p>
	<p pid="a.1453W.5/24">R12. The Committee recommends that all central Government Departments should report annually on the value of their contract spend with SMEs, creating a reliable single source of quantitative data which can be used to inform future policy decisions and evaluate the recommendations in this report.</p>

	<p pid="a.1462W.2/1">The European Commission's proposal for an 18-month extension to the derogation which allows the UK to operate its current pet movement controls also includes provisions for the control of other diseases, such as echinococcus multilocularis. The Government will need to conduct a risk assessment to assess UK exposure to the parasite if the requirement for Praziquantel tapeworm treatment is removed. Should the evidence justify it, this would form part of the case to retain current controls.</p>

	<p pid="a.1470W.0/2">This year is very challenging in resource terms, and success in Afghanistan must take priority. As much as the Regular forces, the Reserves must now focus available resources on supporting the ongoing campaign in Afghanistan, which means reducing activity levels elsewhere. These savings have been recommended by the Army and accepted by the Secretary of State. This is about putting today's operations first.</p>
	<p pid="a.1470W.0/3">The measures that have been the subject of recent parliamentary debate and media reporting are specific to this financial year and reflect the fact that we are rightly focusing resources on the main effort, Afghanistan. And that means also focusing on forces currently deployed and the next roulement. But we have not taken these decisions without understanding potential risks, and we are absolutely determined that any risks to deployments to Afghanistan in 2012 will not be allowed to materialise. The Prime Minister is clear that the mission to Afghanistan will have all the resources and backing it needs to succeed.</p>
	<p pid="a.1470W.0/4">We remain committed to ensuring that we have Reserve forces that meet the needs of Defence, today and tomorrow. Discussions about future training for the TA will be based on the requirement to preserve its ability to support regular forces on operations, and on ensuring that TA soldiers are properly equipped and trained.</p>
	<p pid="a.1470W.0/5">Those reserves deploying over the next year will of course continue to be paid for the training they do to prepare them for their deployment, as well as for the deployment itself. This training will vary for individuals, depending on the task they will be required to do and their current skill set. This pre-deployment training is not being cut back. It will continue to be validated at the Reserves Training and Mobilisation Centre at Chilwell, before individuals are mobilised to join a formed unit for an extended period of training ahead of operations. It cannot be said enough; no soldier will be allowed to deploy to Afghanistan without the necessary training and equipment, whatever their trade, whether regular or reserve.</p>

To further support this work, the Government have announced that they will extend the service declaration period from three to five years as soon as parliamentary time allows. I recently met armed forces families' representatives and I have written to invite MPs with service establishments in their constituencies to meet with me and give their views on improvements to service voting arrangements. At present, the legislation allows service voters to vote by post or by proxy: we are working with the MOD and the Electoral Commission to ensure that we have in place the most effective measures to support participation among service personnel.</p>

	<p pid="a.1481W.2/1">I regret that the information requested is not held centrally and could be obtained only by approaching 135 prisons separately which would be at disproportionate cost. Prison Service Order (PSO) 4460 (Prisoners' Pay) sets out a minimum unemployed rate of &pound;2.50 a week. The PSO has been placed in the House Library and can also be viewed at the following web address:</p>

	<p pid="a.1482W.2/1">Responses to the Youth Crime Action Plan consultation indicated that we should look broadly at how we can best incentivise local authorities to invest in alternatives to custody. The Youth Justice Board is, therefore, exploring options as to how we might do this, including the potential of devolving budgets for Court Ordered Secure Remands as set out in the Youth Crime Action Plan and the potential for devolving wider custody budgets. We recognise this is a complex issue and proper consideration needs to be given to the implications of any changes to the placement of vulnerable young people. That is why the Youth Justice Board is undertaking a full analysis before providing advice to ministers in due course.</p>

However, under EC coordinating regulations on social security for migrant workers and their families, which the UK has administered since it joined the European Economic Community in 1973, a European Economic Area (EEA) national working in one member state can claim family benefits (child tax credit together with child benefit) in that member state in respect of members of their family resident in other member states.</p>
	<p pid="a.1484W.2/4">All claims for family benefits are subject to a wide range of checks throughout the life of each claim. Where claims for family benefits are made under the EC Regulations on behalf of children living in another member state, HMRC carry out further checks to verify the information provided by the customer to prevent erroneous or fraudulent claims. These checks include requiring the relevant authorities in the member state where the worker's family resides to confirm the composition of the family and to find out whether there are any family benefits in payment in that other member state.</p>

	<p pid="a.1488W.2/1">Prior to April 2006, most primary dental services were provided under former General Dental Service (GDS) arrangements. These were demand led services where the pattern of dental expenditure was largely determined by where dentists chose to practice, and how much national health service work they chose to undertake.</p>
	<p pid="a.1488W.2/2">The NHS Information Centre for health and social care published the following report on <phrase class="date" code="2008-03-26">26 March 2008</phrase>: &quot;NHS Expenditure for General Dental Services and Personal Dental Services: England 1997-98&mdash;2005-06&quot;. This report has already been placed in the Library and is also available on the NHS Information Centre website at:</p>
	<p pid="a.1488W.2/3" class="indent"><a href="http://www.ic.nhs.uk/pubs/dentalexpendl997to2006">www.ic.nhs.uk/pubs/dentalexpendl997to2006</a></p>
	<p pid="a.1488W.2/4">The report includes information on primary dental care expenditure by parliamentary constituency, primary care trust (PCT) and strategic health authority (SHA) area for 1997-98 to 2005-06 in Tables A3 and B3 of Annex 3. Table A3 relates to 'gross' expenditure and table B3 relates to 'net' expenditure. 'Gross' expenditure refers to the full cost of the payments recorded; 'net' expenditure reflects the cost of these payments to the NHS after the deduction of income from NHS dental charges paid by patients.</p>
	<p pid="a.1488W.2/5">This information is based on the old contractual arrangements which were in place up to and including <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-31">31 March 2006</phrase>. Further notes to aid interpretation of the information are shown in the 'Contents and Notes' page of Annex 3. The data will not be directly comparable with data based on the new dental service framework introduced from <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-01">1 April 2006</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.1488W.2/6">The former GDS arrangements were replaced with effect from <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-01">1 April 2006</phrase>, when PCTs were given responsibility for planning and commissioning primary dental services and provided with local, devolved, dental budgets. The primary dental service funding allocations made to the North Yorkshire and York PCT, the aggregate allocations to all PCTs within the Yorkshire and the Humber SHA, and the aggregate allocations to the NHS in England, for each of the four years since PCTs assumed full responsibility for primary dental care services, are in the following table. These are net of income from dental charges paid by patients, which are retained locally by PCTs to supplement the resources available for dentistry. PCTs may also dedicate some of their other NHS resources to dentistry if they consider this an appropriate local priority. Allocations are not apportioned by individual constituencies or towns; PCTs determine the distribution of resources within their area on the basis of local needs and priorities. Actual expenditure levels are determined by the pattern and type of services commissioned by each PCT and are recorded in the notes to PCT accounts.</p>

	<p pid="a.1489W.5/1">There is no information held centrally on which we could base an estimate of the number of children who still receive dental screening examinations in school. The National Screening Committee advised that that there is no evidence to support universal screening for dental disease among children aged six to nine years. In the light of this expert advice, we have concentrated on targeted initiatives like the Brushing for Life scheme which provides for families with young children to receive toothpaste and brushes at child health clinics or Sure Start centres, together with advice on how the children can be seen by a dentist.</p>
	<p pid="a.1489W.5/2">Data published by the NHS Information Centre for health and social care showed that 7,643,000 children and young people aged under 18 were seen by a primary care national health service dentist in the 24-month period ending June 2009. This is equivalent to 69.5 per cent. of the population aged under 18.</p>

	<p pid="a.1490W.2/1">Providers of national health service dental services have contracts with primary care trusts (PCTs) that set out the agreed annual contract sum and the corresponding level of services to be provided over the course of the year. These annual service levels are expressed mainly in terms of 'units of dental activity', which measure courses of treatment according to their relative complexity. Dental providers who under-deliver by up to 4 per cent. may carry this forward and make up the activity in the following year. Where a provider has delivered less than 96 per cent. of the agreed annual service level, it is at the PCTs discretion whether the undelivered activity is carried forward to the following year or an appropriate proportion of the annual contract sum is refunded to the PCT. This is a matter for PCTs to decide locally in the light of individual circumstances, and their decisions are not collected or held centrally.</p>

	<p pid="a.1490W.5/2">Information on the normal weekly hours of dentists in the period since 1997 is set out in Table 19 of the NHS Information Centre (IC) for health and social care publication entitled &quot;Dental Working Hours England and Wales 2006-07 and 2007-08&quot;.

	<p pid="a.1490W.5/4">The IC's report records that a study in 2000 found that dentists worked an average of 39.4 hours; the IC's Dental Working Hours Analysis recorded averages of 36.6 hours in 2006-07 and 37.0 hours in 2007-08. There were differences in the coverage of the surveys.</p>
	<p pid="a.1490W.5/5">The 2000 survey does not give a complete split of weekly hours into NHS and private dental work and so a weekly NHS hours estimate is not available for the year 2000.</p>

	<p pid="a.1490W.5/7">The IC in its publication &quot;NHS Dental Statistics for England&quot;, a copy of which has already been placed in the Library, report that 20,815 dentists performed some NHS dental activity in 2006-07 in England and 21,343 dentists some dental activity in 2007-08. However, some of these dentists did not work for the whole year. So these figures cannot be used to produce estimates of total annual hours worked.</p>

As noted, the survey which collected data for 2006-07 and 2007-08 (a single questionnaire for the two years) in fact showed a small increase in the average hours worked for the NHS by dentists doing some NHS work from 26.1 hours in 2006-07 to 26.2 hours in 2007-08. We shall be writing to the DDRB to correct this error.</p>

	<p pid="a.1491W.5/1">The responsibility for providing healthcare, including specialist mental health care services, rests with primary care trusts (PCTs). The Department provides funding for PCTs to commission, or provide healthcare for their local populations from national health service or independent sector providers. We are not prescriptive about how individual PCTs spend their budgets and each PCT decides its own spending levels for specific healthcare treatments and services.</p>
	<p pid="a.1491W.5/2">Since 2001-02, total planned investment in adult mental health services has increased by 50 per cent. (&pound;2.0 billion), putting in place the extra services and staff needed to transform mental health services. Nine consecutive years of increased spending by the NHS on mental health services has provided more staff, and increasing numbers of people with a severe mental illness are receiving treatment from community teams outside of hospital settings.</p>
	<p pid="a.1491W.5/3">Our significant investment in the Improving Access to Psychological Therapies programme (IAPT), will see annual funding rising to &pound;173 million, 3,600 extra therapists trained and 900,000 more people treated by 2011. This investment in IAPT will help to add to the existing provision of psychological therapies, increase capacity, reduce waiting times and drive up quality standards.</p>

The Department plans to publish information in December on the number of households who have been helped through Homeowners Mortgage Support. Statistics from the Financial Services Authority show that more than 135,000 borrowers were benefiting from forbearance offered by their lender at the end of June 2009, an increase of 17 per cent. on the previous quarter.</p>

	<p pid="a.1511W.5/1">John Hills' report has made a significant contribution to the debate about the role of social housing. This Government have taken decisive action to address the challenges raised in John's report and the challenges raised by the current economic climate. We have committed to investing &pound;7.5 billion over two years to deliver up to 112,000 affordable homes and around 15,000 private homes, including &pound;340 million to support local authorities in delivering new council housing. I am also introducing a range of major reforms to the social and private rented sector. This includes the consultations I have recently published on a devolved system of responsibility and funding for council housing, a major review of the private rented sector and changes to social housing allocations to give people confidence that councils allocate housing in their area fairly, and the initiative I have launched to clamp-down on fraud in the social sector. In addition, I will be setting out further details of the Government's plans to support housing recovery and ensure people have access to decent homes later this year.</p>

	<p pid="a.1524W.0/1">The Higher Education Statistics Agency (HESA) publishes the 'Performance Indicators in Higher Education' which cover projected outcomes of full-time first degree starters.</p>
	<p pid="a.1524W.0/2">The following link shows the relevant part of the HESA website to access data since 2003:</p>
	<p pid="a.1524W.0/3" class="indent"><a href="http://www.hesa.ac.uk/index.php/content/category/2/32/l41/">http://www.hesa.ac.uk/index.php/content/category/2/32/l41/</a></p>
	<p pid="a.1524W.0/4">Table 5 covers projected outcomes of full-time first degree starters. The completion rate covers starters who are expected to gain a degree. However, the more frequently used rate is the non completion rate (projected to neither gain an award nor transfer to another institution) which accounts for starters who obtain another award, or transfer.</p>
	<p pid="a.1524W.0/5">The completion rate tables lag behind the widening participation indicators by one year due to the need for an extra year's data to determine which students are still in HE. Therefore, the most recent figures refer to the 2006/07 academic year. Projected outcomes for the 2007/08 academic year will be available in 2010.</p>
	<p pid="a.1524W.0/6">The UK is maintaining very good completion rates for first degrees with the latest statistics from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development showing that the UK ranks 3<sup>(rd)</sup> of the 27 countries reporting data in this area. This has been achieved and maintained during a period when higher education has been opened up to both increased numbers and a greater diversity of students.</p>

	<p pid="a.1534W.2/1">The figures in table 1 show the number of subject profiles added to the National DNA Database (NDNAD) by English and Welsh forces and the British Transport Police in each month between <phrase class="date" code="2009-07-09">9 July 2009</phrase> and <phrase class="date" code="2009-10-15">15 October 2009</phrase>, broken down by the police force which took the sample.</p>

	<p pid="a.1534W.2/3">The number of subject profiles held on the NDNAD is not the same as the number of individuals. A proportion of DNA profiles held on the NDNAD are replicates, that is, a profile for a person has been loaded on more then one occasion (this may be because the person gave different names, or different versions of their name, on separate arrests, or because of upgrading of profiles). It is currently estimated that 13.8 per cent. of subject profiles held on the NDNAD are replicates. The replication rate of 13.8 per cent. should only be applied over the entire database however, as the replication rate for individual police forces varies considerably. The presence of these replicate profiles on the NDNAD does not impact on the effectiveness and integrity of the database.</p>

	<p pid="a.1538W.2/1">The number and proportion of recorded crimes detected in which a DNA match was available in 2008-09 is shown in table 1. It is also important to note that the detections are achieved through integrated criminal investigation, not through DNA alone. The source of the figures provided is the Forensic performance data, which is collected from police forces by the Home Office.</p>
	<p pid="a.1538W.2/2">The figures for the number of crimes detected in which a DNA match was available only include crimes detected in which a DNA match was reported by the National DNA Database (NDNAD). They do not include DNA matches which arise through case work in serious crime, which usually involve comparing DNA profiles in a forensic laboratory, or DNA matches arising from one-off speculative searches of the NDNAD. Data on DNA matches from casework and speculative searches is not included in the police Forensic performance data.</p>
	<p pid="a.1538W.2/3">The presentation of crimes detected with DNA as a proportion of total recorded crime undervalues the relative contribution of DNA to the crime detection rate. It should be noted that the majority of recorded crimes do not have a crime scene (for example, minor assault, drugs offences, theft, fraud etc.) and do not have a crime scene examination. In 2008-09, just under 797,000 crimes had a crime scene examination (17 percent of recorded crimes). In those crimes which have a crime scene examination, some do not yield any forensic material (DNA or fingerprints). In 2008-09, potential DNA material was collected at 99,402 crimes; and of these, 39,795 crimes yielded DNA crime scene samples of sufficient quantity and quality for profiling and loading to the NDNAD. Of the 39,795 crimes in which a crime scene sample profile was loaded, a match was generated in 36,727 crimes.</p>
	<p pid="a.1538W.2/4">The proportion of 'crimes detected in which a DNA match was available', of those, 'crimes where potential DNA material was collected' is shown in table 2.</p>

The Home Office also needs to take into account the needs of other security agencies, affordability within the total funding available, and how to secure value for money. Funding will be kept under constant review to reflect the overall Olympic security requirement, including the needs of Dorset.</p>

	<p pid="a.1546W.5/1">The Government are very clear that the use of blocking to prevent access to these images is something that internet service providers should do, and are pleased with the support from providers, which has led to 98.6 per cent. of UK consumer broadband lines being covered by blocking of sites identified by the Internet Watch Foundation as containing such illegal images. The Government recognise the work of the internet industry in reaching this figure.</p>
	<p pid="a.1546W.5/2">It remains our hope that the target of 100 per cent. of consumer-facing ISPs operating a blocking list will be achieved on a voluntary basis and we keep progress on the 100 per cent. target under review.</p>

	<p pid="a.1558W.14/1">We are currently appraising the 51 applications we have received for the &pound;200 million of capital funding we have secured as an interim measure to support authorities which forecast exceptional growth in demand for primary school places by 2011. In considering these applications, we have had discussions with a range of local authorities and with representative bodies including London councils and the Local Government Association, to consider the criteria we have used. Our aim is to ensure that this funding is fairly allocated to those authorities with the highest need, where funding the additional places from other resources would unduly impact on other priorities. We aim shortly to announce allocations. We are also, in the context of the next spending review, working on how to ensure that in the longer term there are high quality permanent pupil places where they are wanted.</p>

	<p pid="a.1560W.0/11">The revenue per pupil figures shown in the following table are taken from the new Dedicated Schools Grant (DSG). They are not comparable with those for the years 2004-05 to 2005-06 because the introduction of the DSG in 2006-07 fundamentally changed how local authorities are funded.</p>
	<p pid="a.1560W.0/12">The 2004-05 to 2005-06 figures are based on education formula spending (EFS) which formed the education part of the local government finance settlement, plus various grants. This was an assessment of what local authorities needed to fund education rather than what they spent. The DSG, which has been in place since 2006-07 is based largely on an authority's previous spending. In addition, the DSG has a different coverage to EFS. EFS comprised a schools block and an LEA block (to cover</p>
	<p pid="a.1560W.0/13">LEA central functions) whereas DSG only covers the school block. LEA block items are still funded through DCLG's local government finance settlement but education items cannot be separately identified. Consequently, there is a break in the Department's time series as the two sets of data are not comparable.</p>
	<p pid="a.1560W.0/14">To provide a comparison for 2006-07 DSG, the Department have isolated the schools block equivalent funding in 2005-06; as described above this does not represent the totality of 'education' funding in that year.</p>

	<p pid="a.1562W.2/1">The information provided in the answer of <phrase class="date" code="2009-06-02">2 June 2009</phrase> was based on a review of the department's field forces, providing support and challenge to LAs, conducted in autumn 2008. Comparable information is not available for other years since this was a one-off exercise and no equivalent exercise had been conducted in previous years. Information about the numbers and costs of all field forces has not been routinely recorded centrally for each year since 1997. To collect this information retrospectively would exceed the cost threshold of &pound;750 applicable to central Government.</p>

	<p pid="a.1562W.5/1">The Specialist Schools and Academies Trust (SSAT) is an independent registered charity which receives income from a range of sources.
