	<p pid="a.443W.3/2">These losses are not expected to have a major impact on the work of non-government organisations (NGOs) in Afghanistan. Overall, the Afghanistan NGO Safety Office (ANSO) reports that NGO security incidents are declining. There has been a 17% reduction in attacks on NGOs by armed opposition groups this quarter compared to the same quarter last year, while criminal incidents have fallen by 43% over the same period. However, the accessibility of some districts for national and international staff has declined.</p>
	<p pid="a.443W.3/3">All NGOs working in Afghanistan liaise with the ANSO. Staff at the British embassy in Kabul are in regular contact with the ANSO and share relevant security information with them. The UK Government supports the work of ANSO through its contributions to the Humanitarian Aid Department of the European Commission (ECHO).</p>

	<p pid="a.445W.5/1">As part of a joint assistance strategy to Kenya, the Department for International Development (DFID), along with 16 other donors, has agreed to a division of labour to improve aid effectiveness. As a result, DFID is not planning to provide agricultural development assistance directly. DFID is, however, engaged in many related areas, such as food security, livestock insurance and pastoralist development. An example is the Hunger Safety Net Programme (&#163;84 million 2007-2017), piloting innovative and secure ways of delivering cash to support 300,000 poor people by 2012. The small amounts of cash will allow people to buy food and diversify their livelihoods. Other support is planned for index-based livestock insurance, a drought management fund, 50,000 micro enterprises, and local community adaptation programmes.</p>

	<p pid="a.446W.0/1">The Department for International Development (DFID) has conducted a study on the economic impacts of climate change in Kenya, looking at a range of important sectors for the Kenyan economy, including agriculture and water. In some areas agricultural production is likely to improve through better rainfall and potential for irrigation. However, the overall impacts are likely to be negative, through increased occurrence of drought, flooding and changing patterns of land use.</p>

	<p pid="a.446W.3/1">The Department for International Development (DFID) has contributed &#163;37.5 million to the African Enterprise Challenge Fund (AECF), which awards grants or loans for private sector projects in agri-business and financial sectors in rural Africa. A specific part of this fund, the Renewable Energy and Climate Technology Fund (REACT), aims specifically at supporting businesses that promote emissions mitigation and climate adaptation in East Africa. Further, DFID's Research and Evidence Division funds a number of research programmes supporting climate adaptation in Kenya, including pest management, and creating demand for new crop varieties and improved fertiliser blends. As part of the current review of all UK bilateral aid programmes, we are considering further what assistance we may be able to give Kenyan farmers to adapt to climate change in future.</p>

	<p pid="a.446W.6/1">The food security situation in Kenya has improved since last year's drought, following favourable rains in late 2009 and 2010. The Kenya Food Security Steering Group (KFSSG) reports that 1.2 million rural poor in the arid and semi-arid lands require assistance (down from 3.8 million in 2009). There is a risk that food security next year will deteriorate in eastern and south-eastern parts of the country due to uneven rains in March to June 2010 and predicted below-average rains in 2011 due to the impact of La Nina. Short-term food security has also improved among urban households, due in part to downward pressure on food prices, but the KFSSG still estimates that 3.5 million people in urban centres are food insecure.</p>

	<p pid="a.454W.8/1">As at <phrase class="date" code="2010-03-31">31 March 2010</phrase>, the Department's annual accounts gave the value of the Ministry of Defence (MOD) owned estate as some &#163;15 billion. However these values represent replacement and not open market value.</p>
	<p pid="a.454W.8/2">As announced in October, the sale of assets such as the Defence Support Group, the Marchwood Sea Mounting Centre and the Defence stake in the telecommunications spectrum should generate in excess of &#163;500 million over the spending review period.</p>

	<p pid="a.459W.3/1">The spending review announced the biggest changes to our welfare system for a generation. It means we will be able to take action to get spending under control, cut the deficit, reform the system to make work pay and end the cycles of benefit dependency that exist in too many communities around the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.459W.3/2">The universal credit will simplify the benefits system by moving from the current multitude of benefits to one streamlined payment. Benefit will be withdrawn at one unified rate, making it easy for people to see that it is always worth going to work, and exactly how much of their income they will keep. This will reduce risks for people by smoothing transitions into and out of work which is particularly important for people in short-term or low-paid work. Details of the credit, which we hope to introduce from 2013, will be set out in a White Paper to be published shortly.</p>
	<p pid="a.459W.3/3">We are also introducing the new Work Programme a multi-billion pound investment to support people into work. We will replace the ineffective and wasteful employment programmes of the past with a unified structure which treats people as individuals and is delivered by private and voluntary sector organisations, paid for by long-term results. Providers will only be paid for securing sustainable work, rather than a short-term or temporary job entry that might lead to returning to and cycling on and off benefit.</p>

The majority of pensioners in the lowest decile appear from the data collected in the Family Resources Survey to have an entitlement to pension credit but have not made a claim.

In these circumstances the pensioner's income is assessed independently of the wider household to establish entitlement to pension credit.</p>

	<p pid="a.466W.2/1">The information is not available in the form requested. Estimates of Exchequer costs in relation to all unemployed people would require information on the earnings and other circumstances of those people if they were not unemployed, which are unknown.</p>
	<p pid="a.466W.2/2">The Department does make estimates of the typical Exchequer impact associated with individuals who move from jobseeker's allowance (JSA) into work. Our current estimate for the net Exchequer savings from someone who would have claimed JSA instead of being in employment for a full year is &#163;7,800, taking into account changes in benefit and tax credit entitlements, and changes in tax and national insurance payments. This is based on specific assumptions<sup>(1)</sup>, and in practice the net effect will vary widely depending on individual circumstances.</p>
	<p pid="a.466W.2/3">The average length of JSA claim is less than a year (more than half of new JSA claimants leave benefit within three months and around three-quarters within six months) so the actual savings generated by an average jobseeker moving into employment will be less than this estimate. For this reason, the total Exchequer saving from all movements from JSA to employment could not be extrapolated from this estimate.</p>

	<p pid="a.466W.2/6" class="indent">The estimate assumes that the individual earns &#163;12,200 pa (gross) in work, and is based on the estimated demographic profile of those leaving JSA.</p>

	<p pid="a.468W.2/17">These figures are a snapshot of the latest position and hide the dynamism of a labour market in which most people who experience unemployment leave quickly. Currently over half of new claimants to jobseeker's allowance leave within three months, around three quarters leave within six months and around 90% leave within a year.</p>
	<p pid="a.468W.2/18">However, to strengthen the support available for people to return to work, we are aiming to introduce the Work Programme from next summer. The Work Programme, will be a flexible, personalised programme built around the needs of individuals, providing the employment support customers need when they need it. It will contribute to the Government's key aims of fighting poverty, supporting the most vulnerable and helping people to break the cycle of benefit dependency.</p>
	<p pid="a.468W.2/19">Ahead of the implementation of the Work Programme, the Government will ensure that support will be in place with a more personalised service for claimants of all working age benefits from April 2011. Jobcentre Plus will have more flexibility to judge which interventions, from a menu of options, will help individual claimants most cost-effectively and which will meet local labour market needs.</p>

	<p pid="a.488W.8/2">Pursuant to the answers provided on <phrase class="date" code="2010-11-03">3 November 2010</phrase> the Department has national level information on market rents for privately-owned properties from the English Housing Survey from 2008-09 onwards and the Survey of English Housing prior to 2008-09. The most recent national level estimates were published on <phrase class="date" code="2010-10-27">27 October 2010</phrase> in the English Housing Survey Household Report 2008-09 which is available from:</p>

	<p pid="a.488W.8/4">Regional level results are based on a two year average due to sample size issues. The most recent regional level estimates are an average for 2006-07 and 2007-08, available from:</p>

	<p pid="a.488W.8/6">Updated regional rent estimates will be available when the 2009-10 data are published in 2011.</p>
	<p pid="a.488W.8/7">Information on median rents for broad rental market areas, used to determine local housing allowance rates, is published by the Valuation Office Agency and is available from:</p>

	<p pid="a.488W.8/9">Estimating market rents of social rented properties is not straightforward and different approaches can be taken. One example is in research carried out by Professor Steve Wilcox for DCLG where an assessment of regional social rents in comparison to market levels is made in terms of the capital value of the property, rental yield and housing association management and maintenance costs.</p>

	<p pid="a.488W.8/11">As I set out in my written ministerial statement on <phrase class="date" code="2010-12-09">9 December 2010</phrase>, <phrase class="offrep" id="wms/2010-12-09.31"><i> Official Report</i>, column 31-34WS</phrase>, our new delivery model for affordable housing will allow housing associations to set rents of up to 80% of market rent on some properties. A housing association's calculation of the market rent would need to be based on a residential lettings estimate for a property of the appropriate size, condition and area. Valuations should be in accordance with a RICS recognised method. The Homes and Communities Agency will publish a full framework document early next year that will form the basis for bids from providers who are interested in offering affordable rent.</p>
	<p pid="a.488W.8/12">With regard to the question answered on <phrase class="date" code="2010-11-11">11 November</phrase> relating to estimate made of the total number of new homes to be built in each year of the next six years. We do not provide estimates of future new build numbers, as forecasting is imprecise and could affect market sentiment. However, there are various private sector organisations who can, and do, use our statistics to make their own forecasts.</p>
	<p pid="a.488W.8/13">Ultimately, the number of new homes that are built will depend upon market conditions and decisions that are taken at the local level. This Government are rebalancing power from central Government to local authorities and local people, replacing top down targets with fiscal incentives for local authorities to develop housing. We are also seeking to remove unnecessary regulation on the house building industry.</p>

Taking into account all of these factors the Lord Chancellor decides on the appropriate level of interest paid on funds held in court.

	<p pid="a.501W.2/2">The LPA forms were designed to be completed without the automatic need for professional advice. However, some applicants' circumstances may be such that they wish to take advice from a solicitor or other professional. Such private client work can be undertaken for a fixed fee or may be charged on the basis of actual time spent depending on how the firm involved chooses to charge for the work involved. As a result, the cost of using a solicitor can vary greatly and the Ministry of Justice has not made any estimate of average costs charged for this type of work.</p>
	<p pid="a.501W.2/3">Under the MCA, LPAs are registered with the Office of the Public Guardian rather than the Court of Protection. In certain limited cases, where there are issues with the registration of an LPA, or objections are made by certain parties, an application may need to be made to the Court of Protection for determination of that matter before the OPG can register.</p>
	<p pid="a.501W.2/4">Figures on the average time taken by the OPG to process an application in the current financial year are outlined in the following table. The timescales include a statutory six week waiting period during which objections to registration can be made.</p>

	<p pid="a.508W.5/1">Guidance on sentencing is provided by the Sentencing Council independently of Government. A sentencing guideline 'Over-arching Principles for Sentencing of Youths' was published on <phrase class="date" code="2009-11-20">20 November 2009</phrase> by the Sentencing Guidelines Council, the predecessor of the Sentencing Council.</p>
	<p pid="a.508W.5/2">The Government set out in legislation the sentencing framework and principles for sentencers to follow. Sentencers are required to have regard to the principal aim of youth justice, which is the prevention of offending by children and young people and to have regard to their welfare when sentencing any person aged under 18 years.</p>
	<p pid="a.508W.5/3">Most first time young offenders will receive an out of court disposal, if the offence is not serious. These can include restorative or reparative conditions.</p>
	<p pid="a.508W.5/4">Under the sentencing framework courts are required to impose a referral order for persons aged under 18 years who are appearing in court for the first time and plead guilty. The referral order is based on restorative justice principles and must include reparative and rehabilitative elements.</p>
	<p pid="a.508W.5/5">Repeat offenders may receive a youth rehabilitation order which has a range of both punitive and rehabilitative requirements that may be attached to the order as the court sees fit.</p>
	<p pid="a.508W.5/6">Custody is available for the most serious and violent offenders from whom the public must be protected. Custody is also available for persistent offenders where their offending is considered to be serious enough to warrant custody.</p>

Local authorities are funded for this work though the Revenue support grant. There is therefore no need, nor provision, to enable a local authority to recover any costs incurred in processing such an application. In the case of an application for a public path order there is provision for the local authority to recover some costs, as the applicant usually gains some benefit from the stopping up or diversion of a way.</p>

	<p pid="a.534W.3/2">The Director of the Government Communication Headquarters (GCHQ) recently estimated that over 20,000 malicious emails are detected on Government networks each month, 1,000 of which are deliberately targeting them. It would not be in the interests of UK national security to go into greater detail since such disclosure could assist attackers in undermining the integrity and security of departmental systems and thereby increase their exposure to potential threats.</p>
	<p pid="a.534W.3/3">Departments are required to have technical controls in place to protect their ICT systems from cyber threats. GCHQ, through its information assurance arm, CESG, and its Computer Emergency Response Team, GovCertUK, provides Government Departments with guidance on how to protect themselves against, detect, and mitigate various types of cyber attack, and acts as a single point for reporting Government network security incidents.</p>

We have considered the option of issuing a UK passport for periods of less than 10 years in response to correspondence and other enquiries generally by or on behalf of senior citizens.

	<p pid="a.552W.11/5" class="indent">Heroin (diamorphine) and morphine are counted together because the former breaks down in the body into morphine and, consequently the latter may be the substance detected at post mortem and recorded on the death certificate.</p>

	<p pid="a.567W.5/14">Note that it is possible in some circumstances for estimates of participation in some LAs to reach, and even exceed, 100%. This is because the numerator (participation in education) and denominator (population) come from different data sources. For the most part the participation and population data are consistent and young people are assigned to the LA in which they are resident. An exception is participation in independent schools, where learner residence data are not collated nationally. An assumption is made that young people participating in independent schools live in the LA that the school is located. This will tend to inflate participation estimates for LAs with both an untypically high number of independent schools and where cross border flows of independent school pupils between LAs are common.</p>
	<p pid="a.567W.5/15">The city of Bristol is one such LA, with 16% of academic age 16-year-olds participating through independent schools compared to 6% nationally.</p>

	<p pid="a.570W.8/2">No research evidence is available on which to base such estimates for either school staff or pupils.</p>
	<p pid="a.570W.8/3">However, deaths from the cancer, mesothelioma, which is the main and most serious of the asbestos related diseases, can be regarded as an indicator of risk from exposure to asbestos. There is strong evidence that this disease is usually a consequence of heavy past occupational exposure to airborne asbestos fibres, although sometimes it is linked to exposure in a domestic setting. There is no evidence to say whether or not any of the remaining cases where there is no recognised cause may have been due to exposures in schools at a time when asbestos was in widespread use as a building material.</p>
	<p pid="a.570W.8/4">The Health and Safety Executive (HSE) tracks all deaths in Great Britain where mesothelioma has been recorded as a cause. HSE's periodical analyses of these deaths by occupation show that mesothelioma does occur among those whose last occupation is recorded as a teacher. The most recently available analyses by occupational group are for deaths during 2002-05. Among those aged 16 to 74-the ages for which occupation is reliably coded-there were 53 male deaths and 23 female deaths among those whose last occupation was recorded as a teacher. In statistical terms these numbers are broadly in line with the average for all occupations. Teachers do not stand out as a higher risk group.</p>
	<p pid="a.570W.8/5">Of those deaths involving teachers it is not possible to say whether any are a result of asbestos exposure during the course of their work in schools as it can take decades for the disease to develop after exposure and the cause may lie in other jobs earlier in life or in non-occupational activities.</p>
	<p pid="a.570W.8/6">A recent, detailed, independent epidemiological study of mesothelioma in Britain conducted by Professor Julian Peto supports the conclusion that teachers are not a higher risk group. This study showed that the risk for those who had carried out at least five years work as a teacher or school worker, and had never worked in jobs classified as higher risk, was statistically no different from that for individuals who had only ever done office work.</p>

This includes all of the many schools that Ministers in the Department for Education have visited since May 2010. These visits will have been for a range of purposes: to see examples of good practice; to meet and talk to students and staff; and to witness schools in action at first hand. The purpose of these visits is quite categorically not to make assessments of these institutions; that is the role of Ofsted.</p>

In particular, he was impressed with the way the schools were making maximum use of the freedoms afforded to them by their academy status to improve provision for their pupils, both within their sport specialism and across the whole curriculum.</p>

	<p pid="a.575W.3/2">The Schools White Paper 2010, 'The Importance of Teaching', confirmed the importance the Government place on making the study of the three separate science subjects at GCSE accessible to all pupils. This includes exploring how schools delivering triple science might be recognised in the performance tables; the need to increase the number of specialist science teachers, for example, by providing financial incentives to attract the best graduates in shortage subjects such as the sciences into teaching; and improving the skills of existing science teachers. The level of support the Government will provide to enable wider participation in the three separate sciences at GCSE level is still subject to the more detailed outcome of the spending review and we will announce our plans as soon as that is finalised.</p>

	<p pid="a.582W.0/1">The Department for Culture, Media and Sport is in close discussions with the Department for Education about competitive sport in schools and we are working to ensure this fits with the new Government approach to school sports, that being to give schools more autonomy and reducing centrally determined objectives.</p>
	<p pid="a.582W.0/2">As part of this objective we are introducing a new School Sport Competition in 2011 which should see levels of competition increase, but most importantly the competition should appeal to a wide range of young people of different tastes and abilities.</p>
	<p pid="a.582W.0/3">Sport England's mass participation legacy plan Places People Play will bring the sporting legacy to life in communities across the country to deliver a sustainable increase in adult participation for the games and beyond by improving local sports facilities and by getting more people involved in grassroots sporting activities and in Olympic and Paralympic sports.</p>
	<p pid="a.582W.0/4">For example, as part of the Places People Play programme, Sportivate, which will be launched in April 2011 and run until March 2015, is designed to capture the excitement of London 2012 and provide attractive sporting opportunities for young people aged between 14 and 25. Those involved will be given six weeks coaching at a local venue and provided with guidance on places and people they can continue to compete with.</p>

	<p pid="a.584W.0/3">We are establishing a new framework with increased responsibility on universities to widen participation. We are also introducing the National Scholarship Programme which will form part of a package of measures to support disadvantaged young people through their education, including the introduction of the &#163;2.5 billion pupil premium in April 2011 that will help to encourage young people from disadvantaged backgrounds to apply to higher education.</p>
	<p pid="a.584W.0/4">Universities, schools and colleges have learned much from Aimhigher about what works, and activities to help young people find out about higher education are a normal part of what schools do. Higher education institutions will build on this knowledge and continue to deliver a range of outreach activities including those in their existing access agreements, agreed with the Office for Fair Access, and their widening participation strategic assessments. Within this context, the Aimhigher programme will cease at the end of this academic year (July 2011).</p>

	<p pid="a.586W.5/1">The Government are committed to increasing the number of apprenticeship places for all suitably qualified people, regardless of ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, disability or religious beliefs. In the spending review, we announced that we will increase investment in adult apprenticeships by up to &#163;250 million during this Parliament. There will be investment of &#163;605 million in 2011-12 and an indicative budget of &#163;648 million in 2012-13. By the 2014-15 financial year, we will have in place sufficient funding for 75,000 more adult apprenticeship places than the previous Government were providing.</p>
	<p pid="a.586W.5/2">Men and women are evenly balanced in terms of numbers on the apprenticeships programme, but we know there is gender segregation across some sectors, with women under-represented in higher paid sectors such as construction and engineering. This broadly reflects the gender divide in the workplace, but it is an area we are keen to address.</p>
	<p pid="a.586W.5/3">Good quality information, advice and guidance are critical to helping everyone make informed choices. It is important that this information is presented in a non-biased and non-stereotypical manner. That is why we are also introducing an enhanced information, advice and guidance service for adults, offering high quality personalised information about a range of training and support.</p>
	<p pid="a.586W.5/4">Increasing the number, quality and background of people applying for apprenticeships is a priority for National Apprenticeships Service. The NAS is working with careers guidance agencies, local authorities, Job Centre Plus and other key partners to develop resources on apprenticeships to encourage people to think about apprenticeships in a non-stereotypical way. NAS also works with employers to help them understand and be more responsive to the needs of atypical and under-represented groups, for example women in construction and engineering.</p>
	<p pid="a.586W.5/5">The 'Diversity in Apprenticeships' pilots, which are due to commence delivery early in 2011, will test out new approaches to addressing under-representation and inequality in apprenticeships by creating a mutually supportive 'critical mass' of learners in non-traditional occupations. Seven of these pilots are focusing on the issue of under representation of females in male dominated sectors.</p>

	<p pid="a.592W.8/1">The completion rate in 2008/09, for all learners participating in Government-funded further education was 80.6%. Information is not collected centrally for learners in further education who entered the UK under the student visa programme.</p>
	<p pid="a.592W.8/2">Government-funded learning as recorded on the individualised learner record (ILR) is restricted to home learners. Therefore learners who are non-EEA (European economic area) nationals must have been resident in the UK for the three years preceding their course start date and the main purpose for residence was not to receive full-time education during any part of that three-year period. There are a limited number of exceptions to this, for example-refugees, learners with indefinite leave to remain status, or learners studying under reciprocal exchange agreements.</p>

	<p pid="a.594W.2/1">The information requested is shown in the table. These figures relate to pupils who were in receipt of free school meals (FSM). It is known that not all pupils who are eligible for FSM claim them. Such pupils would be excluded from the figures. These figures have been estimated using matched data from the National Pupil Database and the Higher Education Statistics Agency Student Record. These rounded estimates allow for a small margin of error that arises as result of the matching procedure deployed.</p>

	<p pid="a.602W.5/2">The principal allocations from the Science and Society budget to increase the number of women participating in science, technology, engineering and mathematics support the UK Resource Centre for Women in Science, Engineering and Technology (UKRC) and Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics Network (STEMNET).</p>
	<p pid="a.602W.5/3">In April 2008 the Tavistock Institute published an evaluation of UKRC on behalf of the then Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills. The recent National Audit Office report, 'Educating the Next Generation of Scientists', showed that the STEMNET Ambassador scheme is associated with a statistically significant improvement in take-up and achievement in science and mathematics.</p>
	<p pid="a.602W.5/4">STEMNET's remit is to enthuse young people to study STEM, and across the population this would mean significant numbers of extra girls taking up these subjects. STEMNET seeks to ensure that it targets all equality groups through the diversity of its STEM Ambassador profile, and interaction with less engaged and hard-to-reach schools.</p>
	<p pid="a.602W.5/5">Both programmes are routinely reviewed against their agreed objectives on a quarterly basis.</p>

	<p pid="a.603W.5/1">The Government fully recognise the importance of science and engineering advice to the delivery of its policies and the important role that Scientific Advisory Committees (SACs), and the independent advisers that sit on them, play in ensuring that the best advice is available.</p>
	<p pid="a.603W.5/2">The Public Bodies Reform process was undertaken to ensure that central Government is not carrying out functions which are no longer needed, to consider where there is duplication of effort and where lines of accountability for decisions which should be taken by Ministers needs to be strengthened.</p>
	<p pid="a.603W.5/3">Scientific advisory non-departmental public bodies (NDPBs) were included in the process along with all the other bodies. Reforming the way Government obtain scientific and technical advice, through using committees of experts in some cases, will reinforce transparency and accountability and provide for stronger co-ordination, while allowing Government to have continued access to independent, authoritative and cost-effective advice to support its policies.</p>
	<p pid="a.603W.5/4">The changes proposed to specific SACs were decisions for the Department to which that SAC reports and were considered on a case-by-case basis.</p>
	<p pid="a.603W.5/5">The guidance to Departments in implementing the changes is clear that SACs, whether being retained as NDPBs or being reconstituted, should continue to operate in line with the Principles of Scientific Advice to Government and the Code of Practice for Scientific Advisory Committees. These set out clearly the importance of such committees operating independently and transparently. The changes of themselves should not have an impact on the responsibilities of the chairs of SACs.</p>

After the end of each tax year, Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs (HMRC) notifies the Student Loans Company (SLC) of loan deductions made by employers in the previous tax year. Due to this time lag, it is possible for people to over-repay. However, all overpayments are refunded with interest.</p>
	<p pid="a.604W.8/3">Since December 2009, in order to reduce the number of those who over-repay, borrowers nearing the end of their loan repayment term are notified by the SLC that they may opt out of the PAYE system, and complete their loan repayments by direct debit. Additionally, borrowers are advised to monitor their own repayments so they can calculate when they are likely to repay their loan in full.</p>

	<p pid="a.605W.9/1">Any food obtained from cloned animals is regulated as a &quot;novel food&quot; under Regulation (EC) No 258/97<sup>(1)</sup>. According to this regulation, novel foods may not be marketed in the European Union without an authorisation. Applications for authorisation of novel foods are evaluated by national authorities against criteria of safety, nutritional quality and not misleading the consumer. The Food Standards Agency (FSA) is the competent authority for novel foods in the United Kingdom and advises that food obtained from the offspring of cloned animals also falls within the scope of Regulation (EC) 258/97. However, the legislation could also be interpreted to apply only to food from cloned animals themselves. The FSA is seeking views of interested parties on a change to its advice on the application of this regulation to the offspring of cloned cattle and pigs.</p>
	<p pid="a.605W.9/2">In October 2010 the European Commission published a report on animal cloning which recommended a temporary ban on the marketing of products obtained from cloned animals. The Government's view is that such a ban would be disproportionate in terms of food safety and animal welfare and insufficient evidence has been provided to justify it. Any proposal should be supported by an impact assessment that demonstrates the need for and benefit of new regulation. The Commission's report does not identify the need for any future controls on food from the offspring of cloned animals, which is in line with the Government's view.</p>
	<p pid="a.605W.9/3">The Board of the FSA discussed animal cloning at its open meeting on <phrase class="date" code="2010-12-07">7 December</phrase> and has subsequently advised Ministers that the marketing of products obtained from cloned animals should be subject to authorisation as novel foods but, based on the current evidence, there are no food safety grounds for regulating foods from the descendants of cloned cattle and pigs.</p>
	<p pid="a.605W.9/4">In respect of other consumer interests, the Board agreed that, for food safety purposes, mandatory labelling of meat and milk obtained from the descendants of cloned cattle and pigs would be unnecessary and disproportionate, providing no significant food safety benefit to consumers. However, the Board recognised the high level of public concern over the use of cloning and has asked Ministers to consider what information should be provided to the public about the ethics and welfare implications of animal cloning.</p>

	<p pid="a.608W.2/1">The Food Standards Agency (FSA) leads on government policy for the reduction of foodborne illness. Since its inception in 2000, the reduction of foodborne illness, including illness caused by campylobacter, has been one of the FSA's key objectives.</p>
	<p pid="a.608W.2/2">The FSA's policy on reducing the incidence of food poisoning caused by campylobacter is to reduce the levels of campylobacter in chicken as a priority. This is a priority because the handling, preparation and consumption of chicken may account for 20% to 30% of human cases of campylobacteriosis, while 50% to 80% may be attributed to the chicken reservoir as a whole. The FSA food chain analysis project, which looked at risk from primary production to retail, concluded that the greatest risk of campylobacter infection for people is from poultry meat, and hazards arise across the food chain that can result in the introduction of campylobacter into food.</p>
	<p pid="a.608W.2/3">In order to reduce campylobacter, the FSA has developed a Campylobacter Risk Management Programme, which encompasses a range of Government/industry partnership led projects targeted at different points across the food chain and coordinated through a joint action plan. To measure progress on the effectiveness of our Campylobacter Risk Management Programme the FSA has agreed a new target with industry for the reduction in levels of campylobacter in United Kingdom produced raw chicken, to be achieved in a phased approach by April 2015. The target will be published in December 2010.</p>
	<p pid="a.608W.2/4">The aim of the target is to reduce the levels of the most highly contaminated whole chickens at the end of the slaughter process. This reflects the fact that the degree of contamination on birds is most relevant to their risk to public health, with a high level of contamination posing the highest risk for human illness.</p>
	<p pid="a.608W.2/5">In addition to working with industry, the FSA's Food Hygiene Campaign works to promote awareness of safe food handling and preparation with consumers in the home and in catering settings.</p>

A great deal of activity is already in hand across the NHS to improve outcomes for people with COPD and asthma as a result of the work undertaken so far.</p>

	<p pid="a.610W.5/1">Under the Mental Health Act 1983, tribunals have the power to discharge patients from liability to detention in hospital and from supervised community treatment and guardianship. Those decisions are binding on all concerned.</p>
	<p pid="a.610W.5/2">While a tribunal's decision to discharge does not prevent the re-detention of the patient in accordance with the Act, case-law has established that only in limited circumstances would that be a proper course of action in the period immediately following the tribunal's decision.</p>
	<p pid="a.610W.5/3">In certain cases, a tribunal may defer a decision to order the conditional discharge of a patient while arrangements are made to satisfy the conditions it believes are necessary for that discharge. Case-law has established that health and social services must use their best endeavours to put in place the arrangements needed to allow the conditional discharge to take effect. But there is no absolute duty to implement the arrangements the tribunal has in mind, and the tribunal cannot order clinicians to treat patients against their clinical judgment.</p>
	<p pid="a.610W.5/4">In other cases, if it decides not to discharge a patient, a tribunal may make certain recommendations about the future treatment of the patient, including a recommendation that a patient be transferred to another hospital. Those recommendations are not binding, but the tribunal may, if it wishes, further consider the case if its recommendations are not acted on.</p>

	<p pid="a.616W.6/1">The Department holds some information on performance related pay for very senior managers (chief executives, executive directors and other senior managers with board level responsibility) that are employed by strategic health authorities (SHAs) on the pay framework for very senior managers, which was introduced in 2006. A copy of the framework has been placed in the Library.</p>
	<p pid="a.616W.6/2">The Department does not hold information on performance related pay for very senior managers employed in primary care trusts (PCTs), other groups of national health service staff not covered by the pay framework, or NHS staff employed on local arrangements which were in place before the introduction of the pay framework.</p>
	<p pid="a.616W.6/3">The performance related pay scheme which applied to SHA very senior managers in the period from 2007-08 (to recognise performance in 2006-07) to 2010-11 (to recognise performance in 2009-10) was in the form of non-consolidated, non-pensionable one off payments. As explained in the pay framework, payments are authorised subject to the approval of the 'grandparent' organisation. For very senior managers in SHAs this is the Department of Health.</p>
	<p pid="a.616W.6/4">The value of the performance related pay pot is subject to affordability and an absolute ceiling that the total cost of performance related pay must not exceed 5% of the reckonable pay bill for all very senior managers within the relevant bonus pool. For the 2006-07 performance year, the Department operated a national performance related pay pool, whereby the combined total of performance related pay for all very senior managers in SHAs was not allowed to be in excess of the 5% ceiling of total SHA very senior manager pay bill. In subsequent years, the pool was at an individual organisational level, rather than national.</p>
	<p pid="a.616W.6/5">Where an organisation fails to meet its financial control target, all of its very senior managers will be treated as 'Category D-not satisfactory' performers and will not receive an annual uplift or performance related pay.</p>
	<p pid="a.616W.6/6">The table shows the total amount of performance related pay paid to the very senior managers employed on the pay framework in each SHA, and the value of the performance related pay as a percentage of each SHA's total very senior manager pay bill. We understand that some very senior managers may have chosen not to receive performance related pay.</p>
	<p pid="a.616W.6/7">The table also shows the value of the total amount of performance related pay paid to all SHA very senior managers in each year, and the value of the total performance related pay as a percentage of the total SHA very senior manager pay bill.</p>

	<p pid="a.619W.9/1">The Independent Organ Donation Taskforce recommended against presumed consent in 2008, concluding that although such a system might have the potential to deliver benefits it would also present significant difficulties, which might not bring about the desired increase in donation rates. Instead, the Taskforce recommended that efforts should concentrate on implementing the recommendations in their first report which they believe should lead to an increase of at least 50% in donation rates by 2013. Currently donation rates are around 20% higher than the baseline year of 2007-08 and around 1 million more people have signed up to the organ donation register.</p>

To reduce incidence and mortality rates of the disease, we are supporting SunSmart, the national skin cancer prevention campaign run by Cancer Research UK (CRUK) on behalf of the UK health departments. SunSmart raises awareness among the public and health care professions about the causes of skin cancer, how to prevent it, and the importance of early detection, presentation and treatment. In 2010-11, the Department is funding a further year of the CRUK SunSmart campaign for England on skin cancer prevention.</p>
