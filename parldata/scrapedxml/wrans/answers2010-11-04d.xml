	<p pid="d.878W.0/1">The UK Border Agency makes every effort to ensure that a person's removal by deportation coincides, as far as possible, with his/her release from prison on completion of sentence. Where sentence length allows, the UK Border Agency will consider deportation up to 18 months prior to the earliest point of removal.</p>
	<p pid="d.878W.0/2">Foreign nationals who are served with a deportation notice have the right of appeal against the decision before the courts.</p>
	<p pid="d.878W.0/3">Deportation can be delayed in a number of ways. Judicial challenge can be used as a means to frustrate removal. This is being tackled through improved legal and case working in the UK Border Agency and closer co-operation with the judiciary.</p>
	<p pid="d.878W.0/4">There may be delays in deportation if foreign national prisoners do not fully co-operate with the documentation process. Failing to answer questions or providing false information will prevent or delay the UK Border Agency obtaining a travel document to facilitate their removal. Where there are difficulties in obtaining travel documents these issues are taken up directly with the relevant embassy or high commission.</p>
	<p pid="d.878W.0/5">The Government are committed to exploring ways of removing these individuals even earlier. This will include working with the prisons, courts and the police to build on our capacity to gather intelligence information on nationality at an earlier stage.</p>

	<p pid="d.883W.6/1">Any approach that helps people get off drugs for good should be explored. The results of the randomised injectable opiate treatment trial were reported in <i> T</i><i> he</i><i> Lancet</i> on <phrase class="date" code="2010-05-28">28 May 2010</phrase>.

It will set out an ambition for a recovery focused system that is locally led and supports individuals to tackle and overcome their dependency, reduce the harm to themselves, their families and the wider community, and make a positive contribution to society.

	<p pid="d.884W.5/2">In 2007 the Meat Hygiene Service (MHS) implemented a number of efficiency programmes. As a result of these programmes the cost of delivering meat official controls in Great Britain has reduced significantly from &#163;91.3 million in 2006-07 to &#163;68.1 million at the end of 2009-10, and in Northern Ireland has reduced from &#163;7.1 million in 2007-08 to &#163;6.6 million at the end of 2009-10. Further savings of &#163;0.6 million from the creation of the FSA's Integrated Corporate Services will be attributed to corporate support for meat official controls. Following the merger with the MHS, the FSA has launched an Operations Programme to review all official controls delivered on behalf of the FSA to maximise its efficiency and effectiveness.</p>

	<p pid="d.891W.5/1">This issue was raised in consultation as part of the Heat and Energy Saving Strategy consultation. The analysis of responses in September 2009 indicated that there was no clear answer to the question of the degree to which combined heat and power powered by fossil fuel will be less advantageous as electricity generation overall becomes less carbon intensive, because this is likely to depend on a range of factors, particularly the overall energy mix, carbon intensity, and the nature of infrastructure and design. It will also depend on the kind of heating system the micro-CHP unit is replacing.</p>

	<p pid="d.893W.2/1">The table, which will be placed in the Library, is taken from Mott Macdonald (2010) and gives levelised cost estimates (average generation cost per megawatt-hour) for new build plants in the main large-scale electricity generation technologies in the UK, including onshore wind, offshore wind and nuclear, at current engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) contract prices, and is available at:</p>

	<p pid="d.893W.2/3">It should be noted that for the purposes of presentation, the table only gives either &quot;FOAK&quot; (first-of-a-kind) prices or &quot;NOAK&quot; (nth-of-a-kind) prices for each technology.</p>
	<p pid="d.893W.2/4">As new technologies are deployed it is likely that costs will fall due to learning. The second table, also being placed in the Library, sets out the estimated levelised costs for projects started in 2017 with the assumption that all technologies have reached &quot;nth of a kind&quot; status. It shows the expectation that new nuclear will cost approximately &#163;68/MWh. Offshore wind and onshore wind are estimated to cost approximately &#163;112/MWh and &#163;86/MWh respectively.</p>
	<p pid="d.893W.2/5">It should be noted that the estimates of levelised costs for different types of electricity generation are highly sensitive to the assumptions used for capital costs, fuel and EU ETS allowance prices, operating costs, load factor, and other drivers, meaning that there is significant uncertainty around these estimates.</p>

The full costs of any redundancies will be met from within the Law Officers' Departments' spending review resource DEL settlement. That settlement covers all of the departments for which the Attorney-General is responsible-namely, the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS), the Serious Fraud Office (SFO), the Treasury Solicitor's Department, HM Crown Prosecution Service Inspectorate, the Attorney-General's Office and the National Fraud Authority.</p>

The Crown Prosecution Service-which represents the most significant share of the Law Officers' Departments' overall budget-has already set out plans to reduce numbers in its headquarters directorates by 50%, and this process has already begun. These reductions are expected to be substantially met by natural wastage but there could be a small number of voluntary redundancies. However, detailed decisions regarding the number of redundancies that may be required overall-and the associated costs-have yet to be finalised.</p>

	<p pid="d.913W.3/1">My right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary has not discussed the worldwide incidence of anti-Semitism with the Secretary-General of the United Nations recently. But combating all forms of racism, including anti-Semitism, is an important part of the Government's human rights agenda. Internationally, Ministers and officials support work to tackle anti-Semitism within the EU, the UN, the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe and other multilateral fora.</p>
	<p pid="d.913W.3/2">The Government support the All Party Parliamentary Group Against anti-Semitism and its work to promote efforts by governments and parliamentarians to combat anti-Semitism through implementing the London Declaration, adopted at the London Conference in February 2009.</p>
	<p pid="d.913W.3/3">The cross-Government working group to tackle anti-Semitism, made up of officials from across Whitehall and the chief executives of the Board of Deputies of British Jews, the Jewish Leadership Council and the Community Security Trust, is engaged in taking forward the provisions of the London Declaration. We look forward to the second Conference of the Inter-parliamentary Coalition for Combating Anti-Semitism in Ottawa in November as an opportunity for all participants to assess the progress that they have made around the world. Sir Andrew Burns, the UK Envoy for post-Holocaust issues, will be representing the Government at the conference.</p>

The Colombian army issued a public statement to make clear that it does not tolerate such violent acts and asked the Attorney-General's office and the Public Ministry to investigate.

In addition, it would support the further development of the country and the further improvement of the humanitarian situation in the north. Of course, any violence around the electoral process could undermine these objectives. Therefore the UK is working with support key institutions in Uganda, including the Electoral Commission, Government and opposition parties and police force, to support elections that are as credible and peaceful as possible.</p>

Those proposals took into account the evidence gathered as part of the previous Government's review of school funding. We plan minimal changes to the underlying system for 2011-12 in order to ensure the transparent introduction of the premium.

	<p pid="d.928W.2/1">People who live in state funded residential care homes will cease to be paid the mobility component of disability living allowance (DLA) after 28 days. While these residents will not be paid DLA, they will retain an underlying entitlement to the benefit and it will be reinstated if they leave the care home providing they continue to satisfy the conditions of entitlement. The planned implementation date is October 2012. The change will not apply to residents who meet the full costs of the care home themselves; they will continue to be paid any care or mobility components of disability living allowance they are entitled to. The change will affect around 60,000 people.</p>
	<p pid="d.928W.2/2">Local authority contracts with care homes cover services to meet all a resident's assessed needs, including any assessed mobility needs, so an individual's care support and mobility needs should be met by residential care providers from social care funding. This measure will remove an overlap of public funds while ensuring that resources continue to be targeted at disabled people with the greatest needs.</p>
	<p pid="d.928W.2/3">We have received representations in the form of parliamentary questions and correspondence since the measure was announced. The measure will be introduced as part of the forthcoming Welfare Reform Bill. In line with the Department's commitment to transparency, an equality impact assessment for Welfare Reform Bill measures such as this, will be published on DWP's website alongside the Bill in due course.</p>

The information was placed on the Treasury and the DirectGov websites. DWP officials also took steps to disseminate the information, including an article for InTouch (an electronic newsletter for key external stakeholders and claimant representative organisations), and a letter in July explaining the change to all DWP stakeholder groups which was followed up with a further letter on <phrase class="date" code="2010-08-31">31 August</phrase> to let them know what the new standard interest rate would be.</p>

The majority of pensioners in the lowest decile appear from the data collected in the Family Resources Survey to have an entitlement to pension credit but have not made a claim so pension credit expenditure on pensioners in the lowest decile is relatively low.</p>
	<p pid="d.933W.8/38">Pension credit recipients within the top four deciles generally have severe disabilities, which entitle them to disability benefits and premiums which increase their income to reflect the additional costs of disability. The breakdown of income takes no account of the extra costs of disability. In addition pensioner's income is assessed independently of the wider household to establish entitlement to pension credit. No account is taken of the income of the wider household, whose income raises the household equivalised income to the higher deciles.</p>

	<p pid="d.947W.3/1">The Strategic Defence and Security Review has determined that the Army should be restructured into five multi-role brigades (MRBs) designed to make the Army more flexible. This restructuring will take place alongside measures to reduce the size of the Army by approximately 7,000 by 2015. Detailed planning to determine exactly how and when this restructuring will be done is now under way. All infantry battalions will be incorporated into the new Army structure, while the reductions in personnel will be found from administrative and supporting elements such as headquarters staff and some combat support and combat service support force elements. Infantry battalions will not operate exclusively under the MRB structure, as they are routinely attributed to other military tasks.</p>

	<p pid="d.949W.3/1">At any one time the Ministry of Defence has many thousands of extant contracts. These are not centrally managed. However, during the period from May to October 2010 a number of contracts will have been renegotiated as part of routine MOD business.</p>
	<p pid="d.949W.3/2">The Strategic Defence and Security Review (SDSR) set out the capabilities the armed forces require now and in the future. As a consequence, changes are required to a number of our equipment and support programmes.</p>
	<p pid="d.949W.3/3">The MOD will now start to engage its suppliers in commercial renegotiations to implement the major changes that were announced in the SDSR.

Prior to the SDSR, the MOD held a series of sessions with key suppliers inviting them to offer innovative cost-effective solutions to providing current and future defence capabilities. MOD officials saw 17 major companies, including the MOD's top 10 suppliers, and received more than 100 proposals which could yet yield potentially significant savings. All of the proposals require further detailed work on legal, financial and commercial issues.</p>
	<p pid="d.949W.3/5">The MOD is also in discussion with the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) to review the Government Profit Formula and its Associated Arrangements (the so-called &quot;Yellow Book&quot;).

	<p pid="d.949W.3/6">The renegotiation process is being led by a steering group comprising senior members of the MOD, meeting twice a week to ensure efficiencies are delivered as planned. The steering group will report to a Whitehall Liaison Group to ensure cross-Government coherence.</p>

We are presently putting together a detailed plan for managing the transition to the new capability. One important element of this will involve the Department working closely with industry and allies, particularly the US and France. As an example, we already have a small team of Royal Navy and Royal Air Force personnel in the United States as part of the JSF programme, and we expect their numbers to rise steadily over the next few years.</p>

	<p pid="d.952W.8/3" class="indent">In my response to your recent Parliamentary Question (Official Report, <phrase class="date" code="2010-10-18">18 October 2010</phrase>, Column 483W), I offered to write to the honourable Member after the publication of the Strategic Defence and Security Review to answer his question about the effect on the UK's future carrier strike capability of the (SDSR) decision to delete Harrier GR9.</p>
	<p pid="d.952W.8/4" class="indent">As the Prime Minister announced to the House, we have decided to retire the Harrier, which has served this country well for 40 years. Although the Harrier is a flexible and capable aircraft, against the background of the severe financial pressures the nation faces, we have concluded that we should sustain the Tornado fleet which is currently supporting operations in Afghanistan, rather than the Harrier. This was a very difficult decision, not least because of its impact on those who have dedicated their lives to flying and supporting the Harrier and those who depend on the programme for their livelihoods. We accept there will be a gap in carrier strike capability until the end of the decade, but judge that in the longer term we cannot assume that bases for land-based aircraft will be available when and where we need them.</p>
	<p pid="d.952W.8/5" class="indent">The SDSR confirmed that we will build both of the carriers, but that we only expect to operate one of them at any time, with the second ship being held in extended readiness. We also intend to maximise the carrier's effectiveness by adapting it to operate the more capable Carrier Variant of the Joint Strike Fighter, which will require the installation of catapults and arrestor gear. This will also provide greater interoperability with key allies, such as the US and France. We are now investigating the optimum means of delivering this outcome.</p>

	<p pid="d.958W.8/2"><i> </i>The Government made clear that they were committed to retaining a nuclear deterrent based on Trident, so the decision did not need to be revisited in the strategic defence and security review. However, the Ministry of Defence has been very clear that the value for money review was conducted within the framework of the strategic defence and security review.</p>

	<p pid="d.959W.6/1">The Ministry of Defence (MOD) made estimates of the cost savings accrued from measures in the Strategic Defence and Security Review for the purposes of formulating policy. Some of these have been published to help inform the public debate. Release of further detail may prejudice the MOD's negotiating position with its commercial suppliers. Furthermore, final savings figures will depend on detailed implementation. The MOD is therefore not prepared to release more detailed figures at this time.</p>
