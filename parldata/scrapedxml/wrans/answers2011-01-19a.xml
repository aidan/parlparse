	<p pid="a.776W.2/1">Based on data from the Environment Agency's 2006 report 'An updated lifecycle assessment study for disposable and reusable nappies', which provided data on the average weight of a disposable nappy, and population estimates for England from the Office for National Statistics, approximately 575 thousand tonnes of children's disposable nappies were sent to landfill in England in 2009. This is equivalent to approximately 1% of the total amount of waste sent to landfill that year.</p>
	<p pid="a.776W.2/2">While the use of reusable nappies could help reduce the amount of waste sent to landfill, this does not necessarily mean that switching to reusable nappies will be of net benefit to the environment. The aforementioned Environment Agency report considered a range of environmental impacts linked with the use of different types of nappy (e.g. waste generation, water and energy consumption). The report showed that the relative benefits of reusable nappies are largely determined by how they are laundered and dried. Therefore, it is not clear whether disposable or reusable nappies are better for the environment overall.</p>

	<p pid="a.778W.7/1">The Case Resolution Directorate (CRD) is nearing the end of its programme to review the backlog of unresolved asylum cases, and remains on track to complete the legacy programme by summer 2011. Individuals who previously fitted the criteria of the R(S) policy would have fallen within one of CRD's priorities, namely those who may qualify to be allowed to stay in the UK. It is expected that the vast majority of such cases will have already been concluded. However, an accurate estimate of the numbers potentially affected by the withdrawal of the policy was not obtained, as this would have involved the manual checking of all CRD remaining cases, which could have delayed their completion.</p>
	<p pid="a.778W.7/2">All representations made on the basis of the R(S) policy prior to its withdrawal on <phrase class="date" code="2010-12-20">20 December 2010</phrase> will still be considered against the R(S) policy. Any representations made on the basis of R(S) after the withdrawal of the policy will be considered on a case by case basis. The small number of individuals who would have qualified on the basis of R(S) but whose cases have not yet been concluded are still likely to qualify for leave under existing immigration rules and policy.</p>

The destruction of the NIR data will involve the physical equipment holding that data being both degaussed and physically shredded. It is estimated that cancelling ID cards and the NIR will realise net savings of &#163;86 million over the next four years. The Identity and Passport Service (IPS) will incur some one-off expenditure and asset write-offs during 2010-11, including the secure destruction of the NIR.

	<p pid="a.784W.2/1">High level radioactive waste (HLW) arises from the reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel and all the UK's current HLW is located at Sellafield where reprocessing takes place.</p>
	<p pid="a.784W.2/2">In the absence of any proposals for reprocessing from industry, the Government's view is that any new nuclear power stations that might be built in the UK should proceed on the basis that spent fuel will not be reprocessed and that plans for, and financing of, waste management should also proceed on this basis. As a result, the Government have not considered, and have no plans for, management of HLW from any new nuclear power stations.</p>
	<p pid="a.784W.2/3">In terms of final HLW disposal, the Government have invited communities to enter discussions about potential involvement in a geological disposal facility siting process. So far, three local authorities in west Cumbria have 'expressed an interest' in the process and the invitation remains open for any other communities who might be interested in finding out more.</p>
	<p pid="a.784W.2/4">In terms of other nuclear materials, the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority's (NDA) draft strategy, which was subject to extensive consultation, identified the possibility of co-locating some spent fuels and intermediate level wastes at certain sites. The NDA's draft business plan, currently being consulted on, identifies two potential such projects; one for the potential movement of spent fuel from Dounreay for reprocessing at Sellafield and the second for the potential interim storage of spent fuel and related materials from a research reactor at Harwell. The amount of waste this could result in is considerably less than 1% of the current Sellafield inventory but it is important to stress that none of this is high level waste and no decisions have been taken. Before any final decisions are taken the NDA will have to complete technical studies, develop a detailed business case and engage with local stakeholders.</p>

	<p pid="a.789W.2/1">The latest household projections for England were published on <phrase class="date" code="2010-11-26">26 November 2010</phrase> and can be found on the DCLG website at:</p>
	<p pid="a.789W.2/2" class="indent"><a href="http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/corporate/statistics/2033household1110">http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/corporate/statistics/2033household1110</a></p>
	<p pid="a.789W.2/3">The household projections are based on the ONS population projections and provide the household numbers that would result if the assumptions based on previous demographic trends in the population and household formation rates were to be realised in practice. The projections therefore provide an indication of the possible demographic demand for new homes. However, it should be noted that future demographic trends might not be in line with past ones, and other factors-such as income growth-will also affect effective demand.</p>
	<p pid="a.789W.2/4">The control over new house building is in the hands of local authorities and the community. The Government are committed to increasing housing supply and seeing more of the homes that people want, in the places that people want them, to meet Britain's housing need. The New Homes Bonus, announced by my right hon. Friend the Minister for Housing and Local Government (Grant Shapps) on <phrase class="date" code="2010-11-12">12 November 2010</phrase>, will create a simple, powerful, transparent and permanent incentive to increase the supply of new homes and shift power back into the hands of individuals, communities and councils.</p>

The linkages are made by taking account of topography, the extent of built-up areas and the distance available from weather stations. Each postcode district is assigned to a station with the most similar climate in terms of mean winter temperature.</p>
	<p pid="a.791W.12/2">The cold weather payment scheme is reviewed annually after the end of each winter to assess the adequacy of all weather stations linkages. Expert advice is sought from the Met Office and changes made where appropriate before the start of the next winter period. As part of the next review we will consider the use of costal weather stations for applicants who live inland.</p>

	<p pid="a.794W.2/3" class="indent">The Secretary of State has asked me to reply to your question about what recent representations he has received on access to jobcentres in rural areas. This is something that falls within the responsibilities delegated to me as Chief Executive of Jobcentre Plus.</p>
	<p pid="a.794W.2/4" class="indent">In terms of previous representations, we have received the occasional letter from customers in rural locations but not in such numbers which would indicate that there is a specific problem.</p>
	<p pid="a.794W.2/5" class="indent">I am acutely aware that customers in more rural locations face particular difficulties and we take care to consider these when delivering policies and processes. For example, where there is a need to see someone face-to-face, we will take the individual's circumstances into account. This may mean arranging the time of a work focused interview around the customers transport links, offering to undertake a work focused interview in the customer's home location or somewhere more mutually convenient and offer assistance with travel and child care costs where possible.</p>
	<p pid="a.794W.2/6" class="indent">In addition to these services, where a journey by public transport would take the customer more than one hour (door to door) or result in an absence from home in excess of four hours, Jobcentre Plus would consider offering these customers the facility to make postal declarations rather than attend in person every fortnight.</p>
	<p pid="a.794W.2/7" class="indent">Jobcentre Plus also deploys a number of Mobile Units to help deliver a range of advisory services to our rural communities. Over and above the use of these Mobile Units, Jobcentre Plus also has a presence in approximately 1500 outreach premises such as children's centres, community centres, libraries and youth centres. Services offered from these outreach locations range from open access to jobsearch activity through our external jobpoints to one-to-one work sessions for Jobcentre Plus priority customers. The extent of co-location can vary from a few hours each week to a full time presence. These decisions are taken by local managers in conjunction with partner organisations to meet local need.</p>
	<p pid="a.794W.2/8" class="indent">New policies introduced by Jobcentre Plus are assessed to see whether they are likely to have any differential social, economic, environmental or geographical impacts. This ensures that customers in rural communities are not disproportionately disadvantaged by any new policies and procedures.</p>

	<p pid="a.795W.2/1">The Government do not forecast how many families or children they expect to be in poverty each year because child poverty is dependent on a number of factors which are difficult to reliably predict.</p>
	<p pid="a.795W.2/2">HMT's published analysis shows that the measures that can be robustly assessed from the 2010 spending review and June Budget will not lead to an increase in child poverty over the next two years. This analysis is not carried out separately for rural communities.</p>
	<p pid="a.795W.2/3">The latest data available from the Households Below Average Incomes for 2008-09 show that in England, before housing costs, the proportion of children in relative poverty is 15% in rural areas compared to 23% in urban areas and the proportion of families in relative poverty is 16% in rural areas compared to 19% in urban areas.</p>

In our view, the current rules are within the law and are right for the UK; and changing them now would not be in our interest. Our rules fully support the freedom of workers within the EU, while making sure that there are reasonable restrictions on access to social security for those who have never worked in the UK. This prevents unsustainable burdens being placed on our social security system.</p>

	<p pid="a.800W.3/1">The UK favours a policy of principled engagement with Cuba as the best means of achieving our objectives, especially on human rights. We have good diplomatic relations and good co-operation in a number of areas of common interest, including trade, counter-narcotics, climate change and child protection. We do however remain committed to holding the Cuban Government to account to its international commitments in governance and human rights. We have pushed for an end to restrictions on the right to freedom of expression and assembly in Cuba and the release of all political prisoners, and will continue to do so.</p>
	<p pid="a.800W.3/2">On North Korea, we have a policy of engagement through respective embassies in both countries. This engagement offers the potential for change, and enables us to raise difficult issues, which is important particularly during times of heightened tension. We are also able to carry out a programme of humanitarian projects and English language teacher training. Relations are measured to reflect concerns about North Korea's nuclear programme and their poor human rights record.</p>
	<p pid="a.800W.3/3">On Russia, since my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister and President Medvedev stressed their desire for a stronger, more positive relationship, there has been progress in developing commercial ties and some co-operation on foreign policy priorities. Our bilateral differences remain, and the UK will promote and protect its interests vigorously. For example, we remain deeply concerned about human rights and the rule of law in Russia, and we continue to raise this issue with the Russian Government, including through our bilateral human rights dialogue.</p>
	<p pid="a.800W.3/4">The UK enjoys cordial relations with Venezuela and we co-operate on areas of mutual interest including sustainable development and community policing. We follow developments in Venezuela closely. This includes the implications of new laws passed by the last Congress, particularly the Enabling Law, and the legislative programme of the new Congress.</p>
	<p pid="a.800W.3/5">As regards Iran, I refer my hon. Friend to the answer given to the noble Lord Kilclooney on <phrase class="date" code="2011-01-11">11 January 2011</phrase> by my right hon.

	<p pid="a.802W.5/1">Triwall is a commercial company that has developed a way of dropping humanitarian supplies in cardboard boxes from aircraft. The Department for International Development (DFID) considers airdrops of supplies to be a last resort for food distribution because they risk supplies being grabbed by the strongest people in the population, and can even worsen the humanitarian plight of more vulnerable people.</p>
	<p pid="a.802W.5/2">DFID does not make airborne drops in humanitarian aid operations itself. Where DFID delivers relief supplies it does so with partner agencies, who normally distribute food at ground level. This method is easier to control, ensuring that those who are most vulnerable and need the supplies most receive them.</p>
	<p pid="a.802W.5/3">In particular circumstances, however, such as in violent conflict where isolated populations cannot be reached by land, airdrops can be an important tool. The United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) plays a leading role in such operations and has delivered 1 million tonnes of food in this way to Sudan, Angola and Somalia over the last 20 years.</p>

	<p pid="a.803W.8/1">The British high commission in Colombo is in close contact with the Sri Lankan authorities, United Nations agencies and non-governmental organisations over the impact of recent flooding in Sri Lanka and the response to it. Current assessments are that as many as 1,063,000 people have been affected, with about 50 deaths. 3,000 houses have been destroyed and 175,000 damaged.

From a total of 82 recommendations 78 were accepted in full or in part. A significant number of recommendations have been completed and others are ongoing. A further inspection was carried out between <phrase class="date" code="2011-11-29">29 November</phrase> and <phrase class="date" code="2010-12-03">3 December 2010</phrase> which will produce a new set of recommendations and work to implement as many of them as possible will begin once the inspection report is received.</p>

	<p pid="a.812W.0/1">The average resource cost per prison place in 2008-09 (latest period for which figures are available) was approximately &#163;45,000.</p>
	<p pid="a.812W.0/2">The average cost per prison place at different populations has not been estimated as it would depend on a large number of variables. At the different populations given, the average cost per place might change slightly due to economies or diseconomies of scale, but the cost per place would depend more on the composition of the prison estate and of the prison population. Factors related to the prison estate are the category, size and number of prisons. Particular factors related to the population are age and gender.</p>
	<p pid="a.812W.0/3">The average cost for 2008-09 comprises the expenditure on public and private prisons (as recorded in the NOMS Agency annual report and accounts), increased by an apportionment of relevant costs borne centrally and in the regions by the National Offender Management Service (NOMS). This involves some estimation. The figures do not include the cost of prisoners held in police or court cells under Operation Safeguard, nor expenditure met by other Government Departments (eg Health and Education). The prisoner escort service costs are included. Expenditure recharged to the Youth Justice Board in respect of young people is included.</p>

Ford has a resettlement department who are expanding the numbers of offenders who access unpaid and paid work activities in the community. Ford has many areas supporting rehabilitation including drug work, advice on housing, Offending Behaviour Programmes (OBPs) delivered in conjunction with Sussex probation in the community, work with indeterminate sentence prisoners, education, full internal employment of offenders, for example in the garden and plant nursery, and work-based qualifications. A full programme of physical education is also offered with qualifications available but this is currently restricted due to the damage caused in the disturbance.</p>

	<p pid="a.822W.11/1">Tribunal proceedings are overseen by independent members of the judiciary. The Secretary of State for Justice does not have powers to monitor tribunal proceedings. There are provisions in all jurisdictions which allow for decisions of a tribunal to be challenged by way of internal review, onward appeal or a judicial review.</p>
	<p pid="a.822W.11/2">The Tribunals Courts and Enforcement Act 2007 provides the Lord Chancellor with the power to remove members of the Upper Tribunal or First-tier Tribunal on the grounds of inability or misbehaviour. The Lord Chancellor's power to remove other tribunal judges (such as those in the employment tribunal) is set out in other legislation. The exercise of the Lord Chancellor's statutory power of removal usually requires the concurrence of Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales, the Lord President or the Lord Chief Justice of Northern Ireland as appropriate.</p>

	<p pid="a.829W.4/1">We have made a good start on delivering the additional 50,000 adult places this year and are working with the National Apprenticeship Service to encourage colleges and providers to prioritise the growth in apprenticeships. Final figures for the 2010-11 financial year will be published in a National Statistics First Release in January 2012.</p>
	<p pid="a.829W.4/2">We have set ambitious goals for expansion of the programme and remain confident that they will be achieved, not least through the National Apprenticeships Service's work to support employers, colleges and training organisations across the country to make these additional apprenticeship places available where there is local demand.</p>
	<p pid="a.829W.4/3">While the Government make funding available for apprenticeship training, the opportunities themselves must be offered by employers. Already 85,000 employers are involved in the programme but we want to make apprenticeships an even more attractive offer to them. We are therefore reducing bureaucracy making the system simpler for employers and are considering how we might better support them through improved funding arrangements. The National Apprenticeships Service (NAS) is also continuing to promote the benefits of Apprenticeships to employers. For example, in November 2010, joining forces with business leaders in a campaign to urge more employers to take on apprenticeships. National Apprenticeship Week in February will also see apprentices, employers, and providers showcase the benefits of apprenticeship programmes and the value apprentices bring to organisations.</p>

	<p pid="a.830W.2/1">Apprenticeships are at the centre of the skills system.

We remain confident that these goals will be achieved, not least through the National Apprenticeships Service's work to promote apprenticeships and to support employers, colleges and training organisations across the country to make these additional apprenticeship places available where there is local demand. We have chosen to abolish Train to Gain and invest in longer and more comprehensive apprenticeships programmes because of the higher economic return apprenticeships yield.</p>

	<p pid="a.833W.2/1">The spending review settlement for RDAs provides &#163;464 million over four years, covering various salaries, redundancies, transition/closure costs and pension liabilities. Of this, the preliminary estimate is that up to 22% may be required to cover redundancy costs. It is not, however, possible to estimate this figure with certainty because the number of staff who will be working on continuing functions (such as European Regional Development Fund (ERDF), Rural Development Programme for England (RDPE), UK Trade and Investment (UKTI) etc.) has not been finalised and staff are also leaving on other bases such as through resignation. The cost of cancelling or varying operating contracts is not yet known and will be subject both to negotiation with the parties concerned and securing the best value outcome for the taxpayer.</p>

At the 2010 spending review, the Government announced their intention to carry out a public consultation on the discount rate used in unfunded public service pension scheme valuations to set contribution rates. Public service pension scheme valuations were therefore suspended until the review of the discount rate is complete.</p>

	<p pid="a.839W.6/5" class="indent">We have not assessed the impact of the change in VAT on the Northern Ireland economy. However, the OBR applied a range of fiscal multipliers to help inform its judgement on the impact of VAT on aggregate demand in the UK economy. These multipliers are set out in Table C8 of the interim OBR's June Budget document. A figure of 0.6, for example, means that a measure which has a direct effect of raising revenue by 1 per cent of GDP is estimated to reduce aggregate demand in the economy by 0.6 per cent in the short run.</p>
	<p pid="a.839W.6/6" class="indent">The interim OBR's June 2010 Budget forecast and the OBR's November forecast assumed that the increase in the standard rate of VAT from 17.5 per cent to 20 per cent would reduce the level of real GDP in 2011/12 by around 0.3 per cent.</p>

	<p pid="a.843W.2/1">To improve outcomes for patients with cancer, including those with haematological cancers and children with cancer, on <phrase class="date" code="2011-01-12">12 January 2011</phrase> we published &quot;Improving Outcomes-A Strategy for Cancer&quot;, which sets out a range of measures to improve cancer survival rates in England. It shows how we intend to tackle preventable cancer incidence, improve the quality and efficiency of cancer services and deliver outcomes that are comparable with the best in Europe. Through these approaches, the aim is to save an additional 5,000 lives every year by 2014-15.</p>
	<p pid="a.843W.2/2">The strategy makes clear that the improving outcomes in cancer guidance, published by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence, will continue to be a feature of all commissioned cancer services. &quot;Improving Outcomes in Haematological Cancers&quot;, which makes recommendations on the treatment, management and care of patients with haematological cancer, will ensure that the planning and commissioning of cancer services are organised to deliver the best patient outcomes.</p>
	<p pid="a.843W.2/3">Specifically regarding improvements in the health outcomes for children diagnosed with cancer, &quot;Improving Outcomes in Children and Young People&quot; with cancer will continue to support commissioners and clinicians to make the right decisions about the care and treatment of children with cancer that deliver the best outcomes.</p>
	<p pid="a.843W.2/4">The strategy also sets out how children with cancer will benefit from improved access to proton beam therapy (PBT). We are investing around &#163;50 million more over the spending review period so that all high priority patients with a need for PBT get access to this innovative treatment. Evidence supports the use of PBT in increasing numbers of children with cancer, for example those with brain tumours, to deliver improved outcomes. We anticipate that this will benefit 400 patients per year by 2014-15, the majority of whom will be children. A copy of the strategy has already been placed in the Library.</p>

	<p pid="a.844W.5/1">Awareness of diabetes is increasing and general practitioners (GPs) are playing a major role in identifying people either at risk or who already have diabetes, ensuring that they receive appropriate treatment at the earliest opportunity. Diabetes is in the quality and outcomes framework (QOF), part of the GP contract. Since diabetes management was included in QOF the number of people diagnosed with diabetes has increased to more than 2.3 million. In order to qualify for these incentives, GPs are required to record all patients with diabetes aged 17 and over on a practice register and undertake a series of tests annually to help assess and manage the risk of complications from diabetes.</p>
	<p pid="a.844W.5/2">The NHS Health Check, a national risk assessment and management programme, will assess everyone between 40 and 74 for their risk of heart disease, stroke, diabetes and kidney disease. It will help individuals manage their risk of these diseases by appropriate follow up and so help them stay well for longer and save lives. Those diagnosed with previously undetected disease will receive earlier management, improving their health outcomes for the future. Identification of those at high risk of having or developing diabetes is included within the programme.</p>
	<p pid="a.844W.5/3">The NHS Outcomes Framework for 2011-12 includes a domain, which focuses on enhancing the quality of life for people with long-term conditions, such as diabetes. A NICE Quality Standard on diabetes is being developed to support those providing national health service care to deliver the outcomes set out in the NHS outcomes framework.</p>
	<p pid="a.844W.5/4">The Public Health White Paper proposes a public health outcomes framework which is currently out for consultation. This includes a domain on prevention of ill-health and this is where measures relating to the prevention and detection of diabetes would best fit. In order for this to be achieved the NHS and public health systems will be required to work more closely together.</p>

	<p pid="a.852W.8/1">The spending review set out the Government's commitment to delivering efficiency improvements in the national health service of up to &#163;20 billion over the next four years (from 2011-12 through 2014-15). This includes a saving of &#163;1.9 billion in the costs of administration across the health system. All savings will be available to re-invest in improving services and outcomes for patients.</p>
	<p pid="a.852W.8/2">The approach to delivering these savings has been developed bottom-up with individual NHS organisations formulating their own plans to deliver quality and efficiency improvements, based upon their own specific local circumstances and priorities, recognising variations in how services are provided and the scale of the challenge. While this process is focussed on the spending review period commencing in April 2011, many NHS organisations are already delivering savings and quality improvements locally.</p>
	<p pid="a.852W.8/3">For example, in Yorkshire and the Humber, staff are working to save &#163;22.5 million across the region by reducing infections, pressure ulcers, falls and deterioration in the form of deep vein thrombosis and clots. Nationally these currently cost the NHS &#163;1 billion a year. Simple systems designed by staff and understood by everyone involved can dramatically improve safety records and deliver safer care to patients every day.</p>
	<p pid="a.852W.8/4">The Department has also taken action centrally to deliver savings, including through strict cross-Government controls introduced in May 2010 on areas of spending including consultancy, communications and marketing and information technology projects. It has also undertaken a thorough review of all health arm's length bodies, which will reduce their number from 18 to between eight and 10 and deliver savings of around &#163;180 million annually by 2014-15.</p>

	<p pid="a.853W.5/1">Hip fractures remain the most serious consequence of a fall in older people and there is a significant programme of work in development by the Department to reduce the number of falls and fractures that occur in England. This includes the consideration of indicators that relate to falls and fragility fractures as part of the NHS Outcomes Framework, the Department's 2009 publication of a Falls and Fractures Commissioning Toolkit, the Best Practice Tariff that is in place which incentivises high quality care in hip fracture patients and National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence guidance on hip fracture care.</p>
	<p pid="a.853W.5/2">The majority of fractures in older people occur as a result from a fall from standing height, commonly affecting the pelvis, wrist, upper arm or hip. Recurrent falls are often a manifestation of impaired postural stability. This can result from a combination of factors, such as conditions like arthritis, stroke or Parkinson's disease, age-related frailty and long-term cardio-respiratory conditions leading to loss of strength, balance and concentration or insight. External factors can contribute to falls, such as poor or cold housing or behavioural issues such as excessive alcohol consumption.</p>
	<p pid="a.853W.5/3">We have also made additional funding available to primary care trusts (PCTs) in order to support social care services. On <phrase class="date" code="2011-01-04">4 January 2011</phrase>, the Department announced it was providing &#163;162 million to PCTs that they will transfer to local authorities for immediate spending on social care services to benefit health, and to improve overall health gain. PCTs will need to work together with local authorities to agree jointly on appropriate areas for social care investment, and the outcomes expected from this investment. The investment may be used to support and maintain existing services such as telecare, community directed prevention (including falls prevention), community equipment and adaptations, and crisis response services. The Department would expect these decisions to take into account the Joint Strategic Needs Assessment for their local population, and the existing commissioning plans for both health and social care. PCTs will work with local authorities to achieve these outcomes in a transparent and efficient manner, with local authorities keeping PCTs informed of progress using appropriate local mechanisms.</p>
	<p pid="a.853W.5/4">The 2011-12 Operating Framework for the national health service in England includes a focus on joint working between the NHS and its local Government partners, especially in the area of community-directed prevention (including falls prevention) and backs this up with further PCT allocations totalling &#163;648 million. These allocations will be transferred to local authorities for spending on social care services to benefit health in the next financial year. This is part of a package of additional funding, worth &#163;1.3 billion in 2011-12, that will support the delivery of social care in the context of a challenging local government settlement.</p>

	<p pid="a.854W.5/4">The Department reviewed the cost of alcohol related harm to the NHS in 2008.

	<p pid="a.854W.5/5">The Department has also estimated the cost of Class A drug use to the NHS in 2008-09 to be &#163;585 million.</p>

	<p pid="a.854W.5/7">Community drug treatment is funded by the Department through the Pooled Treatment Budget (PTB). The PTB is &#163;406 million in 2010-11 and covers drug treatment for adults and young people. This budget includes &#163;22 million from the Ministry of Justice as a contribution towards the delivery of drug rehabilitation requirements. Local primary care trusts also make an additional &#163;156 million in health funding available to support drug treatment.</p>

	<p pid="a.859W.5/2">In challenging times the Government are freeing local authorities to focus on essential frontline services, and to invest in early intervention and prevention to produce long-term savings and better results for children, young people and families. A key element of this approach is the creation of a new Early Intervention Grant for local authorities in England, worth &#163;2,212 million in 2011-12 and &#163;2,297 million in 2012-13. It replaces a number of former funding streams, which are listed in a note on my Department's website. The Early Intervention Grant is not ring-fenced, so it is for each local authority to determine what proportion of the grant will fund community activities for young people.</p>

	<p pid="a.871W.0/1">In January 2009 the then Department for Children Schools and Families carried out a survey of the management of asbestos in system-built schools to confirm that the school duty holders were managing asbestos correctly. The survey focused on system-built schools, such as CLASP, as these are most likely to contain high levels of Asbestos Containing Materials (ACMs).</p>
	<p pid="a.871W.0/2">The majority of local authorities demonstrated that they have procedures and precautions in place to manage asbestos safely. Visits were made to those authorities where the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) considered further clarification of arrangements was necessary to ensure they were complying with the legal requirements set out in the Control of Asbestos Regulations 2006. HSE served enforcement notices on a small number of authorities to improve asbestos management standards.</p>
	<p pid="a.871W.0/3">HSE has also written to the chief executives of all 152 authorities to highlight key messages on managing asbestos, and to remind them that effective management of asbestos in schools is an ongoing requirement for authorities and other duty holders across all schools under their control.</p>
	<p pid="a.871W.0/4">This survey and inspection programme is the latest in a series of initiatives to ensure that local authorities and schools responsible for system buildings are managing the risks from asbestos. HSE will conduct a further survey and inspection initiative between October 2010 and March 2011 to check compliance with the regulations in a sample of schools that fall outside local authority control.</p>

This will aim for high levels of pupil participation; competition is a way of ensuring breadth, so that all students can be involved, not just the highest performing students.</p>

	<p pid="a.874W.5/1">The Schools White Paper 'The Importance of Teaching' sets out the Government's intention to provide support to increase the number of specialist science and mathematics teachers and to improve the skills of existing teachers. This will include encouraging and supporting primary schools to develop specialist mathematics teachers and a number of changes to get more good people into teaching, such as expanding Teach First and readjusting incentives for graduates. We will also review the National Curriculum and 14-19 qualifications to ensure that children gain the knowledge they need in maths and science, in order to progress and develop their understanding and provide them with the solid foundation to progress on to further study in these and related subjects at a higher level if they so wish.</p>

	<p pid="a.875W.5/1" class="holdinganswer">holding answer <phrase class="date" code="2010-11-29">29 November 2010</phrase></p>
	<p pid="a.875W.5/2">The largest item of school spending on sport has been, and will continue to be, the salaries of teachers who teach the National Curriculum programmes of study for physical education for all pupils aged five to 16. This will include virtually all primary classroom teachers, as well as the specialist PE teachers in secondary schools. These costs are already met from the dedicated schools grant (DSG).</p>
	<p pid="a.875W.5/3">The Department has not estimated total spending from DSG on teachers who teach PE, but we do not expect it to change, as PE will remain statutory for all age groups within the National Curriculum.</p>
	<p pid="a.875W.5/4">It is for school leaders to decide what additional resources they will provide for school sport from their (enhanced) school budgets from April 2012. The Department does not require schools to allocate specific levels of funding for PE and sport, or for any other subject. The Department has protected school budgets at a time when cutting the budget deficit is an urgent national priority.</p>
	<p pid="a.875W.5/5">Around &#163;120 million a year of the previous Government's PE and Sport Strategy was given directly to schools and ring-fenced for PE and sport. The Secretary of State announced in December 2010 the direction of travel, and initial funding, for the coalition Government's new approach on school sports.</p>
	<p pid="a.875W.5/6">Schools will receive funding to allow PE teachers to embed competitive sport in schools across the country and raise participation. Every secondary school will receive funding up to the end of the academic year in 2013 to pay for one day a week of a PE teacher's time to be spent out of the classroom, encouraging greater take-up of competitive sport in primary schools, and securing a fixture network for schools to increase the amount of intra- and inter-school competition. The detail of the time-limited funding announced is:</p>
	<p pid="a.875W.5/7" class="indent">The Department will pay school sport partnerships for the full school year to the end of the summer term 2011 at a cost for the final term of &#163;47 million from our 2010-11 budget. This will ensure the partnerships and their service can continue until the end of this academic year.</p>
	<p pid="a.875W.5/8" class="indent">A further &#163;65 million from the Department's spending review settlement will be paid to enable every secondary school to release one PE teacher for a day a week in the school years 2011/12 and 2012/13. This will ensure all the benefits of the current system are fully embedded.</p>

To help minimise funding turbulence for schools, local authorities, in consultation with their schools forum, will be able to take account of the previous level of this funding in each school when making their 2011-12 allocations. The minimum funding guarantee of minus 1.5% will further help to minimise funding changes for specialist schools.</p>

	<p pid="a.877W.11/1">The general funding Government allocate to schools for the provision of education is used by schools in accordance with their local needs. Schools are free to use their funding allocation for their own education provision, which can include vocational education for their pupils.</p>
	<p pid="a.877W.11/2">In 2010-11, the following elements of funding allocated to local authorities for vocational education programmes in schools are ring fenced.</p>
	<p pid="a.877W.11/3">The diploma formula grant is paid to local areas at an average rate of &#163;1,000 per pupil for pre-16 pupils to cover the additional costs of teaching diplomas that could not be met through mainstream funding.</p>
	<p pid="a.877W.11/4">The local delivery support grant is used to support local areas with the implementation of the diploma and other aspects of what was formerly known as the 14-19 programme. The grant is paid on the basis of the number of young people in the area and the number of approvals for new unique subjects in each local authority.</p>

	<p pid="a.879W.0/2"><i> </i>The Young Ambassadors is a scheme funded jointly by the Department for Education and the Department for Culture, Media and Sport and developed and run by the Youth Sport Trust, with additional help from private sector sponsors. It harnesses the passion of young people for competitive sports and uses this to get more young people involved. The London Organising Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games (LOCOG) has recognised the Young Ambassadors as part of its &quot;Inspire&quot; programme. I was very pleased to meet representatives of the Young Ambassadors on <phrase class="date" code="2011-12-07">7 December</phrase> and recognise their energy, commitment, and the valuable contribution they make. I have offered a follow up meeting with a larger group of Young Ambassadors. The Department for Education intends to continue to fund the scheme through to the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games and is discussing with the Youth Sport Trust options to expand the scheme to allow every secondary school to have a young ambassador and also to include some primary schools.</p>
