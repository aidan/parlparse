	<p pid="b.466W.2/1">Free standing Blue Force tracking systems are available largely off the shelf using US based technology and are deployed on operations in Iraq and Afghanistan to supplement the initial capability provided by Bowman ComBAT (Common Battlefield Application Toolset), Infrastructure and Platform Battlefield Information System Application (CIP). In the longer term we are looking mainly to more advanced versions of Bowman CIP and to Tactical Data Links to provide positional information. The joint US-UK Coalition Blue Force Situational Awareness demonstrator is helping to develop ways of exchanging data between Bowman CIP and US Blue Force tracking systems. It is too early to say what the resource implications would be.</p>

A breach of the principles underpinning these elements can lead to consultations between the EU and the ACP state concerned and the imposition of measures aimed at remedying the breach.

The UK believes that an effective aid partnership is based on a shared commitment to poverty reduction, human rights and strong financial management. These are similar to those essential and fundamental elements outlined in the aforementioned paragraph. We may interrupt or stop aid if a partner Government breaches these commitments. Any conditions we use will relate to these three commitments and be drawn from our partner's own policies and plans, wherever possible.</p>

	<p pid="b.481W.2/1">Sustainability of production is one of the Government's key priorities for biofuel development. That is why the Government are developing environmental reporting as an integral part of the renewable transport fuel obligation (RTFO). This will require all obligated companies to report on the carbon savings and wider environmental impacts of their biofuels. The reports will include details of the previous use of the land on which the biofuel feedstocks were grown, and the impacts on biodiversity of growing those feedstocks. This will encourage companies to supply biofuels which deliver the maximum carbon savings with the minimum environmental impact. It will also ensure that we can monitor the impact of both imported and domestically-sourced biofuels.</p>
	<p pid="b.481W.2/2">In the longer-term, the Government will be looking to move to a system that allows only biofuels which meet certain minimum sustainability standards to benefit from the RTFO. However, developing a verifiable and robust system that is compatible with World Trade Organisation requirements on preventing barriers to trade will take time.</p>
	<p pid="b.481W.2/3">We anticipate that biofuels in the UK will come from a mixture of home-grown and imported crops, recycled waste vegetable oils and tallow. While some biofuel crops are likely to replace UK food crops, there are significant quantities of oilseed rape and wheat that are currently exported which could be retained for domestic biofuel use, with no loss to food production. Biofuel crops can also be grown on set-aside land, that is, land which cannot be used for food crops. In the longer term, as technology improves, straw and wood could be used for biofuel production.</p>

DEFRA has been working closely with DCLG to secure greater energy efficiency of new and existing homes through amendments to Part L of the Building Regulations. DEFRA supports the recent amendment to Part L, which will lead to an increase in the energy efficiency of new homes by approximately 20 per cent. compared with those built to the 2002 Regulations. DEFRA also supports the commitment that all new homes will be zero carbon by 2016, introduced through a timetable of phased improvements.</p>

	<p pid="b.491W.2/1">There was no recommendation from the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) meeting in May 2004 to change the listing status of the saker falcon. The UK has a policy of only putting forward species for listing or amendment of their listed status where we or one of our overseas territories are a range state. This is not the case with the saker falcon and any action therefore to change its listing status would be for one of the range states. Although the saker falcon is listed by CITES as Appendix II, it is listed by the EU as Annex A (the most endangered category).</p>

	<p pid="b.493W.4/1">The Youth Opportunity and Youth Capital Funds have been running since April 2006 and are worth &pound;115 million over two years. Local authorities are required to report to Government offices on delivery of the funds on a six monthly basis. The first six monthly reports were received at the end of October 2006. The second reports are due at the end of April 2007. The reporting system is supported by independent evaluation which is being undertaken by the National Foundation for Educational Research.</p>

Overall in the 2005/06 academic year there were nearly 4 million publicly funded adult learner places. We do not hold information on the number of adult education courses.</p>

	<p pid="b.496W.2/3">In doing so the offer can help tackle both the causes and the impact of bullying by giving children and young people safe places in which to achieve and build their confidence, helping to address their social and emotional needs through effective relationships between children's professionals, and by supporting parents in building strong and constructive relationships with their children and dealing with issues such as bullying.</p>

The under-16 rate fell by 12.1 per cent. over the same period.</p>

	<p pid="b.499W.10/1">All national health service bodies must live within their means and there can be no question of us simply writing off deficits when particular trusts have failed to operate within their budgets.</p>
	<p pid="b.499W.10/2">We recognise that it may be challenging for NHS trusts to pay back a large deficit that has built up over a number of years. However, the Department, and, consequently, the NHS, have to live within an agreed level of resources in each financial year. This level is set by HM Treasury and voted by Parliament. In order for the system as a whole to balance, a deficit in one organisation has to be matched by a surplus elsewhere.</p>
	<p pid="b.499W.10/3">In circumstances where a surplus cannot be generated in the following year, for example in the case of the small number of organisations with particularly large deficits, strategic health authorities can agree to a recovery plan which phases the recovery of those deficits over a number of years. This would require other NHS organisations within the health economy to underspend over the same period. Any such arrangements would have to be subject to the agreement of local providers, commissioners and the managing SHA.</p>

	<p pid="b.506W.9/2" class="italic"> Letter from Stephen Geraghty:</p>
	<p pid="b.506W.9/3" class="indent">In reply to your recent Parliamentary Question about the Child Support Agency, the Secretary of State promised a substantive reply from the Chief Executive.</p>
	<p pid="b.506W.9/4" class="indent">You asked the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, what targets the Child Support Agency has for processing and reducing the volume of cases processed clerically; and if he will make a statement.</p>
	<p pid="b.506W.9/5" class="indent">The Child Support Agency has been set six targets by the Secretary of State for 2006/07, which were published in the Agency's Business Plan, a copy of which is available in the House of Commons Library, or on the internet via the following link: <a href="http://www.csa.gov.uk/pdf/English/reports/plan0607.pdf">www.csa.gov.uk/pdf/English/reports/plan0607.pdf</a></p>
	<p pid="b.506W.9/6" class="indent">Two of these targets relate to the processing and clearing of applications received since the new scheme was introduced in March 2003 and include the Agency's clerical cases. The first concerns the volume of applications being cleared and states that: by <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-31">31 March 2007</phrase>, the Agency will have reduced the volume of uncleared new scheme applications by 25 per cent of the amount outstanding by the end of March 2006.</p>
	<p pid="b.506W.9/7" class="indent">The second concerns the speed with which new applications should be processed and states that by <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-31">31 March 2007</phrase>, the Agency will clear 55 per cent of new applications within 12 weeks of receipt and 80 per cent within 26 weeks.</p>
	<p pid="b.506W.9/8" class="indent">Reducing the number of clerical cases is dependent on rectifying the existing defects on the Agency's computer system &mdash; work will continue over 2007 to resolve these defects. To date the Agency has reduced the amount of new cases that need to be processed clerically by introducing a number of fixes to the computer system. The Agency aims to restore its clerical cases onto the computer system when the system is working effectively.</p>

	<p pid="b.509W.2/3" class="italic"> Letter from Stephen Geraghty, dated <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-15">15 March 2007</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="b.509W.2/4" class="indent">In reply to your recent Parliamentary Question about the Child support agency, the Secretary of State promised a substantive reply from the Chief Executive.</p>
	<p pid="b.509W.2/5" class="indent">You asked the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, how many (a) total and (b) full-time equivalent Child support Agency staff were engaged in processing (i) old scheme and (ii) new scheme maintenance claims in each month of the last two years for which figures are available.</p>
	<p pid="b.509W.2/6" class="indent">The attached table details the people working on processing new applications for each scheme in full-time equivalents for each month of the last two years. I regret that the information is not available on the number of individual people employed in these areas in each month.</p>
	<p pid="b.509W.2/7" class="indent">The clearance process includes all work undertaken on applications for child maintenance until one of the following conditions is met: a parent with care has been identified as claiming Good Cause or is subject to a Reduced Benefit Decision; the application is identified as being change of circumstances on an existing case; the application is identified as being a change of circumstances on an existing case; the application has been closed; or for old scheme cases a maintenance assessment has been carried out and for new scheme cases, a payment arrangement between the parent with care and the non-resident parent is in place.</p>
	<p pid="b.509W.2/8" class="indent">The Agency holds only a negligible number of completely unprocessed applications. The amount of work required to achieve clearance, and the length of time involved, varies considerable depending on, amongst other things, the circumstances of the parents and how readily they cooperate with Agency. The work undertaken by the Agency's New Client Teams extends far beyond simply clearing new applications through the computer system. A significant proportion of the work undertaken by the Agency's New Client Teams consists of setting up the first maintenance payments to the parent with care, and retaining responsibility for the growing caseload until the first fully complaint, on time payment is made by the non-resident parent.</p>

	<p pid="b.521W.6/1">Eligibility for membership of the New Firefighters' Pension Scheme is restricted to firefighters whose role on taking up employment with a fire and rescue authority includes resolving operational incidents, or leading and supervising others in the resolution of such incidents. In consequence those who join the Fire and Rescue Service at station manager, or above, are excluded from the scheme. Guidance to this effect has been issued to the Service.</p>
	<p pid="b.521W.6/2">The justification for a separate pension scheme with a normal pension age of 60 is that the duties of an operational firefighter are physically onerous and require high standards of physical fitness. These particular standards do not apply for senior management posts and therefore membership of the Local Government Pension Scheme, with a normal pension age of 65, is considered more appropriate.</p>
	<p pid="b.521W.6/3">The issue was fully discussed by the highly representative Firefighters' Pension Committee during consultation on the new pension arrangements. The provision reflects the outcome of that discussion.</p>
	<p pid="b.521W.6/4">Correspondence has been received from the Commissioner, London Fire and Emergency Planning Authority, and a response is being given setting out our position.</p>

	<p pid="b.526W.8/2">The forthcoming elections to a Constituent Assembly in Nepal will be key to sustaining the momentum of the current peace process. However, it is vital that they are credible, free and fair and that they allow a voice to marginalised groups. We will continue to work with the Government of Nepal, our international partners and NGOs to ensure free and fair elections take place.</p>

	<p pid="b.528W.3/1">The Government recognise the harms associated with the misuse of anabolic steroids and have controlled their availability under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971. This is only one part of the effort to reduce misuse. Education and prevention are key measures. The FRANK campaign makes it clear that the misuse of steroids is dangerous and can lead to some potentially fatal medical problems. The harmful short and long-term effects of anabolic steroid use are also described in the most recent version of the Department of Health publication &quot;Dangerousness of drugs&quot; (2003). Needles and syringe exchange services are also available to provide harm reduction paraphernalia to those who are at risk of blood borne virus infection (HIV, hepatitis B and C) by sharing injecting equipment.</p>
	<p pid="b.528W.3/2">The Government and the law enforcement agencies take very seriously the use of the internet for the advertising, and in some cases the sale, of controlled drugs. Where a website is hosted by a UK Internet Service Provider (ISP) and contains material which is illegal, the agencies can issue the ISP concerned with a notice and take down order to remove the offending material. UK ISPs have a very good record of removing such sites following notification.</p>

	<p pid="b.534W.5/1">The British Crime Survey (BCS) routinely provides information on the number of incidents of domestic violence in England and Wales, but this is not broken down by the relationship between the offender and the victim.</p>
	<p pid="b.534W.5/2">The 2004-05 and 2005-06 British Crime Surveys also included a self-completion module on intimate violence (partner abuse, family abuse, sexual assaults and stalking). This contained more detailed questions about experiences of intimate violence. Results from the 2005-06 BCS self-completion module were published in Home Office Statistical Bulletin 02/07, which included information about the prevalence of family abuse but not by children specifically.</p>
	<p pid="b.534W.5/3">According to the 2005-06 BCS, 12 per cent. of women and 9 per cent. of men had experienced family abuse (non-physical abuse, threats and/or violence by a parent, step-parent or other family member) since the age of 16. 3 per cent. of women and 2 per cent. of men reported having experienced family abuse in the 12 months prior to their interview.</p>
	<p pid="b.534W.5/4">The Offending Crime and Justice Survey (OCJS) provides information about the prevalence of offending among the general population. In the survey, if someone reports that they have committed an assault in the last 12 months, they are then asked about their relationship to the victim. According to the latest OCJS figures, taken from the 2005 survey, in 3 per cent. of incidents of assaults by 10 to 25-year-olds, the victims are the parents of the offender. Details for dependent children are not available.</p>

	<p pid="b.535W.2/2">The Home Office has commissioned research on the association of drug and alcohol use with specific aspects of offending, and routinely collates information on the proportion of alcohol related violent crime based on an assessment by the victim.</p>
	<p pid="b.535W.2/3">Published Home Office research estimates that 15 per cent. of all persons arrested for any offence reported that they had committed a crime in order to obtain drugs in the last four weeks. The proportion increased to 46 per cent. among those persons who reported taking heroin, crack or cocaine in the same four-week period. This estimate is published in the Arrestee Survey Annual Report: October 2003-September 2004.</p>
	<p pid="b.535W.2/4">Information which is routinely published from the British Crime Survey (BCS) provides an assessment of alcohol related violent crime. In 2005-06 it is estimated that victims believed the offenders to be under the influence of alcohol in 44 per cent. of all violent incidents. This information is contained in the statistical publication Crime in England and Wales 2005-06.</p>
	<p pid="b.535W.2/5">Additional research findings from the Offending Crime and Justice Survey (OCJS) suggest that being drunk once a month or more in the last year is associated with offending among 10 to 25-year-olds. This information is contained in the report &quot;Young People and Crime: Findings from the 2005 Offending Crime and Justice Survey&quot; and was published in December 2006.</p>

However, the National Identity Scheme Commissioner, to be appointed under section 22 of the Identity Cards Act 2006, will prepare annual reports which will be published and laid before Parliament on the operation of the National Identity Scheme under the Identity Cards Act. In addition Lord Carlile of Berriew QC, the independent reviewer of terrorist legislation, provides an annual report on the operation of the Terrorism Act 2000. The Terrorism Act 2006 largely amends the 2000 Act and will therefore also be covered by his annual reports.</p>

	<p pid="b.555W.2/1">The Home Office has published formal reports relating to the assessment of performance of police forces in England and Wales and of Staffordshire police specifically. The most recent Police Performance Assessments were published in October 2006 covering annual data to March 2006. These assessments combine the robust evaluation of data collected by the force and through the British Crime Survey with the results from Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary's (HMIC) evidence-based qualitative inspections. Forces are assessed across seven policing areas to provide a thorough, balanced and realistic assessment of its ability to tackle crime and disorder.</p>

Of the 158 cases outstanding, 31 have gone to review (the first tier in the two-tier appeals process) or to appeal (the second tier).

	<p pid="b.564W.9/1">The following table outlines the revenue generated each year by the Safety Camera Scheme since its introduction in July 2003. The figures have been broken down by district command unit as requested. Revenue from all fixed penalty notices and conditional offers is paid to the Court Service. However, there is a mechanism to 'Cost Recover' funds generated by the scheme to cover its running costs. Any surplus funds then go to Treasury along with all the other fines received from penalty notices issued outside of the scheme.</p>
