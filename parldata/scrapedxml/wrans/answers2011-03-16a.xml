	<p pid="a.324W.5/2">We have been pressing for improved origin labelling in negotiations and have successfully included in the current text an extension making origin labelling compulsory to all fresh meat with the possibility, subject to a review, of extending origin labelling for other foods. We have also secured a requirement for origin information to be given for main ingredients when origin claims are made on food products (eg the origin of the steak in a steak pie labelled as made in the UK).</p>
	<p pid="a.324W.5/3">EU member states have reached political agreement on this text and it will now be sent to the European Parliament for further consideration. We are not expecting the regulation to be adopted and published until early 2012. In the meantime, we continue to work with the food industry, retailers and others to encourage better labelling. Indeed, I am pleased that food industry launched its own voluntary principles on origin labelling on <phrase class="date" code="2010-11-24">24 November 2010</phrase>. These principles have been agreed by trade associations representing manufacturers, retailers and the food service sector (British Retail Consortium, Food and Drink Federation, British Hospitality Association, Dairy UK, British Meat Processors Association). All of the major supermarkets have signed up to this approach. We will be carrying out an evaluation of the effectiveness of these voluntary principles for meat and dairy products over the next few months to provide a baseline for future assessments of the effectiveness of the voluntary approach to origin information.</p>

	<p pid="a.333W.2/3">Subsequent to that answer:</p>
	<p pid="a.333W.2/4" class="indent">We have scrapped planning rules which forced up parking charges and imposed artificial caps on parking spaces in new homes.</p>
	<p pid="a.333W.2/5" class="indent">We have made changes to the regulations governing Homes in Multiple Occupation to allow areas experiencing problems with Homes in Multiple Occupation to put in place local solutions without imposing unnecessary burdens on the whole of the country.</p>
	<p pid="a.333W.2/6" class="indent">We have cut red tape to make it easier for communities to hold street parties for the Royal Wedding.</p>
	<p pid="a.333W.2/7" class="indent">The Localism Bill has been introduced to Parliament. The Bill seeks to achieve a substantial and lasting shift in power away from central Government and towards local people. Reducing bureaucracy is one of the key aims of this Bill and we have committed to a number of bold and transformative measures in order to achieve this aim.</p>
	<p pid="a.333W.2/8" class="indent">We have also carried out an extensive review to identify the changes that are needed to Building Regulations and are working up detailed proposals for consultation towards the end of this year, taking forward the spending review 2010 commitment to reduce the overall regulatory burden on house-builders.</p>
	<p pid="a.333W.2/9" class="indent">We are also working to remove bureaucratic barriers that hold back local action, and have opened up a 'Barrier Busting' website for communities to identify them.</p>
	<p pid="a.333W.2/10">All future regulations will be developed in full compliance with the Government's one-in, one-out rules-meaning that new regulatory burdens we impose on businesses will be given full consideration to ensure that the costs being imposed are offset by reductions in the overall cost of regulation imposed by the Department.</p>
	<p pid="a.333W.2/11">In the period from <phrase class="date" code="2010-11-24">24 November 2010</phrase> to <phrase class="date" code="2011-02-08">8 February 2011</phrase>, we have introduced 19 new statutory instruments. Although these are 'regulations' in the technical sense of the word, many of these are deregulatory in function and intent, and others are purely technical with no adverse impact whatsoever on business or local government. A table with details of the statutory instruments that have been introduced has been placed in the Library of the House.</p>

It is not possible to work out the exact saving this will bring, as the total amount of grant will depend on how much fuel is used by eligible bus services in each year, and how many buses are eligible for each of the specific incentives.</p>

Assuming a similar level of BSOG claims in each of the next four financial years, that would suggest a spend of &#163;1,692 million if we had maintained the current BSOG rate. With a 20% reduction from 2012-13, we would expect spending of around &#163;1,438 million, a saving of approximately &#163;254 million.</p>

	<p pid="a.350W.2/1">This Government's vision is for a transport system that is an engine for economic growth. A key part of this is tackling congestion and the unreliable journey times that congestion generates.</p>
	<p pid="a.350W.2/2">In regard to local highway authority managed roads, we have published a Local Transport White Paper. It explains how the Government are placing localism at the heart of the transport agenda, and taking measures to empower local authorities when it comes to tackling issues, such as congestion, in their areas.</p>
	<p pid="a.350W.2/3">In addition we are intending to commit &#163;1.5 billion to local authority major transport schemes in the spending review period and a further &#163;560 million through a new Local Sustainable Transport Fund.</p>
	<p pid="a.350W.2/4">On the strategic road network, we are taking forward a range of measures. This includes investment in 14 new major improvement schemes and delivery of a new National Traffic Information Service to enable motorists to make informed decisions about how to avoid congestion and thereby contribute to its reduction.</p>
	<p pid="a.350W.2/5">The Highways Agency Traffic Officer Service continues to play a vital role in swiftly clearing incidents and incident related congestion. We have also recently completed a review of motorway closure incidents, focusing on what improvements could be made to reduce incident durations. We are committed to ensuring that any improvements identified from the review are taken forward by December 2012.</p>

The MOD is currently undertaking a comprehensive review of the estates and basing implications of the conclusions of the Strategic Defence and Security Review and the comprehensive spending review. This does include the consequences of the changes to the RAF's force structure, but also includes the basing, accommodation and training requirements in the UK of units returning from Germany; changes to the structure of the Army; reductions in the overall numbers of service personnel and MOD civil servants; and the requirement to achieve efficiencies from better use of the Defence estate. As a matter of routine business this work is being undertaken with the involvement of officials from HM Treasury, but it would not be appropriate to place correspondence from Treasury officials on the policy making process in the Library of the House.</p>

	<p pid="a.354W.5/1">The life of L16, L17 and L18 propellant charges in kinetic energy penetrator ammunition depends on whether the ammunition has been issued to operational (deployed) units or whether it is held in conditioned storage. In the case of deployed ammunition, the life of the charges is normally six months; for ammunition in conditioned storage this varies from between five and 10 years.</p>
	<p pid="a.354W.5/2">The life of the propellant charges used in kinetic energy penetrator ammunition is extended provided it is shown to be safe and suitable for continued service. This is demonstrated through a rigorous in-service surveillance programme. While there are currently no plans to replace the propellant charge used in kinetic energy penetrator ammunition, we do investigate options to replace existing charge systems when the current in-service systems can no longer be supported.</p>

	<p pid="a.354W.8/2">The standard service life of Bay Class Landing Ship Dock Auxiliary (LSDA) is 25 years as articulated in the staff requirement document and reflected in the Royal Navy Plan 2010. The Bay class LSDA when appropriately enhanced with aviation and surface manoeuvre assets (eg Landing Craft, Mexefloat rafts), has been suitable as a platform from which to deliver humanitarian aid such as RFA Largs Bay's contribution to the international humanitarian mission in the wake of the earthquake in Haiti in January 2010. When enhanced with aviation assets, Royal Navy and Royal Marine specialist manpower, it has been suitable for the task of Atlantic Patrol Task (North). For example, in December 2007 RFA Largs Bay had a successful counter-narcotics interdiction in the Caribbean in which the items seized had a street value of &#163;20 million. When enhanced with aviation assets, Royal Marine Boarding Teams and Royal Navy Medical Staff, the units have the capability to be employed as platforms conducting counter-piracy operations. For example, RFA Fort Victoria conducted a successful patrol in the Somali Basin in 2010.</p>

	<p pid="a.358W.0/1">As we set out in the Strategic Defence and Security Review (SDSR) White Paper (CM 7948) we plan to replace the Army's four regional divisional headquarters with a single UK support command and to close at least two of the Army's 10 regional brigade headquarters, thereby enhancing our focus on front-line capabilities. Detailed planning is currently being undertaken to examine how best to take the SDSR direction forward, taking account of work ongoing across all three services on future basing requirements. Announcements will be made in due course.</p>
	<p pid="a.358W.0/2">It is too early to say how many military and civilian posts will be saved by the reduction in the number of Army regional headquarters. It is also too early to say whether any civilian redundancies will be required either to manage these changes or to meet the MOD's overall civilian personnel reduction target of 25,000. Every effort will be made to avoid redundancies through the established measures laid down for managing surplus staff.</p>
	<p pid="a.358W.0/3">I can confirm, however, that they will be included in the 25,000 civilian staff reduction targets announced in the SDSR White Paper.</p>

	<p pid="a.358W.6/1">The coalition Government are committed to improving transparency and the coalition programmes include commitments to publish salary information for the most senior civil servants and to publish organograms for the entire organisation.</p>
	<p pid="a.358W.6/2">As a first step, the Government published the details of 345 senior officials in departments, agencies and non-departmental public bodies in post at <phrase class="date" code="2010-03-31">31 March 2010</phrase> whose rate of pay was &#163;150,000 or more.

	<p pid="a.358W.6/3">Although individualised salary details for the most junior level of the SCS (Pay bands 1 and 1A) were not released, the numbers and grades of staff in each of their teams and the total salary costs of the team were published.

We are now in a period of consolidating and embedding transparency processes into business as usual. We are always looking to go further and we will continue over the coming months to review, and where necessary improve, the quality and extent of data being released.</p>

Costs of the MOD's White Fleet are not included as they are not recorded on a monthly basis; however, we estimate that White Fleet contract and fuel costs averaged around &#163;4.5 million a month.

	<p pid="a.361W.7/1">The Ministry of Defence (MOD) does not yet have detailed estimates of the overall financial savings arising from the Government's rebasing policy, or a profile for the realisation of these savings over the coming years. Such information depends on the way in which the policy is implemented. This has yet to be finalised. The MOD can, however, provide details of expected savings in personnel costs. The latest estimate (January 2011) is that the saving to the Defence budget from repatriation would be approximately &#163;5.5 million per unit (approx 600 personnel) per annum-so approximately &#163;183 million per annum once all 20,000 personnel have been returned to the UK. This figure includes allowances, travel and subsistence and posting costs (approximately &#163;2.3 million per unit per annum) and approximately &#163;3.2 million per unit per annum in health care and education costs, because Defence is the sole provider for British soldiers and their dependants when posted in Germany. The MOD will also expect to make considerable savings in infrastructure and operating costs.</p>

	<p pid="a.370W.5/1">We remain deeply concerned by the regime's continued refusal to engage in dialogue with Aung San Suu Kyi and other democratic opposition and ethnic groups. The Government does not believe that the near completion of the regime's roadmap process represents progress. The regime is clearly intent on maintaining power. This is shown by the continued imprisonment of over 2000 prisoners of conscience, the deeply flawed constitution, manipulation of the electoral process, the rejection of the National League for Democracy's appeal against dissolution, and highly restrictive controls on freedom of expression. Human rights abuses also continue unabated, with ongoing arbitrary arrests and persistent corruption. Many civilians, particularly in ethnic areas, face regular threats of persecution, injustice and violence. We strongly urge the junta to work with the UN and all of Burma's political groups towards national reconciliation and a just political settlement.</p>

Whilst there have been no serious outbreaks of violence since the unrest of March-May 2010, demonstrations by both anti-government (Red Shirt) and nationalist (Yellow Shirt) groups continue in central Bangkok. The Red Shirts continue to demonstrate twice a month to mark the violent incidents that took place in April and May last year. Since January this year, the &quot;Yellow Shirt&quot; People's Alliance for Democracy (PAD) and the Thai Patriot Network have been demonstrating outside Government House over the government's handling of the ongoing Thai/Cambodia border dispute.

	<p pid="a.371W.5/1">Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) officials have regularly raised the issue of Tibet with the Government of China.</p>
	<p pid="a.371W.5/2">During 2010 FCO staff visited the Tibetan Autonomous Region (TAR), where they had meetings with local officials and raised issues relating to China's treatment of its ethnic minorities, and Tibetan areas of Sichuan and Gansu provinces. Staff have pressed for better access to the TAR by diplomats and foreign journalists. In the last 12 months FCO staff have been consistent in signalling the UK's hopes for a positive outcome to talks with the Dalai Lama. We have consistently expressed concern over the numbers of Tibetans in detention in TAR, Sichuan, Gansu and Qinghai in relation to the March 2008 unrest and the related death sentences. Officials have also expressed concern over cultural rights and religious freedom in Tibet. In 2011 FCO officials used the 19th round of the UK-China human rights dialogue to raise our concerns regarding the rights and freedoms of the Tibetan people, and urged China to renew its dialogue with the Dalai Lama.</p>
	<p pid="a.371W.5/3">We continue to monitor the situation in Tibet carefully.</p>

	<p pid="a.372W.8/1">We are deeply concerned by the recent increase in politically motivated intimidation and violence in Zimbabwe, in contravention of the spirit of the Global Political Agreement. In particular, we condemn the arrest and treatment in detention of 45 people for watching publicly available footage of events in North Africa, and the arrest of the Minister of Energy on spurious charges. We have made our views known to the Government of Zimbabwe. We urge all parties, including the security forces and the judiciary, to discharge their duties in an impartial manner.</p>
	<p pid="a.372W.8/2">Even though there has been considerable economic progress in Zimbabwe since the formation of the Inclusive Government in 2008, it has not been matched by equivalent political reform. It is clear that there is still a long way to go before the country can be considered stable and democratic. A number of key provisions of the Global Political Agreement remain unimplemented. And the general conditions necessary for free and fair elections have yet to be established.</p>
	<p pid="a.372W.8/3">We continue to engage with our international partners, including Southern African Development Community and South Africa, in support of their work on preparing a roadmap to elections.</p>

	<p pid="a.373W.10/3" class="indent">As Director General for the Office for National Statistics, I have been asked to reply to your recent questions asking i) how many birth certificates have been issued for babies born at under 21 weeks of pregnancy in each year from 2005 to 2010 (46721) and ii) how many death certificates have been issued for babies born at under 21 weeks of pregnancy in each year from 2005 to 2010 (46722).</p>
	<p pid="a.373W.10/4" class="indent">Information on gestational age (length of pregnancy) is not routinely recorded at the registration of live births. However, ONS links birth registrations to NHS birth notifications data to publish figures by gestational age. These figures are less timely than statistics based on birth registrations only. Figures are not reported for individual weeks of gestation but grouped at 'under 22 weeks', divided according to whether the birthweight is consistent for the baby's gestational age (under 1,000g) or inconsistent (1,000g or over). In the latter case, there may have been an error in the recording of either gestational age or birthweight.</p>

This is relevant for severe learning disabilities and autistic spectrum disorders as well as other health conditions and impairments, to ensure that the new assessment accurately and consistently enables support to be targeted to those with the greatest need. Both I and departmental officials have met with a number of disability organisations representing learning disabilities and autistic spectrum disorders, to discuss our reform proposals and to seek their views on how the new benefit can best support those with autism and severe learning disabilities. We are keen to continue to work with disabled people and their organisations to ensure that the training and guidance is right.</p>

Therefore, when an individual claims one aspect of universal credit (ie income replacement aspect), they will automatically receive amounts associated with their children and their housing costs. As a result, there will be an 'automatic passporting' effect for people who currently claim some, but not all, of the benefits or tax credits to which they are entitled.</p>

	<p pid="a.404W.2/1">Estimates of the reduction in poverty have been derived using the Department's Policy Simulation Model (PSM). The PSM is a static micro simulation model of the GB tax and benefit system based on data from the Family Resources Survey (latest available year 2008-09).</p>
	<p pid="a.404W.2/2">The PSM takes the FRS survey data and uprates it to the year of analysis (in this case 2014-15)-taking account of projected changes in benefit rates, earnings, other incomes and demographic change. It models the rules of the tax and benefit system and applies these to the data allowing us to calculate net incomes for each member of the sample. We are able to model a change in the tax and benefit rules and estimate the subsequent impact on household incomes and numbers in poverty.</p>
	<p pid="a.404W.2/3">The universal credit reform has been modelled in the PSM and takes account of the increase in take up which we expect to occur as a result of moving to a simpler, consolidated benefit. Numbers in poverty are compared under the tax and benefit system both with and without the universal credit. Poverty was estimated for children and working age adults on a before housing costs basis consistent with the definitions used in the Households Below Average Income Publication.</p>

	<p pid="a.410W.6/1">Calculations were based on the amounts of local authority central services equivalent grant (LACSEG), which are currently paid to academies that have converted from a maintained school. There are two elements to the grant: the proportion which the Department funds from the Dedicated Schools Grant that would otherwise go to local authority schools budgets, and the proportion that the Department funds from other sources, because it is in respect of services normally paid from other local authority funds. For the latter, on the basis of local authorities' financial statements provided to the Department under section 251 of the Apprenticeships Schools Children and Learning Act 2009, we estimated an average amount per pupil across all local authorities, and applied that to estimates of the number of pupils in new academies and free schools opening over the next two years. The resultant amounts were then reduced by the Department for Communities and Local Government to reflect overall reductions in local authorities' formula grant. The top slice totals are &#163;148 million in 2011-12 and &#163;265 million in 2012-13, and these are the amounts to be transferred to the Department to contribute to LACSEG costs.</p>

	<p pid="a.410W.9/2">In December 2010 the Young People's Learning Agency announced that the national funding rate for apprenticeships funded by the Department for Education would be reduced by 2% per year from 2011/12. This reflects the Government's commitment to ending the disparity in funding schools, colleges and work-based learning providers to deliver provision for 16-19 year olds and to reflect the better efficiency of the sector in delivering apprenticeships.</p>
	<p pid="a.410W.9/3">Quality in apprenticeships is assured through the &quot;Specification of Apprenticeship Standards for England&quot; which we published in January and will come into force in April this year. This sets out the minimum core content that can be expected in an apprenticeship. The Government are committed to not merely maintaining, but improving the quality of apprenticeships and to this end the National Apprenticeship Service has endorsed the publication and dissemination by the Learning and Skills Improvement Service of a diagnostic toolkit to help employers and training providers supply high quality training places.</p>
	<p pid="a.410W.9/4">The 2% reduction in the apprenticeship funding rate represents an equitable contribution to the savings required across the 16-19 education system. I am confident that the Government's priority for expanding and improving the quality of the Apprenticeship programme can be delivered whilst making these savings. As we grow the number of apprenticeships, the cost of delivery for providers will be reduced through economies of scale and where learners complete their training more quickly with no loss of quality, appropriate reductions in payment will be made.</p>

The Government have ensured there is enough money within the Early Intervention Grant to maintain a network of Sure Start Children's Centres, accessible to all but identifying and supporting families in greatest need. To date only the EIG funding for the financial years 2011-12 and 2012-13 has been announced and is only available by local authority-the figures for Birmingham city council and all other local authorities in England are available at:</p>

The base allocations for Sure Start Children's Centres for the financial year 2010-11 remain as announced at the start of the 2008-11 comprehensive spending review period. For Birmingham and England those figures are as follows:</p>

	<p pid="a.414W.2/11">The Department does not allocate funding at constituency level. It is for local authorities to determine how best to allocate available funding within their areas. The allocations for all local authorities can be found on the Department's website at:</p>

	<p pid="a.414W.2/13">Published allocations for Sure Start Children's Centres are not individually ring-fenced within the main revenue block of the SSEYCG and therefore are notional.

	<p pid="a.414W.2/14">In addition to the capital base allocation the Department had been able to offer some carry-forward of unspent SSEYCG capital funding from prior years. Given the unprecedented fiscal deficit the Department restricted carry-forward of SSEYCG capital (which includes Sure Start Children's Centres) to cases where funding was required for the completion of the children's centres programme, or where there was evidence of a contractual commitment either with a building contractor or for goods.</p>
	<p pid="a.414W.2/15">The Department's calculations of carry-forward are predicated on levels of expenditure from prior years. We are awaiting audited financial returns from a number of local authorities, at which point carry-forward for all local authorities will be finalised.</p>

	<p pid="a.416W.6/1">We know that communicating clearly is essential to good government. We have always worked hard to try to remove jargon and we continue to make sure that staff at all levels treat this as an important issue. Consequently we provide regular training.</p>
	<p pid="a.416W.6/2">For example, to promote plain English in departmental communications, we have produced a &quot;Style Guide&quot;-an internal tool containing advice on using plain English, writing for the web and A-Z of house style. We also regularly run writing workshops for our staff that focus on writing in plain English, making sure communications are tailored to the audience and are written in an appropriate tone of voice. This is an ongoing programme of work.</p>
	<p pid="a.416W.6/3">Our internal communications to staff are jargon-free, to help promote good practice. We have also featured a series of articles in our staff magazine on the importance of good writing skills and some tips on how to keep communications free from jargon and written in plain English. Each item of correspondence from young people 18 or under receives a reply from a Minister and we ensure that each reply is suitably tailored to suit the recipient's understanding.</p>
	<p pid="a.416W.6/4">To support the Department's work on reducing bureaucracy, we are also developing a programme to improve the quality, format, and clarity of our communications to schools and other frontline groups. This includes improvements to statutory guidance, consultations, and online content. We also regularly test the content and tone of communications with groups of frontline staff before they are issued, so that we know that they make sense to heads, teachers and others.</p>

	<p pid="a.419W.0/1">All of the funding streams specified above will have ended by the end of March 2011 and are replaced by the Early Intervention Grant. The Early Intervention Grant is a new un-ring-fenced and un-hypothecated funding stream that gives local authorities greater flexibility to target resources strategically and intervene early to improve outcomes for children, young people and families. This is a major reform and gives local authorities greater freedom to respond to local needs and target resources where they will have the greatest impact. The overall Early Intervention Grant is &#163;2,222 million in 2011-12 and &#163;2,307 million in 2012-13.</p>
	<p pid="a.419W.0/2">Against the background of greater flexibility to decide priorities locally, there are key areas of early intervention where the Government are ensuring that the overall grant provides support:</p>
	<p pid="a.419W.0/3" class="indent">Sure Start Children's Centres-Funding for Sure Start Children's Centres in 2010-11 was &#163;1.1 billion. We have ensured there is sufficient money in the Early Intervention Grant to retain a network of Sure Start Children's Centres, accessible to all but identifying and supporting families in greatest need.</p>
	<p pid="a.419W.0/4" class="indent">Short Breaks for Disabled Children: the Department will be providing &#163;198 million/&#163;202 million/&#163;206 million/&#163;210 million over the next four years.</p>
	<p pid="a.419W.0/5" class="indent">Early Education Places for Disadvantaged Two-Year-Olds: the Department will provide &#163;64 million/&#163;223 million/&#163;331 million/&#163;380 million over the next four years. For the first two years of the spending period, this funding will be routed through the Early Intervention Grant. Ministers are considering the most appropriate route for funding from 2013-14 when it is expected that a duty for local authorities to provide free places for all disadvantaged two-year-olds will come into force.</p>

	<p pid="a.419W.6/1">This is a matter for Ofqual, the independent exams regulator and I have asked Glenys Stacey, chief executive of Ofqual, to write to the hon. Member on it. I am aware that Ms Stacey has now done that and I will arrange for a copy of Ms Stacey's letter to be placed in the Library.</p>
	<p pid="a.419W.6/2" class="italic"> Letter from Glenys Stacey, dated <phrase class="date" code="2001-03-08">8 March 2001</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="a.419W.6/3" class="indent">Further to your Parliamentary Question asking whether the Office of Qualifications and Examinations Regulation will collaborate with universities in its work to monitor and improve the quality of A levels and GCSEs, I have three key areas of work being undertaken which you may find of interest in relation to this matter.</p>
	<p pid="a.419W.6/4" class="indentitalic"> Providing universities a role in the design and development of A levels</p>
	<p pid="a.419W.6/5" class="indent">I can confirm that Ofqual has been working in collaboration with colleagues from the Department for Education to establish how universities can be given a key role in the design and development of A levels in future. To date a series of workshops have been held with Higher Education representatives from different subject areas to identify the range of HE requirements for A levels and potential approaches for securing effective involvement.</p>
	<p pid="a.419W.6/6" class="indent">We shall take the outcomes to Higher Education management groups, awarding organisations and learned societies to establish how to arrive at a process to secure the involvement of Higher Education in future developments of A levels that commands widespread confidence in the sector.</p>
	<p pid="a.419W.6/7" class="indentitalic"> Monitoring work and Higher Education involvement</p>
	<p pid="a.419W.6/8" class="indent">In our monitoring work, Ofqual involves Higher Education as appropriate. For work such as scrutinies (in-depth analyses of individual qualifications) and standards reviews (comparisons of standards in a qualification over, say, a five year period) some of the independent subject experts that we use have a Higher Education background.</p>
	<p pid="a.419W.6/9" class="indent">In addition, for work that has a clear link with Higher Education, we invite Higher Education representatives as well as other subject experts. For the current international study we invited the university sector specifically (as the purpose of the review was to judge appropriate demand for entrance to UK universities).</p>
	<p pid="a.419W.6/10" class="indentitalic"> Recruitment of subject experts</p>
	<p pid="a.419W.6/11" class="indent">In order to ensure that recruitment of our independent subject experts is fair and open, Ofqual advertises annually to recruit individuals with subject and/or assessment expertise. It is from this pool that we draw our 'independent' subject experts. In most studies we additionally invite representatives from the regulators for Wales and Northern Ireland, awarding organisations involved in the study and learned societies to nominate representatives. We do not determine how these organisations select their nominees but they would be free to nominate representatives from Higher Education Where appropriate.</p>
	<p pid="a.419W.6/12" class="indent">I trust that this clarifies the situation and provides you with the information you require.</p>
	<p pid="a.419W.6/13" class="indent">Should you require any further information about this or the workings of Ofqual, please do not hesitate to get in touch.</p>

	<p pid="a.423W.2/1">The Government are committed to making regulation and inspection less burdensome and more proportionate to risk. Out of school clubs provided by maintained schools are within scope for inspection by Ofsted as part of routine school inspection. For those out of school clubs run by other providers that register with Ofsted, there is a briefer inspection arrangement.</p>
	<p pid="a.423W.2/2">Local authorities also have the power to investigate settings outside of schools where there are concerns about children's safety. As well as general safeguarding risks, there is clearly the potential in environments outside of school for children to be influenced by extreme views which are counter to democratic values and we have started to look in detail at ways to stop children coming into contact with such views alongside partners including Ofsted and the police.</p>
	<p pid="a.423W.2/3">Out of school provision can include anything from teaching at somebody's house to a large registered charity. This provision is mostly unregistered and therefore not subject to inspection, but we have asked Ofsted to look at options for improving public confidence in this sector and Ofsted will be writing to the Secretary of State shortly about this.</p>

Each pupil known to be eligible for free school meals will attract &#163;430 of funding which will go to the school or academy via the local authority or YPLA if the pupil is in a mainstream setting or will be managed by the responsible local authority if the pupil is in a non-mainstream setting.</p>

	<p pid="a.427W.5/3">The amounts allocated in 2011-12 will depend on the numbers of FSM and Looked-After pupils recorded on the January 2011 Censuses, so it is not possible to give precise figures for 2011 and subsequent years. We aim to extend the coverage of the pupil premium from 2012-13 onwards to pupils who have previously been known to be eligible for free school meals.

	<p pid="a.430W.6/1">Funding for the current one-to-one tuition programme for seven to 14-year-olds in 2010-11 is based on tuition in a school environment, provided by a qualified teacher, which includes 10 hours of tuition plus two hours planning time. The per pupil funding available for these 12 hours, plus schools' administration costs ranges from inner London area at &#163;426.72, outer London at &#163;413.72 and &#163;374.72 elsewhere. In addition &#163;17 million is provided to local authorities to enable them to support delivery of the programme.</p>
	<p pid="a.430W.6/2">We know that the number of pupils in maintained schools who did not achieve at least a GCSE grade C, not including equivalents, at the end of KS4 in 2010, were 199,661 in English and 221,817 in mathematics.</p>
	<p pid="a.430W.6/3">There is no current tuition programme targeted at 16 to 18 years and the costs of any new programme would be dependent on the volume of tuition provided, as well as any costs falling to central and local government to support delivery of such a programme to this age range.</p>

	<p pid="a.440W.0/1">The Department for Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS) has undertaken its own evaluation of various outreach activities and continues to monitor work done by others. BIS funded substantial monitoring and evaluation of activities which took place as part of the Aimhigher programme. The Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) has encouraged institutions to develop their approaches to evaluation, and organisations such as the Sutton Trust have undertaken evaluation of their own outreach activities such as summer schools. Sir Martin Harris's report &quot;What more can be done to widen access to highly selective institutions?&quot; (OFFA, April 2010) summarised the difficulties in isolating the effects of outreach activities from other factors influencing higher education participation, but concluded that there was robust evidence on the effectiveness of a range of outreach activities. The report highlighted evidence which showed that</p>
	<p pid="a.440W.0/2" class="indent">&quot;coordinated, sustained outreach works best&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.440W.0/3">and that schemes</p>
	<p pid="a.440W.0/4" class="indent">&quot;targeted at groups of very able students identified as having the potential to succeed in a selective institution, have been shown to significantly improve the likelihood of participants both applying to and entering such institutions.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.440W.0/5">It also made particular note of the evidence that university summer schools</p>
	<p pid="a.440W.0/6" class="indent">&quot;often delivered either in collaboration with Aimhigher or the Sutton Trust&quot;</p>

	<p pid="a.440W.0/9">In his guidance to institutions, issued this month, the Director of Fair Access has set out his expectation that those institutions charging the highest rates and with the furthest to go in widening participation, fair access and retention, should be doing most to protect access. The guidance includes guideline expenditure on access to help institutions in drawing up their own plans. The guidance also sets out a greater focus on outcomes, including through targeted outreach. The Director of Fair Access requires institutions to submit annual monitoring returns reporting on their expenditure on access measures and their progress against their agreed access targets. Institutions are expected to evaluate the impact of their plans with a view to directing expenditure at those access and retention measures that are most likely to succeed.</p>

	<p pid="a.443W.2/1">We believe that effective general practitioner (GP) commissioning will require the full range of clinical and professional input alongside that of local people. Nurses, allied health professionals (AHPs) and other clinicians all have a vital role to play and a real opportunity to develop services and improve the health outcomes of their local populations. In community services in particular, nurses and AHPs will have a key role in supporting commissioners.</p>
	<p pid="a.443W.2/2">The Health and Social Care Bill places a duty on the NHS Commissioning Board and GP consortia to make arrangements to ensure that they have appropriate advice from professionals with expertise in health. Appropriate structures to ensure nursing engagement are already evolving naturally in the GP pathfinder consortia areas with, for example, clinical cabinets with nurse representation. We believe, however, that the board and consortia should have the freedom and flexibility to decide how best they exercise this duty, rather than rely on rigid prescribed structures.</p>

	<p pid="a.443W.5/1">The costs associated with the treatment of patients in other European Economic Area (EEA) member states will ultimately fall on the commissioning bodies in the United Kingdom. It will be necessary to consider how this will work in future in England as part of the national health service system architecture changes.</p>
	<p pid="a.443W.5/2">The reimbursement of the costs of health services obtained by the patient in another EEA state is capped at the cost of the same or equivalent treatment which the NHS would have made available to the patient under the NHS. The directive reflects the accumulated case law established by the European Court of Justice, which is already implemented in the UK by regulation.</p>
	<p pid="a.443W.5/3">Since patients are only entitled to seek reimbursement up to the cap in respect of necessary medical care where the NHS would have made the same or an equivalent treatment available to them, the money for this is in principle already in the system. Similarly, provider bodies will be able to charge incoming patients the full WHS cost of treatment.</p>
	<p pid="a.443W.5/4">There may be additional costs associated with the directive-for example, in connection with the set up of national contact points and in administering the reimbursement of costs. However, these are still to be quantified and should be considered in the context of the requirements already placed upon the NHS to provide information to patients and to have processes in place for managing requests for treatment overseas and handling reimbursement.</p>

	<p pid="a.444W.2/1">The numbers of people who travel overseas for treatment is low. There is very limited information on the current levels of cross-border healthcare in Europe. Assessment is therefore not easy. Responsibility for these matters is devolved to individual primary care trusts in England (and health boards in the devolved administrations).</p>
	<p pid="a.444W.2/2">It is possible, over time, that the United Kingdom will see requests from more European Union patients for access to treatment in hospitals with particular specialist services, where perhaps there are capacity issues in their home countries. However, no provider would be required to accept any patient from elsewhere in the EU to the detriment of home patients. In addition, EU patients would be required to pay the full cost of national health service treatment in advance of that treatment happening.</p>

Cause code: A supplementary code that indicates the nature of any external cause of injury, poisoning or other adverse effects. Only the first external cause code which is coded within the episode is counted in Hospital Episode Statistics (HES). Codes in italics are those used to define assault. Knife wound: W26 Contact with knife, sword or dagger; X78 Intentional self-harm by sharp object; X99.- Assault by sharp object; Y28.- Contact with sharp object, undetermined intent. These four codes identify any sharp object, and therefore include (but are not limited to) knives.<br/> 3. SHA/PCT of residence: The SHA or PCT containing the patient's normal home address. This does not necessarily reflect where the patient was treated as they may have travelled to another SHA/PCT for treatment.<br/> 4. NHS Re-organisation: In July 2006, the national health service reorganised SHAs and PCTs in England from 28 SHAs into 10, and from 303 PCTs into 152. As a result data from 2006-07 onwards are not directly comparable with previous years.<br/> 5. Data quality: Hospital Episode Statistics HES are compiled from data sent by more than 300 NHS trusts and PCTs in England and from some independent sector organisations for activity commissioned by the English NHS. The NHS Information Centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies. While this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain.<br/> 6. Small numbers: To protect patient confidentiality, figures between one and five have been replaced with '*' (an asterisk). Where it was still possible to identify numbers from the total an additional number (the next smallest) has been replaced.<br/> 7. Activity included: Activity in English NHS Hospitals and English NHS commissioned activity in the independent sector.<br/> <i> Source</i>:<br/> HES, The NHS Information Centre for Health and Social Care</td> </tr>

	<p pid="a.452W.3/1">Through the national health service sickle cell and thalassaemia screening programme all expectant women are offered screening for sickle cell disease and thalassaemia. In addition all newborns are offered screening for sickle cell. This allows newly born infants with sickle cell disease to receive a definitive diagnosis of their condition, ensuring that prompt and specific treatment can begin immediately. The Department has supported initiatives to improve the management of the condition including, asking National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence to produce a short clinical guideline on the management of a sickle cell crisis in hospital, launching a national registry to identify patients with the condition and monitor care, and funding more NHS posts to increase the number of staff with specific expertise. However, planning local services is a matter for local commissioners.</p>

	<p pid="a.458W.5/1">Land Registry is under a statutory obligation to enter the price paid or value declared for the registered estate, where this is practicable (rule 8(2), Land Registration Rules 2003).</p>
	<p pid="a.458W.5/2">The onus is on applicants for registration to complete their transfers, leases and applications correctly and to provide accurate information as to the price paid. If there is no conflicting information as to the accuracy of the information provided, the registrar would not normally query the price or value.</p>
	<p pid="a.458W.5/3">The price paid may not represent the full market value of a property.</p>
	<p pid="a.458W.5/4">If it is obvious from a transfer or lease that a discount has been applied, Land Registry will enter the price paid as the lowest or net amount.</p>
	<p pid="a.458W.5/5">If it appears from a transfer or lease that there may have been a discount or cashback, and the actual amount paid for the property is not clear, Land Registry will requisition for the lowest or net price paid and will enter that as the price paid in the register. Generally, however, Land Registry will not raise a requisition merely to improve the price paid or value stated information in its possession.</p>
	<p pid="a.458W.5/6">Land Registry will not enter a price paid if it is not ascertainable or may be misleading, for example where there are portfolio transfers or transfers of a share in a property. If, for example, the price is not specified but is dependent on provisions in documents Land Registry does not see, or it cannot be calculated at the time of registration, then no entry will be made.</p>

	<p pid="a.465W.2/1">We have implemented a strategy to minimise the number of mobile phones entering prisons, to find phones that do get in and to disrupt mobile phones that cannot be found.</p>
	<p pid="a.465W.2/2">The Offender Management Act 2007 made it a criminal offence to convey specific items, including mobile phones and associated equipment into or out of a prison or to transmit sounds or images from within a prison. The Crime and Security Act 2010 will also make it an offence, with a penalty of up to two years' imprisonment and/or an unlimited fine, to possess an unauthorised mobile phone or other electronic equipment or component element that can receive or transmit information electronically within a prison.</p>
	<p pid="a.465W.2/3">Robust local security and searching strategies are key to addressing the risks presented by illicit mobile phones. A range of technology has been made available to prisons to strengthen searching and security, including portable mobile phone signal detectors, body orifice security scanners (BOSS chairs) and high sensitivity metal detecting wands which can detect internally concealed items such as mobile phones.</p>
	<p pid="a.465W.2/4">We are trialling a range of signal denial technology in a number of establishments; however, at this stage we cannot provide much detail for security and operational reasons. The trials confirm that denying signals in prisons is not a quick, simple or cheap option. It is highly technically challenging, given the nature of the different fabric and layouts of prisons, the need to identify technology that is effective at denying signals within prisons without adversely affecting signals outside the prison and ensuring compliance with health and safety and regulatory requirements.</p>

	<p pid="a.474W.2/3">We recognise that young people leaving custody are some of the most vulnerable young people in our society and that their effective resettlement is critical to breaking the cycle of offending. Young offenders have complex and wide ranging problems which require intensive support and access to services which can directly address their offending behaviour.</p>
	<p pid="a.474W.2/4">The recent Green Paper proposals set out how we are considering introducing elements of payment by results into youth justice to incentivise local authorities to reduce youth offending, of which resettlement is a key part.</p>
