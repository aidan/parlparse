	<p pid="b.575W.10/1">DFID as a whole has robust accounting and financial management procedures, governed primarily by HM Treasury's Government Accounting Manual and developed over 40 years of ODA/DFID experience. As a member of the OECD's Development Assistance Committee, DFID also complies with good international practice on aid management. We are applying both these systems and good practice in Afghanistan, and are also working closely with other Government Departments to ensure good practice and financial compliance in managing funds.</p>
	<p pid="b.575W.10/2">DFID currently channels around 75 per cent. of its &pound;102 million programme to Afghanistan through the Government's budget. This helps the Government of Afghanistan to deliver essential public services and to strengthen its public financial management systems. Most of this goes through the Afghan Reconstruction Trust Fund (ARTF). DFID has committed &pound;165 million to the ARTF over the next three years (2006-07 to 2008-09). The ARTF is administered by the World Bank. It reimburses the Government of Afghanistan for expenditures that meet strict eligibility criteria in order to reduce the risk of waste and corruption. The World Bank considers both the type of expenditures and the process by which the money was spent. An independent monitoring agent (currently PricewaterhouseCoopers) monitors and reports on this to ensure it is effective.</p>

	<p pid="b.576W.5/2">Links between rural and urban markets are important for economic growth and for allowing the poor to participate in that growth. One of the key constraints is the poor state of infrastructure linking rural and urban areas.</p>
	<p pid="b.576W.5/3">DFID is helping a number of countries in Africa to improve their road networks to link rural and urban markets. This includes specific projects to improve roads and transport services in countries such as Nigeria and Ghana in addition to budget support for implementation of countries' own infrastructure plans.</p>
	<p pid="b.576W.5/4">DFID support for information and communications technology (ICT) is also helping to build effective links between rural and urban markets. For example, the DFID-supported Business Linkage Challenge Fund is helping to boost the outreach of mobile banking in Kenya.</p>
	<p pid="b.576W.5/5">The Infrastructure Consortium for Africa was launched in London as a multi-donor initiative in October 2005. This is addressing regional infrastructure constraints to connecting markets across Africa, which will impact on rural-urban links. The UK has committed US $20 million for the work of the consortium.</p>

	<p pid="b.577W.2/1">The Post-Conflict Reconstruction Unit (PCRU) was established at the end of 2004 to help improve the United Kingdom's capacity to contribute to achieving a stable environment in countries emerging from conflict. It seeks to do so by working closely with Government Departments and the military to help (a) facilitate joint military-civilian assessments of the immediate challenges and opportunities in such countries; (b) facilitate joint military and civilian planning; (c) share lessons to further improve the effectiveness of UK activities in helping to stabilise countries and (d) enhance Her Majesty's Government's capability to deploy civilians overseas to develop and oversee implementation of these plans during their initial stages.</p>
	<p pid="b.577W.2/2">In the year since it became operational, the PCRU's achievements include:</p>
	<p pid="b.577W.2/3" class="indent">Facilitating an assessment and plan for the UK's engagement in Helmand Province in Afghanistan. It has provided seven staff and consultants over the last six months to support implementation of this plan in areas such as security, justice and governance, prior to the establishment of longer-term staffing by DFID and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO);</p>
	<p pid="b.577W.2/4" class="indent">Providing the majority of the staff of the strategic delivery unit in the British embassy in Kabul which helps ensure the overall coherence of UK assistance in Afghanistan;</p>
	<p pid="b.577W.2/5" class="indent">Providing the team leader and support staff for the UK-led provincial reconstruction team in Basra which co-ordinates and helps deliver UK, US and Danish capacity building assistance to the Iraqi Government in the south, focusing on Basra Province;</p>
	<p pid="b.577W.2/6" class="indent">Providing advice in other areas such as UK security and justice sector work in Yemen and assisting the AU/AMIS in the development of an initial six month communications strategy for the Darfur Peace Agreement; and</p>
	<p pid="b.577W.2/7" class="indent">working with the Permanent Joint Headquarters in military exercises to demonstrate the value of integrated civilian/military planning.</p>
	<p pid="b.577W.2/8">Currently, the PCRU has 28 personnel drawn from five Government Departments and agencies including DFID, FCO, the Ministry of Defence (MOD) and HM Treasury. In responding to requests for deployment this is supplemented by drawing on its database of 400 experts. The unit's &pound;10 million budget for 2006-07 finances core staff, deployment of these staff and consultant experts, and associated vehicles and communications.</p>
	<p pid="b.577W.2/9">The unit's work is overseen by the Defence and Overseas Policy (Conflict Prevention and Reconstruction) Committee (DOP (CPR)). The DFID permanent secretary is accountable for staffing and finance.</p>

	<p pid="b.580W.7/1">There are no current plans for a switchover to digital radio. However, section 67 of the Broadcasting Act 1996 requires the Secretary of State to keep under review the development of digital radio for the purposes of considering how long it would be appropriate for sound broadcasting services to be provided in analogue form. The first review in 2004 found that both the BBC and Ofcom agreed that it was premature to set a switchover date. We are, however, working with Ofcom and the industry to overcome the remaining potential barriers to digital radio.</p>

	<p pid="b.583W.3/1">I am answering this question on behalf of the Crown Prosecution Service, the Treasury Solicitor's Department, the Serious Fraud Office, the Revenue and Customs Prosecutions Office and HM Crown Prosecution Service Inspectorate.</p>
	<p pid="b.583W.3/2">For the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS), the figures available are as follows (all figures include VAT):</p>
	<p pid="b.583W.3/3" class="italic"> The COMPASS programme</p>
	<p pid="b.583W.3/4">The COMPASS programme is a 10-year public finance initiative partnership between the CPS and LogicaCMG to modernise information technology within the CPS.</p>
	<p pid="b.583W.3/5" class="indent"><i> (a)</i> When the COMPASS contract was awarded (December 2001 to begin April 2002) the value was estimated at approximately &pound;240 million over the period of the contract, based on the parameters at the time such as the number of sites and users and the legislative environment.</p>
	<p pid="b.583W.3/6" class="indent"><i> (b)</i> The estimated outturn cost to the end of the contract is &pound;408 million.</p>
	<p pid="b.583W.3/7" class="indent"><i> (c)</i> The outturn cost as at <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-31">31 March 2006</phrase> is &pound;122 million.</p>
	<p pid="b.583W.3/8">The difference between the original estimate and the most recent estimate of the cost of the contract reflects: higher staff numbers, a larger number of locations where COMPASS is available, improvements in service levels and the development of a new system to support witness care units, none of which could have been anticipated when the contract was let.</p>
	<p pid="b.583W.3/9" class="italic"> Finance and accounting record management system (FARMS)</p>
	<p pid="b.583W.3/10">FARMS is the CPS's finance and accounting record management system.</p>
	<p pid="b.583W.3/11" class="indent"><i> (a)</i> Original estimate for full life costs based on &quot;best and final offer&quot; September 2003: &pound;9.723 million.</p>
	<p pid="b.583W.3/12" class="indent"><i> (b)</i> Revised estimate for full life costs based as at March 2005: &pound;10.195 million.</p>
	<p pid="b.583W.3/13" class="indent"><i> (c)</i> Outturn to <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-31">31 March 2006</phrase>: &pound;6.103 million.</p>
	<p pid="b.583W.3/14">Managed service and support costs are indexed at 3 per cent. pa. The five-year managed service contract commenced in August 2004 and finishes in July 2009.</p>
	<p pid="b.583W.3/15">Other, smaller contracts (for example the payroll and HR systems and the corporate information system) began over five years ago and have subsequently been incorporated into the wider COMPASS programme.</p>
	<p pid="b.583W.3/16">For the Treasury Solicitor's Department the following table shows the originally estimated, most recently estimated and outturn cost of the five largest IT contracts agreed with outside suppliers over the last five years.</p>

	<p pid="b.586W.5/1">The Department always seeks a full range of views when drawing up and framing legislation. Consultation is a key part of the policy-making process; both informal and formal. The Department holds regular meetings with representatives of the principal stakeholder groups for our policy areas and with relevant experts. Organisations and individuals can also contribute to the Department's formal consultations which abide by the Code of Conduct on Consultation. Known stakeholders are generally alerted when a formal consultation is taking place. As required by the code, the Department then gives feedback on the responses received and on how the consultation process influenced the policy decision.</p>

Copies of the consultation paper were circulated to over 400 organisations and individuals with an interest in London's governance, and to all main public libraries in London. The proposals were also made publicly available on the DCLG and GLA websites. In addition the Minister for London hosted two seminars as part of the overall review, attended by a range of stakeholders. DCLG received 337 consultation responses and a summary of responses was published on <phrase class="date" code="2006-07-13">13 July 2006</phrase> alongside our conclusions on what new powers the GLA should be given. Most of these will be enacted by primary or secondary legislation and we intend to undertake further consultation as part of the implementation process.</p>

Last year, the Board published 'Well-maintained Highways' (TSO, July 2005), a code of practice for highway maintenance management, which encourages both a focus on the needs of road users and continuous improvement in delivery (which includes effective staff training).</p>

Both population projections and mid-year estimates are used in relative needs formula indicators. Population projections are also used to determine the relative needs amount, relative resource amount and central allocation as these are calculated on a per head basis.

	<p pid="b.593W.5/1">The explosive device disposal assistance provided to the Colombian armed forces by the MOD through its humanitarian de-mining training sits very well within the de-mining framework of the Human Rights Programme of the Colombian Vice-Presidency. The work of the latter is done through the Anti-Personnel Mines Observatory, as the Colombian Government's vehicle for the application of the Ottawa Convention.</p>
	<p pid="b.593W.5/2">The Observatory aims to achieve its goals by following an action plan that includes: the generation of knowledge and information on landmine issues, prevention, assistance to victims and removal of mines; promoting the solidarity of the international community for developing national actions in applying the Ottawa convention; education work to help prevention; promoting humanitarian de-mining; and regulating, disseminating, promoting, applying and monitoring various aspects of the De-mining National Plan, including the Regime of Collection and Destruction of anti-personnel mines.</p>
	<p pid="b.593W.5/3">MOD personnel providing de-mining training enter into consultation with personnel from the Anti-Personnel Mines Observatory to ensure the training we give ties in with their action plan. MOD humanitarian de-mining training affects the removal of mines, and promotes public education and awareness of landmine issues. Thus it is well positioned to meet a number of the Vice President's priorities.</p>
	<p pid="b.593W.5/4">The humanitarian de-mining training provided by the MOD in 2006 conformed to the International Mines Action Standards (IMAS) 2005. This is the acknowledged international standard approved by the UN and is used worldwide. We have an aspiration that for future courses Colombian students will gain IMAS accreditation through such training.</p>

	<p pid="b.608W.2/2">The majority of requests for the exchange of DNA information between the United Kingdom and other countries are routed through the United Kingdom National Central Bureau for Interpol (UK NCB) based at the Serious Organised Crime Agency (SOCA). Other channels may include bi-lateral direct liaison between law enforcement authorities: and formal mutual legal assistance channels. Exchanges of DNA information via these channels will almost always be a response to the needs of a specific criminal investigation.</p>
	<p pid="b.608W.2/3">Requests from international law enforcement agencies for a search of the National DNA Database are only processed where it is clear that the request is in the interest of prevention and detection of crime, national security or the data subject.

The establishment of UKHTC came as a result of the success of operation Pentameter, a national police led multi-agency operation which aimed to tackle trafficking for sexual exploitation and which led to 234 people being arrested. Of these 132 people have been charged, to date, with offences connected to trafficking.</p>
	<p pid="b.610W.11/4">Following on from the success of Operation Pentameter the UKHTC will support the overarching aim of moving the United Kingdom to a leading position in relation to the prevention and investigation of trafficking in human beings.

Two STCs and two SCHs, however, use a definition of self-harm similar to the Prison Service. Some STCs and SCHs were unable to provide this data for the earlier period covered by this Question because either the information was not collected, or only the total number of recorded incidents was collected (i.e. not only self-harm incidents; in which case it represented disproportionate cost to examine each incident report). In the future the YJB will provide clear definitions and recording requirements with respect to self-harm.<br/> <i> Note:</i><br/>  A new form specifically for reporting self-harm (the F213SH) was introduced in Prison Service establishments in December 2002 (i.e. in prisons, YOIs and juvenile prisons). The rise in reported self-harm from 2003 may therefore partly reflect improved reporting rather than an actual increase in self-harm incidents. Prior to December 2002. Self-harm was reported using the general incident reporting form (the F213), which resulted in significant under-reporting. The data from 2003 onwards cannot therefore be directly compared to earlier years.</td> </tr>

	<p pid="b.635W.3/1">There are now more people in work in the United Kingdom (UK) than ever before, up 130,000 in the last quarter and by 272,000 in the year to June 2006. At 28.94 million this is just over 2.5 million higher than 1997. There are fewer people out of work than in the last quarter and economic inactivity has fallen sharply, down by 121,000. There are currently 2,477,000 people between 50 and state retirement age who are recorded as economically inactive in the UK. When people over state pension age are included, this figure rises to 12,176,000.</p>
	<p pid="b.635W.3/2">Between 1979 and the mid 1990s, the number of people on incapacity benefits in Great Britain (GB) trebled. Growth in the caseload has since slowed significantly, and in November 2005, there were 2.71 million people claiming incapacity benefits, a fall of 61,000 over the year. Although 46 per cent. of those claiming incapacity benefits are aged between 50 and state pension age, between 2000 and 2005 the number of people in this age group fell by 52,000. This has contributed to the overall reduction in the incapacity benefits caseload.</p>
	<p pid="b.635W.3/3">Like other age groups, people aged 50 and over will be able to benefit from the rollout of the successful &quot;Pathways to Work&quot; service across Great Britain which will be completed by 2008. Pathways offers new incapacity benefits customers early support from skilled personal advisers and direct access to a &quot;Choices Package&quot; of employment programmes and clear financial incentives to make work pay. Any incapacity benefits customer will be able to access the support and help available on a voluntary basis.</p>
	<p pid="b.635W.3/4">Also like all other customers, eligible people aged 50 and over, including those above state pension age, can benefit from the range of services provided by Jobcentre Plus, including access to jobs and help and support to find work. This can include programmes such as new deal 25 plus (ND25 plus) which is mandatory for younger participants but can be accessed on a voluntary basis by people above state pension age who are in receipt of pension credit.</p>
	<p pid="b.635W.3/5">Additional help is provided to older people who do not find work quickly. new deal 50 plus is a voluntary programme for people who have been in receipt of benefits, including pension credit, for at least six months. It provides people in GB with advice and guidance from personal advisers, and access to in-work financial help through the 50 plus element of the working tax credit. Since April 2000, the programme has been successful in helping more than 150,000 older workers into employment. Once in work, new deal 50 plus customers can claim a training grant of up to &pound;1,500 for training of which up to &pound;300 can be used for life-long learning.</p>
	<p pid="b.635W.3/6">People aged 50 and over can also be eligible for help from ND 25 plus. People who have been claiming jobseeker's allowance (JSA) for 18 months, who have not previously participated on ND 25 plus, are required to attend the gateway stage of the ND 25 plus programme. This is a period of up to four months of intensive job search and specialist help and support to improve job prospects. This is followed by the intensive activity period (IAP) which is currently voluntary for people aged 50 and over. The IAP provides further support and pre-work training to help people return to work.</p>
	<p pid="b.635W.3/7">Since April 2004, we have been piloting mandatory participation in the ND 25 plus IAP for people aged 50-59 who have been claiming JSA for 18 months. The pilot has offered people in this age group more extensive help back to work. Interim results are positive and, as announced in our Welfare Reform Green Paper, we intend to commence a phased national rollout.</p>
	<p pid="b.635W.3/8">In terms of people facing redundancy, we work with employer and partner organisations, to provide access to a range of services aimed at helping people find alternative employment. The help provided will vary depending upon particular needs, not the age group of individuals, or the period of unemployment following redundancy. Typically, this involves the provision of information, advice and guidance about jobs and how best to secure alternative employment. In the case of large-scale redundancies that have a significant impact on the labour market, additional help, for example skills training analysis and job focused training can be provided through the rapid response service. This help is not age related but it is time bound to 12 weeks before and 12 weeks following someone being made redundant. In the event that these redundant workers have not found alternative work within this period they then access all the other Jobcentre Plus services stated. The rapid response service is available in England, Scotland and Wales although different processes apply within each country.</p>
	<p pid="b.635W.3/9">Through our Age Positive Campaign, we are working with employers and others to promote the business benefits of an age diverse workforce and best practice on age in recruitment, training and promotion. In May 2005 we launched the &quot;Be Ready&quot; national information campaign to raise employer awareness of, and ability to adopt, flexible employment and retirement opportunities to support the recruitment and retention of older workers in advance of age legislation due in October 2006.</p>
	<p pid="b.635W.3/10">The Department for Education and Skills has responsibility for apprenticeships and training grants. The development and delivery of programmes to help unemployed people in Northern Ireland into work is the responsibility of the Northern Ireland Office.</p>

It is clear that Pathways is helping large numbers of people with a mental health condition to move from Welfare to Work. In our qualitative research both personal advisers and Condition Management practitioners have provided individual examples of progression for people with mental health conditions.</p>

	<p pid="b.638W.2/1">The Post Office card account has allowed some customers, including pensioners, to get used to the basics of banking. In practice, there is no real difference in accessing money at the post office via a bank account compared to a Post Office card account. Customers can collect the same money, on the same day as they do now at the post office, by using a plastic card and a personal identification number.</p>
	<p pid="b.638W.2/2">Around 90 per cent. of pensioners already have access to a bank account suitable for direct payment. In making use of existing bank accounts, or opening new ones, pensioners will have a wider choice about where and when they collect their money. They will have the opportunity to make savings on their fuel bills by paying them through direct debit, the option to pay in cash as well as cheques, and to receive interest on balances.</p>

Funds in some local authority areas are directly funded, by the LSC, to other types of organisation, such as further education colleges and voluntary and community providers. In some cases local authority area population statistics aren't easily connected to the range of organisations receiving the ACL funding in that area. Therefore the attached data shows each local authority area within its local LSC area.

	<p pid="b.639W.6/1">Since 1997 we have increased investment in further education (FE) by &pound;2.5 billion&mdash;around 48 per cent. in real terms. Overall we are broadly maintaining funding for adults programmes at &pound;2.9 million although this will increasingly be focused on our priorities. I announced on <phrase class="date" code="2005-10-21">21 October 2005</phrase> our priorities for post-16 learning which are: raising participation and achievement of young people; driving down the skills deficit in adult workforce; and ensuring a wide range of learning opportunities at Level 3. I also reaffirmed our commitment to safeguard the funding for personal and community development in mainstream FE and local authority funded adult education with a budget of &pound;210 million in 2006/07.</p>
	<p pid="b.639W.6/2">The 2006/07 funding allocations for providers in the Gravesend area would have taken into account these priorities as well as local circumstances and need. It is essential that funding is prioritised on these areas if we are to address skills weaknesses and improve productivity.</p>
	<p pid="b.639W.6/3">Providers also have the opportunity, if they succeed in meeting employer needs, to access additional funding through Train to Gain, our new national employer training programme. If successful a provider's net funding position could therefore increase.</p>

	<p pid="b.641W.2/1">The Department carries out a nationally representative survey of all childcare providers annually to provide a range of data to help monitor progress towards meeting key government targets in the provision of childcare and early years services and to inform the strategic development of policy in this area. The nature of the data collection does not permit separate analysis of costs of provision for three and four year olds for each provider.</p>
	<p pid="b.641W.2/2">Fieldwork for the 2006 survey is currently under-way and will be completed in early September. Results from the survey will be published in spring 2007 and available on the DFES website at <a href="http://www.dfes.gov.uk/research">http://www.dfes.gov.uk/research</a>. Findings from previous years' surveys are also published on the DFES website.</p>
	<p pid="b.641W.2/3">Future work is under way in the context of the Comprehensive Spending Review considering the impact on the cost of provision of extending the free entitlement to 15 hours per week and increasing flexibility by 2010. My Department has announced that it will be exploring how to extend the entitlement through pathfinders in a selection of local authorities from April 2007. The pathfinders will also consider the funding implications of extending the free entitlement. Evaluation of the pathfinders will be published in due course.</p>

	<p pid="b.641W.8/1">The Government consider citizenship education an important element of the National Curriculum. The current review of citizenship will focus on the content of the curriculum and the broad themes upon which it is based. We recognise the significant role that Parliament and local government have to play in the education of young people and encourage teachers to organise lessons to include active learning about these institutions. Specific guidance on how to do this has been sent to all schools by the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority. Training teachers in the effective delivery of citizenship is a priority and we are funding 1,200 places for the continuing professional development citizenship certification course over the next two years. This is in addition to the 1,000 specialist teachers who will be trained by the end of this year.</p>

	<p pid="b.650W.0/1">It is too soon to assess the impact of the Fresh Talent: Working in Scotland Scheme on international student numbers. This scheme was introduced in June 2005 as part of the Fresh Talent Initiative to help to address the ageing and declining population in Scotland. International students are able to stay in the UK following completion of their studies under the Science and Engineering Graduate Scheme. This scheme was extended in May to enable all international students, on completion of a postgraduate degree, or an undergraduate degree in a shortage sector, to work in the UK for up to 12 months. The numbers of international students coming to English higher education institutions to study increased by nearly 60 per cent. between 2000/01 and 2004/05, the latest date for which figures are available. The Government recognise the benefits that international students bring to institutions, to the economy and to the country more generally. We also recognise that the international education market has become more competitive. That is why on <phrase class="date" code="2007-04-18">18 April</phrase> this year the Prime Minister announced the second phase of his international education initiative which is designed to secure the UK's position as a leader in the field of international education.</p>

Although that is not a disproportionate sum in view of the size of the budgets whose allocation the RAE informs, the bulk of those costs relate to the time that university staff spend preparing for the exercise. One of the main objectives of the consultation proposals on the reform of higher education research assessment and funding that my Department published on <phrase class="date" code="2007-06-13">13 June</phrase> is to devise a system to replace the RAE which continues to promote high-quality research but frees researchers from the administrative burdens associated with the RAE, allowing more of their time to be spent on academic work.</p>

	<p pid="b.655W.5/1">Sure Start Hollinwood was set up in 1999 and became a children's centre in 2004. Sure Start Local Programmes (SSLPs) carried out their own evaluations assessing progress against a range of outcomes for children, including educational attainment, as part of their local level monitoring and evaluation. Sure Start Hollinwood's evaluation of its first three years of operation and its other reports can be obtained directly from the programme or from the National Evaluation of Sure Start website <a href="http://www.ness.bbk.ac.uk">www.ness.bbk.ac.uk</a>. The Three-Year Evaluation showed how the programme had developed regular 10 week family literacy courses for children and their carers; supported four independent community based pre-schools allowing them to improve their curriculum and ran a six week group for children aged between 12 and 18 months providing parents with ideas on how they could help their children's early communication and allowing them to borrow 'chat bags' containing a book, nursery rhyme tape and musical instrument.</p>
	<p pid="b.655W.5/2">The impact of Sure Start Local Programmes nationally on children is being assessed through a comprehensive National Evaluation of Sure Start (NESS). It is too early yet to see an impact on educational attainment as the children being tracked through the evaluation are only just three years old. However, this is being assessed and results on this will be available in due course.</p>
	<p pid="b.655W.5/3">NESS is also looking at if and how the characteristics of SSLP communities change over time and early analysis shows that achievement at Key Stage 2 in Maths and English and proportion of children achieving five GCSEs A*-C has improved for children in Round 1-4 SSLP areas faster than in England though this cannot be attributed to Sure Start.</p>

	<p pid="b.661W.5/1">The General Dental Council, which is responsible for the registration of dentists practising in the United Kingdom, is bound by the provisions of European Union (EU) sectoral directive on dentistry, which governs recognition of dental qualifications. As with the directives relating to other professions, the intention is to facilitate the movement of professionals within Europe. Where an EU national and his or her spouse (who is not originally from the EEA) move between member states, the directive provides for an assessment as to whether the spouse's professional qualifications can be considered equivalent to a European qualification. EU law does not, however, allow such an assessment if they remain in the country in which they normally reside. A non-EEA national can still obtain full registration in the UK through the General Dental Council's international qualifying examination.</p>

	<p pid="b.662W.5/1">Primary care trusts (PCTs) are not involved in calculating the superannuation contributions of dentists. Dental providers give details of superannuable pay for each of their dental performers to PCTs and the PCT then enters the relevant details onto the NHS Business Services Authority (BSA) payment systems. The BSA then deducts the superannuation amounts from the monthly payments to dental providers.</p>

Analyses by the National Osteoporosis Society (NOS) in 2005 identified these SHAs, as listed as follows, as having the least available dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scanning capacity. The funding was allocated for the purchase of DXA scans, rather than DXA scanning equipment. Scans were mainly to be purchased from independent sector (IS) providers, but also from national health service providers where this represented better value for money. Expenditure against these allocations has not been monitored centrally, but it will be subject to audit.</p>

	<p pid="b.666W.2/1">We have recommended the use of face masks for health care professionals who would be working closely with infected patients. This is detailed in the national health service infection control guidance which is available on the Department's website at <a href="http://www.dh.gov.uk/pandemicflu">www.dh.gov.uk/pandemicflu</a> This guidance is evidence-based and sets out how protective clothing, including gloves, should be used to minimise the risk of NHS staff acquiring pandemic influenza while caring for symptomatic patients. Gloves are not required for routine care of patients with pandemic flu.</p>
	<p pid="b.666W.2/2">The chief medical officer commissioned the Health Protection Agency to review the scientific evidence for the use of face masks by the public during an influenza pandemic. This review did not find any clear evidence that such a policy would be of benefit. However, as with all policies relating to pandemic influenza, the evidence is regularly reviewed.</p>

	<p pid="b.667W.3/1">The Department has already introduced a number of policy initiatives which will improve the safety of women patients in mental health accommodation, including: single sex accommodation guidance in 2000; a national suicide prevention strategy in 2002; psychiatric inpatient care best practice guidance in 2002; mainstreaming women's mental health guidance in 2003; and management of violence guidance in 2004 to make in-patient services safer, including clear guidance on single sex accommodation to which national health service trusts are expected to adhere. This allows for men and women within the same unit, providing that there are separate sleeping areas, separate bathrooms and appropriate operational policies and procedures in place to ensure each patient's safety.</p>
	<p pid="b.667W.3/2">The Department's statistical note of May 2005, &quot;Elimination of mixed-sex hospital accommodation&quot;, shows that 99 per cent. of mental health trusts and primary care trusts which provide mental health services meet these single-sex accommodation objectives. We are working closely with the remaining trusts to ensure that they achieve the necessary standards as quickly as possible. This is available on the Department's website at: <a href="http://www.dh.gov.uk/assetRoot/04/ll/21/41/04112141.pdf">www.dh.gov.uk/assetRoot/04/ll/21/41/04112141.pdf</a></p>
	<p pid="b.667W.3/3">In 2005, the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence published guidelines on the management of violence in inpatient settings. Revised guidance on the management of aggression and violence is due to be published in September 2006 by the Care Service Improvement Partnership (CSIP), and this will also address issues of sexual safety.</p>
	<p pid="b.667W.3/4">The Healthcare Commission will include safety and the physical environment in their improvement review on acute inpatient care, commencing in autumn 2006 and reporting in 2007. The Healthcare Commission will also include sexual safety in its review of inpatient mental health services due to be carried out in spring 2007.</p>
	<p pid="b.667W.3/5">In addition, the Department will participate in national programmes which will build on existing initiatives of protecting vulnerable patients in mental health services with CSIP, the National Patient Safety Agency, and other agencies to ensure that reporting and appropriate investigation of all such incidents occurs. For example, CSIP together with the current joint Home Office/Department programme on domestic and sexual violence will discuss with mental health trusts what type of guidance is most needed to help support this.</p>

	<p pid="b.669W.8/2">Regular performance review meetings are held between the Department and NHS Direct. This review includes indicators in relation to the percentage of urgent and emergency referrals and the percentage of calls completed by NHS Direct without onward referral.</p>
	<p pid="b.669W.8/3">NHS Direct applies consistent methods to assess the clinical needs of people contacting them across the country. According to that assessment they give advice on self care, provide access to a nurse or, where appropriate, advice on seeing a doctor, or other part of the national health service. This ensures that people are able to access health services appropriately.</p>
	<p pid="b.669W.8/4">NHS Direct provides a 24-hour service, 365 days a year, that is shown in monthly patient satisfaction surveys to be highly valued by people seeking advice on health and health care.</p>
	<p pid="b.669W.8/5">The service is available through a variety of channels&mdash;by telephone, through the internet or through television sets in the comfort of one's own home. NHS Direct also provides medical and dental out of hours services for a number of primary care trusts and is developing a number of services to support and complement other NHS organisations, including pilot work to proactively support patients with long-term conditions, as well as pre-operative screening and post-operative follow up services. Its work to support people in their homes is an important contribution to the changes in services needed to meet people's needs as set out in the White paper, &quot;Our health, our care, our say, a new direction for community services&quot;.</p>

	<p pid="b.671W.0/1">Funding for primary care trusts (PCTs) is informed by a weighted capitation formula which determines their target shares of available resources to enable them to commission similar levels of healthcare for populations with similar healthcare need.</p>
	<p pid="b.671W.0/2">Four elements are used to set PCTs' actual allocations:</p>
	<p pid="b.671W.0/3" class="indent">weighted capitation targets which are set according to the national weighted capitation formula which calculates PCTs' target shares of available resources by adjusting PCT populations for age (to allow for different levels of health need in different age groups), additional need (highly correlated to social and economic deprivation) and unavoidable geographical differences in the cost of providing healthcare (the market forces factor (MFF));</p>
	<p pid="b.671W.0/4" class="indent">recurrent baselines which represent the actual current allocation which PCTs receive. For each allocation year the recurrent baseline is the previous year's actual allocation, plus any adjustments made within the financial year;</p>
	<p pid="b.671W.0/5" class="indent">distance from target (DFT) which is the difference between weighted capitation targets and recurrent baselines above. If the weighted capitation targets are greater than recurrent baselines, a PCT is said to be under target. If the weighted capitation targets are smaller than recurrent baselines, a PCT is said to be over target; and</p>
	<p pid="b.671W.0/6" class="indent">pace of change policy which determines the level of increase which all PCTs get to deliver on national and local priorities and the level of extra resources to under target PCTs to move them closer to their weighted capitation targets.</p>
	<p pid="b.671W.0/7">Because there are four elements to PCT allocations, it is not possible to state the financial impact of each adjustment in the formula.</p>
	<p pid="b.671W.0/8">There are separate components in the formula for different services: hospital and community health services (HCHS), primary medical services, prescribing and HIV/AIDS. Within each component, each adjustment for age, additional need and unavoidable costs is expressed as an index comparing the PCT score on the adjustment to the national average. These indices are listed in &quot;2003-04 to 2005-06 Primary Care Trust Revenue Resource Limits Exposition Book&quot; and &quot;2006-07 and 2007-08 Primary Care Trust Initial Revenue Resource Limits Exposition Book&quot; which are available in the Library.</p>
	<p pid="b.671W.0/9">The demands of a rural economy are reflected in both the additional need and unavoidable cost adjustments. The additional need adjustment recognises that access to services is more difficult in rural areas by including measures of distance to providers in the statistical modelling. The unavoidable cost adjustment includes an adjustment for emergency ambulance services where geographical cost differences are partly accounted for by rurality.</p>
	<p pid="b.671W.0/10">A full explanation of the elements in the weighted capitation formula and their weights is provided in &quot;Resource Allocation Weighted Capitation Formula Fifth Edition&quot; which is available in the Library.</p>

	<p pid="b.689W.11/1">Quiet Lanes is a Countryside Agency initiative that aims to maintain the character of minor rural roads. Guidance on Quiet Lanes has been developed by the Department in collaboration with the Countryside Agency.</p>
	<p pid="b.689W.11/2">For national consistency, all changes of speed limit are required by law to be clearly signed so that all road users may be aware of potential vehicle speeds and to allow drivers ample time to adjust their speed accordingly. This includes the beginning of national speed limits. However, the signing requirements seek to strike a sensible balance between driver awareness and unnecessary sign clutter and environmental intrusion. For example, repeater national speed limit applies signs are only required on roads where there are street lights.</p>
	<p pid="b.689W.11/3">The Department acknowledges that speed limit signs may not necessarily be in keeping with the aesthetic layout of the countryside. However, they are a vital tool in alerting drivers to a change in road conditions. We continue to work closely with Defra and the Countryside Agency to ensure speed limit signing is appropriate yet not unnecessarily intrusive.</p>

	<p pid="b.694W.6/1">The Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety has made no assessment of the number of trips made to and from hospital by cancer patients in 2005-06, or the travel and hospital car parking costs incurred by them.</p>
	<p pid="b.694W.6/2">Not all acute hospital Trusts charge for car parking; those that do have in place policies regarding exemptions for patients and visitors who must attend on a frequent basis over a short period of time. For example, Belfast City Hospital provides an exemption from car park charging to radiotherapy patients whose course of treatment requires them to attend on more than 10 occasions. Chemotherapy patients are similarly exempted from the cost of car parking if their stay is longer than four hours. This policy makes a distinction between those actually receiving treatment and those attending the hospital for another reason.</p>
	<p pid="b.694W.6/3">In addition, the Hospital Travel Costs Scheme provides for patients who are in receipt of certain state benefits, or who are on a low income, to be reimbursed for hospital travel costs, including car parking charges.</p>
	<p pid="b.694W.6/4">Decisions about charging for car parking at hospitals, and exemptions from such charges, are matters for individual health and social services trusts. I will, however, be asking trusts to review their policy in this area.</p>

	<p pid="b.700W.5/1">The number of domestic violence incidents reported to the Police Service of Northern Ireland is given in the following table. There is no official breakdown available by gender but it is known that women are the victims in the majority of reported cases. A strategy for addressing domestic violence in Northern Ireland, &quot;Tackling Violence at Home&quot;, was launched in October 2005. The strategy is aimed at providing protection and support to all victims of domestic violence, irrespective of gender or sexual orientation. All victims can seek information and advice through the 24-Hour Free-phone Domestic Violence Helpline which handles over 20,000 calls each year. Any victim of a domestic assault can seek protection from the police who will investigate, arrest the alleged abuser if power exists and prosecute where there is evidence of a crime. The police have trained Domestic Violence Officers in each District Command Unit. Alternatively a victim can apply to a court for a civil order (a non-molestation order and/or an occupation order) to prevent further abuse or exclude the abuser from the family home. There are 12 Women's Aid Refuges in operation across Northern Ireland for women and children fleeing domestic violence. Local Women's Aid Groups also provide a range of other services for women, including outreach and floating support for women who wish to remain in their own homes.</p>

	<p pid="b.705W.5/1">The Government does not issue guidelines on sentencing for any offence in Northern Ireland. Sentencing is entirely a matter for the independent courts based on case law and precedent. The role the Government plays is to provide the legislative framework and options within which the courts operate. To that end, in 2004 we introduced two new offences and penalties to deal with what is often inappropriately referred to as &quot;joy-riding&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.705W.5/2">We created the offence of &quot;Aggravated vehicle taking&quot; which is a vehicle being taken without consent, and which is then driven dangerously or causes an accident which results in injury, damage to property or damage to the vehicle. The maximum penalty for this offence is up to five years imprisonment, a fine, or both.</p>
	<p pid="b.705W.5/3">We also created the more serious offence of &quot;Causing death by aggravated vehicle taking&quot;. The maximum penalty for this offence is up to 14 years imprisonment, a fine, or both.</p>
