	<p pid="c.12W.2/13">The air conditioning system has been examined to establish areas where it can be switched off for periods of the day or week. Thermal efficiency has been increased by the introduction of 'tin foil' between the radiators and exterior walls to reflect the heat inwards in places where there are specific problems. Electric doors have been installed to isolate the loading bay and downward blowers have been put in place at exterior doorways to contain heat within the building. The IPO are also investigating insulating ceilings where this is cost-effective.</p>

	<p pid="c.18W.2/1">We are committed to improving choice and reducing barriers to ensure that there is fair access for all to the learning opportunities available. Further education operates across society, having a real impact on businesses, young people and adults, including those from disadvantaged and minority communities. In 2007-08, over 2.6 million people were participating in learning at a FE college.</p>
	<p pid="c.18W.2/2">This Government are fully committed to ensuring every young person has a fair chance of attending university. And we are making progress with the proportion of young entrants from lower socio-economic groups going to university increasing steadily, reaching almost 30 per cent. in 2007. A New University Challenge, with an investment of up to &pound;200 million, will establish new campuses, particularly in areas with no history of provision, and provide places for 10,000 extra students.</p>
	<p pid="c.18W.2/3">In January 2009, the New Opportunities White Paper announced a wide-ranging package of investment and support from across Government for people to make the most of their potential throughout their lives giving them lifelong chances to succeed.</p>

	<p pid="c.18W.5/20">Adventurous R and D projects such as these have an element of uncertainty and risk by their very nature. Exploitation strategies, which are commercially confidential, setting out how the project consortium plans to exploit the results are a key component of the business case submitted to the technology strategy board and can include the development of new products or processes, the publication of results or the stimulation of further work.</p>
	<p pid="c.18W.5/21">These strategies are re-visited during the course of the work and the technology strategy board have monitoring systems in place to encourage robust self-monitoring and to maximise exploitation during and beyond the project's life-time and to monitor the impact of projects at least five years after the end of the project.</p>
	<p pid="c.18W.5/22">While the projects funded under the innovation platform are at a formative stage, a majority of the legacy projects such as those led by Zytek and Ford have already resulted in excellent technical outputs, while the Morgan LIFECar have been presented at the Geneva Motor Show and been featured extensively in the UK press and media. The technology strategy board will now work to ensure that where appropriate, technical advances are incorporated into the relevant company development plans.</p>

	<p pid="c.36W.10/1">The consultation paper &quot;A Framework for Fairness: Proposals for a Single Equality Bill for Great Britain&quot; (June 2007), called for evidence of unfair age discrimination in the supply of goods, facilities and services. The majority of the nearly 750 responses on this issue (around 80 per cent.) were in favour of legislation to tackle harmful age discrimination outside the workplace, but only a small number of respondents felt that the marketing of products and holidays to specific age groups was discriminatory and very few felt that such marketing was harmful.</p>
	<p pid="c.36W.10/2">We have been taking forward discussions with relevant representatives of industry and stakeholders with an interest in age discrimination to better understand the benefits and consequences of the ban on age discrimination in the provision of goods, facilities and services we are including in the Equality Bill. These discussions have helped us develop an approach which takes account of the need to ensure that the legislation does not prevent service providers offering age-specific goods and services where this is beneficial or can be justified. We will consult on our detailed proposals for the exceptions from the ban on age discrimination in the summer.</p>

	<p pid="c.37W.2/1">We have always been clear that the legislation banning age discrimination in the provision of goods, facilities and services&mdash;to be included in the Equality Bill&mdash;will bite on harmful age discrimination and allow justifiable and beneficial age-based practices to continue.</p>
	<p pid="c.37W.2/2">The legislation will not prevent different treatment on grounds of age in the provision of insurance, where this is based on actuarial evidence. Nor will it prevent holidays for particular age groups.</p>

Most are pre-development, comprising sites which have yet to be allocated for development in a development plan, those allocated without planning permission, and those with planning permission but yet to be developed. In the hon. Gentleman's constituency, the Commissioners are jointly promoting the Bognor Regis Eco Quarter proposal with other landowners.

These personnel compete along side non-service candidates and must pass selection by the Admiralty Interview Board. The schemes are: Upper Yardmen and Royal Marine Corps Commissions to provide opportunities for promotion to commissioned ranks open to those aged under 26; and RN Senior Upper Yardman and RM Senior Corps Commission open to those over the age of 26.</p>

	<p pid="c.49W.2/8">For those who are not selected for a direct entry commission from the ranks, then after nine years service (from age 21), and having attained the rank of sergeant, all soldiers are eligible to apply for a late entry (LE) commission up to 44 years of age (waivers can be applied for older applicants).</p>
	<p pid="c.49W.2/9" class="italic"> Direct Entry/Late Entry Balanc e</p>
	<p pid="c.49W.2/10">Over the last decade, the Army has adjusted its balance from 25 per cent. LE/75 per cent. DE to 33 per cent. LE/67 per cent. DE as greater demand for LE officers has emerged. LE officers do have differing terms of service from DE officers, principally to accelerate their promotion given their average commissioning age of 40. They are widely employed and compete up to the rank of Lt Col with DE officers for appointments.</p>

	<p pid="c.63W.6/1">The European Initiative on the Exchange of Young Officers Inspired by Erasmus, sometimes known as military Erasmus, is focussed on European exchanges at the initial officer level.</p>
	<p pid="c.63W.6/2">The UK's initial training for officers is conducted at separate single service institutions. These three different courses all last approximately one academic year. The training has a strong focus on UK specific elements such as legal issues and specialist equipment training, with the aim to prepare officers for the next stage in their training on more specialist military courses. It would therefore not be practical to train officers at other nations' institutions.</p>
	<p pid="c.63W.6/3">The importance of education in international issues is recognised and is included in initial training for junior officers, but is covered in more depth later as officers' careers begin to include more staff appointments and as they begin to attend staff officer training such as the Intermediate Command and Staff Course, typically undertaken between the ages of 29 and 32. Similarly the higher proportion of, and the opportunity for, exchange training for UK officers comes later in officers' careers.</p>

	<p pid="c.82W.2/1">DEFRA's annual report gives estimated figures for its total spending in 2009-10 on animal health issues through Animal Health area offices and activities and the Veterinary Laboratories Agency, and on research and development directed towards improving agricultural production and productivity, but expenditure under these headings is not regionalised and so no separate figure for the south-west of England can be given.</p>
	<p pid="c.82W.2/2">Improving the competitiveness of the agriculture and forestry sectors is one of the objectives of Axis 1 of the Rural Development Programme for England (RDPE). In the south-west, Axes 1 and 3 of the RDPE are delivered by the South West Regional Development Agency (SWRDA). DEFRA has made an indicative allocation of &pound;30.27 million to SWRDA for Axis 1 and 3 in 2009-10.</p>

	<p pid="c.84W.8/1">I can confirm that information relating to DEFRA's performance against the energy efficiency per metre square Sustainable Operations on the Government Estate (SOGE) target is available on the Sustainable Development Commission website.</p>
	<p pid="c.84W.8/2">DEFRA has an ongoing programme of work to improve the energy efficiency of its estate. A key element of this programme is to reduce the size of the DEFRA Estate and make more efficient use of the existing portfolio. To date this strategy has resulted in an overall reduction in energy consumption across the estate, but has had a negative effect on the energy efficiency per metre squared.</p>
	<p pid="c.84W.8/3">Also, over the past four years, DEFRA has increased its capability to investigate and respond to animal and plant disease outbreaks. This work is carried out in energy intensive high containment laboratories which are regulated by strict legislation. It is accepted by energy efficiency expert bodies such as the Building Research Establishment (BRE) and the Chartered Institute of Building Services Engineers (CIBSE) that energy efficiency of laboratory buildings cannot be calculated solely on a floor space basis. 75 per cent. of the DEFRA Estate's total energy consumption is used for laboratory activities.</p>
	<p pid="c.84W.8/4">It should be noted that the DEFRA office estate is performing well, and if SOGE target for energy efficiency related solely to the office estate, DEFRA would currently be within 4 per cent. of achieving the target.</p>

	<p pid="c.88W.8/1">As a result of structural changes to the Department and to meet cross-Government targets to reduce headcount within Departments DEFRA has managed the exit of a number of staff over recent years. The initial investment in reducing the headcount will lead to significantly reduced future pay costs on staff.</p>
	<p pid="c.88W.8/2">These included both voluntary and involuntary leavers to whom payments were made. As is common to other Government Departments, the structures of these payments were based on the rules contained within the Civil Service Pension Scheme.</p>
	<p pid="c.88W.8/3">For staff leaving on compulsory or flexible early severance terms, or in receipt of a statutory redundancy payment, the size of the package represents the lump sum compensation payment made.</p>
	<p pid="c.88W.8/4">For staff leaving on compulsory, flexible or approved early retirement terms, the size of the package includes:</p>
	<p pid="c.88W.8/5" class="indent">any lump sum compensation payment made on departure (compulsory terms only);</p>
	<p pid="c.88W.8/6" class="indent">the capitalised cost of paying a pension or annual compensation payment (ACP) before pension age;</p>
	<p pid="c.88W.8/7" class="indent">the cost of any pension enhancement (compulsory and flexible terms only) and the cost of bringing forward the payment of the pension lump sum (for those in classic).</p>
	<p pid="c.88W.8/8">These figures are therefore the initial provision for the early departure liabilities caused by the staff's departures and include any cash payments made during the period.</p>

	<p pid="c.96W.5/2"><i> </i>The Environment Agency completed actions in response to the urgent recommendation from Sir Michael Pitt's interim report in August 2008 which stated</p>
	<p pid="c.96W.5/3" class="indent">'The Review recommends that the Environment Agency, supported by local authorities and water companies, should urgently identify areas at highest risk from surface water flooding where known, inform Local Resilience Forums and take steps to identify remaining high risk areas over the coming months'.</p>
	<p pid="c.96W.5/4">The Environment Agency sent map data to Local Resilience Forums to help them plan their response to surface water flooding emergencies.</p>
	<p pid="c.96W.5/5">The information on the maps is still under development and is for emergency planning purposes. The maps give an indication of the broad areas likely to be susceptible to surface water flooding based upon an extreme summer rainfall event with no drainage systems working. The information is not sufficiently accurate to use for individual properties. For example, it excludes the impact of buildings and kerb heights on surface water flows which at the local level can be significant. There will be properties at risk from surface water flooding that will not be included in the outline areas on the maps. The Environment Agency has not published the maps because of these uncertainties.</p>
	<p pid="c.96W.5/6">The Environment Agency is committed to providing the public and businesses with accurate and meaningful information about surface water flood risk in conjunction with local authorities and water companies in the future. Work is ongoing to validate the model results against historic surface water flood events. The information will be published once there is confidence in the results.</p>
	<p pid="c.96W.5/7">I have balanced the need to share surface water flood risk data with the public against the risks of publishing nationally un-validated data based on extreme scenarios for some types of surface water flooding. The public interest is best served by the current situation where Local Resilience Forums have information that will help them plan for emergencies and it is better to wait until more reliable data is available before publishing the Environment Agency's maps. In the meantime, members of the public can purchase maps on surface water flooding on the internet from at least one commercial company.</p>

	<p pid="c.97W.2/8">&pound;4.67 million has been spent during 2008-09 on the general maintenance of river and tidal defences in Essex by the Anglian Eastern Area of the Environment Agency. Work has been carried out across the county at many locations, covering routine maintenance and one-off repairs to defences and structures, and is not broken down into specific schemes.</p>
	<p pid="c.97W.2/9">The following Capital Flood Defence schemes in the Essex Catchment have received funding during 2008-09 and will continue into the next five years.

	<p pid="c.99W.2/1">The Government are taking steps on a number of fronts to help local authorities and the Environment Agency tackle fly-tipping, an antisocial activity which can blight both urban and rural areas.</p>
	<p pid="c.99W.2/2">DEFRA's illegal waste activity action plan, as set out in the England Waste Strategy 2007, aims to reduce fly-tipping through better prevention, detection and risk-based enforcement. The main measures are:</p>
	<p pid="c.99W.2/3" class="indent">new powers for local authorities and the Environment Agency to instantly seize vehicles that are involved in waste crime, implementing a power established by the Clean Neighbourhoods and Environment Act 2005. These powers are scheduled to be introduced later this year and should act as an effective deterrent, as well as helping regulators to build more effective prosecutions;</p>
	<p pid="c.99W.2/4" class="indent">improving the waste carrier registration system and promoting&mdash;through more user friendly guidance&mdash;the waste duty of care so that the law around carrying waste is better understood by businesses and easier for authorities to enforce;</p>

	<p pid="c.99W.2/6">There are various sources of support, advice and guidance on fly-tipping available to local authorities:</p>
	<p pid="c.99W.2/7" class="indent">DEFRA is funding Encams (&quot;Keep Britain Tidy&quot;) to offer bespoke advice to local authorities requiring assistance with their anti-fly-tipping strategies. Forty authorities received this assistance in 2008-09 and further funding is now in place to assist additional authorities in the coming year. This will be supported by a CD-Rom, being distributed to local authorities during April 2009, which offers authorities a single source of information on legal, detection and enforcement issues around fly-tipping, as well as best practice case studies.</p>
	<p pid="c.99W.2/8" class="indent">DEFRA also funded the Environment Agency to develop the Flycapture Enforcement training programme which aims to help local authorities to take appropriate enforcement action in response to fly-tipping incidents. Training courses, delivered by Encams and the Chartered Institute of Waste Management (CIWM), are available around the country.</p>
	<p pid="c.99W.2/9" class="indent">The fly-tipping protocol sets out the circumstances in which either a local authority or the Environment Agency deals with a particular incident and is supported by various other guidance documents linked to the Flycapture database.</p>

	<p pid="c.102W.2/2">In addition to further research and development and an education and awareness programme, we will be looking to reduce the level of disease by removing infected and susceptible plants in woodlands and the wider environment, as well as identifying and controlling any new outbreaks. Experience has shown that the eradication of Rhododendron ponticum (the main host for the diseases) is the most effective control measure to reduce disease spread in the wider environment. At a selected number of woodland sites, the clearance of all rhododendrons, whether infected or not, has proved effective and appears to have prevented further infection of trees on those sites.</p>

	<p pid="c.108W.9/5" class="indent">When the service was set up initially Jobcentre Plus had 800 Crisis Loan Decision Makers answering telephones and making decisions in the 20 Crisis Loan Benefit Delivery Centres. Due to an unprecedented rise in Crisis Loan applications which has more than doubled since October 2006, taking us to an average of 220,000 applications per month, plans were put in place to deploy an extra 700 staff from our Contact Centre Directorate to take Crisis Loan calls. The conversion of these 700 Contact Centre staff to offer the full telephone application and decision making process for Crisis Loans is due for completion by April 2009.</p>
	<p pid="c.108W.9/6" class="indent">This year we have seen further increases in applications to 275,000 for January and 272,000 for February 2009. Therefore, a decision has been made to increase our staff over the next year by an extra 300. This will take us to 1,800 Decision Makers overall.</p>

	<p pid="c.116W.0/1">One of the core recommendations from the Gregg review of conditionality was the creation of a new 'Progression to Work' group. Gregg recommends that this new approach should be for those people who may not be ready to work immediately, but who with the right mix of support and encouragement could get back into employment. This model would apply to employment and support allowance claimants (other than those in the employment and support allowance support group) and lone parents, and partners of benefit recipients, with children aged one to six. The Progression to Work pathfinders have been created as a result of this recommendation.</p>
	<p pid="c.116W.0/2">The claimants involved in the Progression to Work group will be required to actively engage with their adviser on an ongoing basis to consider, discuss and agree an action plan comprising activities they think will improve their prospects of moving back into work. They must then undertake these agreed activities as part of their own journey towards employment following directions from advisers where these are strictly necessary. This will be underpinned with recourse to sanctions for those failing to engage with support without good cause. However, although still in the Progression to Work group, lone parents and partners of benefit recipients, with children aged one and two will be encouraged, rather than required, to undertake work related activity and will not be sanctioned for refusing to undertake work related activity.</p>
	<p pid="c.116W.0/3">This pathfinder will cover approximately 10 to 15 per cent. of the new employment and support allowance claimants and parents with a youngest child aged between one and less than seven nationally. Based on current inflows, this equates to roughly 65,000 employment and support allowance claimants, 60,000 lone parents and 10,000 partners of benefit recipients each year. These pathfinders are anticipated to begin in late 2010 and last for two years. They are likely to be across six districts and delivery will be a mixture of provider led and Jobcentre Plus led.</p>
	<p pid="c.116W.0/4">The Progression to Work pathfinders will not cover any existing employment and support allowance claimants.</p>
	<p pid="c.116W.0/5">The Invest to Save pathfinders will not cover any new employment and support allowance claimants; it is planned that the pathfinders will cover existing incapacity benefits customers only, following migration to employment and support allowance. Based on published caseload projections, we estimate that approximately 17 per cent. of existing customers will be covered by these pathfinders. Estimates will be refined as part of the tendering process for the pathfinders and will be published at the Pre-Qualification-Questionnaire stage.</p>
	<p pid="c.116W.0/6">The Invest to Save pathfinders will not cover any existing employment and support allowance claimants; the pathfinders will cover existing incapacity benefits customers only.</p>
	<p pid="c.116W.0/7">We anticipate the Personalised Employment Programme pilots will, subject to the passage of legislation, cover approximately 6 per cent. of new employment and support allowance claimants. This equates to roughly 35,000 new employment and support allowance claimants annually, based on current inflows.</p>

	<p pid="c.119W.2/5" class="indent">We do not have comprehensive information on the numbers of people made redundant from Woolworths who have found work through Jobcentre Plus as we do not record job outcomes achieved for former employees of particular employers: to do so would be prohibitively expensive. We do however know that large numbers of people who worked in Woolworths have found new work with Jobcentre Plus' help. In the retail sector, the skills, experience and knowledge of former Woolworths' employees have proven attractive to new employers.</p>
	<p pid="c.119W.2/6" class="indent">Our support for Woolworths' staff began with deployment of our Rapid Response Service, which meant for example that staff in almost all of Woolworths' stores were offered support before they closed. We issued over 8,000 packs to enable people to make claims for benefit, and in many instances provided on-site advice on benefits. Our advice and support on jobsearch has also been available to Woolworths' employees, both in the run up to store closure and afterwards.</p>

	<p pid="c.119W.8/4" class="indent">Jobcentre Plus Customer Service Directors constantly review their service delivery plans to ensure optimum provision of service for all customers, for every Jobcentre Plus District.

	<p pid="c.119W.8/5" class="indent">In addition to our network of modernised Jobcentres we make our services accessible to customers by providing a range of support through outreach, often delivering advisory and other support on partners' premises. That is important in locations where maintaining a Jobcentre could not be justified. Typically such services can be delivered in partnership with Children's Centres or on Local Authority premises or in conjunction with one of our Welfare to Work Providers.</p>

	<p pid="c.120W.2/4" class="indent">54 Jobcentre Plus offices were closed during 2008 that were previously open to the public. During the summer of 2008 every Jobcentre Plus district was asked to begin a review of their service delivery plans, taking account of current economic conditions and future changes. That initial review led to a decision, announced before Christmas, to suspend the planned closure of 25 Jobcentres. A further three small sites in London were closed during March 2009. These had been announced last summer prior to the decision to suspend future closures. No further Jobcentre closures are planned at the present time.</p>
	<p pid="c.120W.2/5" class="indent">The great majority of our services (in common with most large, modern organisations) are now delivered through the telephone and internet. For example, to give customers more convenient access, we have around half a million vacancies on-line at any time (our website receives close to one million job searches every working day), and new claims to benefit are predominantly taken by telephone with some taken on-line.

	<p pid="c.122W.0/3" class="indent">The Secretary of State has asked me to reply to your questions asking what estimate he has made of the level of sickness absence attributable to work-related stress among staff in jobcentres in <i> (a) </i>Hemel Hempstead and <i> (b)</i> Hertfordshire in the latest period for which figures are available; and what assessment he has made of the effect of such levels of absence on the delivery of jobcentre services. This is something that falls within the responsibilities delegated to me as Acting Chief Executive of Jobcentre Plus.</p>
	<p pid="c.122W.0/4" class="indent">Jobcentre Plus do not collect absence data specific to work related stress, as the causes of stress are complex and difficult to attribute to a single cause. We do, however, collect detailed data on the causes of sickness absence, including absences attributed to mental health problems, and through close monitoring are able to identify problem areas.</p>
	<p pid="c.122W.0/5" class="indent">Jobcentre Plus is very aware of the negative impact of sickness absence on customer service and is committed to improving performance in this area. Indeed, our strategies are delivering considerable success, with the latest data confirming the improving trend we have seen over the last 12 months. We remain committed to securing further improvements.</p>
	<p pid="c.122W.0/6" class="indent">Stress management and prevention are fundamental aspects of this approach, and we have a number of tools to support managers and staff achieve these objectives. These include risk assessment policies, developed by our psychologists, in consultation with the Health and Safety Executive, to identify working practices that might create pressure and to address stress experienced by individual employees regardless of the cause. These are supplemented by comprehensive lifestyle guidance for all staff on how to reduce personal stress levels.</p>
	<p pid="c.122W.0/7" class="indent">Stress prevention is integral to wellbeing products available to all staff. For example, our people have 24-hour access to professional stress counsellors and to debt/legal advice free of charge. We also help managers to support their staff by providing them with access to medical advice provided by occupational health doctors and nurses.</p>
	<p pid="c.122W.0/8" class="indent">In addition, we are embarking upon a major health and wellbeing programme across all of our sites. The programme provides staff with a wealth of information and guidance to support healthier lifestyles, gives them access to a confidential on-line health and wellbeing assessment and delivers targeted solutions to support the individual.

At that time, as part of our Welfare to Work strategy, Jobcentre Plus expanded the Personal Adviser role to include specialist advisers for specific client groups, for example lone parents and customers aged over 50. This change was to improve the help it provides to customers who face additional barriers in returning to employment.</p>

	<p pid="c.124W.8/3" class="indent">The Secretary of State has asked me to reply to your questions asking what assessment has been made of levels of sickness absence attributable to work-related stress in jobcentres in Cumbria and Copeland constituencies, and what assessment he has made of the effect of such levels of absence on the delivery of jobcentre services. This is something that falls within the responsibilities delegated to me as Acting Chief Executive of Jobcentre Plus.</p>
	<p pid="c.124W.8/4" class="indent">Jobcentre Pus do not collect absence data specific to work related stress, as the causes of stress are complex and difficult to attribute to a single cause. We do, however, collect detailed data on the causes of sickness absence, including absences attributed to mental health problems, and through close monitoring are able to identify problem areas.</p>
	<p pid="c.124W.8/5" class="indent">Jobcentre Plus is very aware of the negative impact of sickness absence on customer service and is committed to improving performance in this area. Indeed, our strategies are delivering considerable success, with the latest data confirming the improving trend we have seen over the last 12 months. We remain committed to securing further improvements.</p>
	<p pid="c.124W.8/6" class="indent">Stress management and prevention are fundamental aspects of this approach, and we have a number of tools to support managers and staff achieve these objectives. These include risk assessment policies, developed by our psychologists, in consultation with the Health and Safety Executive, to identify working practices that might create pressure and to address stress experienced by individual employees regardless of the cause. These are supplemented by comprehensive lifestyle guidance for all staff on how to reduce personal stress levels.</p>
	<p pid="c.124W.8/7" class="indent">Stress prevention is integral to wellbeing products available to all staff. For example, our people have 24-hour access to professional stress counsellors and to debt/legal advice free of charge. We also help managers to support their staff by providing them with access to medical advice provided by occupational health doctors and nurses.</p>
	<p pid="c.124W.8/8" class="indent">In addition, we are embarking upon a major health and wellbeing programme across all of our sites. The programme provides staff with a wealth of information and guidance to support healthier lifestyles, gives them access to a confidential on-line health and wellbeing assessment and delivers targeted solutions to support the individual. The programme also provides managers at our Jobcentres with comprehensive information about the potential health risks to their staff, ensuring specific preventative action is taken to address the issues.</p>

These figures are planning assumptions only and do not reflect an official view of numbers of unemployed people or the duration of unemployment.

Among the actions agreed, we have been prepared to consider re-profiling the payment of the service fee element, to reflect more closely the expenditure and income generation of providers. This re-profiling does not, overall, change the contractual terms, the value or the total amount payable for outcomes against the service fee or the overall performance expectations. Each contract is being looked at on an individual basis and of the 11 providers involved, we have agreed to re-profile in nine cases.</p>

	<p pid="c.133W.5/1">There is a body of published scientific research on voice risk analysis, but there is no published research on the efficacy of the technology when applied to benefit claims. The Department is therefore conducting its own research into the efficacy of voice risk analysis based on trials by local authorities and Jobcentre Plus. The Department's evaluation is being conducted by departmental statisticians who are bound by a National Code of Practice. The Department has not commissioned any independent bodies or service providing contractors to conduct an evaluation.</p>

Each local authority conducting trials of voice risk analysis technology is responsible for completing a disability impact assessment. This is a prerequisite to participation in the Department's trial.</p>
	<p pid="c.133W.5/3">In accordance with departmental policy on carrying out equality impact assessments Jobcentre Plus conducted an initial screening on their voice risk analysis pilot. The pilot was restricted to assessing whether the technology could successfully identify the difference between high and low risk readings. As the pilot processes were specifically designed to test the voice risk analysis technology only and not its use as a new process or policy for implementation across Jobcentre Plus, it was concluded a full impact assessment was not required.</p>

	<p pid="c.135W.0/2">Jobcentre Plus works with a range of providers from the private, public and voluntary sectors to provide specialist disability programmes to help people with a disability or health condition, including HIV, to overcome the labour market barriers they may face. These programmes include Work Preparation, Workstep (a programme of supported employment), New Deal for Disabled People and residential training. Disability employment advisers also have access to work psychologists to assist them in supporting customers if appropriate.</p>
	<p pid="c.135W.0/3">For customers claiming benefits due to illness or disability the Pathways to Work programme helps move them into or nearer to work.

	<p pid="c.135W.0/4">People who are in work or due to start work and need support can claim help from Access to Work. Access to Work can provide practical advice and support to the disabled person and their employer to help them overcome work related obstacles resulting from disability. All Access to Work support is tailored to the individual's needs.</p>
	<p pid="c.135W.0/5">From Autumn 2010 the new specialist disability programme will replace the existing Workstep and work preparation programmes and will be designed as a single streamlined and flexible programme based on effective needs assessment and creation of tailored packages of appropriate support.</p>

This learning routeway provides the adviser with the key knowledge and skills to interview customers and enable them to work effectively with customers with disabilities or health conditions. Part of the training is a &quot;Disability Confident&quot; course which explains various disabilities and health conditions, including HIV and other long term conditions, and what would be considered reasonable adjustment by employers.</p>

This will make it clear that special schools are considered part of the UK's general education system and that parents have the right to express a preference for a special school. A reservation will allow for circumstances where disabled children's needs may be best met through specialist provision, which may be some way from their home&mdash;so they will need to be educated outside their local community.

We continue to focus particular help where people have basic skills needs and enable them to train from the beginning of their claim. Jobcentre Plus personal advisers are also able to agree early access to the job-search and training support offered by the New Deal for people whose circumstances may make it particularly hard to find work.

For those who do not, an enhanced offer is now available which includes:</p>
	<p pid="c.140W.2/4" class="indent">Personalised support from a Jobcentre Plus adviser who will work with customers to identify the steps appropriate to enable a swift return to work;</p>

	<p pid="c.144W.5/1">The Government have made a number of such assessments. The main one is the British Crime Survey (BCS), a report into 'The Impact of the Licensing Act 2003 on Levels of Crime and Disorder: An Evaluation (2008) by Hough et al' as well as 'Violent Crime, Disorder and Criminal Damage Since the Introduction of the Licensing Act (2007) Babb et al'.</p>
	<p pid="c.144W.5/2">In addition to piloting alcohol arrest referral schemes, the Government are taking a number of steps to tackle alcohol-related crime. These include the provisions in the Policing and Crime Bill which will introduce a mandatory code for all alcohol retailers, and will give licensing authorities new powers to clamp down on specific problems in their areas. We have also given &pound;3 million to Crime and Disorder Reduction partnerships (CDRPs) in order to undertake multi-agency enforcement activities on specific alcohol-related problems. We have made available a further &pound;1.5 million to our top 50 priority areas which have the highest levels of alcohol-related crime and disorder and public concern about drunk or rowdy behaviour. This money has been used to tackle under age sales, to confiscate alcohol from under 18's and to run communications campaigns to tell local people what action is being taken in their area. We have also just finished the series of 13 alcohol training enforcement workshops for front-line practitioners.</p>

	<p pid="c.145W.2/1">In July 2008, a review of the Nafovanny Centre against the published qualifying criteria confirmed the centre as category A (no issues or only minor issues noted). Nafovanny's suitability was reviewed again in February 2009 in the light of a recent campaign report, in which allegations were made about the use and condition of some small cages. As a result, the centre remains acceptable as a source of non-human primates, but has been reassigned as category B (issues identified that require further monitoring by the Inspectorate and/or action by the breeding centre). Accordingly, a visit by the Home Office Inspectorate to Nafovanny has been arranged and is scheduled to be completed before the end of May 2009. Since the date of the last assessment there have been no requests from users to acquire animals from Nafovanny.</p>

	<p pid="c.152W.0/1">The e-Borders Programme has engaged directly with several of the large coach operators involved in international coach travel.

	<p pid="c.152W.0/2">The programme is in regular contact with the Confederation of Passenger Transport (CPT), the industry trade association, and articles on e-Borders have appeared in their journal, Route One.

Only a small proportion of cannabis seizures are further examined to determine the tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) content, as a result of a customer request; customer requests for cannabidiol content are extremely unusual.</p>

In today's market, seizures of cannabis resin are comparatively rare compared to herbal cannabis.</p>

	<p pid="c.157W.3/1">The original ministerial announcement of funding to the Council for the Regulation of Forensic Practitioners (CRFP) in 1999 was expressly subject to the CRFP's performance, particularly the condition that it became self-financing through registrant's fees and there should not be a long-term reliance on grant.</p>
	<p pid="c.157W.3/2">By the time CRFP closed, this goal of a self-funding independent accreditation body had not been achieved and the company was facing a long-term shortfall of funding, because the registration income did not match the expenditure&mdash;and would not have matched it, irrespective of whether the Government grant had been continued or not. This was likely to become considerably worse because of the withdrawal of support for the registration process by police forces.</p>
	<p pid="c.157W.3/3">The grant was latterly provided by the National Policing Improvement Agency, who last year jointly commissioned with the CRFP an independent analysis of CRFP's finances. Following this, the CRFP's financial situation, as detailed above, was clear and further commitment of public money to CRFP would have amounted to a long-term</p>
	<p pid="c.157W.3/4">commitment to funding the company without full public control, which would not have been a justifiable or sustainable approach. I, and ministerial colleagues, were kept fully briefed on this issue throughout.</p>

	<p pid="c.158W.2/1">CCTV is a powerful crime fighting tool. Police operational experience and various research studies show that it deters and detects crime and helps secure convictions. It can also reduce fear of crime. CCTV works best as part of a package of measures to deal with specific events and crime problems.</p>
	<p pid="c.158W.2/2">A recent review of existing research was undertaken by the Campbell Collaboration, which was part funded by the National Policing Improvement Agency. The review found that CCTV has a modest but significant desirable effect on crime, is most effective in reducing crime in car parks, when targeted at vehicle crimes, and is more effective in reducing crime in the United Kingdom than in other countries. The main points of the review will be summarised and made available to police forces by the summer.</p>

	<p pid="c.159W.5/1">The disruption caused by the extreme weather conditions on 2 and <phrase class="date" code="2009-02-03">3 February</phrase> this year caused severe difficulty for many Home Office staff travelling to and from work.</p>
	<p pid="c.159W.5/2">As a result guidance was provided to line managers to remind them that they should consider sympathetically circumstances where staff were unable to report for work or have had to leave early due to severe travel disruption. This guidance reflected existing departmental arrangements on travel disruptions set out in the Staff Handbook. These arrangements provide for situations where staff experience unavoidable travel delays due to travel disruption or other exceptional circumstances which may mean they are either late for work or are unable to attend work. In these circumstances those staff that use the departmental flexi time system may be given a credit to compensate for travel delays. Depending on circumstances, other staff might not be required to make up time lost.</p>
	<p pid="c.159W.5/3">It was left to managers to decide locally whether the provisions allowed for in the staff handbook should be applied in individual cases. Records of the number of staff who were not able to attend work on 2 and <phrase class="date" code="2009-02-03">3 February</phrase> as a result of the disruption to the transport system were not collated centrally and could be obtained only at disproportionate cost.</p>
	<p pid="c.159W.5/4">For the same reason it is also not possible to provide an estimate of the cost to the Department or the total number of working hours that were lost.</p>

	<p pid="c.173W.2/1">Visa services deploy a range of indicators and checks concerning the quality of decisions to issue a visa. These include sampling of decisions by Entry Clearance Managers, spot checks on whether applicants have left the UK, refusals of visa holders at ports of entry and monitoring of compliance when in the UK. In addition, the use of biometrics allows us to identify those who have entered the UK on a visa but subsequently destroyed their ID papers. This information is fed into risk profiles to inform future visa decisions. UKBA is also employing structured decision-making techniques to improve consistency in decision-making. The Independent Monitor for Entry Clearance scrutinises visa refusals not acceptances.</p>

During the whole of 2008, the FMU received reports of over 1,600 possible forced marriage cases. Of those who gave a location, 15 per cent. were in the North West region.

	<p pid="c.198W.14/1">In September 2008, the High Court agreed that the 1997 cut-off date applied to retired Gurkhas was sound and not discriminatory. However, it did find that the policy guidance relating to the treatment of Gurkhas discharged before 1997 was not sufficiently clear and did not cover service-related factors. We are determined to get the revised guidance right to ensure that it is fair to all Gurkhas and this has involved consultation across Government.</p>

	<p pid="c.200W.6/1">Engaging young people has been a key element of the Tackling Knives Action Programme. All forces involved have delivered education programmes on the dangers and consequences of carrying knives. In addition, young people have been involved in youth forums, conferences and a range of events using drama, sport, music and dance. A National Youth Theatre tour, funded through the programme, has also given young people an opportunity to educate their peers on the risks and consequences of knife carrying.</p>
	<p pid="c.200W.6/2">The Home Office worked with a group of young people to develop the 'It Doesn't Have to Happen' youth marketing campaign, which seeks to educate young people about the dangers of carrying a knife and encourage them to put the knife down and take up a more positive activity. Young people have contributed to the campaign's development and are encouraged to share the campaign messages with their peers. The campaign has used a range of radio, viral, online and poster adverts as well as events and competitions to get the messages across. Over 10,000 people are also members of the campaign's thriving Bebo community, providing young people with an online forum to share their views and take a stand against knife crime.</p>

	<p pid="c.227W.5/2" class="italic"> Prevent</p>
	<p pid="c.227W.5/3" class="indent">I understand that a Prevent Working Group has been developed in Coventry, made up of senior representatives from the police, council, universities, colleges and other public agencies, which will meet for the first time this month.</p>
	<p pid="c.227W.5/4" class="indent">Coventry has recently developed a communications strategy to help mainstream messages to counter extremism. The local authority is also currently developing a programme of activities for young people from diverse communities, which explores issues of identity, challenging extremist ideology, and provides support to the most vulnerable.</p>
	<p pid="c.227W.5/5" class="italic"> Prepare</p>
	<p pid="c.227W.5/6" class="indent">Prepare activity in Coventry is driven through the well established partnership of the Coventry Local Resilience Forum. This group is responsible for the development of the Local Community Risk Register which works to mitigate risks and threats within the area through prioritising planning, training and exercising activities.</p>
	<p pid="c.227W.5/7" class="italic"> Protect</p>
	<p pid="c.227W.5/8" class="indent">Through NaCTSO (the National Counter Terrorism Security Office) and Project ARGUS we have provided advice and an awareness-raising programme to staff in all the main five shopping areas in Coventry (West Orchards, Cathedral Lane, Cross point, Lower Precinct and Tesco Arena), theatres and cinemas, the Transport Museum, Coventry FC and delegates from the night-time economy.

	<p pid="c.227W.5/13">The key stakeholders at Coventry and other airports will have statutory responsibility for carrying out a joint threat and risk assessment and for preparing a comprehensive security plan setting out the actions being taken to address the risks at their airport. The costs of the police resources identified in that plan would then feature in a separate agreement about reimbursement between the operator, police force and the police authority.</p>

Partnerships for Schools (PfS) the body which assists local authorities procure their BSF investment, is already engaging with authorities to discuss their readiness to deliver. No project will formally enter BSF until PfS is satisfied that there is robust evidence that the authority is ready to deliver. It has therefore not yet been decided which will be the next authorities to enter the programme after 2010-11.</p>

	<p pid="c.241W.2/1">This is a matter for Ofsted. HM Chief Inspector, Christine Gilbert, has written to my hon. Friend and a copy of her reply has been placed in the House Libraries.</p>
	<p pid="c.241W.2/2" class="italic"> Letter from Christine Gilbert, dated <phrase class="date" code="2009-04-02">2 April 2009</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="c.241W.2/3" class="indent">Your recent parliamentary question has been passed to me, as Her Majesty's Chief Inspector, for a response.</p>
	<p pid="c.241W.2/4" class="indent">Ofsted recognises that inspecting provision and outcomes for deaf or hearing impaired pupils requires particular specialist knowledge and skills with regard to issues such as language development, communication methods, and acoustic conditions.</p>
	<p pid="c.241W.2/5" class="indent">You asked how Ofsted ensured that its inspectors had adequate levels of training and expertise in education for the deaf and communication with deaf children. Ofsted has a small core team of four Her Majesty's Inspectors (HMI) who are specialists in the inspection of sensory impairment who are routinely deployed in the inspection of schools for deaf and hearing impaired pupils. Ofsted also requires our contracted Regional Inspection Service Providers to provide inspectors who are suitable for each individual inspection. Every effort is made to inspect special schools with inspectors who have expertise in that particular field. Where there is specific provision for pupils with SEN in mainstream schools, then every effort is made to provide the inspection team with an inspector with expertise in the particular field of SEN provided by the school. Training on inspecting special educational needs (SEN) in mainstream schools, special schools and pupil referral units was provided for HMI and Additional Inspectors (AI) during 2008, and is being updated for the coming year. All inspectors have access to extensive guidance available to support this area of work.</p>
	<p pid="c.241W.2/6" class="indent">In February 2009, Ofsted announced that it has agreed three new contracts with contractors for the provision of inspection from September 2009. These contracts will cover all the inspection remits in schools and colleges, apprenticeships, adult skills and initial teacher education. The procurement process for the new contracts has provided the opportunity for Ofsted to renew the commitment of its contractors to deploy appropriately skilled and specialist additional inspectors for each school's context, including those with deaf children.</p>
	<p pid="c.241W.2/7" class="indent">Ofsted is also working with the Department for Children, Schools and Families to ensure the availability to inspectors of better performance data for pupils with learning difficulties and/or disabilities, including children who are deaf and/or hearing impaired. In particular, we are seeking to provide performance data for individual pupils who have specific learning difficulties and/or disabilities, in order to measure more rigorously their progress and achievement.</p>
	<p pid="c.241W.2/8" class="indent">You also asked whether inspectors are accompanied by a skilled interpreter. It is necessary for inspectors to be able to communicate effectively with deaf and hearing impaired pupils: this may require competence in British Sign Language or other methods of communication, or use of a skilled interpreter. Ofsted is reviewing these requirements for the new inspection arrangements for September, including the requirement to have an interpreter on inspection.</p>
	<p pid="c.241W.2/9" class="indent">A copy of this reply has been sent to Rt Hon Jim Knight MP, Minister of State for Schools and Learners, and will be placed in the library of both Houses.</p>

	<p pid="c.243W.6/1">Information on the number of GCSEs sat for young people in custody are not collected centrally. However, the Learning and Skills Council (LSC) collects monthly data on learning for young people in Prison Service Young Offender Institutions. This data shows that during the 2008 academic year, for young people under the age of 18, there were 106 GCSE achievements between grades A and C, and 159 GCSE achievements below grade C. However, these figures do not reflect all of the GCSEs achieved in juvenile custody because this does not include young people in Secure Children's Homes, Secure Training Centres, or private prisons. Also some of the young people in Young Offender Institutions are still registered at schools and colleges and therefore any GCSEs that they achieve whilst in custody will be reflected in achievement figures of schools and colleges, rather than the figures reported by the LSC for those achieved in custody.</p>

	<p pid="c.249W.5/1">The dedicated schools grant formula review was launched at the end of January 2008. The purpose of the review is to ensure that all education to the age of 16 is well supported and providers have the confidence they require to plan their spending effectively over the longer term. We have established a DSG formula review group with representation from central and local Government, teaching associations, unions representing support staff and governors' organisations. In addition, other stakeholders are invited to attend when the most relevant issues to them are on the agenda. We are also considering the extent to which we can rationalise and simplify the different funding streams to deliver children's services &mdash; particularly relevant to early years.</p>
	<p pid="c.249W.5/2">In addition, all local authorities in England are currently in the process of introducing a single funding formula to support the delivery of the free entitlement to early years provision. While this will not mean that funding levels will be equal across all providers, it will mean that it will be provided on an equitable basis, taking into account the same factors, reflective of costs and that any differences will be both transparent and fully justifiable.</p>
	<p pid="c.249W.5/3">It will also introduce a shift away from place based funding toward participation led funding. There are a number of options for consideration in the formulation of the framework&mdash;for example how local formulas are used to take account of costs associated with quality, flexibility and outcomes, and under participation led funding when children are counted as participating in provision. The Department is assessing these options through a formula development pilot which was set up in November 2007 and now involves twelve local authorities whose experiences and challenges are being captured.</p>

	<p pid="c.253W.3/17">The revenue per pupil figures shown in the following table are taken from the Dedicated Schools Grant (DSG) which was introduced in April 2006. They are not comparable with those for the years 2004-05 to 2005-06 because the introduction of the DSG in 2006-07 fundamentally changed how local authorities are funded.</p>
	<p pid="c.253W.3/18">The 2004-05 to 2005-06 figures are based on Education Formula Spending (EFS) which formed the education part of the Local Government Finance Settlement, plus various grants. This was an assessment of what local authorities needed to fund education rather than what they spent. The DSG is based largely on an authority's previous spending. In addition, the DSG has a different coverage to EFS. EFS comprised a schools block and an LEA block (to cover LEA central functions) whereas DSG only covers the school block. LEA block items are still funded through DCLG's Local Government Finance Settlement but education items cannot be separately identified. Consequently, there is a break in the Department's time series as the two sets of data are not comparable.</p>
	<p pid="c.253W.3/19">To provide a comparison for 2006-07 DSG, the Department have isolated the schools block equivalent funding in 2005-06; as described above this does not represent the totality of 'education' funding in that year.</p>
	<p pid="c.253W.3/20">The per pupil revenue funding figures for years 2005-06 (baseline) to 2008-09 for England and Staffordshire local authority are provided in the following table. As the DSG is a mechanism for distributing funding, a split between primary and secondary schools is not available.

	<p pid="c.264W.2/1">This is a matter for Ofsted. HM Chief Inspector, Christine Gilbert, has written to the hon. Member and a copy of her reply has been placed in the House Libraries.</p>
	<p pid="c.264W.2/2" class="italic"> Letter from Christine Gilbert, dated <phrase class="date" code="2009-04-03">3 April 2009</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="c.264W.2/3" class="indent">Your recent parliamentary question has been passed to me, as Her Majesty's Chief Inspector, for reply.</p>
	<p pid="c.264W.2/4" class="indent">There are no standard definitions for medium or large schools. This response provides data based on the size banding used when analysing inspection outcomes for Ofsted's Annual Reports. These also include the figures on small schools (primary schools with 100 pupils or fewer, and secondary schools with 600 pupils or fewer), previously provided in response to Parliamentary Question 258254. Data identifying the total number of pupils on a school's roll in each academic year are derived from the Annual School Census produced by the Department for Children, Schools and Families. Please note that schools for which the number of pupils on roil is not available have been excluded from this analysis.</p>
	<p pid="c.264W.2/5" class="indent">Ofsted introduced a judgement of schools' overall effectiveness in January 2000, and this response covers data since that point. Under the school inspection framework used between January 2000 and August 2005 (commonly known as Section 10), the school's overall effectiveness judgement was made using a seven point scale: excellent, very good, good, satisfactory, unsatisfactory, poor and very poor. Since September 2005, the overall effectiveness judgement has been made under the current school inspection framework (commonly known as Section 5) using a four point scale: outstanding, good, satisfactory and inadequate. Tables A to D show the percentages of primary and secondary schools by grade for each academic year since January 2000.</p>
	<p pid="c.264W.2/6" class="indent">It is not possible to operate a simple read-across approach from a seven- to a four-point scale. Ofsted's criteria for making inspection judgements about schools are clearly set out in our inspection guidance, which is available on the Ofsted website at</p>

	<p pid="c.271W.0/4">The Learning and Skills Council's (LSC) letter 31 of March confirmed that we continue to consider options for further funding, including meeting emerging pressures from the impact of the recession and recruitment during the year. The LSC will be writing again to schools and colleges by the end of April.</p>

	<p pid="c.276W.0/1">This information is not available.</p>
	<p pid="c.276W.0/2">No child with special educational needs (SEN) should be denied admission to a mainstream school because of staffing levels. They are protected against being treated worse then other children in the admissions process. For children with SEN statements, under section 324 (5) (b) of the Education Act 1996, local authority maintained schools, including maintained mainstream schools, are required to admit pupils whose statements name the school. The statements may set out extra staffing resources to meet the child's needs. The statutory School Admissions Code says that admission authorities and school governing bodies must ensure that their admission arrangements are fair and do not unfairly disadvantage particular social or racial groups including children with SEN. Under the Disability Discrimination Act 1995, children with SEN who also come within the definition of disability under that Act are protected against discrimination in the matter of admissions on the ground of disability and their parents can make claims to the First-tier Tribunal (SEN and Disability) or to local admissions panels if they feel their child has been discriminated against.</p>
	<p pid="c.276W.0/3">As at January 2008, there were 40,000 more teachers in schools than there were in 1997. The total school workforce staff (teacher and support staff) has grown by 42 per cent. since 1997, with the number of teaching assistants having increased by 12,700 between 2007 and 2008. Full-time teacher vacancies in local authority maintained schools were running at 0.7 per cent. in East Sussex, the same percentage as for England as a whole.</p>

However, most diplomas are taken as two-year courses, and we therefore expect the majority of awards from the first phase of teaching to be made in summer 2010.

	<p pid="c.280W.2/1">Young people began Diploma programmes for the first time in September 2008. At this early stage, in one or two year programmes, detailed data on the number of days they have completed in work based training is not available.</p>
	<p pid="c.280W.2/2">However, each Diploma learner must complete a minimum of 10 days work experience during their programme. In addition, as part of their Diploma programme, they will have opportunities to undertake work related learning in a range of settings beyond the classroom, to equip them with the knowledge and skills for employment and further study.</p>

We are currently consulting on expanding the CERT by 20 per cent. and on extending a CERT mechanism beyond March 2011 to 2012. We hope that these two proposals, in combination with work to improve the exchange of information between the insulation industry and energy suppliers, should help to generate greater continuity and confidence in the market and lead to appropriate investment.</p>

	<p pid="c.310W.2/1">Since 2000 over &pound;20 billion has been spent on fuel poverty benefits and programmes.</p>
	<p pid="c.310W.2/2">This includes: the Warm Front Scheme in England, which has assisted 1.8 million households; the Carbon Emissions Reduction Target and the Decent Homes Programme, primarily addressing the energy efficiency of households; and Winter Fuel and Cold Weather Payments to increase household incomes. The Warm Front scheme alone, has in the 2008-09 year, assisted almost 235,000 households spending almost &pound;340 million on measures.</p>
	<p pid="c.310W.2/3">The combination of national and local programmes and delivery through local government, partnerships and area based schemes can help target areas of particular need. We are currently consulting on the Community Energy Savings Programme (CESP), where we propose to support energy efficiency measures at a local, community level, by fostering new and existing partnerships between energy companies, local authorities, voluntary organisations and other such bodies, to offer support to poorer communities on a house-by-house, street-by-street basis.</p>
	<p pid="c.310W.2/4">As part of the Local Government Framework, National Indicator 187 (Tackling Fuel Poverty) has been designed to measure the proportion of households on income related benefits for whom an energy assessment of their housing has been carried out and have a SAP of below 35 or greater than 65. We are encouraged that 40 out of 150 Local Area Agreements (LAAs) have included NI187 as one of their 35 local improvement targets and have set challenging but achievable targets. All local authorities will have to report on progress each year.</p>
	<p pid="c.310W.2/5">Responsibility for fuel poverty policy is a devolved matter. Ministers across Government and the Devolved Nations discuss policy to tackle fuel poverty and we publish an annual report which includes information on progress in the Devolved Administrations.</p>

	<p pid="c.311W.5/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2008-09-11">11 September 2008</phrase> the Prime Minister announced the Home Energy Saving Programme which included a 20 per cent. uplift to the level of the Carbon Emissions Reduction Target (CERT) and a new obligation, the Community Energy Saving Programme (CESP). These schemes operate as obligations on the energy suppliers (and the electricity generators in the case of CESP) to achieve carbon savings by encouraging households to take-up energy saving measures.</p>
	<p pid="c.311W.5/2">The figure of &pound;910 million refers to the estimated extra investment suppliers and generators will need to make in order to deliver these additional obligations. No Government funding is involved.</p>
	<p pid="c.311W.5/3">In terms of CERT, Ofgem, the scheme administrator, does not collect data on energy supplier spend. However, based on the costs of the measures promoted by suppliers, we estimate that the overall spend by suppliers on delivering the 20 per cent. increase to the CERT obligations will be around &pound;560 million. However, we expect the CESP to lead to supplier and generator investment of some &pound;350 million by 2012.</p>
	<p pid="c.311W.5/4">The proposals for CERT and CESP are currently subject to public consultation.</p>

	<p pid="c.316W.5/2">National Grid (NGET) is aware of the phenomena of extreme solar weather events and began preparations for the next peak in 2011-12 some years ago. NGET has procedures in place to improve the resilience of the network which include putting their field force on standby and ensuring that enough reactive power is available (a technical service provided by generators which helps manage voltage fluctuations&mdash;a possible consequence of both a conventional and severe solar storm).</p>
	<p pid="c.316W.5/3">The electricity networks are designed to provide a level of resilience that would cope with incidents that are potentially more severe than those that may be caused by a solar flare. Similarly, Government emergency planning arrangements are in place and tested to be able to cope with a complete shutdown of the electricity network.

A Service Level Agreement (SLA) was introduced following extensive consultation by Ofgem involving local authorities and distribution network operators (DNOs). Ofgem published a decision letter in this respect in 2007 and set out a number of key performance indicators (KPIs) to apply to the various street lighting maintenance categories. Ofgem also made it clear that DNOs should be seeking to meet and surpass the KPIs and if performance did not improve it would take action in this respect through the distribution price control review (DPCR).</p>
	<p pid="c.327W.0/2">I understand that Ofgem is now considering the extent of regulation required for the KPIs and is working with the industry to formalise these arrangements through further regulation. Ofgem expects to publish its initial proposals in this respect in July 2009.</p>

	<p pid="c.342W.2/1">The available figures, extracted from the dataset used to compile &quot;Sentencing Statistics, 2007&quot; published in November 2008, are contained in the following table. The maximum penalty has increased from two to four years imprisonment for offences committed after <phrase class="date" code="2007-02-12">12 February 2007</phrase>. These penalties relate to possession of a knife. Where a knife is used to commit a crime a more severe sentence will be imposed. In some cases (e.g. for grievous bodily harm with intent) this could be life imprisonment.</p>
	<p pid="c.342W.2/2">The sentence imposed in individual cases is a matter for the courts to decide upon, within the statutory limits laid down by Parliament. It is entirely a matter for the court to determine the sentence taking account of all the circumstances in each case.</p>
	<p pid="c.342W.2/3">Provisional statistics, mainly from the police national computer, published by the Ministry of Justice in the first quarterly knife crime sentencing bulletin (on <phrase class="date" code="2009-03-12">Thursday 12 March</phrase>) and covering possession of an offensive weapon as well as possession of an article with a blade or point showed that:</p>
	<p pid="c.342W.2/4" class="indent">More offenders are being sent to jail (23 per cent.): the number of offences resulting in immediate custody rose from 1,125 in the last quarter of 2007 to 1,386 in the same period of 2008. On average there was a 40 per cent. increase in the number of prisoners serving a sentence for possession of an offensive weapon between the same periods.</p>
	<p pid="c.342W.2/5" class="indent">Fewer cautions being issued: the number fell 31 per cent. over the same period (1,706 in the last quarter of 2008 compared to 2,455 in the same period of 2007).</p>
	<p pid="c.342W.2/6" class="indent">More use of tougher community sentences: the number of offences resulting in community sentences rose 16 per cent. (from 1,861 in the last quarter of 2007 to 2,151 in the same period of 2007)</p>
	<p pid="c.342W.2/7" class="indent">Longer sentences: the average immediate custodial sentence has risen by 38 per cent. (from 133-days in the last quarter of 2007 to 184 days in the same period of 2008.</p>
	<p pid="c.342W.2/8">The proportion of all possession offences resulting in immediate custody rose to 21 per cent. in the last quarter of 2008 from 17 per cent. in the same period of 2007. The proportion of offences resulting in a caution decreased from 36% in the last quarter of 2007 to 25 per cent. in the last quarter of 2008.</p>
	<p pid="c.342W.2/9">The statistics also show a decline in the total number of offences involving possession of a knife or other offensive weapon (6,704 offences were dealt with between October and December last year, compared to 6,808 in the same period of 2007).</p>

	<p pid="c.353W.0/3" class="indent">As the Chief Executive of the Charity Commission, I have been asked to respond to your question (269357) regarding the number of charities that have opened and closed each year since 2004 and each month since January 2008.</p>
	<p pid="c.353W.0/4" class="indent">I attach below tables which set out the number of charities that registered with the Charity Commission and the number of charities that were removed from the Register for each year since 2004 and for each month since January 2008.</p>
	<p pid="c.353W.0/5" class="indent">The tables below refer to those charities which are required to register with the Commission by law. Smaller charities are not required to register with us; the threshold for registration was an annual income of &pound;1,000 for the periods shown by the tables until April 2008 when this threshold was increased to &pound;5,000.</p>
	<p pid="c.353W.0/6" class="indent">Charities are removed from the Register for a number of different reasons and the figures below are not directly representative of the number of charities that are wound down during any one period. The peak in removals seen in the figures for November 2008 represents the removal of dormant charities from the Register. Likewise the number of charity registrations is not directly representative of the number of charities that have been opened during any one period. For example charities that are opened with an annual income below the threshold do not have to register and other charities may only register when their income rises above this threshold.</p>

	<p pid="c.354W.8/1">As the independent regulator of charities in England and Wales, the Charity Commission is not subject to ministerial direction or control. The Commission's statutory objectives were recently reviewed and updated in the Charities Act 2006. This included increasing public confidence in charities, promoting compliance by charity trustees with their legal obligations in exercising control and management of the administration of their charities, promoting the effective use of charitable resources and enhancing the accountability of charities to donors, beneficiaries and the general public. The Commission has wide powers of intervention where there is evidence of misconduct or mismanagement. It operates a risk-based approach to the regulation of charities. This is set out in its published Risk and Proportionality Framework, and I have placed a copy in the House Library.</p>

	<p pid="c.367W.2/10" class="indent">This ILO internationally-standard definition is applied in the LFS so that people are defined as unemployed purely on the basis of their behaviour in the labour market. Therefore the definition of unemployment is independent of someone's participation on any training scheme. Consequently, people on such schemes who satisfy the above criteria will be classified as unemployed and others will not.</p>

	<p pid="c.367W.5/2">We believe that volunteering alongside looking for work can help to develop useful skills for work and keep jobseekers in touch with the labour market. Provided jobseekers are available for and actively seeking work, they can take part in unlimited volunteering work.</p>
	<p pid="c.367W.5/3">Jobcentre Plus has over 2,400 partnerships with local third sector organisations across the country. These complement the service Jobcentre Plus offers, providing customers access to additional advice and support. Personal advisers in Oxfordshire have five main websites that they use and share with customers who would benefit from doing voluntary work. They are: Oxfordshire Community and Voluntary Action (OCVA), Oxford Radcliffe Hospital Volunteers, Smart, Do-it and the Oxfordshire county council website.</p>
	<p pid="c.367W.5/4">In addition to these existing partnerships, new measures to encourage volunteering as a means of developing skills for work are being introduced as part of the jobseeker's support at six months package from April 2009. Through this package, those who have been unemployed and claiming jobseeker's allowance for six months or more will have access to a range of support including recruitment subsidies, work-focused training, help to start a new business and access to work-focused volunteering placements delivered through third sector partners.</p>
	<p pid="c.367W.5/5">Jobseekers who have been claiming Jobseeker's Allowance for six months and would like to volunteer to maintain or develop their skills for work can discuss with their Jobcentre Plus personal adviser how they can make use of the extra support on offer from April 2009.</p>

	<p pid="c.374W.3/2">Pre-Budget report 2008 confirmed that differential first year rates of vehicle excise duty (VED) would be introduced in 2010, in order to provide a stronger signal of vehicle emissions at the point of sale.</p>
	<p pid="c.374W.3/3">As a result of these changes the Treasury expects sales of lower-emitting cars to increase; and sales of higher-emitting cars to decrease. The Treasury does not hold data in relation to specific models of new cars and does not make assessments for specific models.</p>
	<p pid="c.374W.3/4">Vehicle excise duty reforms will continue to incentivise the purchase of lower-emitting cars in future years, helping to deliver the long-term EU target of average new cars emissions of 95 grams per kilometre by 2020. It is estimated that by 2020 around one million tonnes of carbon dioxide will be saved as a result of changes to VED rates and bands announced at pre-Budget report 2008.</p>

	<p pid="c.375W.9/1">ISAs are tax-advantaged savings products. No tax is payable on interest or capital gains arising on investments held within ISAs, and therefore no revenue accrues to the Exchequer as a result.

This will help to revive the flow of credit within the economy, encourage spending and support economic activity. A prosperous and stable economy is vital for pension schemes to meet their obligations.</p>
	<p pid="c.378W.8/2">Public sector pensions are predominantly run on a pay as you go basis. This means that pension liabilities are financed when they become due, mainly from contributions into pension schemes and otherwise out of other current Government revenues.</p>

The overall effect on an individual fund's financial position will depend on how closely the fund's assets and liabilities are matched in terms of their exposure to interest rate risk. This will vary across funds, reflecting differences in the composition of each fund's assets and liabilities.</p>

However, use of the helicopter on official visits where several short journeys may take place, permits the maximum number of engagements to take place in a day. This makes best use of the Principal's time and minimises the disruption to the public when car journeys and a police escort may be used as an alternative.</p>

	<p pid="c.391W.9/1">The majority of trains have been accessible to wheelchair users for many years, although the proportion that meet modern accessibility standards has increased dramatically since the Rail Vehicle Accessibility Regulations (RVAR) (SI 1998/2456) were introduced in 1998. The RVAR considerably improve the accessibility of rail vehicles to disabled people by setting minimum technical standards designed to make trains more accessible to disabled people, including wheelchair users.</p>
	<p pid="c.391W.9/2">Almost 4,800 train carriages have been built in compliance with RVAR, while almost all older vehicles have featured improved accessibility, including for wheelchair users, when they have undergone refurbishment. A list of all trains that were built in compliance with RVAR and their current operator is available on the Department for Transport's website:</p>
	<p pid="c.391W.9/3" class="indent"><a href="http://www.dft.gov.uk/transportforyou/access/rail/vehicles/pubs/rva/accessibilityregulations.xls">www.dft.gov.uk/transportforyou/access/rail/vehicles/pubs/rva/accessibilityregulations.xls</a>)</p>
	<p pid="c.391W.9/4">However, as rolling stock is frequently moved between different train operating companies, the Department does not keep a historical record of where these rail vehicles have previously been in service.</p>
	<p pid="c.391W.9/5">The UK's lead in this area resulted last year in the introduction of new pan-European accessibility standards (the Technical Specification of Interoperability for Persons with Reduced Mobility&mdash;PRM TSI) which are based on RVAR. In future, all heavy rail trains will be subject to the PRM TSI, while tram, underground and metro systems will remain subject to RVAR.</p>
	<p pid="c.391W.9/6">In 2008, the Department set an end date of <phrase class="date" code="2020-01-01">1 January 2020</phrase>, by which time all trains must be accessible. This is some 15 years earlier than would occur naturally through normal fleet replacement and we are already working closely with the rail industry to deliver this commitment.</p>

It is important to note that this cost saving is attributable to a fatal accident and not to each single fatality. A single accident can involve more than one fatality and include other individuals with injuries varying in severity. Medical and ambulance costs, however, relate to each personal fatality and are estimated at &pound;6,310 (2007 prices).</p>
	<p pid="c.393W.9/3">Each year the Department for Transport publishes its valuation of preventing fatalities (VPF) on transport using annual road accident data for appraisal purposes. In addition to the costs mentioned above components of the VPF that are directly attributable to each fatality on average include valuations of lost human output (&pound;624,190 in 2007 prices) and human costs such as grievance and suffering (&pound;1,232,800 in 2007 prices).</p>

	<p pid="c.401W.2/1">BERR are continuing to work towards achieving the energy efficiency targets expressed in the Sustainable Operation of the Government Estate (SOGE) framework. Our main strategy has been to gain efficiencies through a reduction in the physical size of its estate and the number of buildings occupied. As a result the whole BERR estate has been reduced by 58 per cent. and its overall carbon footprint by 26 per cent. since the baseline year of 1999-2000.</p>
	<p pid="c.401W.2/2">As we are working the remaining buildings harder, through better space optimisation, energy use has risen slightly. We are addressing this through improved utilisation of building management systems; installing new environmental and lighting controls during 2008-09, together with introduction in January 2009 of new automated monitoring and targeting systems, which will give significant savings over the next few years.</p>
	<p pid="c.401W.2/3">Furthermore, in mid-February 2009, BERR installed two sets of photovoltaic arrays on the roof of its 1 Victoria Street HQ building and carried out a thermal imaging study. We are currently evaluating the latter study to see if there are additional means of improving the performance of the HQ building.</p>

	<p pid="c.405W.5/14">For staff leaving on compulsory or flexible early severance terms, or in receipt of a statutory redundancy payment, the size of the package is simply the lump sum compensation payment made.</p>
	<p pid="c.405W.5/15">For staff leaving on compulsory, flexible or approved early retirement terms, the size of the package includes any lump sum compensation payment made on departure (compulsory terms only) and also the capitalised cost of paying a pension or annual compensation payment (ACP) before pension age, the cost of any pension enhancement (compulsory and flexible terms only) and the cost of bringing forward the payment of the pension lump sum (for those in classic). These figures are therefore the initial provision for the early departure liabilities caused by the staffs departures. They will include any cash payments made during the period.</p>

	<p pid="c.428W.2/1">The British Humanist Association received &pound;25,000 in order to establish and support a network of grassroots humanists to work and build relationships with statutory bodies and participate in groups that advise local authorities on matters of religion or belief, or encourage dialogue between people with different beliefs. The project aimed to enable local humanists to network with faith and 'interfaith' groups and participate in groups convened by local authorities, and thus contribute towards good relations and community cohesion.</p>
	<p pid="c.428W.2/2">The Faith Communities Capacity Building Fund was designed to increase the capacity of all religion and belief communities to engage with each other and with wider society. The guidance notes for the Fund included the following definition:</p>
	<p pid="c.428W.2/3" class="indent">&quot;For the purpose of this fund, a faith organisation is defined as one where the majority of its members adhere to the same faith. They share a world view or 'life stance' that involves a set of moral and spiritual values and beliefs about the nature of life and the world. They will usually, but not always, believe in a god or gods.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="c.428W.2/4">The application was made under the &quot;relationships with local, regional or national Government&quot; category&mdash;one of the capacity building categories of the fund. In its application, the BHA described their faith tradition as: &quot;Humanist (though we do not think of ourselves as a 'faith', we meet the definition of 'faith' given in the guidance)&quot;.</p>

	<p pid="c.442W.11/1">The Department has invested &pound;6 million per year in a national communications campaign, launched in May 2008, to improve the public's understanding of units of alcohol and alcohol related health harm. The campaign's purpose is to give clear information about how many units are in alcoholic drinks and to raise awareness of the risks to health of regularly drinking too much. Its messages are being released across television, press, outdoor, radio and on-line channels.</p>
	<p pid="c.442W.11/2">We intend that this campaign should be sustained over a number of years. The key tasks in 2009-10 will be to optimise the unit messaging, by continuing to focus on the recommended unit guidelines and to communicate the health risks associated with drinking regularly in excess of these guidelines through media channels such as television and print.</p>
	<p pid="c.442W.11/3">We also provide web-based support and advice and an enhanced helpline available nationally.</p>
	<p pid="c.442W.11/4">We have recently completed an innovative pilot to target information to neighbourhoods, individuals and their families and encourage those most affected to seek advice and support, including help from health professionals locally. Initial results are promising and development work will continue in 2009. The aim is to develop an evidence base for effective local action by national health service bodies.</p>
	<p pid="c.442W.11/5">The north-east has launched a regional alcohol office, which is committed to changing the drinking culture in the north-east by informing, influencing and educating people about the health and other dangers caused by alcohol misuse, both to themselves as individuals and to the wider community and by encouraging evidence-based NHS interventions.</p>
	<p pid="c.442W.11/6">Middlesbrough Primary Care Trust has received &pound;150,000 in additional funding in 2008-09, as an Early Implementer of the Alcohol Improvement Programme, to implement high impact changes and other measures, which will address health problems caused by alcohol misuse. This includes providing &pound;32,000 funding for extra identification and brief advice sessions in hospitals, accident and emergency departments, and primary care.</p>

This has, to date, delivered 205 new buildings open to patients with another 25 under construction. Private sector capital has also been invested by third party developers who specialise in the primary care estate.</p>
	<p pid="c.456W.2/4">The NHS ProCure21 initiative has also provided premises that fully satisfy minimum standards. Of a total of &pound;3.5 billion invested through that investment programme, over &pound;400 million has been invested in primary care and community facilities across England. Of that amount, 36 projects with a value of &pound;143 million have been completed and 33 projects with a value of &pound;260 million are currently in the earlier stages of development.</p>

	<p pid="c.460W.0/1">The 2009-10 and 2010-11 revenue allocations to primary care trusts (PCTs) were made on the basis of a new funding formula, recommended by the independent advisory committee on resource allocation.</p>
	<p pid="c.460W.0/2">The funding formula determines PCT target allocations. Actual allocations to PCTs depend also on the pace of change policy&mdash;how additional funding is distributed to move PCTs towards their target allocations. It is therefore not possible to say what the allocations would have been in 2009-10 and 2010-11 if the previous funding formula had still applied.</p>
	<p pid="c.460W.0/3">The Department is moving all PCTs towards their target allocations as quickly as possible, but this must be balanced with the need to ensure that all PCTs are appropriately supported with stable funding that both supports existing commitments and allows long-term planning, as well as recognising the unavoidable cost pressures that all PCTs face.</p>
	<p pid="c.460W.0/4">Enfield PCT moved from being 0.1 per cent. above target under the previous funding formula at the close of 2008-09 to opening 2009-10 under the new formula at 2.3 per cent. above target. This means that under the 2009-10 and 2010-11 pace of change policy, Enfield PCT received a 10.6 per cent. average increase in funding over the two years, equivalent to a cumulative cash increase of &pound;44.1 million. The average increase for London PCTs over the two years is 10.7 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="c.460W.0/5">The 2009-10 and 2010-11 allocations made to the PCTs in the London strategic health authority and the difference between their actual and target allocations (the distance from target) are listed in the following table.</p>

	<p pid="c.465W.5/1">Health inequalities are a key priority for the national health service as set out in the NHS Operating Framework 2009-10 and all primary care trusts (PCTs) are required to have plans that add up to a narrowing of the life expectancy gap. Incentives for the NHS and local authorities have been aligned with the same health inequalities indicators in both the NHS Operating Framework 2009-10 and the New Performance Framework for Local Authorities and Local Authority Partnerships: Single Set of National Indicators. PCT performance against health inequalities plan is managed through strategic health authorities.</p>
	<p pid="c.465W.5/2">The Department is working to provide local partners with the support and tools they need to tackle health inequalities effectively and meet the 2010 National Target. This includes establishing a range of national support teams (NSTs) with an inequalities focus, providing tailored, intensive, assistance to areas that face the biggest challenges in delivering public health-related Public Service Agreement targets. The NSTs which have a particular role in supporting the inequalities targets are:</p>
	<p pid="c.465W.5/3" class="indent">Health Inequalities NST;</p>
	<p pid="c.465W.5/4" class="indent">Infant Mortality NST;</p>
	<p pid="c.465W.5/5" class="indent">Tobacco Control NST; and</p>
	<p pid="c.465W.5/6" class="indent">Teenage Pregnancy NST.</p>
	<p pid="c.465W.5/7">The NST for health inequalities, has been expanded and will have offered to visit all Spearheads by summer 2009.</p>
	<p pid="c.465W.5/8">In addition, the Department is funding the Improvement Foundation to deliver a Healthy Communities Collaborative programme to promote earlier presentations of cardiovascular disease and cancer symptoms in Spearhead areas. In addition, the Department has continued or expanded support for communities to tackle inequalities such as the Improvement and Development Agency's Healthy Communities and Communities for Health programmes.</p>
	<p pid="c.465W.5/9">A range of important tools has been developed to support target delivery in local areas, including:</p>

	<p pid="c.466W.2/1">National level analysis of the life expectancy gap by the Department shows circulatory disease, cancer and respiratory disease account for around two thirds of the gap in men and women. Other drivers of the gap are digestive diseases, external causes of injury and poisoning, infections and parasitic diseases and deaths under 28 days. Further information is contained in &quot;Tackling Health Inequalities: 2005-07 Policy and Data Update for the 2010 National Target&quot;, which has already been placed in the Library.</p>

The reduction in team numbers since 2006 has been minimal at both national and strategic health authority (SHA) level. Nationally, the number of teams was 252 in 2006 and 249 in 2008. The corresponding figures for South West SHA were 29 in 2006 and 28 in 2008. Primary care trusts are responsible for ensuring that the number of teams commissioned meets local need.</p>

	<p pid="c.472W.8/1">It is the responsibility of the board of the trust, with the new leadership in place, to ensure it fully implements the recommendations made within the Healthcare Commission's (HC) report. The trust is producing an action plan to implement the recommendations that it will agree with Care Quality Commission (CQC). Monitor, the foundation trust (FT) regulator, will hold the trust to account for delivery of the action plan. CQC, which replaced the HC on <phrase class="date" code="2009-04-01">1 April 2009</phrase>, has informed us that they plan to take stock with the trust and Monitor at three months and perform a follow up review in approximately six months time to provide the necessary assurance that all the recommendations in the HC's report have been satisfactorily addressed.</p>
	<p pid="c.472W.8/2">David Nicholson, chief executive of the national health service, wrote to all NHS organisations on <phrase class="date" code="2009-03-18">18 March 2009</phrase> urging NHS leaders to ensure that the recommendations set out in the report are fully understood by boards and that any local actions necessary are implemented with immediate effect. In addition, Monitor has written to all FTs making clear the expectation that their boards should consider the contents and recommendations of the HC report and implement any actions to ensure they do not breach their terms of authorisation. In his letter, the chief executive made clear that where senior NHS management and boards fail to act in the light of the HC recommendations to assure the ongoing quality and safety of the care they provide, they must and will be held accountable.</p>
	<p pid="c.472W.8/3">In addition, Professor Sir George Alberti is undertaking a rapid review at Stafford of the procedures for emergency admissions to ensure the trust is providing the best service it can to patients, building on the progress already made in implementing the recommendations of the HC. Dr. David Colin-Thom&eacute; is undertaking a rapid local review to identify what the people who commission NHS services and manage the performance of these services across England can learn from this case. The new National Quality Board (NQB) has been asked to look at how we can ensure that any early signs that something is going wrong with patient care are picked up immediately, that the right organisations are alerted, and that action is taken quickly. (The NQB is comprised of representatives from the Royal Colleges, patient groups, regulatory bodies and clinical experts, and has been set up to look at how organisations work together to improve the quality of patient care and patient experience.) Any recommendations arising from these reviews will be shared with the wider NHS for action as necessary.</p>

From the term 'respiratory complaints' the NHS Information Centre are unable to provide a definitive list of respiratory conditions without specification of the conditions required.

As a result the figures provided may provide an under count of episodes and admissions.<br/> 2.The NHS Information Centre are unable to provide data at individual hospital level and have therefore used the appropriate hospital providers of the requested hospitals:<br/> Ashford and St. Peter's Hospital NHS Trust - which includes Ashford Hospital<br/> Ealing Hospital NHS Trust - which includes Ealing Hospital<br/> The Hillingdon Hospital NHS Trust - which includes Hillingdon Hospital<br/> West Middlesex University Hospital NHS Trust - which includes West Middlesex University Hospital<br/> Richmond and Twickenham PCT - which includes Teddington Memorial Hospital.<br/> 3.

We also set out that we will commit an additional amount of &pound;30 million in 2010 dependent on performance and results. The Prime Minister also announced in September last year a further &pound;40 million in support to the Affordable Medicines Facility for Malaria (AMFM) which will be hosted by the fund as part of its existing business.</p>

	<p pid="c.490W.11/1">Predecessors of the Department for International Development commissioned studies by the Civil Aviation Authority in 1973 and 1987, both of which concluded that while a runway was feasible technically the costs would be considerable. DFID commissioned High Point Rendel as part of the Comparative Study of Air and Sea Access in 2001. This assessed costs of both forms of access indicating air access a better long-term option.</p>
	<p pid="c.490W.11/2">More recently, DFID commissioned Atkins to undertake the full feasibility study. This was completed in January 2005 and evaluated a wide range of options, including the proposed airport. It was on the basis of its conclusions that the Government went to tender in 2007. A full environmental impact assessment was carried out in 2005-06, following earlier studies into the St. Helena wirebird, invertebrates and lichens on the proposed airport site.</p>

	<p pid="c.492W.8/1">The Department for International Development's (DFID) main focus remains the delivery of the Global Plan to Stop TB 2006-15, which aims to save 14 million lives. We do this with substantial support through country programmes, multilateral organisations, global partnerships, research, and through using our political voice in the G8 and other fora.</p>
	<p pid="c.492W.8/2">Key priorities for TB control at present include addressing the challenges of HIV-TB co-infection and the increasing problem of drug resistance. We will continue to focus on both HIV and TB, and on strengthening the underlying health systems in order to improve the way health services diagnose and treat illnesses, including TB and TB-HIV. We will also continue to support research into new TB treatments. DFID recently made a new &pound;18 million funding package to the Global Alliance for TB Drug Development. This is part of the &pound;220 million committed for product development research for diseases including HIV, TB and malaria.</p>

As with previous summits, the UK Government will continue to work through all available channels in the lead up to the summit to ensure that tackling global health challenges remains a high priority for the leaders' agenda. The UK is strongly committed to reducing death and suffering from drug-resistant tuberculosis, and will encourage other G8 partners to ensure that tuberculosis is addressed as part of the comprehensive package of G8 measures.

	<p pid="c.495W.6/1">The management and protection of the environment has been devolved to the individual Overseas Territories. However, we recognise that there are capacity limitations in the Overseas Territories and that they need help to address conservation issues. The Government supports the Overseas Territories by providing funding through the Overseas Territories Environment Programme, a joint Foreign and Commonwealth Office and Department for International Development funded programme, and through the Darwin Initiative, a Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, funded programme, to encourage the conservation and preservation of biodiversity in the British Virgin Islands.</p>
	<p pid="c.495W.6/2">Through the Overseas Territories Environment Fund, we are funding a project for the community of Jost Van Dyke, the fourth largest inhabited island in the British Virgin Islands, to help it develop an environmental profile and increase environmental awareness among residents, stakeholders, visitors and government agencies, providing a long-term programme of education, outreach and environmental monitoring.</p>
	<p pid="c.495W.6/3">We have also provided funding for a project, working with the British Virgin Islands National Parks Trust, which has created an identification guide to the major Caribbean reef species. This enables accurate monitoring and conservation of the reefs, and also enables information to be shared across the Caribbean Overseas Territories, whose reefs have many ecological similarities.</p>

	<p pid="c.507W.11/2">The Overseas Pricing Mechanism (OPM) to support exchange rate pressures. Although HM Treasury withdrew support for the OPM we continue to operate the OPM internally to maintain the purchasing power of our overseas posts' local budgets.</p>

These provide the maximum cover allowed for our forecast US dollar and euro net exposure up to February 2010, and partial cover over the intervening months to January 2011.</p>

	<p pid="c.513W.8/2">From the Government's perspective, the Department for International Development has issued 117 contracts for our bi-lateral Iraq programme since March 2003. These all relate to our technical assistance projects in Iraq and are mostly small (under &pound;100,000) and often to individual consultants. Some are considerably larger with sixteen over &pound;1 million in value and the highest of &pound;11,700,000.

Despite the Government of Nepal making repeated commitments to promoting respect for human rights, they have made limited progress. They have however taken steps towards the proportional inclusion of minorities in all organs and at all levels of the state. They have also increased the budget for the national human rights commission, and has discussed the introduction of a bill to establish a truth and reconciliation commission.</p>
	<p pid="c.515W.3/2">The continuing impunity for past and ongoing human rights abuses remains a key concern. It has encouraged a lack of respect for the law which encourages people to turn to violence to resolve disputes. Poor public security, particularly in the Terai (plains), where there is a proliferation of armed groups, is a major obstacle to improving human rights in Nepal. We are also concerned at the increase in intimidation and violence against journalists which is leading to self-censorship by journalists. Political interference in police investigations is commonplace and we continue to receive reports of torture in police custody.</p>
	<p pid="c.515W.3/3">Our embassy in Kathmandu closely monitors the human rights situation. During the past year we have raised our concerns, including at ministerial level, about attacks on the media, freedom of expression and movement, excessive use of force by the security forces, and the need to discharge minors from the Maoist people's liberation army. We will continue to engage with the government of Nepal both bi-laterally and in conjunction with the EU, other international partners, and the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights to urge it to meet the commitments it has made to uphold and promote human rights. Our embassy is also supporting the efforts of civil society to combat impunity, through advocacy, training and work on legislative reform.</p>
