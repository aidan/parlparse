The Treasury, for example, supports the goals of the big society by ensuring that the tax system supports charitable giving. The Charity Tax Forum was established in 2010 to provide input to Treasury on the effectiveness of the charity tax system in supporting charitable giving. Furthermore, the Chancellor announced a &#163;470 million package to support the civil society sector as part of the spending review and the Treasury is working closely with the Cabinet Office on the implementation of the Big Society Bank. To support public service reform, the Treasury has also eliminated top-down process targets in favour of front-line professional judgment by scrapping public service agreements.</p>

	<p pid="a.1198W.3/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="a.1198W.3/2">There were 603,700 referrals to children's social care services in England in 2009-10, an increase of 56,700 (10.4%) from the 2008-09 figures. The 2008-09 referral figures were themselves a small increase of 8,500 (1.6%) from the 2007-08 figures.</p>
	<p pid="a.1198W.3/3">Although comparing 2009-10 data to previous years is not straightforward-due to a change in how data is collected, it is clear that there has been an overall increase in the number of referrals received by children's social care services. The increase may be explained by a number of factors and the Department has not made a separate assessment of the impact of high profile child protection cases.</p>
	<p pid="a.1198W.3/4">The independent review of child protection in England commissioned from Professor Eileen Munro has been looking closely at the referral process. In her recent interim report, Professor Munro observes that:</p>
	<p pid="a.1198W.3/5" class="indent">&quot;the variation in referral rates around the country and the fluctuations in referral rates in response to high profile child deaths both suggest the complexity, uncertainty, and anxiety play a significant part in making the decision to refer&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1198W.3/6">Professor Munro is examining local innovations that have helped reduce the number of inappropriate referrals to children's social care and will be submitting recommendations for reform on this area to the Government in her final report in April.</p>
	<p pid="a.1198W.3/7">This reply applies to England only. The issues raised are the responsibility of the Welsh Assembly Government in Wales.</p>

It is awarded where surgery is undertaken within 36 hours of admission, where specialist geriatric assessment takes place within 72 hours and where the patient follows an agreed care pathway.

	<p pid="a.1202W.8/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2010-12-21">21 December 2010</phrase>, we published the consultation document &quot;Healthy Lives, Healthy People: consultation on the funding and commissioning routes for public health&quot;, a copy of which has already been placed in the Library. The consultation period ends on <phrase class="date" code="2011-03-31">31 March</phrase>. For sexual health, we propose that local authorities will be responsible for commissioning comprehensive open-access sexual health services using funds from the ring-fenced public health budget.</p>
	<p pid="a.1202W.8/2">The Department wants to ensure that local authorities are accountable to their local communities, and that they are able to determine how best to improve public health and reduce inequalities in health in their local area. However, some public health services for which local authorities will take responsibility will need to be commissioned in a universal way in all areas. The consultation asks which services should be mandatory for local authorities to provide or commission.</p>
	<p pid="a.1202W.8/3">The public health grant to local authorities will be made under section 31 of the Local Government Act 2003 and as a ring-fenced grant will carry some conditions about how it is to be used. These conditions could be used to ensure the ring-fenced grant is spent appropriately, including ensuring value for money.</p>
	<p pid="a.1202W.8/4">We are consulting on which essential conditions should be placed on the ring-fence grant to ensure a successful transition of responsibility for public health to local authorities. For example, to specify the role of the Director of Public Health in relation to spending decisions: or, to provide for other accountability arrangements. However, we will need to balance the need to ensure accountability for spend against the desirability of maximising the capacity for local decision-making about how best to spend the money and to minimise bureaucracy. We intend to seek to ensure this balance in any conditions that we impose on the grant.</p>

	<p pid="a.1204W.12/1">Local newspapers continue to face challenging times as they meet the demands of structural and cyclical change. There is some evidence to show that newspapers might be over the worst, but advertising, which is the main source of income, remains depressed. To allow local news groups to provide a better offering to advertisers the Secretary of State recently announced that he would introduce secondary legislation to repeal certain cross media ownership rules. These include the rule that prohibits a person that owns a local radio licence with more than 45% coverage to also own a local newspaper with 50% or more coverage within the same area. This would allow local media groups to offer a more comprehensive package to advertisers and follows the recommendation made by the industry regulator Ofcom.</p>

Furthermore, in recent years the number of offences recorded has been affected by the powers available to the police for possession of cannabis offences. In April 2004, the introduction of cannabis warnings allowed the police to issue a warning on the street and in January 2009 the police were also given the power to issue penalty notices for disorder (PNDs) for possession of cannabis.</p>

	<p pid="a.1214W.5/2"><i> </i>DEFRA has not received any recent reports that are specifically on the costs of beef production to farmers. Data from the Farm Business Survey indicate that average farm business income on grazing livestock (cattle and sheep) farms increased over the period 2007-08 to 2009-10 from &#163;12,500 to &#163;22,000 for lowland enterprises and from &#163;10,500 to &#163;22,000 for those in the less favoured areas (LFA).</p>
	<p pid="a.1214W.5/3">However, provisional estimates for 2010-11 indicate a fall in income to around &#163;11,500 in the lowlands and to &#163;14,500 in the LFA due to higher input costs and lower prices for finished cattle.</p>

	<p pid="a.1214W.8/1">Four EU member states have placed some additional restrictions-not bans-on the use of neonicotinoid insecticides. The UK pesticides regulator keeps up to date with developments on this issue through contacts with its counterparts in other member states and participation in EU fora.</p>
	<p pid="a.1214W.8/2">A scientific report submitted to the European Food Safety Authority in December 2009, entitled: &quot;Bee Mortality and Bee Surveillance in Europe&quot;, showed that although there have been some high colony losses in Europe, there is a lack of comparative data and the contributory factors are not fully understood. In addition, the effectiveness of the surveillance systems employed by member states varies considerably, which causes difficulties in assessing trends and forecasts. The European Commission has recently announced, as part of a series of initiatives on bee health, that a pilot surveillance programme will be started-by the end of 2011. The programme is aimed at providing a better understanding of the situation in the EU.</p>

	<p pid="a.1217W.11/1">DEFRA has commissioned work to understand the potential for encouraging increased consumption of less popular species like dab, flounder and gurnards as part of an initiative called Fishing for the Markets. This project aims to increase consumption of sustainable, underutilised fish species that are often discarded. Coley is a quota species with very good quota uptake and so it may not be a good candidate for us to encourage increased consumer uptake, as a small increase could mean we overfish the stock.</p>
	<p pid="a.1217W.11/2">The Fishing for the Markets project began last year and research is ongoing. Initial results will be available in spring 2011 and measures to encourage consumption of those species considered sustainable will be developed from these findings.</p>

	<p pid="a.1222W.8/1">We will put in place legislation to prohibit the first-placing of illegal timber on the EU market, restricting its purchase, possession and sale down the supply chain. Further details, including our plans for public consultation, will be announced in due course. This is complemented by the Forest Law Enforcement Governance and Trade Regulation, which requires timber imports from countries that have signed a Voluntary Partnership Agreement with the EU to carry a licence to prove legality. These new legislative measures underline our commitment to eliminate illegal timber from the UK market.</p>

	<p pid="a.1224W.9/1">Our calculations were based on the amounts of local authority central services equivalent grant (LACSEG), which we currently pay to academies that have converted from a maintained school. There are two elements to the grant: the proportion which the Department can recoup from the dedicated schools grant that would otherwise go to local authorities, and the proportion that the Department cannot recoup because it is in respect of services normally paid from other local authority funds. For the latter, on the basis of local authorities' financial statements provided to the Department under section 251 of the Apprenticeships Schools Children and Learning Act 2009, we estimated an average amount per pupil across all local authorities, and applied that to our estimates of the number of new academies opening over the next two years, using average school sizes. The resultant amounts were then reduced to reflect annual reductions in local authorities' formula grant. The final amounts deducted from local authorities' formula grant were &#163;148 million in 2011-12 and &#163;265 million in 2012-13.</p>

EIG will replace a number of existing funding streams which will come to an end in 2011. Details were announced by the Secretary of State for Education on <phrase class="date" code="2010-12-13">13 December 2010</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.1226W.8/2">EIG will not be ring fenced because we are committed to giving local authorities greater autonomy and flexibility enabling them to use resources in ways that reflect local need, not central Government prescription. It will be for local authorities to determine how they use that resource to best effect, including what services would be funded for families with disabled children, early support and key working. The grant will help local authorities to support vulnerable young people to engage in education and training, intervening early with those who are at risk of disengagement and to support those young people who have a learning difficulty, disability or mental health problem.</p>

	<p pid="a.1230W.2/2">We are currently reviewing the national curriculum with a view to focusing it on the essential body of knowledge in key subjects which all children need to learn in order to succeed in education and in life, and to give teachers greater freedom beyond that core to design and teach a curriculum which best meets the needs of their pupils. We intend that English, mathematics, science and physical education will continue to be compulsory subjects within the national curriculum at Key Stages 1 to 4 in future. The review will determine which other subjects will remain compulsory, and at which key stages.</p>

The statutory guidance on promoting the educational achievement of looked-after children (March 2010) and promoting the health and well being of looked-after children (November 2009) are also pertinent to the work of educational psychologists.

Our reforms will ensure that schools have the freedom and flexibilities to organise staff and resources in a way that reflects local priorities and needs.

Classical civilisations was not included in the humanities element of the English Baccalaureate for the 2010 performance tables because the historical element of the course was not considered sufficient.

	<p pid="a.1235W.2/3">Funding for free nursery education is devolved to local authorities through the Dedicated Schools Grant. It is a matter for local authorities to distribute this funding locally. In July 2010, we announced that every local authority will be expected to introduce the Early Years Single Funding Formula (EYSFF) from April 2011 following successful implementation in more than 70 pathfinder areas this year. The EYSFF is designed to increase transparency and fairness in the way funding is allocated to providers offering free nursery education for three and four-year-olds, by establishing locally driven criteria which are applied on an equitable basis across all providers; including maintained nursery schools, primary schools, private, voluntary and independent providers. The Department encourages providers to engage in a constructive dialogue with local authorities about the level of funding, and the transparency of the EYSFF supports this.</p>
	<p pid="a.1235W.2/4">Many providers up and down the country are offering an outstanding service to parents and their children within existing funding levels. The Government are listening to the views of providers on early years funding; we are keen to work with the sector to reduce administrative burdens on providers.</p>

	<p pid="a.1237W.2/4">The Childcare Act 2006 gave schools the power, subject to Regulations, to charge for early education in addition to the 15 free hours now provided for three and four-year-olds. The provisions in clause 47 of the Education Bill amend existing legislation governing what costs nursery schools (and schools with nursery classes) can include in determining the charges for additional early education, principally to enable schools to include the costs of permanent teaching staff who provide the early education provision. As such, we do not anticipate that the provisions in the Education Bill will have an impact on levels of child poverty, nor a discriminatory impact. However, by enabling schools to expand their provision, we are giving parents greater choice, in their early education and childcare arrangements, supporting them to work or return to work.</p>

	<p pid="a.1253W.0/4">As a part of the spending review tough decisions about departmental budgets have been taken and, like all other areas further education has made its contribution. We have had some difficult choices but we will prioritise funding support for learners with very low levels of skills and unemployed people actively seeking work who are recipients of jobseeker's allowance (JSA) or employment support allowance (work related activity group; ESA (WRAG)) so that we can prepare them for work.</p>
	<p pid="a.1253W.0/5">It is not for us to attempt to plan the delivery of further education and skills from the top down. Instead our simplification agenda will give colleges and training organisations the freedoms and flexibilities to respond to local need, giving JobCentre Plus and employers a key role in shaping the volume and content of further education and skills provision. We expect that the availability of fee remission for those on JSA or ESA (WRAG) will make them an attractive client group for colleges and training organisations. In addition we are piloting an approach to give colleges and training organisations a financial incentive for helping learners who are unemployed through the piloting of new job outcome payments for further education colleges and training organisations.</p>
	<p pid="a.1253W.0/6">We do not hold data relating to the questions you have asked about the Job Outcome Incentive pilots that will operate in the academic year 2011/12 centrally and so I have asked the chief executive of the Skills Funding Agency to write to the hon. Member to provide the details already agreed regarding the operation of the pilots.</p>
	<p pid="a.1253W.0/7" class="italic"> Letter from Geoff Russell, dated <phrase class="date" code="2011-03-07">7 March 2011</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="a.1253W.0/8" class="indent">Thank you for your parliamentary questions addressed to the Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills in which you asked:</p>
	<p pid="a.1253W.0/9" class="indent">1. What criteria will be used to determine whether successful employment has been secured as a result of education or training under the job outcome payment scheme (PQ 2010/4320);</p>
	<p pid="a.1253W.0/10" class="indent">2. What his estimate is of the number of learners who will participate in the job outcome scheme pilots in the academic year 2011-12 (PQ 2010/4321); and</p>
	<p pid="a.1253W.0/11" class="indent">3. Whether learners referred to further education colleges as part of the skills conditionality scheme will be included in the assessment of the job outcome payment scheme pilots in academic year 2011-12 (PQ 2010/4323)</p>
	<p pid="a.1253W.0/12" class="indent">Please be advised job outcome incentive payments will be piloted in the 2011/12 academic year as previously announced. The specific arrangements for how the payments will operate are still to be finally agreed. We expect the agreed process to reflect overall performance at provider level, in the context of local labour market conditions, rather than at the level of the individual learner. We will look to reward colleges and independent training providers for the work they undertake to help move individuals claiming Jobseeker's Allowance and the Employment and Support Allowance (those who fall in the work-ready activity group) into employment. This will include learners who are referred under the skills conditionality regulations.</p>

	<p pid="a.1254W.2/1">As part of the spending review tough decisions about departmental budgets have been taken and, like all other areas, further education has made its contribution. This has included reviewing the extent to which automatic fee remission for adult skills is provided, and in this context we have prioritised English for Speakers of Other Languages (ESOL) funding to unemployed people in receipt of jobseeker's allowance or in the employment and support allowance (work-related activity) group, where English language skills have been identified as a barrier to entering employment. We will continue to pay 50% of ESOL course fees for people who are settled here. Increased freedoms and flexibilities for providers will allow them to respond to the needs of their communities and determine within their funding where this is prioritised.</p>
	<p pid="a.1254W.2/2">The Equality Impact Assessment published alongside Skills for Sustainable Growth (November 2010) found that, at the aggregate level, there are unlikely to be disproportionate impacts on protected groups. A separate assessment of how the changes may affect ESOL learners is currently being carried out by this Department. I expect to be able to publish the assessment in due course.</p>

Our embassy in Bahrain is closely monitoring the security situation in that country, including how it might affect the safety of UK nationals. This situation is reflected in the Foreign and Commonwealth Office travel advice for Bahrain.</p>
	<p pid="a.1256W.10/2">Updates are provided regularly to UK nationals in the country via the embassy webpage, Facebook site and Locate registration system. An advertisement has been placed in local English newspapers to encourage UK nationals to use these channels.</p>

This consultation document sets out the changes that we propose to make to the child maintenance system to increase its effectiveness for all families and seeks views to inform our thinking as we outline the way forward.</p>
	<p pid="a.1259W.12/2">At present only half of children living in families where parents have separated are supported with effective financial maintenance arrangements. The proposed charges are to enable more parents to take responsibility and to make effective maintenance arrangements. The proposals are based on the recommendations of Sir David Henshaw's 2006 review 'Recovering child support: routes to responsibility'. The Government recognise the specific circumstances of victims of domestic violence, and it is proposed that these clients will be exempt from the application charge. Additionally for parents on prescribed benefits, there will be reduced charges. The consultation also puts forward the option of fast-tracking other vulnerable families through the gateway and onto the statutory system.</p>
	<p pid="a.1259W.12/3">The Government will develop detailed proposals in relation to these criteria and these will be outlined in draft regulations later in the year. The impact assessments accompanying the draft regulations will set out the estimated impacts on volumes and individuals who will be affected by the proposed new charges.</p>

We do not have an estimate of the number of people who may be eligible for disability living allowance.

The detailed criteria that will be used in the new assessment to determine eligibility are currently being developed and are being informed by the consultation which recently closed. At this stage it is not possible to provide an assessment of the impact of personal independence payment on existing disability living allowance, or future recipients, although we are working with disabled people and organisations who represent them on the design and delivery of personal independence payment to ensure that disabled people have a clear understanding of its eligibility criteria and claiming process.</p>

	<p pid="a.1262W.5/1">From 2013 we will replace disability living allowance (DLA) with personal independence payment for new and existing working-age claimants. Personal independence payment will be a new, more transparent and sustainable benefit. Like DLA, personal independence payment will be a non-means-tested, cash benefit which contributes to the extra costs incurred by disabled people as a result of their health condition or impairment.</p>
	<p pid="a.1262W.5/2">There is no information available on the number of DLA recipients accessing mental health services or primary care services. However we expect individuals to be accessing the relevant support services, regardless of benefit receipt. We therefore do not expect the reforms to DLA to impact mental health or primary care services.</p>
	<p pid="a.1262W.5/3">The employment rate of 16 to 64-year-olds in receipt of DLA is 14%. Evidence suggests that DLA can act as a barrier to work and that receiving it appears to reduce the likelihood of being in employment, even after allowing for the impact of health conditions or impairments. Like DLA, personal independence payment will be available regardless of employment status. By giving people the right level of support through personal independence payment, we hope that many more disabled people will be able to work and enjoy the advantages that an active working life can bring.</p>
	<p pid="a.1262W.5/4">The impact assessment for disability living allowance reform considers the impact of DLA reform on health and employment. The impact assessment can be found on the DWP website at:</p>

	<p pid="a.1263W.2/1">The reason we have done this is to offer greater protection to those undergoing chemotherapy, those in residential rehabilitation and those with particularly severe mental health conditions in the support group.</p>
	<p pid="a.1263W.2/2">In addition, we do not believe those who have adapted to their condition should remain in the Work Related Activity Group (WRAG) but should be given the support to look for work.

	<p pid="a.1264W.0/1">We are committed to ensuring that disabled people have the same employment opportunities and chances as everyone else to find and stay in paid employment, regardless of their disability or benefit status.</p>
	<p pid="a.1264W.0/2">As part of this commitment, the Department for Work and Pensions is responsible for a range of employment provision specifically aimed at disabled people, including those receiving jobseeker's allowance (JSA).</p>
	<p pid="a.1264W.0/3" class="indent">Work Choice, which was launched in October last year, provides tailored support to help disabled people who face the most complex barriers to employment find and stay in work and ultimately help them progress into unsupported employment, where it is appropriate for the individual. Work Choice is voluntary and available regardless of any benefits being claimed.</p>
	<p pid="a.1264W.0/4" class="indent">Access to Work provides practical advice and financial support to employed disabled people above and beyond what the employer could reasonably provide, to help them overcome obstacles resulting from disability and thus stay in work.</p>
	<p pid="a.1264W.0/5">In addition Remploy, an executive non-departmental public body sponsored by the Department for Work and Pensions, delivers a range of employment and development opportunities for disabled people under the Work Choice programme.</p>
	<p pid="a.1264W.0/6">The Department for Work and Pensions also funds residential training for unemployed disabled adults whose needs cannot be met through any other government-funded programmes.</p>
	<p pid="a.1264W.0/7">From April 2011 the support that Jobcentre Plus delivers to customers across all working age benefits (including JSA) is changing. Jobcentre Plus managers and advisers will have more flexibility to judge which interventions will help disabled customers move towards paid employment in the most cost-effective way ensuring provision is tailored to personal and local labour market needs. To support this, Jobcentre Plus are introducing a suite of measures bringing together communities, the voluntary sector, business people and employers, to help get people back to work.</p>
	<p pid="a.1264W.0/8">Jobcentre Plus will continue to work closely with local health services, supported by disability employment advisers and work psychologists.</p>

This review is being conducted by Liz Sayce, chief executive of the disability organisation RADAR and will report in summer 2011, with recommendations on how existing specialist employment support for disabled people can better serve the Department's wide-ranging customer base.</p>

	<p pid="a.1265W.0/1">We have begun reassessing the benefit entitlement of all old-style incapacity benefits claimants. Those people who are assessed as capable of work will be moved onto jobseekers allowance where eligible. People who are assessed as having limited capability for work will be moved to employment and support allowance. We are reassessing everyone claiming old-style incapacity benefits, regardless of the date of their last incapacity benefit assessment.</p>
	<p pid="a.1265W.0/2">We do not believe that it would be right to exclude claimants from the reassessment process as a result of a particular health condition or disability. Many people with health conditions are able to sustain and progress in employment if they are supported to do so. Those people being exempted from the reassessment are those incapacity benefits claimants who will reach retirement age during the reassessment process, as they will shortly be claiming benefits for pensioners.</p>
	<p pid="a.1265W.0/3">Those claimants being reassessed need to undergo a work capability assessment (WCA) to allow us to understand their ability to engage in work or work-related activities. The work capability assessment is based on the premise that eligibility for employment and support allowance should not be based on a person's health condition or disability, but rather on the way their health condition or disability limits their functional capability. Therefore, claimants are not automatically exempted from the work capability assessment because they have a particular health condition or disability.</p>
	<p pid="a.1265W.0/4">A face-to-face assessment by a trained health care professional is a standard part of the work capability assessment process. However, we recognise that asking claimants to attend an unnecessary face-to-face assessment is in no one's interests. People who unfortunately have a terminal illness do not need to undergo a face-to-face assessment as part of the reassessment of their incapacity benefit. These claimants will automatically be treated as having limited capability for work-related activity, and so will be placed in the Support Group of Employment and Support Allowance, where they will not be expected to undertake work related activity. Some other claimants may also be exempted from a face-to-face assessment if we are able to make an assessment based purely on the evidence provided.</p>
	<p pid="a.1265W.0/5">Terminal illness for these purposes means that a claimant is suffering from a progressive disease, and that death in consequence of that disease can reasonably be expected within six months.</p>

	<p pid="a.1266W.6/1">The Government have restored the earnings link for the basic state pension and given a triple guarantee that the basic state pension will increase by the highest of the growth in average earnings, price increases (as measured by the consumer prices index) or 2.5%. It is estimated that the average person retiring on a full basic state pension in April 2011 will receive &#163;15,000 more in basic state pension income over their retirement than they would have done under the old prices link.</p>
	<p pid="a.1266W.6/2">The restoration of the earnings link and the triple guarantee will benefit both existing and future pensioners by providing a more generous state pension, giving a solid financial foundation from the state, which is essential as part of the pensions system.</p>
	<p pid="a.1266W.6/3">In April 2011 it is proposed that the basic state pension will increase by 4.6%, in line with the retail prices index, to fulfil a commitment made at the Budget. After that the triple guarantee will apply.</p>
	<p pid="a.1266W.6/4">This Government are protecting key benefits for pensioners. Free eye tests; free prescription charges; free bus passes; free television licences for the over 75s; and winter fuel payments will remain exactly as budgeted for by the previous Government. We have also made the temporary increase in the cold weather payment to &#163;25 permanent.</p>
	<p pid="a.1266W.6/5">We are introducing automatic enrolment into workplace pensions from 2012. This is a central element of our strategy to reinvigorate private pension savings and aims to harness inertia and bring about a change in people's behaviour in saving for retirement. We expect this to radically increase the number of people saving into a pension and to lead to between 5 million and 8 million people newly saving or saving more in all forms of workplace pension schemes.</p>
	<p pid="a.1266W.6/6">We are conducting a research study to help build the evidence base on how the information that we routinely collect can be used more effectively to ensure pensioners get the help that is available through pension credit. This is a longer term aspiration and the study is a first step in seeing if this type of approach might be possible.</p>

	<p pid="a.1267W.2/1">The assessment is being developed in collaboration with an independent group of specialists in health, social care and disability, including disabled people. Its membership encompasses a wide variety of relevant expertise and reflects a broad range of experience in the needs of disabled people. As well as representatives from RADAR and Equality 2025, the group includes individuals from professions such as occupational therapy, psychiatry, physiotherapy, social work, general practice and community psychiatric nursing. This approach ensures that the initial development work is being undertaken within a holistic view of the impact of disability.</p>
	<p pid="a.1267W.2/2">This group is currently undertaking the early design work on the assessment criteria. Once the broad principles are in place, we will work with the assessment group, disabled people and their organisations on refinement and testing. We know it is essential that the assessment accurately captures the needs of disabled people with autistic spectrum disorders and this is something that the development group is considering. We are still considering the delivery model for the assessment and no decisions have yet been taken. We recognise the importance of providing adequate training and guidance for assessors and of ensuring that the assessment process is appropriate to individual's circumstances, including individuals with autistic spectrum disorders.</p>
	<p pid="a.1267W.2/3">During the public consultation on DLA reform, we received responses from a number of disability organisations representing autistic spectrum disorders. Both I and departmental officials have also met with the National Autistic Society to discuss our reform proposals and to seek their views on how the new benefit can best support those with autism. We agree with many of the points raised in the National Autistic Society's recent report on DLA reform, 'Who benefits?', and we are looking closely at how these recommendations can be incorporated into its design. We will continue to work with disabled people and their organisations as the detail of the assessment criteria and its operation is developed and tested.</p>

	<p pid="a.1268W.2/1">From 2013 we will replace disability living allowance for people of working age with personal independence payment, a new, more transparent and sustainable benefit with an objective assessment of individual need. Support through personal independence payment will be focussed on those with the most need. The detailed criteria that will be used in the new assessment to determine eligibility are currently being developed and are being informed by the consultation which recently closed. I am, therefore, unable at this time to comment on how the new assessment will work or make estimates of its impact on people with specific health conditions or impairments. However, we are committed to ensuring that it reflects the needs of all individuals effectively. We recognise that the current assessment criteria for disability living allowance can favour physical impairments and does not always fully reflect the needs of disabled people with mental, intellectual, cognitive and development impairments, including autistic spectrum disorders.</p>
	<p pid="a.1268W.2/2">The Department remains committed to supporting the life chances of people with autism. They will continue to benefit from the delivery of more flexible services across government for people facing complex barriers; through the introduction of the universal credit; and through the Work programme and Work Choice.</p>

	<p pid="a.1272W.2/1">The Ministry of Justice collects statistical information on the length of time from death to the completion of inquest in aggregate form by asking coroners to report the number of inquests completed within specified time bands. The estimated average length of time between death and completion of inquest for inquests completed during 2009 for each coroner's district in England and Wales is set out in the table. We do not, however, hold data relating to the length of time taken to complete any individual inquest, so do not have information about the inquest which took the longest time to complete in each coroner district, or why.</p>

The average time for an inquest to be conducted is estimated in the following way: Coroners are asked in their annual return to state how many inquests were concluded within certain time periods. There are five time bands, which are: within one month; 1-3 months; 3-6 months; 6-12 months; and over 12 months. All the inquests falling within a time-band are then assumed to have been completed at or near the mid-point of the various time-bands for the purposes of calculating the average, although inquests within the &quot;under one month&quot; band are assumed to have taken 3 weeks for this purpose of this estimation, and those inquests taking over a year to conclude were deemed to have taken 18 months, although the time-band itself is open-ended. Numbers are then aggregated and the average figure (in weeks) calculated in the normal way.<br/> 3. Only deaths occurring within England and Wales are included in the calculation. Statistics are not collected on the time taken for inquests where the death occurred outside England and Wales.</td> </tr>

	<p pid="a.1278W.0/21">The Ministry of Justice recently issued a memorandum to the Justice Select Committee on the operation of the MCA to date, which makes a preliminary assessment of the impact of the Act and the effectiveness of its implementation. The Ministry and the Office of the Public Guardian (OPG) will consider what additional evaluation of the Act, and further consideration of how the needs of vulnerable people are being met, would be useful and will take forward future research as appropriate.</p>
	<p pid="a.1278W.0/22">With respect to the levels of protection from fraud, LP As offer greater protection for the customer compared to EPAs. These include the need for registration with the OPG before an LPA can be used and the requirement for an independent person, known as a Certificate Provider, to certify that the customer understands the implications of making the LPA. The customer is also able to choose who should be notified when an application to register is made and these people can object to registration if they have any concerns.</p>
	<p pid="a.1278W.0/23">The number of objections made to the Court of Protection in relation to the registration of an EPA or an LPA are shown in the following table. This provides some evidence that the safeguards provided by the MCA are working.

The Judicial Studies Board ensures that magistrates are kept up-to-date with relevant legislation and are given training on the sentencing powers that are available to them.

	<p pid="a.1282W.2/1">In all cases the courts determine which sentence or sentences to impose and how those sentences should be served. The general principle they follow is that offences arising from the same incident will usually lead to concurrent sentences. On the same general principle, offences committed on separate occasions against different victims usually result in consecutive sentences.</p>

No separate estimate has been made of the effect of restricting the maximum discount to admissions at the police station, though it would undoubtedly be less.

	<p pid="a.1283W.5/2">In an individual case a court may obtain and consider a pre-sentence report providing information about the offender's circumstances and making a sentencing proposal.

Having no address or spending a short period abroad do not necessarily prevent the court from imposing a community order, where that is the appropriate sentence. For example, an offender can comply with a supervision requirement of a community order if he has no fixed abode. Where an offender intends to go abroad for a short period, the court could delay the start of a community order to accommodate the visit, depending on its purpose.</p>

	<p pid="a.1284W.2/1">Restricting the guilty plea discount to suspects who co-operate in interview with the police and then plead guilty in court would risk reducing the incidence of guilty pleas at the first court hearing, as there would be no incentive for a defendant who had failed to make admissions in interview to plead guilty thereafter. This would not be in the interests of the efficiency of the criminal justice system or of victims and witnesses.

The Secretary of State for International Development and the Business Secretary, as well as other DFID and BIS Ministers, had many discussions on the range of issues contained within the White Paper.</p>
	<p pid="a.1286W.0/2">The Exports Credit Guarantee Department (ECGD) pilot schemes announced in the White Paper largely focus on supporting small and medium enterprises in the UK. DFID will continue to fully engage with ECGD by providing case-by-case assessments of these and ongoing ECGD transactions where they relate to the poorest countries. This practice is in line with Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) guidelines and ensures that ECGD-backed lending supports the financial future and long-term prospects of developing countries.</p>

	<p pid="a.1290W.2/3" class="indent">As Director General for the Office for National Statistics, I have been asked to reply to your Parliamentary Question to asking what payments account for the difference between the UK's net contribution to the EU budget in 2009 and the UK's Current Account balance with EU institutions. (43943)</p>
	<p pid="a.1290W.2/4" class="indent">Annual data for 2009 on the UK's transactions with the EU, including the UK's current account balance with EU institutions, are published in the UK Balance of Payments (Pink Book) 2010:</p>

	<p pid="a.1290W.2/6" class="indent">The data published in the Pink Book are consistent with the concepts and definitions in the International Monetary Fund (IMF) Balance of Payment's Manual version 5 (BPM5) which is the internationally agreed framework for the compilation and presentation of Balance of Payments statistics. The UK's current account transactions with EU institutions in 2009 are published in Pink Book 2010, table 5.1, pp 78-80, and are largely based on HM Treasury data on UK transactions with the EU, as published in the White Paper (table 3.1, p21).</p>
	<p pid="a.1290W.2/7" class="indent">Some of the HM Treasury data are incorporated directly into the Pink Book, for example, figures for abatement receipts and VAT based contributions. However, some of the HM Treasury data need to be modified prior to incorporation, for reasons such as to bring the figures onto an accruals basis and to present them on a calendar year, rather than a financial year basis. Additionally, some of the HM Treasury data feed into the UK's capital account, rather than the current account, for example, receipts from the Agricultural Fund for Regional Development and European Regional Development Fund. These are shown in the Pink Book 2010, table 6.1, p. 85. Total official transactions between the UK and institutions of the EU (including current and capital account transactions) are published in the Pink Book 2010, table 9.9, p.161.</p>

The strategy will support the travel policy to ensure that Government Departments keep travel expenditure to a minimum. The use of online booking systems is a key element of this strategy as they provide the best access to advance, and therefore cheaper, fares and rates.</p>

	<p pid="a.1294W.6/1">Our analysis suggests that biomass heat and electricity could provide about 4.5% of overall energy demand by 2020. This would not all be met by burning wood-other biomass feedstocks include a broad range of wastes (eg food and municipal waste, landfill and sewage gas), residues such as straw, perennial energy crops such as miscanthus, and second generation technologies that do not require combustion. We do not have specific expectations for each particular biomass feedstock type but expect that burning wood from imported and domestic sources, preferably waste wood, will make a significant contribution to biomass heat and electricity generation in the UK by 2020.</p>
	<p pid="a.1294W.6/2">We are introducing sustainability criteria for the use of imported and domestic biomass to generate electricity under the renewables obligation from April this year. These criteria require a minimum greenhouse gas emissions saving of 60% compared to fossil fuel and include restrictions on the use of materials from land important on carbon or biodiversity grounds. We intend to do the same next year for heat generation under the renewable heat incentive.</p>

	<p pid="a.1298W.6/1">Support for the establishment of offshore wind manufacturing at port sites will be available from April 2011 to March 2015, and will be delivered through the Grant for Business Investment (GBI) scheme, a state-aid cleared scheme which will continue to be utilised to assess applications for this funding in England for the full period that the support is available. On <phrase class="date" code="2011-02-01">1 February 2011</phrase> the Government announced that the GBI scheme is closed for new applications, except for large exceptional projects and applications to DECC for support for major offshore wind manufacturing investments, which will therefore continue to be administered through this scheme.</p>
