	<p pid=".1563W.10/1">The Department for International Development (DFID) welcomes the launch of &quot;Millennium Ecosystem Assessment&quot; (MA). The report provides a useful and comprehensive overview of recent trends in ecosystem function. The detailed findings of the MA will further strengthen the evidence base for addressing the linkages between poverty and environment. This includes specific consideration of the role of ecosystems in supporting the livelihoods of the poor and the implications of changes in ecosystem function for achievement of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).</p>
	<p pid=".1563W.10/2">DFID officials have reviewed the main findings of the MA Synthesis Report. They welcome the MA's detailed overview of the status of ecosystems and the consideration of change under different scenarios. DFID's interests primarily relate to policies and actions that respond to environmental challenges while bringing financial and livelihood benefits to the poor. The MA responses of particular interest to DFID include those on: strengthening the integration of environmental considerations in development co-operation; developing markets and economic based incentives for more sustainable ecosystem use; and the research and application of appropriate technologies. This will support development and improvement of tools to better integrate environmental considerations into development co-operation. DFID is already active in many of these areas, for example in taking forward our commitments to support developing countries to integrate environmental considerations into Poverty Reduction Strategies; and work on payment for ecosystem services.</p>
	<p pid=".1563W.10/3">DFID will encourage the agencies involved in commissioning the report, including the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) and the Secretariats of the Conventions (in particular the Convention on Biological Diversity and the Framework Convention on Climate Change), to use the MA's analyses and results to inform their policy and implementation work.</p>
	<p pid=".1563W.10/4">DFID maintains strong working relationships with the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, especially in the areas of climate change, biodiversity and sustainable development. DFID officials will continue to work closely with DEFRA on these issues, taking account of the relevant findings of the MA.</p>

	<p pid=".1564W.2/1">The only instance since 2001&ndash;02 where the UK has suspended its bilateral aid programme is in Zimbabwe. DFID, in line with most other donors, suspended traditional development assistance programmes in late 2001 because of the poor policies of the Government and their unwillingness to engage constructively with the international community on crucial issues of political and economic governance. Our assistance has been confined to humanitarian assistance and support for civil society and United Nations programmes to tackle HIV and AIDS.</p>

These studies were carried out to improve population estimates in the areas that proved hardest to count in the 2001 Census in England and Wales. The results of these studies showed that better estimates of the population could be made in 15 areas, however for the great majority of areas, including Southend-on-Sea, the previously published 2001 Census based population estimate remains the best estimate of the population.</p>
	<p pid=".1570W.10/5" class="indent">As part of these studies ONS reviewed the evidence for all 376 Local Authorities to identify where population estimates may have been at risk.

	<p pid=".1572W.7/1">In December 2000, the Heritage Lottery Fund (HLF) awarded a grant of &pound;725,000 to the Warrior Preservation Trust for the restoration of HMS Warrior, the Royal Navy's first ironclad and the most revolutionary warship of her age. The award was conditional upon the trust satisfying HLF that the teak came from a sustainable source.</p>
	<p pid=".1572W.7/2">The Heritage Lottery Fund agreed new guidance on timber procurement in January 2005. Under this guidance, all timber used on HLF-funded projects must be obtained from verifiable legal sources. The preference must always be for HLF grant recipients to use timber that can be shown to have been obtained from sustainably managed forests. The guidance has been developed with the assistance of the UK Government's 'Central Point of Expertise on Timber' (CPET). Although there is no ban on companies trading with Burma, the Government does not encourage trade and investment with that country; neither does it give financial support to promote trade missions there.</p>

	<p pid=".1575W.2/2">The number of judicial officers that were in post between 1987&ndash;92 is detailed in tables A (full time) and B (part time). Gender breakdown for this period has not been given because it is not available. These figures include the Tribunal posts known about.</p>

	<p pid=".1577W.9/1">The vast majority of offences committed by Army personnel are dealt with by courts martial, following investigation by the military police. In some cases both in the UK and abroad there is concurrent jurisdiction. Often, the most appropriate jurisdiction is for the case to proceed in the military system. When considering the appropriate jurisdiction for trial the various considerations will be taken into account such as where the offence was allegedly committed in operational circumstances; whether there are other charges which can only be preferred under military law; witness availability; whether the alleged victim is military or civilian; whether the soldiers committed offences with civilians who are not subject to military law.</p>

	<p pid=".1590W.5/1">Local education authorities receive funding for all pupils on the school roll in their area through the Education Formula Spending Share. The formula also takes account of the number of pupils with English as an additional language. In 2004&ndash;05 the Ethnic Minority Achievement Grant, a matched funded grant which is part of the Standards Fund, has provided a total of &pound;162 million of ring-fenced funding to schools, aimed at raising the attainment of under-achieving minority ethnic pupils and those whose first language is other than English. For 2005&ndash;06, this total will be &pound;168.6 million.</p>
	<p pid=".1590W.5/2">In addition, in 2003 my Department conducted the &quot;Aiming High: Raising the Achievement of Minority Ethnic Pupils&quot; consultation. This has been followed by a wide range of initiatives aimed at addressing the specific needs of certain groups of pupils, including those whose first language is other than English. Part of this initiative is the Primary National Strategy English as an Additional Language (EAL) Pilot which involves the provision of EAL consultants in 21 local education authority areas, each working with 10 schools. The role of these consultants is to develop an intensive professional development programme for mainstream school staff. This will enable the development of improved skills and confidence among mainstream teachers and allow for the production of teaching and learning materials and the dissemination of good practice.</p>
	<p pid=".1590W.5/3">My Department has also worked with the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority (QCA) and Ofsted to promote a common national approach to assessment of the acquisition of English language fluency based on the National Curriculum in English levels. This approach states that particular care needs to be taken to assess the needs of newly arrived pupils and the importance of using pupils' first languages as part of the assessment process. Finally, my Department provided funding to the QCA to develop guidance to help teachers respond to the needs of newly arrived pupils. This guidance &quot;Pathways to Learning for New Arrivals&quot; was launched in December 2004 and provides all school staff with access to information on all aspects of integrating newly arrived pupils, including good practice case studies, to ensure that these pupils get full access to the National Curriculum.

	<p pid=".1598W.2/19">NVYO Grant Scheme</p>
	<p pid=".1598W.2/20">The Woodcraft Folk submitted a bid for funding under the National Voluntary Youth Organisation Grant scheme due to run from 2005 to 2008. This scheme was run as an open competition. Participation on previous schemes was not one of the criteria used to determine funding. The bid was assessed against criteria made explicit in both the application and guidance notes for the scheme.</p>
	<p pid=".1598W.2/21">The key reasons the Woodcraft Folk's bid was unsuccessful was that, in comparison with other bids, it did not provide the level of detail to enable the Department to determine either how the proposed activities would deliver the outcomes specified or how the outcomes specifically linked with the &quot;Every Child Matters&quot; agenda.</p>
	<p pid=".1598W.2/22">It is important to emphasise that even though the Woodcraft Folk's bid for funding under the National Voluntary Youth Organisation grant scheme was unsuccessful, this is no reflection on the work it does to promote the well-being of children and young people and their participation in society.</p>
	<p pid=".1598W.2/23">The scheme was open to all national voluntary sector organisations engaged in youth work and who met specific criteria and not just those on the existing scheme. We received 160 bids from a variety of national voluntary organisations which totalled over &pound;44 million for the length of the scheme. As the grant scheme was allocated &pound;21 million over three years we were unable to fund everyone who applied. We assessed all of the bids and awarded grants to those organisations which clearly demonstrated the outcomes and quality the scheme required to an agreed standard.</p>
	<p pid=".1598W.2/24">I met the Woodcraft Folk on the <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-04">4 April</phrase> to discuss their work. As a result of that meeting we agreed to second a member of DfES staff to the Woodcraft Folk for 12 months. We hope that that member of staff will be able to support the central organisation by helping it to look for new ways of diversifying the funding streams that it receives so that it secures long-term funding.</p>

The report of the independent inquiry into local government funding by Sir Michael Lyons will inform the Government's decisions on council tax bands. This report is due to be submitted by the end of this year to my right hon. Friends the Deputy Prime Minister and the Chancellor of the Exchequer. The Government have already made clear that the revaluation should not lead to a change in the overall council tax yield and consequently most council tax payers are unlikely to face an increase (or decrease) in their council tax bill as a result of revaluation. There will be a transitional relief scheme to help taxpayers whose properties move to a higher band. Council tax benefit will continue to be available to help those on low incomes with their council tax payments.</p>

	<p pid=".1609W.6/1">The DTI headcount as a proportion of those employed in the manufacturing sector was 0.14 per cent. in 1998 and 0.2 per cent. in 2004. But the DTI's remit covers the whole economy, and as a proportion of total employment the DTI's share remains broadly unchanged at 0.02 per cent. This is despite taking on additional responsibilities and meeting increased demand for our services.</p>

In my evidence to the Trade and Industry Committee on <phrase class="date" code="2005-02-23">23 February 2005</phrase> I referred to the seven such companies based on factually incorrect briefing.

It is ECGD's policy not to disclose details of insurance it provides, or the fact of having provided insurance, where it considers the disclosure of such information might increase the likelihood of default by the bodies whose payment obligations ECGD is insuring. This is because, the commercial interests of ECGD and the U.K economy would be prejudiced by a default. Pursuant to that policy the nine insurance cases referred to have not been publicised.</p>

Due to strict disclosure restrictions under Part 9 of the Enterprise Act 2002, the OFT is unable to comment on the details of any ongoing investigations. However, the OFT does publicise on its website and in the press any undertakings that it has obtained or court action it has taken under the Regulations when such action is completed.</p>

	<p pid=".1619W.3/1">Last year the DTI commissioned a study to develop a strategic framework for hydrogen energy activities in the UK. This was undertaken by E4tech, Element Energy and Eoin Lees Energy and was completed in December. A report of their analysis has been placed on the DTIs publications website at <a href="http://www.dti.gov.uk/energy/sepn/hydrogenframeworkfull.pdf">http://www.dti.gov.uk/energy/sepn/hydrogen framework full.pdf</a> from which it can be downloaded. We will be considering the specific recommendations carefully, and will publish these, together with our response shortly.</p>

However, being ex-directory does not mean a customer will never see their telephone number on a website. For example, telemarketing companies use databases to contact people. These are generally compiled by customers unwittingly completing coupons for special offers, magazine and catalogue tear off slips and other promotional questionnaires and flyers but forgetting to fill in the non-disclosure box (if available).</p>

	<p pid=".1635W.8/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2000-03-24">24 March 2000</phrase> the Environment Agency were notified of the discovery of a radioactive rod at Mormet Alloys in Tamworth. The Environment Agency reported that there was no indication of any hazard to members of the public and that no radioactive contamination had been found at the site. This rod would appear to have been one of two produced in the early 1960s by UKAEA Springfields (now BNFL) for engineering testing purposes. The rod was provided on loan to CA Parsons Ltd in Newcastle. This company was involved with construction consortia involved in the building of nuclear power stations. Because of the destruction of advice and delivery notes under the 30 year rule and the loss of the Parsons files it is impossible to establish if the rod was ever returned to Springfields by Parsons. The rod had been extensively damaged including the removal of both ends which would have had stamped identification numbers.</p>
	<p pid=".1635W.8/2">The rod was taken to Winfrith (and subsequently NNC at Risley) for analysis and then to Springfields for storage.</p>

The European Commission has also played an active role in tackling bans on EU beef in general. However, while the over-30 months (OTM) rule remains in place and while we can export only beef produced under the date based export scheme, the UK will remain a major importer of beef. When the OTM rule is replaced by BSE testing and EU export restrictions are lifted, we will agree a targeted lobbying strategy with industry focussed on countries that provide significant export opportunities. This will include working with the European Commission on third country issues. The Commission would pursue with WTO as appropriate.</p>

Since 2001, Defra has established a number of funding mechanisms to help local authorities achieve their targets. As a result of allocations from these funds the residents of Burnley should reap the benefits over the next few years. Since 2001 a total of &pound;1,131,245 has been awarded to the borough to expand kerbside recycling schemes.</p>

	<p pid=".1645W.2/1">The Government are committed to further reform of the Common Agricultural Policy but does not intend to press for a ceiling on individual payments since this could actually slow the process of reform. Only cutting CAP payments to the EU's largest farms would penalise those which would tend to be better able to compete in a less subsidy dependent market. The measure could, therefore, have the counter-intuitive effect of disproportionately supporting those EU farm businesses most likely to resist further reform. A ceiling on CAP payments would also penalise the UK in relation to most other EU member states, as UK farms tend to be larger than the EU average.</p>

	<p pid=".1653W.2/3">The following information may help provide a &quot;word picture&quot; of the way Defra's work benefits West Dorset.</p>
	<p pid=".1653W.2/4">The Environment Agency has been active on the ground in West Dorset dealing with water quality problems. This work has been part of the &quot;Cycleau Project&quot;, a European Interreg IIIB funded project that aims to:</p>
	<p pid=".1653W.2/5" class="indent">Find innovative ways of managing and improving the water environment.</p>
	<p pid=".1653W.2/6" class="indent">Share knowledge and experience of water management.</p>
	<p pid=".1653W.2/7" class="indent">Involve local communities in the management of local rivers.</p>
	<p pid=".1653W.2/8">More details are on the website. <a href="http://www.cycleau.com">www.cycleau.com</a></p>
	<p pid=".1653W.2/9">In West Dorset most of the activity has been in the River Char catchment area (upstream of Charmouth). The Environment Agency is the lead partner with FWAG delivering advice and grant aid. The main concern has been to ensure that the beach at Charmouth meets its Bathing Water standards with failures in the past resulting from diffuse farm pollution. There are about 35 farms in the Char catchment and so far about 20 farmers have been involved in the project. Funding is &pound;70,000 over three years, up to 2006</p>
	<p pid=".1653W.2/10">West Dorset forms part of the Dorset Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB) and as such is supported by Defra (through the Countryside Agency) for core funding. Core funding since 2002 has been &pound;574,200 that is further enhanced by contributions from all the district authorities and the county council.</p>
	<p pid=".1653W.2/11">Defra has supported Leader+ through the Dorset Chalk and Cheese programme, and awarded &pound;1,217,456 EU and &pound;591,558 Defra funding, to run a six year community based programme (2000&ndash;06), in parts of rural West Dorset.</p>
	<p pid=".1653W.2/12">The Voluntary and Community Sector in Dorset has benefited from joint funding with the Home Office through the Capacity Building and Infrastructure Strategy Programme. The rural preparatory programme to June 2004 awarded &pound;20,000 to Churches Together in Dorset (CTD), Dorset Community Action (DCA) and Dorset Race Equality Council and sought primarily to:</p>
	<p pid=".1653W.2/13" class="indent">Build a broader consortium of rural partners, and develop Vision&quot; for closer collaboration in the longer term.</p>
	<p pid=".1653W.2/14" class="indent">Develop a &quot;Countywide Investment Plan&quot; for Voluntary Sector Infrastructure</p>
	<p pid=".1653W.2/15">The Change Up programme that follows on from this will see Defra and the Home Office supporting a Dorset Consortia to continue with this work and West Dorset is sure to benefit.</p>
	<p pid=".1653W.2/16">The England Rural Development Programme has supported a number of grants in West Dorset for Vocational Training Schemes, for example training farm staff and on organic skills. Processing and Marketing grants of &pound;105,577 were given to support farms and food processing plants. The Rural Enterprise Scheme gave grants of &pound;466,671 to support rural businesses including a livery stable, equatic centre and food processing plant.</p>

In addition the Office of National Statistics also publishes further information that you can access from its website: <a href="http://www.statistics.gov.uk">http://www.statistics.gov.uk</a></p>
	<p pid=".1655W.3/2">Since its establishment in 2001 Defra has put in place a comprehensive programme of action on issues including sustainable development, climate change and energy, sustainable consumption and production, natural resource protection, sustainable rural communities, and a sustainable farming and food sector. I am confident that the South East Cambridgeshire constituency will have benefited from these but it is not possible to systematically quantify those benefits to a constituency level. The difficulties of such geographical analyses are set out by the Office of National Statistics at the following address: <a href="http://www.statistics.gov.uk/geography/default.asp">http://www.statistics.gov.uk/geography/default.asp</a></p>
	<p pid=".1655W.3/3">The following information may help provide a &quot;word picture&quot; of the way Defra's work benefits South East Cambridgeshire. Through our national strategy for waste we are committed to delivering a step change to more sustainable waste management, including tough national targets to recycle or compost 17 per cent. of household waste by 2003&ndash;04, and 25 per cent. by 2005&ndash;06. The county of Cambridgeshire continues to make a substantial contribution to achieving national recycling targets. The county's recycling performance in 2003&ndash;04, the most recent year for which data are available, was 29 per cent., against the national average for that year of 16.9 per cent.</p>
	<p pid=".1655W.3/4">The Government are committed to increasing the amount of electricity supplied by renewable sources in the UK to 10 per cent. by 2010. Between 1990 and 1998, the percentage of electricity generated from renewable sources in Cambridgeshire increased from zero, or very little, to around 0.9 per cent. In the last four years, this figure has increased to around 6 per cent. This dramatic increase is mainly attributable to the opening of a straw burning power station in Sutton near Ely in late 2001.</p>
	<p pid=".1655W.3/5">An area of the East of England, which covers a large part of the South East Cambridgeshire constituency, is one of the eight rural delivery pathfinders announced by the Minister of State, Alun Michael, at Ely on <phrase class="date" code="2005-03-14">14 March</phrase>. The pathfinder initiative is a key part of the Government's Rural Strategy and reflects the Government's commitment to devolve decision-making and resources to the local level. The Fens rural pathfinder will ensure greater co-ordination of rural delivery programmes by testing new and innovative methods to bring about improvements in the delivery of services to rural communities and businesses.

	<p pid=".1656W.2/8">The following information may also help provide a &quot;word picture&quot; of the way Defra's work benefits Witney through a selection of activities which have taken place in Oxfordshire.</p>
	<p pid=".1656W.2/9">Applications for the England Rural Development Programme (ERDP) have been received from within the County of Oxfordshire. As at 2004 Oxfordshire had 594 agri-environment schemes which is the highest number of any other county in the region. Grant paid under the Farm Woodland Premium Scheme and Farm Woodland Scheme since 2000 is &pound;1.2 million and &pound;112,000 has been under the Habitat Scheme since 2001. &pound;565,000 has been paid under the Project Based Schemes since 2001.</p>
	<p pid=".1656W.2/10">Clinics for the promotion of good quality applications under the ERDP are held regularly by the Defra Rural Development Service in Reading and Guildford.</p>
	<p pid=".1656W.2/11">West Oxfordshire is one of five areas in the South East region that has funding under the LEADER + programme, with European Union support, for experimental development of rural projects and community initiatives. Over 20 projects have, or are being funded, through the programme in Oxfordshire with further projects due to start this year. Projects aim to improve quality of life and particularly target younger and older people, women, rural business and workers affected by rural restructuring.</p>
	<p pid=".1656W.2/12">The Countryside Agency is supporting a number of projects in the area. The Vital Villages Programme began in 2001 and provides financial support for rural transport projects, projects to enhance and establish key rural services and to assist parishes with producing a parish plan. Funding for this programme in West Oxfordshire exceeds &pound;1 million.</p>
	<p pid=".1656W.2/13">Defra has worked to implement the vision of the Rural White Paper to support vibrant rural communities through the proactive work of Oxfordshire rural community council which delivers support and services on the ground to rural communities. In the three years from 2001&ndash;04 over &pound;800,000 has been invested in supporting rural transport, rural retail services, the provision of affordable homes in rural communities, community development work and work with socially excluded groups in rural areas across Oxfordshire. The money channelled by Defra through the RCC for this work, has also been instrumental at a local level, in levering other sources of finance to support rural communities.</p>
	<p pid=".1656W.2/14">Defra is funding a pilot study which aims to increase the local food content (fresh, seasonal ingredients) of school meals. Several schools are involved across the pilot area covering Buckinghamshire, Berkshire and Oxfordshire. The findings are due this April.</p>
	<p pid=".1656W.2/15">The South East Rural Affairs Forum was set up following recommendations in the Rural White Paper. The forum held a conference involving stakeholders across the region on <phrase class="date" code="2004-09-07">7 September 2004</phrase> and was attended by several stakeholders from Oxfordshire.</p>

	<p pid=".1660W.3/1">Action that is being taken to reduce the administrative burden on farmers includes the following:</p>
	<p pid=".1660W.3/2">1. We are already implementing the commitments in the Rural Strategy 2004 to modernise the delivery of rural services. Subject to parliamentary approval, we will bring together three existing bodies, English Nature, parts of the Countryside Agency and Defra's Rural Development Service, into a single body, Natural England, to be responsible for conserving, managing and enhancing the natural environment.</p>
	<p pid=".1660W.3/3">2. Our IT Strategy, and its constituent customer information programme, is developing a single data repository for farmers, in partnership with the Rural Payments Agency. Phase One of this work is currently underway, and will be completed in July 2005, when we will have a better idea of the costs and timescales for full delivery.</p>
	<p pid=".1660W.3/4">3. We are developing the Defra Whole Farm Approach programme. This will:</p>
	<p pid=".1660W.3/5" class="indent">Save time on form filling and stop repeated requests for the same information.</p>
	<p pid=".1660W.3/6" class="indent">Cut down bureaucracy and provide a mechanism for registering for exemptions and licenses.</p>
	<p pid=".1660W.3/7" class="indent">Enable farmers to provide us with the evidence of good practice that will reduce their risk of being selected for inspection.</p>
	<p pid=".1660W.3/8" class="indent">Provide instant access to up to date help and guidance.</p>
	<p pid=".1660W.3/9">The programme is being developed with a range of partners including the Environment Agency, Food Standards Agency, Health and Safety Executive and National Farmers Union. They are all playing a vital role in the development of the Approach, and together we aim to create a single set of essential core data on farms and farming activity, and by sharing that data significantly reduce the burdens of regulation and enforcement activities.</p>

	<p pid=".1660W.6/1">Assurance schemes are private initiatives and membership is voluntary. Decisions on assurance standards and inspection regimes are a matter for scheme owners. However, the Department has facilitated discussions between key stakeholders with a view to the rationalisation of assurance schemes in line with the recommendations of the Policy Commission on the future of farming and food. As a result of those discussions the six main sectoral assurance schemes in England have either merged or entered into binding agreements with Assured Food Standards, the private organisation that was set up to administer the Red Tractor logo. This has provided scope for further rationalisation of assurance standards and inspections.</p>
	<p pid=".1660W.6/2">The Department is also committed to further improving farm regulation and in November 2005 we will publish a Strategy for the Regulation of Agriculture. In order to develop this Strategy, we are gathering evidence directly from farmers and their regulators on the impact and performance of farm regulation. This evidence will inform us about how to improve the performance of existing and planned regulation and achieve more effective controls that are delivered more efficiently and with less bureaucracy.</p>

	<p pid=".1662W.2/1">The Department is taking forward a wide ranging strategy for combating fly-tipping, in close liaison with the Environment Agency and local authorities. Some new powers for these enforcement agencies were included in the Anti-social Behaviour Act 2003. Many more provisions have been included in the Clean Neighbourhoods and Environment Bill which has now completed its passage through Parliament. These include raising the penalties for the main offence of illegal waste disposal; new powers to stop, search and instantly seize vehicles that are being used for fly-tipping; additional sentencing powers for the courts including a power to award forfeiture of vehicles used to commit an offence; and powers for the enforcing authorities to issue fixed penalty notices for some offences. We will work closely with the enforcement authorities on implementation of all the measures in the Bill.</p>
	<p pid=".1662W.2/2">100 per cent. of local authorities are now registered on the Flycapture database, which for the first time is producing national data on the nature and scale of fly-tipping across the country. We are funding the Environment Agency through the Flycapture Enforcement project to provide training for local authority enforcement officers and lawyers on how to enhance their skills. Through the BREW programme, we are providing additional funding for the agency to assist businesses in complying with the legal requirements on the disposal of waste. The Department has also just let a research project that will look in depth at the reasons why people fly-tip and will develop good practice guidance for local authorities on further measures they can take to help reduce the problem.</p>

	<p pid=".1663W.2/1">The Government are working to ensure that labour provider businesses have robust business systems in place in advance of the introduction of licensing later this year. Regulation of the industry is intended to end exploitation and drive out illegal activity. In parallel to developing the licensing system, we are working to help legitimate labour providers to be successful and robust businesses. To facilitate this process we are working closely with the Ethical Trading Initiative Temporary Labour Working Group to promote the Code of Practice which the group launched in November 2004. Labour providers are being invited to arrange for their businesses to be audited against the code. Those that do will be offered a pre audit business consultancy session to assess their business and offer advice on problem areas. This process has the full backing of the supermarkets, the Association of Labour Providers, the Transport and General Workers Union and the National Farmers Union. To help reduce the cost to labour providers, the Government will be meeting a proportion of the cost of the consultancy advice and audit activities on a first come first served basis. The Chairman of the Gangmasters Licensing Authority has also indicated, that the cost of a licence audit will be reduced where a labour provider has previously been audited against the Temporary Labour Working Group Code by an auditor meeting the competencies set by the Gangmasters Licensing Authority.</p>
	<p pid=".1663W.2/2">In the longer term the Gangmasters Licensing Authority will be responsible for developing regulations setting out the conditions labour providers will be required to comply with under the new gangmaster licensing arrangements. Regulations establishing the Gangmasters Licensing Authority are in place and the authority started work on <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-01">1 April</phrase>. The authority will be consulting on licence conditions over the next few weeks and hopes to have regulations in place establishing the detailed licensing arrangements by the autumn. It is anticipated that the authority will develop best practice guidance for labour providers alongside the regulations.</p>

	<p pid=".1663W.5/1">This relates to the incident in the USA where some batches of Syngenta's GM maize seed intended to be Bt11 actually contained an unapproved GM maize event known as Bt10. We were informed of this incident on <phrase class="date" code="2005-03-22">22 March</phrase> and issued a press release on <phrase class="date" code="2005-03-23">23 March</phrase>. Our understanding is that between 2001&ndash;04 approximately 15,000 hectares of Bt10 was grown in the USA and most of the resulting grain was used in the USA. Only 18 per cent. of US corn is exported and the levels of maize exported from the US to the EU are very small indeed. The European Commission has been informed that an estimated 1,000 tonnes of Bt10 food and feed products may have entered the European Union (as distinct from the UK) since 2001. We have no evidence at this stage of any import of Bt10 into the UK.</p>
	<p pid=".1663W.5/2">We are unaware of the original source of the figure of 170,000 tonnes which you quote. There is no evidence that 170,000 tonnes of Bt10 maize has been imported into the UK; and indeed this figure is an order of magnitude higher than the total annual maize imports into the UK from the US, which are in a range of 4,000 to 14,000 tonnes annually.</p>
	<p pid=".1663W.5/3">Following Syngenta's disclosure on <phrase class="date" code="2005-03-22">22 March</phrase>, Defra and the Food Standards Agency have been working with the European Commission and the US authorities to gain information on whether or not any contaminated maize has been imported into the UK. We continue to monitor the situation closely.</p>
	<p pid=".1663W.5/4">We have written to maize importers to remind them of the need to check imports of maize and other crops for the presence of GMOs which have not been authorised in the European Union. It is for EU and UK importers to satisfy themselves that imported maize grain and derived products are approved for use and if material is GM that it is appropriately labelled. Our GM Inspectorate and local authority inspectors oversee this process.</p>
	<p pid=".1663W.5/5">We understand that the US authorities consider that Bt10 does not present any concerns for human or animal health. Bt10 maize does contain an antibiotic resistance marker gene (which is not present in Bt11). Although the antibiotic resistance marker is in the process of being phased out, the European Food Safety Authority has concluded that this antibiotic resistance marker gene would have minimal, if any, impact on human health if present in GM plants.</p>
	<p pid=".1663W.5/6">I should stress that we take incidents of this kind seriously. We do monitor the supply chain records of GM imports and take immediate action if evidence or information indicates the presence of any unauthorized GM product. Our priority is to protect the consumer and environment and ensure there is informed consumer choice.</p>

	<p pid=".1665W.5/1">Defra publishes a wide range of statistical information relating to its policies and actions and the following web address will take you directly to the service: <a href="http://statistics.defra.gov.uk/esg/default.asp">http://statistics.defra.gov.uk/esg/default. asp</a>. In addition, the Office of National Statistics also publishes further information that you can access from its website: <a href="http://www.statistics.gov.uk">http://www.statistics.gov.uk</a>.</p>
	<p pid=".1665W.5/2">Since its establishment in 2001 Defra has put in place a comprehensive programme of action on issues including sustainable development, climate change and .energy, sustainable consumption and production, natural resource protection, sustainable rural communities, and a sustainable farming and food sector. I am confident that the Huddersfield constituency will have benefited from these but it is not possible to systematically quantify those benefits to a constituency level. The difficulties of such geographical analyses are set out by the Office of National Statistics at the following address: <a href="http://www.statistics.gov.uk/geography/default.asp">http://www. statistics.gov.uk/geography/default.asp</a>.</p>
	<p pid=".1665W.5/3">The following information may help provide a &quot;word picture&quot; of the way Defra's work benefits Huddersfield.</p>
	<p pid=".1665W.5/4"><i>Waste:</i> Through our national strategy for waste we are committed to delivering a step change to more sustainable waste management, including tough national targets to recycle or compost 17 per cent. of household waste by 2003&ndash;04, and 25 per cent. by 2005&ndash;06. To help local authorities achieve their own targets Defra's Waste Minimisation Fund was set up in 2002. As a result of successful bids for money from this fund by Kirklees metropolitan council a total of almost &pound;1.2 million was used for projects which have seen extra green wheeled bins being provided to 140,000 households across Kirklees, including Huddersfield itself. This, together with a waste reduction and reuse awareness raising campaign, also funded by Defra, has enabled Kirklees to double its recycling and composting rate from 7 per cent. in 1998&ndash;99 to reach its statutory target of 14 per cent. in 2003&ndash;04.</p>
	<p pid=".1665W.5/5"><i>River Water Quality</i> has improved along the Kirklees rivers, including the Rivers Colne and Holme in Huddersfield over recent years. While 75 per cent. of the rivers' lengths within the Kirklees area were already considered to be of fair or better chemical quality in 1997, by 2003 this had risen to 95 per cent. The improvements in the biological quality of the rivers has been even more rapid with the percentage of river length of fair quality or better rising from 4.0 per cent. in 1995 to 75 per cent. in 2003. These improvements reflect Defra's policy to improve river water quality, which is one of the headline indicators of sustainable development and to raise compliance with the EC water framework directive.</p>
	<p pid=".1665W.5/6"><i>Flood Defences:</i> With grant support from Defra the Environment Agency has undertaken maintenance and improvement of flood defences around the Huddersfield area and has invested &pound;30 million in new defences in the past 10&ndash;15 years across Kirklees as a whole. The Environment Agency also now offers a flood warning service for residents and businesses at high and medium risk of flooding through Huddersfield.</p>
	<p pid=".1665W.5/7"><i>Rural Environment:</i> The most important agri-environment scheme delivered by Defra's Rural Development Service in the Huddersfield area constituency is the Countryside Stewardship Scheme (CSS). It aims are to help to conserve and improve the rural environment. There are three CSS agreements in the constituency; the total area of land on these three holdings is 123.42ha, of which 22.12ha is under agreement. In terms of specific payments we have been able to isolate expenditure under the common agricultural policy and a list of payments by constituency is available in the Library of the House following <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/976" name="George Howarth">the answer I gave to the hon.

It is noted in these figures that payments to customers are reported on the basis of requested business address which may differ from the location of farming activity.</p>

	<p pid=".1669W.8/1">Defra publishes a wide range of statistical information relating to its policies and actions and the following web address will take you directly to the service: <a href="http://statistics.defra.gov.uk/esg/default.asp">http://statistics.defra.gov.uk/esg/default. asp</a>. In addition, the Office of National Statistics also publishes further information that you can access from its website: <a href="http://www.statistics.gov.uk">http://www.statistics.gov.uk</a></p>
	<p pid=".1669W.8/2">Since its establishment in 2001 Defra has put in place a comprehensive programme of action on issues including sustainable development, climate change and energy, sustainable consumption and production, natural resource protection, sustainable rural communities, and a sustainable farming and food sector. I am confident that the North Durham constituency will have benefited from these but it is not possible to systematically quantify those benefits to a constituency level. The difficulties of such geographical analyses are set out by the Office of National Statistics at the following address: <a href="http://www.statistics.gov.uk/geography/default.asp">http://www.statistics.gov.uk/geography/default.asp</a>.</p>
	<p pid=".1669W.8/3">The following information may help provide a &quot;word picture&quot; of the way Defra's work benefits North Durham.</p>
	<p pid=".1669W.8/4">Through our national strategy for waste we are committed to delivering a step change to more sustainable waste management, including tough national targets to recycle or compost 17 per cent. of household waste by 2003&ndash;04, and 25 per cent. by 2005&ndash;06. The districts of Chester le Street and Derwentside continue to make a contribution to achieving these national recycling targets and have exceeded regional targets set at 10 per cent. for 2003&ndash;04. The districts' recycling performance in 2003&ndash;04, the most recent year for which data is available, were 12 per cent. and 14 per cent. respectively, an improvement for each council of 5 per cent.</p>
	<p pid=".1669W.8/5">The policy initiatives flowing from the Rural White Paper had a major impact on people in rural and urban fringe locations. North Durham constituents will have benefited from a living, working and vibrant countryside surrounding the towns of Stanley and Chester le Street. The Rural Strategy published in July 2004, builds on the success of the White Paper and aims to give the people of North Durham a greater say in the delivery of services.</p>
	<p pid=".1669W.8/6">The Modernising Rural Delivery pathfinder initiative is a key part of the Government's Rural Strategy and is designed to test and share, at a local authority level, good practice on the Government's commitment to devolve decision-making and resources to the local level. In October, I announced seven rural pathfinders in England, and I announced the final pathfinder in the West Durham area more recently. The North East pathfinder will ensure greater co-ordination of rural delivery programmes testing new and innovative methods to bring about improvements in the delivery of services to rural communities and businesses. Whilst not directly located in the pathfinder area, I expect that the lessons learned will be shared across the constituency, the North East Region and nationally.</p>
	<p pid=".1669W.8/7">West County Durham is an area steeped in a rich social, industrial and natural heritage. I am pleased that the Department is involved in the &quot;Mineral Valleys Project&quot;, which covers an area of 89,000 hectares, aims to use environment-led regeneration to help local communities celebrate their heritage whilst enhancing the environment around them. The Mineral Valleys Partnership that includes 50 businesses, statutory, community and voluntary organisations, led by English Nature and supported by the Heritage Lottery Fund, has been successful in putting a &pound;5.2 million programme together to make this vision a reality. This exciting project has resulted in a number of positive environmental outcomes for the constituency including the Saving Stanley Burn and Woods Project, an Otter Holt at Chester le Street and the creation of wetland at Chester Moor.</p>
	<p pid=".1669W.8/8">In terms of specific payments we have been able to isolate expenditure under the common agricultural policy and a list of payments by constituency is available in the Library of the House following <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/976" name="George Howarth">the answer I gave to the hon.

	<p pid=".1688W.9/1">Cheque payments are designed for the small number of people who we cannot pay directly into an account. We settled on this solution following extensive consultation with customer representative groups. The cheque provides the facility for a third party (including a carer) to cash cheques under &pound;450 on the customer's behalf at a Post Office and this facility has worked successfully for many years.</p>
	<p pid=".1688W.9/2">We need to strike a balance between a customer's right to access their benefit or pension and the need to prevent the cheque being cashed by an unauthorised person without the customer's knowledge. For this reason the Post Office requires the third party presenting the cheque for encashment to produce evidence of both their own and the customer's identity.</p>
	<p pid=".1688W.9/3">There is currently a wide range of forms of identification, which are acceptable to the Post Office to enable a carer or other person to cash a cheque on a customer's behalf. These are listed on the reverse of the cheque. In addition other forms of identification may be accepted at the discretion of the postmaster.</p>
	<p pid=".1688W.9/4">Officials have obtained a report from Post Office Ltd. about the circumstances of the case raised with me on BBC Radio 4 on <phrase class="date" code="2004-03-12">12 March 2004</phrase>. Neither the Department nor Post Office Ltd. have seen any evidence to suggest that there are widespread difficulties being faced by authorised third parties cashing cheques on behalf of customers. However, we will continue to monitor the situation closely and make improvements to the process if necessary.</p>

	<p pid=".1692W.0/1">The administration of Jobcentre Plus is a matter for the Chief Executive of Jobcentre Plus, David Anderson. He will write to the hon. Member.</p>
	<p pid=".1692W.0/2" class="letterfrom">Letter from David Anderson to Mr. Paul Holmes, dated <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-07">7 April 2005</phrase></p>
	<p pid=".1692W.0/3" class="indent">The Secretary of State has asked me to reply to your questions concerning Jobcentre Plus contracts with employment and training providers and the decision to review the 2005 timetable. This is something which falls within the responsibilities delegated to me as Chief Executive of Jobcentre Plus.</p>
	<p pid=".1692W.0/4" class="indent">Our normal practice, wherever possible, is to commence discussions with providers three months before a contract is due to end. We do not cancel contracts during their lifespan except in extreme circumstances, such as a provider becoming insolvent or committing a serious breach of its contractual obligations.</p>
	<p pid=".1692W.0/5" class="indent">The need to review the timetable for letting new Jobcentre Plus Contracts was identified in December 2004. That review was prompted by the Department's recently published 5 year strategy which places an increased priority on helping those who are out of work because of sickness or disability and lone parents. With fewer people unemployed and a greater emphasis on providing support to disabled people through the New Deal for Disabled People and the Pathways to Work pilots, we needed to review our contracting strategy to ensure the provision we procure focuses support on those who need the most help.</p>
	<p pid=".1692W.0/6" class="indent">In the light of that review, the decision was taken to cease current procurement competitions. However, we were not in a position to finalise our strategy for letting new contracts until shortly before <phrase class="date" code="2005-02-25">25 February 2005</phrase>, when Jobcentre Plus Field Directors and others had been informed of the changes to our timetable and the criteria for extending current contracts i.e. satisfactory performance, a clear business need or a mandatory requirement for the provision had been established.</p>
	<p pid=".1692W.0/7" class="indent">To deliver the DWP and Jobcentre Plus efficiency challenges and modernisation agendas it is vital that we obtain best value for money. We have now identified what provision needs to be in place to support our business objectives, and are now in the process of developing a timetable for the implementation of an overall contracting strategy designed to achieve better value for money in terms of process and required outcomes.</p>
	<p pid=".1692W.0/8" class="indent">With regard to the time and cost implications for those involved with Jobcentre Plus contracts for employment and training programmes, this information is not available and could only be obtained at disproportionate cost.</p>
	<p pid=".1692W.0/9" class="indent">We are currently informing providers whether their current contracts are being extended or not. When this process has been completed I will write to you again with the answer to your question about this.</p>
	<p pid=".1692W.0/10" class="indent">I hope this is helpful.</p>

	<p pid=".1694W.11/2">All recipients of the minimum income guarantee (MIG) were subject to MDRs of 100 per cent. These people are now entitled to pension credit and most of them&mdash;of the order of 61 per cent. of those in private households&mdash;are also benefiting from the savings element of pension credit. This majority no longer face MDRs of 100 percent.</p>

	<p pid=".1695W.2/2">Since April 2003, when the Post Office card account system was introduced, there have been a small number of incidents that have briefly affected payments to the Department's customers. These incidents have caused some inconvenience to customers and delay in withdrawing benefit from accounts. It is not possible to say how many customers were temporarily unable to collect their pensions at the Post Office as a result. Those customers who were still unable to manage until the systems were restored, later in the day, could contact the appropriate DWP office to arrange an emergency payment.</p>

The national service framework (NSF) for long-term conditions was launched on <phrase class="date" code="2005-03-10">10 March 2005</phrase> and aims to support people with long-term conditions to live as full and independent a life as possible.</p>
	<p pid=".1702W.0/2">The Department has set up a vascular programmes board that will oversee delivery of the targets for cardiovascular disease (coronary heart disease, stroke and other circulatory diseases), diabetes, chronic kidney disease, health improvement and prevention, and hypertension. The work of the board will assist in the process of taking a more co-ordinated approach to chronic disease management in patients with diabetes, heart disease and kidney disease.</p>
	<p pid=".1702W.0/3">The diabetes NSF was published in December 2001. The NSF sets out a 10-year programme of change where all people with diabetes requiring multi-agency support will receive integrated health and social care. The recently published report, &quot;Improving Diabetes Services&mdash;the NSF Two Years On&quot;, provides information about how services are changing to provide an integrated approach for people with diabetes.</p>
	<p pid=".1702W.0/4">The coronary heart disease (CHD) NSF, published in March 2000, set out a strategy to modernise CHD services over 10 years. Heart failure was identified as an area where there was significant scope to help people with heart failure live longer and achieve a better quality of life.</p>
	<p pid=".1702W.0/5">Part two of the NSF for renal services was published in February 2005. It sets out new quality requirements for the identification and early management of people with, or at risk of, chronic kidney disease. It also identifies considerable scope for integrating care pathways for people with chronic kidney disease, coronary heart disease and/or diabetes, to reduce the impact of these interacting long-term conditions.</p>

	<p pid=".1710W.14/2">Bedside television (TV) and telephone services are now available in most major acute hospitals and provide an additional service to patients, relatives and friends to enable them to remain in direct contact when people are in hospital. It is still possible for friends and relatives to contact a hospital through its main switchboard and then be transferred to a nurse station to enquire about their relatives' health.</p>
	<p pid=".1710W.14/3">Charges for the use of services through bedside telephones are agreed between the national health service trust and the company supplying the service. The trust does not make any profit from these services.</p>
	<p pid=".1710W.14/4">Contracts are entered into by individual trusts who will set out an agreed schedule of charges, including the cost of incoming charges to patients.</p>
	<p pid=".1710W.14/5">Three suppliers, covering 69,000 beds, include a message notifying callers at the outset of the call what the charge will be. The fourth, which provides a service to the remaining 6,000 beds, will shortly be including a similar message at all their sites. In addition, the Patient Power suppliers set out the charges for all their services in leaflets, which are made widely available. A higher incoming call rate helps subsidise concessionary rates provided by the suppliers, which include free TV for children and discounted rates for long stay patients.</p>
	<p pid=".1710W.14/6">NHS Estates commissioned British Market Research Bureau to carry out a survey to conduct research into patient and staff satisfaction with the bedside communication and entertainment systems where 88 per cent. of patients said that they were satisfied with the services, 95 per cent. of patients chose to pay for services offered and patients said the most important reason for using the system was to make phone calls without having to ask a member of staff for help or go to a public pay phone.</p>
	<p pid=".1710W.14/7">The patient bedside entertainment system provides a vital direct link with family and friends for NHS patients. The results of the recent survey confirm that the service is useful in improving the patients' stay in hospital.</p>

	<p pid=".1717W.5/2">The major risk identified from the use of consumer products containing tea tree oil comes from the sensitising potential of concentrated (greater than 2 per cent.) solutions, particularly if the product has been exposed to oxygen, sunlight or higher temperatures. However, the European Scientific Committee on consumer products has advised that the data available are currently insufficient to assess the potential risk of a range of toxic effects.</p>
	<p pid=".1717W.5/3">The Committee requested that a complete package of data be provided in order for them to give an opinion on the potential risks. The conclusions will then be used to amend the cosmetics directive in order to make any restrictions on the use of tea tree oil in cosmetic products legally enforceable. In the meantime, industry has advised that tea tree oil should only be used in cosmetic products at concentrations at or below 1 per cent., and should be formulated and packaged in a way to minimise degradation.</p>
	<p pid=".1717W.5/4">15 medicinal products containing tea tree oil, licensed under medicines legislation, are available in the United Kingdom. There may be other medicines that contain tea tree oil, which currently reach the market as unlicensed herbal remedies. These will potentially qualify to be registered under Directive 2004/24/EC when it is implemented on <phrase class="date" code="">30 October</phrase> this year. To qualify for registration, products will have to demonstrate that they comply with the required evidence of traditional usage and that they meet the required standards of safety and quality.</p>
	<p pid=".1717W.5/5">As with all medicines, the safety of medicinal products containing tea tree oil is closely monitored by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency. There are no safety concerns specific to the medicinal use of tea tree oil but all effective treatments may cause unwanted side effects in some patients, which may be the result of individual sensitivity to the medicine concerned.</p>

The Board also recommended revised procedures for dealing with the media and families after such an incident. The Defence Wider Markets Policy Group was tasked to look at the wider issues raised by the Board of Inquiry report on income generation.

Secondments are available to other areas of the Department and Government, UK industry and international laboratories. There is an internal symposium held annually to encourage networking and debate on topical research areas. There is a Scheme for Technical Education and Professional Support to encourage networking, conferences and events for junior staff and a Fellowship Scheme which gives recognition to senior staff who are acknowledged as national or international experts in their field.</p>

In addition, Dstl undertakes the knowledge integration role for the Research customers which requires it to work closely with the other organisations in industry and academia engaged in hands-on research.</p>
	<p pid=".1734W.5/2">Dstl encourages its staff to undertake research based MSc and PhD activities as well as having a commitment to their continuous professional development through membership of the appropriate professional institutes. To strengthen engagement in underlying technical areas where Dstl has limited hands-on work of its own, it has set up Co-operative Research Centres with academia to facilitate the exchange of staff and resources between Dstl and partner Universities. This allows Dstl staff to work within the partner University alongside external researchers who are engaged in MOD funded work, for example through the Joint Grant Scheme. Dstl has also entered into arrangements with industry to encourage staff secondment and established opportunities for staff interchange with other national and international laboratories.</p>
	<p pid=".1734W.5/3">Dstl staff are also involved in oversight of the MOD Defence Technology Centres which are formal collaborative arrangements between industry and academic experts in particular technologies.</p>
	<p pid=".1734W.5/4">These kinds of arrangement enable Dstl scientists to develop and extend their knowledge networks and improve the quality and context of its advice.</p>

Copies have been placed in the Libraries of both Houses for the years 1995&ndash;96 to 2003&ndash;04. This includes expenditure broken down by top level budget holders and trading funds. However, expenditure on accountancy services is not recorded as a specific category of EA and could only be provided at disproportionate cost.</p>

Consequently, staff at the same level may receive different salaries dependent upon where they are on the pay scale. Following the negotiation and introduction of a multi-year pay deal in 2002, some civilian security staff were overtaken by others joining the Department later.

	<p pid=".1751W.15/3">The United Kingdom armed forces do not have the information that would enable a reliable estimate of the total number of combatant or non-combatant Iraqi casualties arising from the conflict to be made. This is because UK military reporting is limited to UK area of operations. But even within the UK area of operations reporting is limited to what troops observe directly or learn from reliable sources.</p>

	<p pid=".1754W.8/1">The process of restructuring the infantry has been worked through by the Army who consulted widely. Colonels of individual regiments were directly involved in the consultation process through the Colonels Commandants of the Divisions of Infantry. As part of this process those infantry divisions affected by the changes were asked to suggest options for new regimental titles. Of the options put forward by the King's Division, the proposed title of the &quot;King's, Lancashire and Border Regiment&quot;, was felt by the Executive Committee of the Army Board to best reflect the antecedent regiments from which it will be drawn.</p>

	<p pid=".1767W.8/1">Swan Hunter's design for the LSD(A) vessels was based upon the modification of the Enforcer Class concept design by the Dutch Royal Schelde shipyard, which was itself based upon the proven HNLMS Rotterdam. The company's successful bid for the design and construction of the first two ships was to adapt this existing concept design to meet the Statement of Requirement specified in the MOD's Invitation To Tender. The company subsequently encountered difficulties in adapting the design to the UK specification as the concept itself and the modifications needed were shown not to be as mature as they had previously believed. This underestimation of the degree of design work needed resulted in additional work that had not been costed in the company's bid. In September 2003 when the full scale of the additional work became clear the company announced that it would be unable to complete the contract without an adjustment to the original price. The &pound;84 million contract amendment agreed in December 2004 reflected the additional cost to the company needed to complete the programme and was awarded only after full consideration of the options, from which the MOD assessed that the contract amendment offered the optimum value for money solution in the delivery of the LSD(A) capability. In addition to the &pound;84 million needed to address the Swan Hunter design difficulty, &pound;3 million has been added since the start of the contract to address design changes as a consequence of Naval and statutory safety requirements that were not fully defined at the time of the original contract placement. The MOD is unaware of any significant difficulties relating to inaccuracies in measurements.</p>

Also, with effect from <phrase class="date" code="2005-02-01">1 February 2005</phrase> servicemen and women who now leave the Service, subject to certain conditions, are also entitled.</p>
	<p pid=".1769W.12/3">When the demand from World War veterans has been satisfied, we plan to extend eligibility to other veterans as resources allow. It is envisaged that this will be done on a chronological basis, dealing first with veterans of the inter-war years and those who served in the 1940s after the end of the Second World War. Veterans who served in the 1950s, which includes those who served in Korea and Suez, will be included in the following tranche.</p>

	<p pid=".1773W.0/2">My answer of <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-04">4 April</phrase> to the hon. Member was incorrect. The correct answer should read as follows:</p>

	<p pid=".1773W.0/4">In October 2003, the FCO and European Commission jointly organised the &quot;Europe United&quot; football tournament as part of the plans to celebrate EU enlargement. In early 2004 the FCO produced with Commission support booklets explaining the benefits of EU enlargement that were sent to the nine English regions and the devolved administrations. On <phrase class="date" code="2004-04-24">24 April 2004</phrase>, there was &quot;Europe Day&mdash;Meet the Neighbours&quot;&mdash;a jointly organised FCO-Commission project which celebrated EU enlargement.</p>

	<p pid=".1773W.0/6">The FCO and EU institutions also jointly fund a number of development projects outside the UK.</p>

	<p pid=".1773W.3/1">When I visited Guatemala in January 2004 I stressed the importance of human rights issues with the new Vice President and other members of the government. We and our EU partners continue to encourage the Guatemalan government to implement in full the 1996 Peace Accords. Our Embassy follows the human rights situation closely and enjoys close relations with human rights organisations in Guatemala. We are presently supporting projects that are seeking to bring to justice the perpetrators of human rights abuses as well as promoting reconciliation.</p>
	<p pid=".1773W.3/2">Although Guatemala's civil war ended in 1996, serious questions about respect for human rights in Guatemala remain. However, we have noted the positive efforts President Berger has made since his inauguration on <phrase class="date" code="2004-01-14">14 January 2004</phrase> to tackle human rights problems in Guatemala. His first public act was to declare his commitment to the 1996 Guatemalan Peace Accords and on <phrase class="date" code="2004-02-25">25 February 2004</phrase> he announced the establishment of a new national commission to oversee their implementation. These include undertakings to compensate the surviving family members of massacres that took place during the conflict. President Berger has also appointed a respected human rights campaigner, Frank la Rue, to his Cabinet as the Head of the Presidential Commission on Human Rights.</p>

If it feels that such input would be valuable in the longer term, it may co-opt additional members to its sub-committees or working groups.</p>

At the time of his certification under the Anti-Terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001 (ATCSA) in December 2001, he was a leading UK member of the proscribed Egyptian terrorist group, the Egyptian Islamic Jihad (ElJ). Prior to his detention, &quot;C&quot; was active on behalf of the EIJ in Egypt, Ireland and the UK. &quot;C&quot; had an extensive network of associates among international terrorists in the UK and overseas. His contacts included prominent international terrorists from a range of organisations. However, although a number of &quot;C's&quot; associates remain at liberty, many have now been detained and/or their extremist activities have been disrupted.

In addition, the BCS figures show cannabis use declining steadily among 16 to 24-year-olds between 1998&ndash;2004 from 28.2 per cent. to 24.8 per cent.</p>
	<p pid=".1787W.5/2">Cannabis was reclassified on <phrase class="date" code="2004-01-29">29 January 2004</phrase> to a Class C drug under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971. Smoking, drinking and drug use among young people in England in 2004 contains the preliminary key findings of a survey of secondary schoolchildren aged 11 to 15. The figures show a decline in cannabis use in the last year from 13 per cent. in 2001 to 2003 to 11 per cent. for 2004.</p>

	<p pid=".1795W.0/2">Chip and PIN is a major finance and retail industry anti fraud initiative. The introduction of chip and PIN has been managed by the chip and PIN Programme Management Organisation, and actively supported by Government.</p>
	<p pid=".1795W.0/3">Following a successful public trial, national roll out of the scheme began in October 2003 with the aim that by 2005 a majority of plastic card transactions should be chip and PIN. The chip and PIN programme announced earlier this year that it reached all its 2004 targets for the roll out with customer research demonstrating that 71 per cent. of cardholders expect their next transaction to be chip and PIN and 45 per cent. now using it for all or most of their card payments. <sup>1</sup></p>
	<p pid=".1795W.0/4">I last met with representatives from the programme in November 2003 and Home Office officials maintain regular contact with the finance and retail industry.</p>
	<p pid=".1795W.0/5">It is currently too early to assess the effects of chip and PIN in preventing credit card fraud. The impact of chip and PIN on card fraud is expected to be seen early in 2005 and hence will first be reflected in the APACS mid-year card fraud figures to June 2005, which will be available in the summer.</p>

	<p pid=".1800W.5/1">The Government's Response to the Home Affairs Committee's Report published in April 2003 indicated that the Senior Investigations Handbook already included guidance that the Senior Investigating Officer in any individual case should always record, as a matter of routine, justification for using the dip sampling or investigation method for making initial approaches to former residents of care homes. This serves as a guide and is not mandatory therefore neither the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) nor Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMIC) would make a routine assessment as to compliance therein.</p>
	<p pid=".1800W.5/2">The Association of Chief Police Officers has established a multi-agency working group to review the SIO Handbook which was produced in 2002, the group includes officials form the Home Office. That review group has cognisance of all recommendations made by the Committee and in particular on-going concerns raised by my hon. Friend and will ensure amendments in line with police investigative policy. This will include adding further safeguards to the initial approach for evidence as considered by the group similarly for recordkeeping. I understand that the Chair of that group has now invited my hon. Friend to present her concerns to the group in person.</p>
	<p pid=".1800W.5/3">It is not clear to which Inter-agency strategic management group my hon. Friend refers.</p>
	<p pid=".1800W.5/4">The Home Department is not aware of the Gudjohnsson, SCAN or any other statement validity assessment tools for use in cases involving historical child abuse. The work of the ACPO SIO Manual review group is still in progress: it has not issued any guidance on the use of such tools in investigating complex cases of historical child abuse.</p>

	<p pid=".1808W.3/2">Eurojust comprises a college of 25 national members, (one from each member state). The national members elected their president who is the UK national member. In 2004 there was a significant increase in the involvement of the UK authorities with Eurojust. The UK team at Eurojust received 42 cases from UK authorities requesting assistance. The UK team received 68 files from other member states requesting assistance from UK authorities. Cases involved a range of offences including drug trafficking, illegal immigrant smuggling, money laundering and murder.</p>
	<p pid=".1808W.3/3">The UK team has regular meetings in the United Kingdom with colleagues from Government Departments, investigating and prosecuting authorities. Casework co-ordination and co-operation meetings take place regularly at Eurojust's premises. Eurojust also provided oral evidence for the 2004 House of Lords inquiry into the work of Eurojust. A number of publications related to Eurojust are deposited in the United Kingdom Parliament including the 2003 Annual Report and the European Court of Auditors report on the Eurojust accounts for 2003. Eurojust publications, information and materials are available on the Eurojust website <a href="http://www.eurojust.eu.int">www.eurojust.eu.int</a> .</p>

	<p pid=".1815W.5/1">I represented the United Kingdom at the Justice and Home Affairs Council in Brussels on <phrase class="date" code="2005-02-24">24 February 2005</phrase>. Caroline Flint attended with me, along with Cathy Jamieson (Justice Minister) of the Scottish Executive.</p>
	<p pid=".1815W.5/2">A list of &quot;A&quot; points adopted at the Council has been placed in the Library (Document 6588/05).</p>
	<p pid=".1815W.5/3">The proposal for a council framework decision on combating racism and xenophobia was discussed. I intervened to say that there was no need for the decision specifically to include reference to racist symbols, as their use to incite racially motivated hatred and violence was already covered in the draft Framework Decision. The matter has been referred back to the Working Group, to be discussed again at the April JHA Council.</p>
	<p pid=".1815W.5/4">On the proposal for a Council framework decision on the European Evidence Warrant for obtaining objects, documents and data for use in proceedings in criminal matters, the presidency sought agreement to the broad principles to be followed under the EEW in relation to dual criminality. In particular it was proposed that they should be similar to those pertaining to previous mutual recognition measures. This would include using a list of offences to which dual criminality would not apply based on the list in the European Evidence Warrant; excluding the idea of a &quot;sunset clause&quot;, which would eventually have abolished dual criminality for all requests; and included a seriousness threshold of three years for offences. Cathy Jamieson noted the UK's support for the presidency approach and its opposition to an additional proposal to define more clearly some of the offences on the list, stating that this was inconsistent with the principle of mutual recognition and that it would create obstacles to co-operation.</p>
	<p pid=".1815W.5/5">Over lunch I discussed with other Ministers of the Interior the appointment of a Director for Europol. I intervened to say that the UK's position had always been that the best candidate should be selected through a fair and transparent selection process. We therefore supported the recommendation of the Europol Management Board that the German candidate, Herr Ratzel was the best candidate. The Council agreed to his selection and I noted that, for this and similar posts, it was essential that the best candidate was selected on merit, rather than nationality and that selection of individuals and sites of agencies should be considered separately. I said that, during the UK presidency, I would initiate discussion in the Council to agree an approach these issues in future.</p>
	<p pid=".1815W.5/6">There was a policy debate on the follow up to the Commission reports on the member states' transposition of instruments adopted on the basis of title VI of the TEU. Caroline Flint stressed that it was not enough simply to look at how measures had been transposed at a national level but to look at whether they were making a positive impact for citizens in practice.</p>
	<p pid=".1815W.5/7">The presidency also agreed to take forward consideration of the reports on the European Arrest Warrant and Joint Investigation Teams by the end of June in light of the discussion.</p>
	<p pid=".1815W.5/8">The Presidency asked member states to agree that CEPOL be given community financing and should apply ED staff regulations. The UK was able to support this approach as the firststage in establishing CEPOL and the presidency confirmed that the Working Group take work forward on that basis.</p>
	<p pid=".1815W.5/9">On the Commission Green Paper on Economic Migration a first exchange of views took place. Member states responded positively and the issue will be on the agenda again at the April JHA Council.</p>
	<p pid=".1815W.5/10">The Mixed Committee took place in the afternoon and Caroline Flint represented the UK. The Council agreed the proposal (as in document 6483/05 VISA 43) as regards the reciprocity mechanism. Council conclusions were agreed in principle on the inclusion of biometric data in visas and residence permits. Experts will be asked to continue to examine the technical issues and return to the Council in April.</p>
	<p pid=".1815W.5/11">The proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning the Visa Information System (VIS) and the exchange of data between member states on short stay visas was tabled and draft Council Conclusions were circulated which received broad agreement. These will be passed to COREPER to be finalised.</p>
	<p pid=".1815W.5/12">Under AOB the Commission presented its proposal for a regulation on local border traffic.</p>
	<p pid=".1815W.5/13">Also tabled was a memorial report of the anniversary of the Madrid bombings presented by the Commission and dedicated to the victims of terrorism. The draft conclusions were adopted.</p>

	<p pid=".1833W.3/1">We have already given the police a power to conduct compulsory roadside tests for impairment, which may be due to a drug, and for the presence of drugs.</p>
	<p pid=".1833W.3/2">Impairment tests are conducted in accordance with a Code of Practice issued on <phrase class="date" code="2004-12-20">20 December 2004</phrase>. They involve a trained officer observing a suspect in the performance of specified tasks and making other observations about his physical state. They are based on the voluntary field impairment tests and drug recognition techniques that have been in use for some time and are of proven effectiveness in indicating whether a person might be under the influence of a drug.</p>
	<p pid=".1833W.3/3">Tests for the presence of drugs have to be carried out by means of a device of a type approved by the Secretary of State. We are currently developing the detailed specification for such a device and the procedures by which candidate devices might be assessed in field and laboratory trials. It will then be for manufacturers to produce such devices and submit them for approval. We currently expect that suitable products will be on the market by the end of 2006.</p>
	<p pid=".1833W.3/4">A reliable indication of drug presence will, in the same way as a reliable indication of impairment, valuably inform the police decision whether a person might be committing the offence of driving or attempting to drive while unfit to drive through drugs.</p>

	<p pid=".1838W.12/5">Multilateral efforts to counter terrorist financing have feature prominently on all international agendas in recent years.
