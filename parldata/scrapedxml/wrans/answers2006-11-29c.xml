	<p pid="c.677W.7/1">Local authorities (LAs) have a duty under Part IV of the Environment Act 1995 to review and assess the current, and likely future, air quality in their areas. The first step of the review and assessment process is an updating and screening assessment (USA), which is to be undertaken by all authorities to identify those matters that have changed since the last round was completed. LAs are expected to undertake the reviews and assessment every three years. Where local authorities consider that one or more of the nationally prescribed air quality objectives for each of the seven pollutants is unlikely to be met by the relevant deadline, they must declare an air quality management area (AQMA), covering the area where the problem is expected. These local authorities must then take action, along with other agencies and organisations, to work towards meeting the air quality objectives.</p>
	<p pid="c.677W.7/2">When the local air quality management system was first introduced in December 1997, local authorities were advised to complete the review and assessment process by December 1999. My Department assessed Wirral's air quality report in October 1999. The report concluded that further investigation was needed in respect of nitrogen dioxide and particulate matter (PM10). Following monitoring and modelling, Wirral concluded from the additional work that they did not need to declare an air quality management area (AQMA).</p>
	<p pid="c.677W.7/3">The second round of reviews and assessments started in 2003 and local authorities had to submit updating and screening assessments (USA) by the end of May 2003, and were expected to submit either a detailed assessment or a progress report by April 2004 and April 2005 respectively. Wirral submitted their USA in October 2003 and a progress report in both November 2004 and February 2006. They concluded that there was no need to proceed to a detailed assessment or declare an AQMA.</p>
	<p pid="c.677W.7/4">The third round of review and assessments has now started and local authorities were asked to submit new USAs by end of April 2006. We received Wirral's report in May 2006. Our consultants have assessed the report and agreed that there is no need for Wirral to carry out further work in respect of any of the seven pollutants.</p>

	<p pid="c.678W.2/2">The UK is exceptional among EU member states in setting its biofuel sales targets on a volume rather than an energy basis. We have chosen to do it this way for simplicity's sake. Transport fuels are sold and taxed on a volume basis rather than an energy content basis: motorists buy fuel by the litre rather than by the megajoule. We will be consulting in early 2007 on whether, in the longer term, volume-based targets for renewable transport fuels remain appropriate, or whether we might move towards some other form of target such as a carbon-saving target instead.</p>

	<p pid="c.681W.3/2">Home composting is currently excluded from the definition of household waste for the purposes of calculating BVPI 82b, as there is, as yet, no auditable methodology for determining how much household waste is treated in this way.</p>

However, the EA may exercise discretion to treat a person as fit and proper, notwithstanding the presence of a relevant conviction, and shall do so by reference to the continuance of the activities which are, or are to be, authorised by the licence and the fulfilment of the requirements of the licence.</p>
	<p pid="c.683W.6/4">In addition, the operation of the activities authorised by the licence must be in the hands of a technically competent person. Technical competence is generally demonstrated through a Certificate of Technical Competence (CoTC) awarded by the Waste Management Industry Training and Advisory Board, following the successful completion of a National/Scottish/Vocational Qualification. Regulation 4 of, and schedule 1A to, the 1994 regulations sets out the qualifications required for a person to be considered technically competent for different types of waste management facilities. There are some operations that do not operate within the CoTC awards, and in these cases the EA assesses whether the applicant is technically competent.</p>

	<p pid="c.686W.0/1">The adoption of the so-called &quot;Merton Rule&quot; (generally a requirement for a certain percentage of the energy needs of new developments to be provided by renewable sources) could potentially have a significant impact on the market for micro-renewables, particularly as the Minister for Housing has encouraged all local authorities to set such targets. A study carried out for my Department by the Energy Saving Trust (Potential for Microgeneration?Study and Analysis) assessed the implications of a similar policy on the microgeneration (micro-renewables and micro-CHP) industry. It concluded that such a policy could be one of the most effective ways of stimulating the mass market introduction of microgeneration in the medium to long-term, but the main beneficiaries would be CHP technologies rather than micro-renewables.</p>

	<p pid="c.687W.2/1">The DTI has no estimates of impacts on energy demand over this range of temperatures. Any sustained daily temperatures recorded at the limits of these ranges are likely to result in significant changes in behaviour for which there is no historic experience. We are not aware of any studies which address this question. A comparison between the CO2 emissions estimates from the UK Greenhouse Gas Inventory and temperature data from the Met Office suggest that emissions can vary by several percent from year-to-year due to temperature difference, although exact attribution of causes is not straight forward.</p>

	<p pid="c.688W.2/2">It is not practical to make an assessment of the level of gas that would flow into the UK as a result of European liberalisation. A liberalised market would lead to increased imports and exports of gas between the UK and Europe in turn leading to more efficient allocation of resources and potential benefits to consumers in both UK and continental Europe. In particular improved liquidity of gas in European markets could provide incremental gas in times of demand peaks and lead to a reduction in price volatility in the longer term.</p>

The European Commission has undertaken a sectoral inquiry, which has identified access to long-term downstream contracts, capacity on pipelines and gas storage as priorities for individual competition investigations. The Commission aims to reach conclusions by January 2007, and will then pursue infringement of EU competition law as appropriate.</p>

	<p pid="c.691W.6/1">The Government's priority for reducing drinking and driving is through a combination of effective law enforcement, maintaining a very tough penalties regime and continuing investment in high-profile national publicity campaigns to discourage drink driving.</p>
	<p pid="c.691W.6/2">To this end, we have given the police new powers to carry out evidential roadside breath testing, subject to type approval of appropriate equipment. This is supported by a number of other measures in the Road Safety Act 2006 which are designed to deter drink driving and reduce re-offending.</p>
	<p pid="c.691W.6/3">These include enabling powers to require serious, including repeat, offenders to retake the driving test at the end of their period of disqualification; to improve the operation of the drink drive rehabilitation scheme; to close certain loopholes in the law relating to high risk offenders; and to establish a statutory alcohol ignition interlock programme.</p>
	<p pid="c.691W.6/4">We will shortly be launching the THINK! 2006 Christmas drink drive publicity campaign jointly with the Association of Chief Police Officers.

However, as for the most part, compliance with the limits set out in the Road Transport Working Time Directive (2002/15/EC) can only be determined over lengthy &quot;reference periods&quot;, it is unlikely that the digital tachograph generated data available with foreign vehicles/drivers at the roadside would be sufficient for enforcement of those limits.

	<p pid="c.692W.9/1">The full range of road traffic penalties is applicable to owners of foreign vehicles if they commit offences in Great Britain. The same is true of Northern Ireland although not all the relevant offences and penalties there are exactly equivalent to Great Britain. However, provided their vehicles were compliant with the law of the country in which they were registered, the owners would not be subject to prosecution for offences relating, for example, to vehicle excise duty, insurance, and roadworthiness.</p>
	<p pid="c.692W.9/2">At the present time only persons holding GB or Northern Ireland licences are eligible for an offer of a fixed penalty in respect of an endorsable offence; others have to be dealt with by a court. Provisions are made in the Road Safety Act 2006 for these drivers to be allowed to pay a &quot;deposit&quot; in lieu of a fixed penalty, having the equivalent effect. There is a further provision that would allow enforcement authorities to issue a fixed penalty to a non-GB licence holder if they can assure themselves, from any driver record that may be held at DVLA, that the driver in question does not have a record of endorsements that would render him liable to disqualification if he were dealt with by a court.</p>

	<p pid="c.693W.5/2">Total Expenditure on Services (TES) spending by country and region is available in PESA 2006 (cm 6811) Chapter 7. These regional spending statistics use the concept of identifiable spending where Government spending is allocated to the region or country that benefits from the spending. Some spending cannot be allocated to a region or country as it is for the benefit of the UK as a whole (e.g. defence spending). Table 7.11 presents country and regional spending per head for 2000-01 to 2005-06 on Transport on this identifiable, who benefits, basis.</p>

	<p pid="c.696W.5/1">The Childcare Act 2006 puts in place an integrated framework of learning, development and welfare requirements to be met by those providing care to young children. It is intended to increase coherence, provide a flexible approach to care and learning, raise quality across the early years sector and help children to achieve better outcomes.</p>
	<p pid="c.696W.5/2">Those providing care for children aged zero to five years will be required to join the Early Years Register. In order to ensure a proportionate approach to regulation and inspection, exemption from compulsory registration will be allowed under regulation to maintain the existing regime whereby certain forms of care, for example short term, occasional and baby-sitting services, are not required to register. Providers exempt from compulsory registration will be able to join the Ofsted Childcare Register voluntarily and enjoy the benefits it brings.</p>
	<p pid="c.696W.5/3">The Childcare Act also includes a power to exempt early years providers from all or part of the learning and development requirements under the Early Years Foundation Stage (EYFS). We expect that exemptions or modifications in respect of providers to be exceptional and for short limited periods. During the period of such an exemption or modification, local authorities would be expected to use their powers under Section 13 to support the provider to meet the full learning and development requirements. There are no exemptions from EYFS welfare requirements and the learning and develop requirements will be sufficiently flexible to accommodate the vast majority of providers.</p>
	<p pid="c.696W.5/4">The Department will be consulting on both types of exemption in due course.</p>

	<p pid="c.699W.0/1">DFID commissioned the Overseas Development Institute (ODI) to look into the macroeconomic impact of large aid flows in Mauritania, Mozambique Sierra Leone and Tanzania. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) undertook similar work looking at Ethiopia, Ghana, Mozambique, Tanzania and Uganda.</p>
	<p pid="c.699W.0/2">The findings of this work were discussed with a group of interested recipient country finance ministers, central bank governors and officials from developing countries at a joint IMF/DFID at seminar in April 2006. Both pieces of work showed that countries could, with appropriate economic policies, manage the impact of large scale aid inflows.</p>
	<p pid="c.699W.0/3">The issue is obviously more of a concern for countries where aid is a relatively larger proportion of national income. In Uganda for example, DFID has funded work to look explicitly at the macroeconomic impacts of larger aid flows and the particular worry of so called &quot;Dutch Disease&quot; effects, which can hamper exports. This followed explicit concerns from the Ugandan Government regarding increases in aid. We have also recently looked at exchange rate effects in Zambia, although aid flows are only part of the picture in the appreciated exchange rate.</p>

	<p pid="c.701W.2/1">Prevention of mother-to-child HIV transmission (PMTCT) is now established as an effective, feasible, affordable and achievable intervention to limit the number of babies born with HIV.</p>
	<p pid="c.701W.2/2">There has been some progress with coverage. Globally, over 100 countries are now implementing PMTCT programs, yet only 13 developing countries have achieved national coverage. Coverage of PMTCT programmes is particularly low in sub-Saharan Africa where national rates vary from 1 to 10 per cent. of pregnant women receiving services.</p>
	<p pid="c.701W.2/3">We know that proven interventions, such as HIV testing followed by treatment with Nevirapine can reduce this risk to only 5 per cent. Only 8 per cent. of women with HIV in poor countries have access to such treatment.</p>
	<p pid="c.701W.2/4">DFID is concerned at the low distribution of the life-saving, cheap antibiotic, cotrimoxazole; its efficacy in reducing morbidity and mortality of children with HIV was established during DFID funded research. The need to scale-up access to cotrimoxazole was highlighted at the UK/UNICEF hosted Global Partners Forum on Children and AIDS. UN agencies, notably The World Health Organisation and UNICEF have pledged to step up efforts to support countries to scale up provision of cotrimoxazole as part of efforts to scale up health systems more broadly.</p>
	<p pid="c.701W.2/5">Recent DFID-supported research in the Republic of Congo and Uganda demonstrates that pregnant women with HIV are between four to five times more likely to die as a result of pregnancy and childbirth than non-infected women. When a mother dies in childbirth the baby is up to 10 times more likely to die within the first year of life, whether or not they have HIV themselves.</p>
	<p pid="c.701W.2/6">These are some of the reasons why DFID is increasing its focus on Preventing Mother to Child Transmission of HIV (PMTCT).</p>
	<p pid="c.701W.2/7">In Zimbabwe, DFID is initiating a &pound;25 million project designed to address maternal and newborn health in a comprehensive way including: diagnosing HIV in pregnant women; improved obstetric care, increasing access to Nevirapine and other pre- and postnatal health services, nutritional monitoring of mother and baby with treatment for mother, father and child if they have HIV.</p>
	<p pid="c.701W.2/8">In Malawi, where DFID is the major donor in the health sector, with an investment of &pound;100 million over the period 2004-10, a rapid scale up in PMTCT services is taking place with the aim that every pregnant woman visiting a health facility will have access to HIV prevention and treatment services. As countries scale up the provision and availability of anti-retrovirals, they also have to ensure a corresponding increase in uptake of services. In Zambia, we support UNICEF's expansion of prevention of mother to child transmission.</p>
	<p pid="c.701W.2/9">Stigma and discrimination remain major barriers to uptake of PMTCT and other HIV services in sub-Saharan Africa. DFID is helping to tackle this&mdash;for example by funding education and mass-media campaigns in Angola, Ethiopia, Malawi, Nigeria, South Africa and Zimbabwe. We have also supported training of journalists across the Southern African Development Community (SADC) on sensitive reporting on HIV/AIDS.</p>

	<p pid="c.702W.2/1">The commitment made at the UN General Assembly's High Level Meeting on HIV/AIDS in June 2006, to pursue all necessary efforts to scale up towards the goal of universal access to comprehensive prevention programmes, treatment, care and support by 2010, was a significant step forward. The General Assembly further committed that countries would set, in 2006, ambitious national targets, including interim targets for 2008, in the context of national plans for scaling up towards comprehensive plans for universal access.</p>
	<p pid="c.702W.2/2">I understand through UNAIDS that over 80 countries have provided target data and that over 40 have set outcome targets for all prevention, treatment and care. We look forward to these plans being reviewed, seeing the completion of the process to set targets and for countries to set fully costed, credible plans. In this way the international community, with partner governments, can move ahead with implementation of effective national plans for universal access.</p>

	<p pid="c.702W.5/1">The 2006 World Health Organization guidelines on adult antiretroviral treatment in resource-limited settings recommend that national treatment programmes should invest in CD4 cell counting in order to improve the identification of patients in need of treatment.</p>
	<p pid="c.702W.5/2">However, CD4 cell counting requires expensive laboratory equipment and trained staff, and may not be practical at primary care level, since blood samples must be transported to laboratories. Efforts are continuing to reduce the cost of CD4 cell counting. The Department for International Development will continue to monitor the cost of CD4 cell-counting technology and international efforts to reduce costs.</p>
	<p pid="c.702W.5/3">DFID is supporting the scaling up of AIDS treatment services, including CD4 cell-counting and anti-retrovirals in a growing number of countries worldwide. Examples include:</p>
	<p pid="c.702W.5/4" class="indent">Zimbabwe, where an &pound;18 million programme aims to increase by more than 50 per cent., to 20,000, the number of people on anti-retroviral therapy. This is part of a multi-donor partnership, including WHO, UNFPA, UNICEF, UNAIDS and NGOs. DFID is also supporting ART provision in other countries in Africa including DRC, Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda.</p>
	<p pid="c.702W.5/5" class="indent">In India, DFID is planning a programme of support to the new National AIDS Control programme. This will involve the setting up of 250 district-level ART clinics, which will provide CD4 testing and scale up treatment access ten-fold, to 400,000 people.</p>
	<p pid="c.702W.5/6">DFID is supporting the Government of Brazil's STD/AIDS programme to provide technical assistance to 23 countries in Latin America and the Caribbean. Main elements of this programme include the provision of first line ARV drugs and CD4 cell counting. DFID funded a pilot programme in Uruguay to provide essential laboratory equipment, including CD4 cell counting, backed up with technical training. This enabled key lessons to be learnt.</p>
	<p pid="c.702W.5/7">DFID is supporting ARV and CD4 scale-up both through direct bilateral programmes focussed on AIDS and more broadly on scaling up health systems, as well through our investments in multilateral instruments, notably the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, TB and Malaria (GFATM), to which we gave &pound;100 million this year. The GFATM has provided anti-retroviral therapy to over 600,000 people in developing countries.</p>

	<p pid="c.704W.6/1">I do not believe that withholding UK funding to the World Bank would be appropriate. We provide core funding to the World Bank for three-year periods and it is right that we honour our commitments. Last year, the UK announced a contribution of &pound;1,330 million to the 14th replenishment of the International Development Association (IDA-14), the arm of the World Bank which provides grants and concessional loans to the world's poorest countries. Withholding such funding would be damaging to the poor. It would mean that valuable development projects would have to be stopped. It would also mean that our share of the debt cancellation agreed at Gleneagles would be unfunded. The UK worked hard to achieve the debt deal, which has already cancelled all the debts owed to the IMF, the World Bank and the Africa Development Bank of 20 of the poorest countries in the world.</p>
	<p pid="c.704W.6/2">Last year the UK also announced a supplementary contribution of &pound;100 million to IDA-14, linked to progress by the World Bank in working more effectively with other donors and reforming the way it attaches conditions to its aid. We have paid the first &pound;50 million following satisfactory Bank progress against the agreed performance indicators. Payment of the second &pound;50 million will depend on whether the Bank has made satisfactory progress in implementing its Good Practice Principles for conditionally adopted last year. We are currently considering a report on this.</p>
	<p pid="c.704W.6/3">At the Gleneagles summit last year, the G8 agreed that developing countries should</p>
	<p pid="c.704W.6/4" class="indent">&quot;decide, plan and sequence their economic policies to fit with their own development strategies, for which they should be accountable to their people&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="c.704W.6/5">We strongly endorse these principles and will continue to encourage the World Bank to promote them in all its operations.</p>
	<p pid="c.704W.6/6">The July White Paper on International Development acknowledges the critical role which the World Bank plays in providing development assistance to developing countries. It also makes clear that the World Bank must reform if it is to remain relevant in a changing world. Four priorities are identified for the Bank:</p>
	<p pid="c.704W.6/7" class="indent">play a leading role in providing more long-term, predictable funding for developing countries;</p>
	<p pid="c.704W.6/8" class="indent">find new ways to work with middle income countries as they still face major development changes and are shaping the wider world;</p>
	<p pid="c.704W.6/9" class="indent">help tackle the global challenges facing developing countries&mdash;focusing urgently on a financing framework for clean energy and adaptation to climate change, and forging a new international framework to help developing countries tackle corruption and improve their governance;</p>
	<p pid="c.704W.6/10" class="indent">help developing countries obtain more influence in the World Bank, where they are weakly represented on the boards, with voting rights decided by financial contributions. This balance must change. The Bank must do more to support developing country priorities and not impose economic policy conditions in areas like privatisation and trade liberalisation. And if their members demand it, the Bank should be ready to change how members are represented, and how decisions are made&mdash;for example through greater voting rights for poor countries.</p>
	<p pid="c.704W.6/11">We are actively pursuing these reforms in collaboration with like-minded partners.</p>

	<p pid="c.717W.6/2">Since the introduction of the income tax and national insurance contributions exemptions on employer-supported child care in April 2005, employers and employees have not been required to report tax-free employer-supported child care vouchers provided to employees. Therefore information on the marginal tax rate of participants, overall numbers participating, or cost to the exchequer is not available.</p>
	<p pid="c.717W.6/3">HMRC have recently commissioned the National Centre for Social Research (NatCen), an independent social research organisation, to monitor the initial impact of reforms to employer-supported child care. They conducted a survey of employer perception of employer-supported child care as a whole, and not just child care vouchers.</p>

In his Medium Term Strategy the IMF Managing Director, Rodrigo Rato, identified marshalling of the expected rise in aid flows to achieve the MDGs as one of the Fund's key challenges in developing countries. The UK and the IMF jointly hosted a workshop at the IMF/World Bank Spring Meetings in April this year on the management of increased aid flows, including for tackling HIV/AIDS, and the issue was subsequently raised at the IMFC. The conclusion of this and other engagement on the issue has been that countries can, with appropriate economic policies, manage the impact of large aid flows.</p>

However, there is no provision in these agreements that would allow a reduced VAT rate for construction or improvement work to any non-residential building.</p>
	<p pid="c.734W.6/3">To date, where these are available under EU VAT agreements, the Government have been sparing in its use of reduced rates, and only applied them where they offer the best targeted, most efficient support for our social objectives compared with other options. Therefore, we have so far introduced reduced rates for building work in areas that would have the greatest effect on the regeneration and renewal of the UK housing stock, such as certain residential conversions and the renovation of housing that has been empty for more than three years.</p>

	<p pid="c.739W.8/1">The information requested could be provided only at disproportionate cost.</p>
	<p pid="c.739W.8/2">The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) operates a devolved budgeting system for the contracting of staff on a consultancy basis and no central records of numbers employed or length of employment are maintained. We have in excess of 200 overseas posts and a large number of directorates who may have contracted consultants at some time or another in the last five years. Each post and directorate would need to be contacted to provide details of the firms used and the number of consultants provided. This would require significant resource, far in excess of the current threshold for disproportionate cost. In addition, consultants are mainly employed through companies who have been contracted to deliver a specified output for a fixed price. In those instances we would not keep records of the numbers of staff employed on the project by the consultant.</p>
	<p pid="c.739W.8/3">The FCO's use of external consultants helps to contribute to the success of projects by providing relevant new knowledge, specialist skills, experience and an independent view of key issues not available in-house. This wider experience and broader perspective, drawn from their work with other organisations, adds value to the FCO's business.</p>

In other instances, the customer seeking availability details must transfer to providers' or consolidators' own sites to see this information. In the latter circumstances, all accommodation contact details provided to VisitBritain are displayed via its EnglandNet database. This enables consumers to contact the relevant accommodation businesses in the EnglandNet database directly. The presentation of actual availability information, and of other details of services, is a matter for providers themselves.</p>

Currently the EnglandNet database contains records of around 27,000 accommodation businesses which have been quality assessed by either VisitBritain or the Automobile Association.

This reflects the important principle that lottery projects are specific interventions, over a defined period of time, intended to produce a definite result and lasting benefits.

A requirement to contact the next-of-kin within 24 hours of a death being reported is included only within the illustrative draft charter for bereaved people which accompanied the draft Bill on coroner reform. The provisions in the charter are not intended to alter the employment terms and conditions of coroner's officers. The charter will be subject to further consultation, and amendment where necessary, when the Bill has received Royal Assent.</p>

It will be built as a Private Developer Scheme (PDS) which means that HMCS will be spending less than &pound;1 million in fees, and will not take a capital risk. Instead we will take a guaranteed lease from the successful bidder who will take that risk. We expect that the capital cost of the project to the developer will be approximately &pound;14.5 million.</p>

	<p pid="c.768W.5/2">The volunteering projects cover a wide range of programmes with traditional organisations extending their reach to young people and new projects which involve young people as never before.

Programmes funded through the V grants have a wide geographical spread across England and are found in both urban and rural areas to increase opportunities to volunteer for young people in a variety of communities.</p>

The majority of the convictions that resulted in the job offer being withdrawn were for theft and violence. Statistics are not held centrally on the success of applicants seeking to adopt.</p>
	<p pid="c.770W.5/4">The CRB offers guidance to users of the service in the form of a code of practice and explanatory guide, which states that disclosure information should only be used in the context of a policy on the recruitment of ex-offenders, designed to protect applicants from unfair discrimination on the basis of non-relevant past convictions. However it is ultimately for an employer to decide an applicant's suitability for a particular role.</p>

	<p pid="c.778W.5/1">In the period since 1997, the Home Office has had responsibility for a wide range of subjects some of which have now become the responsibility of other Departments. In that period, the Home Office has sponsored primary and secondary legislation on electoral law, data protection and licensing as well as immigration and nationality, terrorism and criminal law and criminal justice. In some cases, the legislation has created new offences; in other cases, it has re-enacted existing offences, sometimes with modifications to their extent or scope.</p>
	<p pid="c.778W.5/2">A list of the offences created in all Home Office legislation in the period since 1997 is not held centrally and could be produced only at disproportionate cost in time and resources.</p>

	<p pid="c.779W.3/1">The police funding formula provides an assessment of the relative need of each police force in England and Wales. This assessment is based on the social characteristics of each police authority which are considered to affect the level of demand for police services in the community. To avoid penalising police authorities that successfully reduce crime, actual crime is not used in determining relative need.</p>
	<p pid="c.779W.3/2">The police funding formula was reviewed in consultation with the police service in 2005 and a revised formula was implemented for the 2006-07 settlement. This revision incorporated more recent data from the 2001 census, changes in the structure of policing and more up-to-date analysis of how the characteristics of different areas affect policing demands. To avoid large changes in grant resulting from this revision, each police authority was guaranteed an increase in formula grant of at least 3.1 per cent. in 2006-07 and 3.6 per cent. in 2007-08.</p>

	<p pid="c.790W.2/1">The Department has undertaken a number of activities to promote equality and diversity in the national health service and particularly to support the NHS in meeting its responsibilities under the various equality legislation on race, disability and gender as well as regulations on age, religion and belief and sexual orientation. The Department's strategy for promoting equality and diversity in the NHS is to set action on these issues within the overall framework for planning and delivering the Department's and NHS's priorities.</p>
	<p pid="c.790W.2/2">The Department has a detailed programme of work under way to take forward equality and human rights commitments which includes the following.</p>
	<p pid="c.790W.2/3">We are working with inspectorate bodies and equality commissions to ensure that equality and human rights issues are integrated into inspection arrangements and relevant sector specific guidance provided to help the health sector promote equality issues.</p>
	<p pid="c.790W.2/4">Delivering Race Equality in Mental Health Care (DRE) is an action plan for reform of NHS mental health services&mdash;working towards equality of access, equality of experience and equality of outcome for all mental health service users. DRE's programme of change consists of three main building blocks: more appropriate and response services, community engagement and better information. As part of the DRE programme the Department commissioned the Healthcare Commission, in partnership with the Mental Health Act Commission, to undertake an annual census of ethnicity of mental health in- patients.</p>
	<p pid="c.790W.2/5">The race for health programme is primary care trust-led with support from the Department equality and human rights group. It convenes a network of 14 PCTs around the country, working in partnership with local black and minority ethnic communities to improve health, modernise services, increase choice and create greater diversity within the NHS work force. Race for health also disseminates examples of good practice across the NHS and recently published &quot;Towards Race Equality in Health: A Guide to Policy and Good Practice for Commissioning Services&quot;. Plans are under way to recruit a new wave of PCTs to the programme.</p>
	<p pid="c.790W.2/6">The pacesetters programme is headed by the equality and human rights group. This programme places equality at the heart of NHS business, organisational objectives and core values, impacting upon future health planning, performance management and delivery. The group is working with up to five SHAs to deliver equality and diversity improvements and innovations resulting in:</p>
	<p pid="c.790W.2/7" class="indent">patient and user involvement in the design and delivery of services;</p>
	<p pid="c.790W.2/8" class="indent">reduced health inequalities for patients and service users;</p>
	<p pid="c.790W.2/9" class="indent">working environments that are fair and free of discrimination.</p>
	<p pid="c.790W.2/10">The participating SHAs are launching their local involvement in the programme from November 2006; developing and publishing &quot;Promoting Equality and Human Rights in the NHS&mdash;a Guide for Board Members&quot; aimed at helping non-executive board members take forward the issues of equality and human rights with regard to patients and the work force. The guide outlines the legislative framework and the principles that underpin equality and human rights. It demonstrates the business case for promoting and delivering equality and human rights, and includes a set of prompts for boards to take stock of how fairly their organisations treat their patients and workforce. The guide is currently being revised to incorporate current and imminent legislation and will extend to include all board members not just non-executive directors. This should be available at the end of 2006;</p>
	<p pid="c.790W.2/11">The leadership and race equality action plan (LREAP) is a 10-point action plan launched in February 2004. LREAP is aimed at NHS chief executives and their boards with a specific focus on health services and outcomes and challenging them to pay greater attention to meeting the service needs of people from ethnic minorities and making equality issues an important dimension of NHS strategy. A revised LREAP will be integrated into an NHS leadership document that is currently being developed;</p>
	<p pid="c.790W.2/12">The Department is working with external lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) stakeholders on the development and implementation of a sexual orientation and gender identity equality strategy. A sexual orientation and gender identity advisory group is assisting with this work;</p>
	<p pid="c.790W.2/13">The Department's equality and human rights group is leading a project aimed at supporting the equalities agenda through the development of single equality schemes (SES) in the NHS. The project has been set up in anticipation of possible further duties in relation to age, religion and belief and sexual orientation and plans to encourage work to pull together the different equality strands without compromising any of the individual elements in a cross-cutting and coherent fashion. Project leads provide support in terms of expertise in the field of equalities legislation, facilitating partnerships and joined-up working, research, sharing of good practice and producing guidance. Project leads also provide specific guidance on the disability and gender duties respectively. The organisations involved are committed to producing a single equality scheme and will collectively produce learning that identifies the different steps required to meet both the current and likely duties which will be meaningful to the host of diverse organisations within the NHS. Development and outcomes from all the programmes outlined above will be shared and disseminated throughout the NHS;</p>
	<p pid="c.790W.2/14">The Mosaic project was established by the Department of Health in 2004 to promote race equality through and in procurement. The project focuses on three main areas:</p>
	<p pid="c.790W.2/15" class="indent">working with NHS organisations and staff, especially on workforce development issues;</p>
	<p pid="c.790W.2/16" class="indent">working with NHS prime or first tier suppliers and getting them to understand the legal responsibility to the RRA and review their own work practices in relation to BME communities;</p>
	<p pid="c.790W.2/17" class="indent">promoting the use of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), and BME suppliers in particular, as a means of promoting race equality.</p>
	<p pid="c.790W.2/18">The Department in collaboration with NHS Employers has published a disability equality guide which gives practical best practice advice on how NHS organisations might produce a disability equality scheme that sets out how they will meet their statutory duty to promote disability equality. The disability equality duty comes into effect on <phrase class="date" code="2006-12-04">4 December 2006</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="c.790W.2/19">In preparation for the gender equality duty which comes into force in April 2007, the Department is in the process of developing a gender equality duty guide to assist NHS organisations meet the duties of the gender duty legislation.</p>

	<p pid="c.794W.0/1">Neither the Department nor the Royal Colleges have prepared guidance on the minimum advisable distance between a consultant-led maternity unit and midwife-led maternity units. Distance alone should not be the only factor as safety, risk and travelling times are equally important. Any woman and maternity professional discussing the planned place of birth should share relevant general information, then during labour make continuing decisions taking this into account. Ultimately, care should be provided within a framework that ensures that the safety of the mother and baby are paramount and that considers factors such as distance, travel times and weather conditions.</p>
	<p pid="c.794W.0/2">The Department has been working on a delivery plan for maternity services. A maternity standard implementation advisory group, on which many stakeholders, including the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG), other royal colleges and voluntary organisations are represented, has been established and has helped develop the delivery plan. We have already held one bilateral meeting with the RCOG with a further one scheduled later in November jointly with the Royal College of Midwives and the National Childbirth Trust, specifically to discuss this plan further. A meeting between the president of the RCOG and Mr. Lewis, the Minister for Care Services, will be held on <phrase class="date" code="2006-11-27">27 November</phrase>.</p>

	<p pid="c.796W.5/1">Although the specific cause of sudden death by epilepsy (SUDEP) is unknown, the risks of sudden death are considered to be greater for those patients whose epilepsy is poorly controlled. Action to reduce SUDEP has therefore concentrated on improving epilepsy services in general, raising awareness of SUDEP among those living with epilepsy and their families, and the introduction of new more effective drugs to control seizures.</p>
	<p pid="c.796W.5/2">We have commissioned the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) to produce clinical guidelines for the diagnosis, management and treatment of epilepsy. This guidance, published in October 2004, specifically covers the importance of informing patients and their families of the risks of sudden death in epilepsy. In addition, we have made a grant of almost &pound;290,000 to the National Society for Epilepsy to improve support and information for people with epilepsy and their families through their Epilepsy Information Network.</p>
	<p pid="c.796W.5/3">NICE has also published guidance on the clinical and cost-effectiveness of new epilepsy drugs in adults (March 2004) and children (April 2004).</p>
	<p pid="c.796W.5/4">The Department published the national service framework (NSF) for long-term conditions in March 2005. This focuses on improving neurological services across the country for a range of conditions, including epilepsy.</p>
	<p pid="c.796W.5/5">We have made no assessment of which primary care trusts and strategic health authorities have reviewed their local epilepsy plans in light of the National Sentinel report. All local health bodies are expected to have plans to ensure they can implement the NSF for long-term conditions, and their performance towards implementation will be assessed by the Healthcare Commission. In addition, all health professionals are expected to comply with NICE clinical guidelines on the treatment of epilepsy.</p>
	<p pid="c.796W.5/6">We have had no discussions with the Royal Colleges on the need to inform those living with epilepsy of the risks associated with this condition. However, the NICE guidance on epilepsy specifically mentions the importance of providing information about the individual's relative risk of SUDEP. This information should be part of the counselling checklist for adults with epilepsy and their families and/or carers.</p>

While this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain.<br/> <i> Sources:</i><br/> 1. Hospital Episode Statistics (HES)<br/> 2.

Please note that admissions do not represent the number of in-patients, as a person may have more than one admission within the year.<br/> 2. Main operation<br/> The main operation is the first recorded operation in the HES data set and is usually the most resource intensive procedure performed during the episode. It is appropriate to use main operation when looking at admission details, eg time waited, but the figures for &quot;all operations count of episodes&quot; give a more complete count of episodes with an operation.<br/> OPCS CODE: N303 Circumcision<br/> 3.Time waited (days)<br/> Time waited statistics from Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) are not the same as the published waiting list statistics. HES provides counts and time waited for all patients admitted to hospital within a given period whereas the published waiting list statistics count those waiting for treatment on a specific date and how long they have been on the waiting list. Also, HES calculates the time waited as the difference between the admission and decision to admit dates. Unlike published waiting list statistics this is not adjusted for self-deferrals or periods of medical/social suspension.<br/> <i> Sources:</i><br/> 1. Hospital Episode Statistics (HES)<br/> 2.
