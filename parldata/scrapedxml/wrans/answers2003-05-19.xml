	<p pid=".508W.3/4">CDC Group plc operates under an investment policy, agreed with DFID, which requires that at least 50 cent. of its new investments are in, or for the benefit of, the countries of sub-Saharan Africa and south Asia and that 70 per cent. of new investments must be in, or for the benefit of, the poorer developing countries (which of course includes most of sub-Saharan Africa).

	<p pid=".509W.5/1">Between 2002 and 2007 we intend to spend &pound;1.3 billion on basic education, subject to agreeing high quality programmes with our partners. Of this, about &pound;500 million will go to Africa. This figure of &pound;1.3 billion compares favourably with the &pound;700 million committed to Universal Primary Education since 1997.</p>
	<p pid=".509W.5/2">There is broad consensus among international agencies that greater harmonisation of resources will increase aid effectiveness. We will work with G8 to ensure that they increase support and resources to meet the education MDGs. Our approach to Nigeria and DRC is to support long-term change while supporting rapid improvements in education delivery. In Nigeria we have committed &pound;12.5 million of technical support to help 16 Nigerian states with their plans for Universal Basic Education alongside $100 million of financial support from the World Bank. In the DRC, DFID has agreed to support an education adviser within the World Bank office in Kinshasa and to provide additional support to the education planning process. We will consider supporting education following the conclusion of the peace agreement.</p>
	<p pid=".509W.5/3">Our approach to the Fast Track Initiative (FTI) is to ensure that it focuses on encouraging Governments with large numbers of children out of school to develop credible education plans that will enable them to achieve the aim of universal primary education. We have successfully pressed for the inclusion of those countries with the most children out of school&mdash;like India (with 30 million children out of school), Bangladesh, Pakistan, Nigeria and the Democratic Republic of Congo. A working group of which DFID is a member has been established to take this forward. In countries where we are engaged, we will consider increasing our support in the context of their PRSP and Medium-Term Expenditure Framework. We will continue to be involved in the Fast Track Initiative at all levels but do not envisage diverting existing commitments in order to support specific Fast Track Initiative proposals.</p>

Additional financial resources are also provided through multilateral channels including the European Commission's external aid programme and the Common Fund for Commodities.

	<p pid=".511W.5/2">Through our membership of the International Coffee Organisation (ICO) the UK is also supporting the development of an ICO diversification programme.

	<p pid=".511W.5/3">It does not necessarily follow that organic certification will deliver improved livelihoods for poor coffee producers. It is important that careful consideration is given to ensuring that any additional premium generated from the production and sale of organic produce justifies any additional costs that may be incurred, including associated certification costs. In 2000, DFID financed a study to examine the opportunities and constraints for resource poor farmers in organic production and trade. DFID is also supporting a coffee certification feasibility analysis in Uganda.</p>

	<p pid=".512W.2/1">The funds in question refer to resources available from the now expired Lome Convention. However, it is important to recognise that these funds, while not disbursed, are currently allocated to other activities. Until such commitments are actually spent, financial resources remain with Member State Treasuries. In the case of the UK, they are spent on poverty reduction activities elsewhere. The European Commission does not maintain a fund of unused finances beyond normal balances needed for cash management purposes.</p>
	<p pid=".512W.2/2">However, from an efficiency point of view, the Commission needs to provide more information about old and undisbursed commitments that could and should be recommitted elsewhere to fund other development activities through bilateral or multilateral channels. The mid-term reviews of EC Country Strategies starting in 2004, will give each country an opportunity to reassess their own priorities and requirements, and could allow reallocation of existing commitments. The Secretary of State will make this point at the General Affairs and External Relations Council on 19 to <phrase class="date" code="2003-05-20">20 May 2003</phrase>, at which Commissioner Nielson will be present.</p>

There are a number of ways in which EU aid could be applied to achieve this. This includes support provided within the framework of poverty reduction programmes.</p>
	<p pid=".512W.2/5">The EU is supportive of the ICO Quality Initiative. Progress with implementation of the Quality Initiative is currently being discussed by the Working Group on Commodities (PROBA) at which the UK is represented by DEFRA.

	<p pid=".512W.5/1">The UK Government remain sceptical about proposals to finance the reduction of stocks of surplus coffee. A voluntary cut in total global production that results in a better balance between coffee supply and demand is the only feasible means to achieve an improvement in coffee prices. It is also important to recognise that any arrangement that promotes an increase in market prices in the absence of strict disciplines on production is likely to be short-lived as producers will respond to increased prices through an expansion in output. For these reasons we do not intend to finance or compensate producer countries in respect of any stock reduction programme they undertake.</p>
	<p pid=".512W.5/2">The Coffee Retention Scheme agreed by the Association of Coffee Producing Countries was intended to raise coffee prices, by retaining a set proportion of coffee supplies destined for export. The Scheme was formally abandoned in 2002 as producer members were unable to work out a mechanism of control over coffee prices. The International Coffee Organisation also used to operate a quota system whereby coffee supplies in excess of consumer requirements were withheld from the market. However, changes in the pattern of supply and demand, resulting in an increase in prices, also led to the collapse of this quota system. This highlights the problems with stock retention schemes.</p>

	<p pid=".514W.8/1">UK development assistance is provided to a significant number of coffee producing countries. More generally, the UK has supported the strengthening of agricultural research and extension systems over many years both nationally and internationally, including in coffee producing countries. At the developing country level, support to agricultural extension is being integrated into sector-wide reform programmes that receive support from multiple donors, for example in Ghana, Uganda and Mozambique. The UK is also a supporter of the Neuchatel Initiative, a multi-donor group established to achieve convergence on the objectives, methods and means of support for agricultural extension policies. The Neuchatel Group has produced studies on alternative financing mechanisms for agricultural extension involving public and private actors.</p>
	<p pid=".514W.8/2">Improved market knowledge and access to information can help to strengthen the negotiating power of farmers. There are a number of routes through which this can be achieved other than through support to formal government agricultural extension service structures.</p>
	<p pid=".514W.8/3">The decision to establish a co-operative, or indeed any other organised grouping of people, must be entirely voluntary and based on a shared commitment to particular ideals or objectives. Activities must be bound by agreed rules including those relating to the behaviour and conduct of members and accountability. The lessons from past experience, particularly of the state-led drive to establish co-operatives in Africa in the '70s, highlight the difficulties that can arise when decisions to form a co-operative are imposed by external agents. Having said that, UK development assistance lends support to a range of institutional arrangements as deemed appropriate.</p>

	<p pid=".515W.2/1">The Department for International Development has increasingly focused its aid to support the Government of India in sustainably addressing poverty reduction and targeting the poorest. The Dalit people, who number about 170 million, are particularly disadvantaged. Much of the sectoral work in service provision, such as the DFID-supported Child Environment Programme in water and sanitation of UNICEF or the Urban Services for the Poor programmes in Kolkata and Andhra Pradesh, deliver aid to Dalit people. The District Primary Education Programme, which DFID has supported since 1998, and the Lok Jumbish primary education programme, which DFID has been funding for about four years, both have explicit budget lines on educational needs of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, particularly girls. Through such government programmes, DFID seeks to increase the potential for the far greater resources of the Government of India to address the needs of the poorest, including the Dalits.</p>
	<p pid=".515W.2/2">In addition, DFID has a relatively small allocation to civil society organisations, which are required under Indian law to be registered under the Foreign Contributions Registration Act in order to receive foreign contributions. DFID, through its Civil Society Department, has supported a number of UK-based NGOs that work with empowering Dalits. More directly the Poorest Areas Civil Society programme works in most of the 100 poorest districts identified by a Government of India survey that included social criteria. These districts include high levels of Dalits and include many of the districts of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. The PACS programme has made grants to a number of organisations that address issues of discrimination against Dalits and more information on these grants can be obtained from the PACS website <a href="http://www.empowerpoor.org">www.empowerpoor.org</a> (e.g. grants 7 to &quot;Chetna Vikas&quot; and 8 to &quot;Gramin Evam Nagar Vikas Parishad&quot; among others). This is a new programme and the first grants were made in the UK financial year 2001&ndash;02, but are mostly effective in 2002&ndash;03 and subsequent years. DFID has also committed 65,000 to the Village Service Trust for four years from 2001&ndash;05 for increasing political participation of socially marginalized groups in Theni District, particularly women and Dalits. The Department's support for ActionAid's &quot;Fighting Poverty Together&quot; corporate plan covers work with particularly discriminated groups, including Dalits. Through the Small Grants Scheme, operated by the British High Commission, a grant of &pound;11,000 was made in 1999&ndash;2000 to &quot;The Society of Depressed People for Social Justice&quot; in Delhi, creating awareness on legal rights for Dalit women in various slum colonies in Delhi.</p>
	<p pid=".515W.2/3">DFID has recently approved the District Health Management and Sector Reform Programme (for the State of Madhya Pradesh) which will invest &pound;18.4 million over the two years 2003&ndash;04 and 2004&ndash;05 and will seek to target health service provision &quot;more effectively and equitably to address the needs of disadvantaged groups, particularly Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, other vulnerable communities and women&quot;.</p>

Recent estimates suggest that the administrative category of &quot;Scheduled Caste&quot;, essentially Dalits, has about 9 per cent. higher levels of income poverty than the all-India average of 26.5 per cent. in 1999&ndash;2000 and that other indicators also show poorer outcomes than average for Dalits. DFID's overall aim of reducing poverty through supporting appropriate government actions therefore addresses these inequalities of outcomes. DFID is seeking to analyse the non-income barriers to poverty reduction and ways of addressing these. Issues of discrimination against Dalits, Adivasis and Minorities are at the heart of social exclusion and poverty.</p>
	<p pid=".516W.2/2">One way DFID seeks to address the position of Dalit peoples when considering bilateral aid is to build in an explicit focus on indicators such as educational or health outcomes for Dalit girls in annual and mid-term reviews of programmes, (even where these involve DFID funding for Government of India programmes, such as the Sarva Shikshya Abhyan primary education programme). To do this, DFID seeks to encourage the collection of disaggregated data that will permit such analysis. This has already been done through the earlier District Primary Education Programme, for example.</p>
	<p pid=".516W.2/3">Developing the demand side for reform of services to be more accountable to, and responsive to the needs of, particular groups of the poor and, in particular, Dalits, requires support for their organisations and representatives to be directly involved in policy formulation and programme implementation and monitoring. DFID is looking at ways of supporting such constructive engagement with government.</p>

	<p pid=".517W.2/1">The information is as follows:</p>
	<p pid=".517W.2/2">(i) The Rome Declaration on Harmonisation in February this year committed donors to track, and as necessary refine, lead indicators of progress on harmonisation. At the country level, a growing number of donors are in the early stages of developing indicators and processes to monitor the impact of their engagement on poverty reduction in partner countries. Where possible these are built upon the partner countries' own systems to monitor progress against the Poverty Reduction Strategy Plan targets. DFID is developing such indicators as part of their new Country</p>
	<p pid=".517W.2/3">Assistance Plans.</p>
	<p pid=".517W.2/4">The Strategic Partnership with Africa (SPA) recently adopted a programme of action to monitor progress made by donors in aligning their support with national poverty reduction strategies (PRSs), and to track the quality and volume of aid flows to Africa. Two working groups have been created to address alignment issues relating to sector programmes and budget support. The working groups are developing a framework for monitoring progress in donor behaviour. The monitoring framework will be implemented in co-operation with the OECD/DAC and the UNECA.</p>
	<p pid=".517W.2/5">(ii) The UN Secretary-General has overall responsibility for monitoring and reporting global progress against the Millennium Development Goals. DFID was influential this year in finalising a working set of 48 indicators against which progress towards meeting the Millennium Development Goals will be measured. These indicators (available in Annex 4 of DFID's 2003 Departmental Report) provide a baseline for the UN Secretary-General's report on progress towards the Goals.</p>
	<p pid=".517W.2/6">DFID has supported the establishment by the UNDP of a comprehensive Millennium Development Goals Support Programme. It will develop strategies to meet each Goal, help each developing country to monitor progress and feed results into the UN Secretary-General's annual report on progress against the Goals, and link up national and global level campaigning in support of them.</p>

	<p pid=".519W.5/1">The Government of Sierra Leone is taking forward a wide-ranging programme of governance reform. In particular it has established an Anti-Corruption Commission, addressed essential reforms in the security sector, and begun the important process of decentralisation. Progress is being made, but is affected by limitations on local capacity.</p>
	<p pid=".519W.5/2">Support for governance reform is central to our assistance to Sierra Leone. We provide extensive support for reform in the security sector, including the armed forces, police and intelligence services. We are also supporting the Governance Reform Secretariat (GRS), which reports to the Office of the President and leads co-ordination of both central and local government reform. Through the GRS we have supported diagnostic studies of four key ministries to provide guidance on measures to improve their effectiveness. A second phase of this programme is being designed. We have assisted the re-establishment of the chieftaincy system. We are also assisting with the preparations for local elections and plans for decentralisation of government. We provide substantial support for the work of the Anti-Corruption Commission, strengthening of the judiciary and law reform, and media development. We are designing major projects to promote access to justice and to strengthen the role of civil society.</p>
	<p pid=".519W.5/3">The Government of Sierra Leone has made significant progress in economic management, which has been acknowledged by the international financial institutions. We are working to help improve public financial management. We are represented on a donor/government public financial management working group which has been established to oversee improvements in a number of key areas including internal and external audit, financial management information systems, and procurement procedures. We plan to provide assistance to the Auditor General and the Public Accounts Committee of Parliament to help ensure transparent economic management of government and donor funds. We have also supported Public Expenditure Tracking Surveys.</p>
	<p pid=".519W.5/4">A UK adviser to the President has prepared a draft strategy for the diamond sector. We plan to work with the Government of Sierra Leone and other donors to gain broad commitment to implementation of the strategy.</p>

	<p pid=".520W.2/1">(i) With others in the international community, we are now planning for the hard work of recovery, rehabilitation and reconstruction in Sudan when there is peace. In preparing for peace, we are co-ordinating closely with other donor countries, the UN, World Bank, IMF and INGOs. When there is a peace agreement, we intend to double our assistance to Sudan to a level of about &pound;20 million. Key priorities for our bilateral programme will be:</p>
	<p pid=".520W.2/2" class="indent">to respond to expanding humanitarian needs;</p>
	<p pid=".520W.2/3" class="indent">to support for &quot;quick start&quot; projects that will demonstrate early benefits of the peace to the Sudanese&mdash;largely be through improved services at the community level;</p>

	<p pid=".520W.2/5" class="indent">to support ceasefire monitoring operations and demobilisation of the armed forces.</p>
	<p pid=".520W.2/6">(ii) The UK has agreed to chair a Support Group of donors to Sudan, to be launched when there is peace, in order to assist the new Government of Sudan through the difficult process of arrears clearance and debt relief. As a first step, the UK will host a workshop for donors this month, to raise awareness of the debt problem.</p>
	<p pid=".520W.2/7">(iii) The current Government of Sudan is working on a first draft of an interim Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper. However, such a strategy will not be credible in the absence of a peace agreement. In addition, the strategy should be produced jointly with the Sudan People's Liberation Movement and prepared in consultation with the wider Sudanese political spectrum and Sudanese civil society. We are encouraging the Government of Sudan to broaden its work on the strategy in this way.</p>

	<p pid=".521W.2/1">I do not have details of the particular water source in question. It is nevertheless clear that destruction of infrastructure as a result of Israeli Military activity in the West Bank and Gaza Strip is adversely affecting public services, including water and wastewater. In addition, closures and curfews imposed by the Government of Israel mean that Palestinian maintenance crews are unable to conduct necessary routine maintenance, and water tankers are unable to service Palestinian communities without networks. This has left many Palestinians without access to reliable water supplies for extended periods of time and is leading to concerns about public health in affected areas.</p>
	<p pid=".521W.2/2">We are working closely with the Palestinian Water Authority to support their activities to supply water to all sections of the population. We continue, both bilaterally and through the EU, to make representations at the highest level to the Government of Israel about damage to Palestinian infrastructure caused by Israeli military activity. We are also working closely with colleagues in the region, and across Whitehall, to encourage the Israeli Government to ease closures and curfews.</p>

	<p pid=".522W.5/1">This regulation relates to the export refund system&mdash;a CAP market support measure intended to allow EU traders to sell competitively outside the Community. Under the export refund system, eligibility to refund is, in many cases, established when the exporter provides proof that the goods have been imported into a particular destination. In the UK, the export refund system is administered by the Rural Payments Agency which is an Executive Agency of DEFRA.</p>
	<p pid=".522W.5/2">Investigations by the Commission's anti-fraud arm, OLAF, indicated widespread irregularities in the import of beef, veal and pigmeat products into the territory of the Russian Federation. These irregularities were thought to be attributable to the unreliability of documentation produced by the Russian customs authorities.</p>
	<p pid=".522W.5/3">Consequently, OLAF brokered an agreement with the Russian authorities. This was partly intended as an anti-fraud measure and partly in recognition of the problems EU traders were experiencing in obtaining proof of import.</p>
	<p pid=".522W.5/4">This agreement was enacted by Commission Regulation (EC) No 2584/2000. It established a mechanism for communicating information on the movement of goods between the EU and the Russian Federation. The mechanism made it possible for EU authorities to trace exports by road of the products concerned to the Russian Federation and, where appropriate, detect cases in which the requirements for the payment of export refund were not met.</p>
	<p pid=".522W.5/5">The regulation was amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 44/2003. This extends the agreement, from <phrase class="date" code="2003-06-01">1 June 2003</phrase>, to cover all types of transport. More importantly, it introduces a provision whereby a confirmation from the Russian authorities that the goods have arrived may be regarded as the primary proof of import for the payment.of export refund. Prior to the amendment, such a response could be considered only in conjunction with other supporting evidence. This new provision should ease the administrative burden on EU exporters and authorities while at the same time ensuring effective control of the export refund system.</p>
	<p pid=".522W.5/6">The UK trade has been kept fully informed of developments in this regard via the Rural Payments Agency's Notices to Traders 1/01 and 36/03 (pertaining to Regulations 2584/2000 and 44/2003 respectively).</p>

For this reason the currently estimated life of the existing Drigg disposal facility is of the order of 50 years. The capacity of the site and its forecast life will be reviewed by the Environment Agency in light of safety cases provided by the site's operators, British Nuclear Fuels plc (BNFL). At some future point either extension of Drigg or the identification of another disposal site will be necessary. Further consideration can begin to be given to this once the outcome of the Environment Agency's review of the safety cases is known, around mid-2004. The outcome will provide vital information for consideration of disposal capacity, as well as providing a basis for the Agency's review of the Drigg disposal authorisation.</p>

However, doorstep recyclate collection is not the only mechanism for enabling us to reach our recycling targets. Increasing the number of, and intensity of use of, bring sites and civic amenity centres, for example, can be used to increase the recycling rate. Local authorities will need to consider a range of options if they are to reach their targets</p>

	<p pid=".529W.10/1">In September 2001, the Department issued a formal public consultation document, accompanied by a more detailed background document, setting out policy proposals for the reform of the TUPE Regulations. Responses to that consultation were considered during 2002, and follow-up discussions took place informally with key stakeholders and TUPE interest groups. In December 2002, a further round of consultation was launched, in the DWP/Treasury Green Paper &quot;Pensions and the Workplace&quot;, on the specific issue of the protection of occupational pension rights on transfer. The outcome of that further consultation is currently under consideration. In the meantime, we announced in February 2003 that we intend to proceed with the other, non-occupational pensions aspects of our proposed reforms. We envisage carrying out a final round of consultation, on draft Regulations (excluding occupational pensions aspects) later this year with the intention of bringing these into force in April 2004.</p>

	<p pid=".531W.8/2">Radioactive waste is categorised according to its radioactivity content and the heat it produces:</p>
	<p pid=".531W.8/3" class="indent">Low Level Wastes (LLW) contain radioactive materials other than those suitable for disposal with ordinary refuse, but not exceeding 4 GBq/te (gigabecquerels) of alpha or 12 GBq/te of beta/gamma activity&mdash;that is, wastes which can be normally be accepted for authorised disposal at Drigg or other landfill sites by controlled burial.</p>
	<p pid=".531W.8/4" class="indent">Intermediate Level Wastes (ILW) contain radioactivity levels exceeding the upper boundaries for LLW, but which do not need heat to be taken into account in the design of storage or disposal facilities.</p>
	<p pid=".531W.8/5" class="indent">High Level Wastes (HLW) are wastes in which the temperature may rise significantly as a result of their radioactivity, so this factor has to be taken into account in designing storage or disposal facilities.</p>
	<p pid=".531W.8/6">National Inventories of radioactive wastes are only produced every three years on the grounds of cost, hence no precise figures are available for 1999 and 2000. However, from interpolation of figures in the 1998 and 2001 Inventories, estimates for 1999 and 2000 and precise figures for 2001 are given as follows.</p>

	<p pid=".536W.0/1">My Department has received a great deal of correspondence from organisations representing musicians and other performers about the Licensing Bill, most of whom have been concerned that it will restrict their activities. The vast majority of their concerns have been unfounded and based on a misinterpretation of the Bill's provisions. Where we believed that the Bill could be improved, however, we have listened to the concerns expressed to us and have made appropriate amendments, for instance, by exempting places of public religious worship from the licensing regime as it relates to the provision of entertainment and entertainment facilities and by accepting the spirit of an amendment which exempts incidental live music in certain circumstances.</p>

	<p pid=".542W.5/1">UK flight and duty time limitations are the responsibility of the Civil Aviation Authority. Their prime objective in setting such limits is to ensure that crew members are adequately rested at the beginning of each flying period and while flying are sufficiently free from fatigue so that they can operate to a satisfactory level of efficiency and safety. Any amendments to UK limitations will take that objective into account.</p>
	<p pid=".542W.5/2">The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) has reviewed the European Parliament's proposed flight time limitations (FTL) requirements. They advise me that, while the requirements are not totally acceptable, with suitable amendment they could form a baseline European FTL requirement which could be supplemented by additional requirements in each member state. We recognise the need for FTL requirements to be harmonised at a European level and should the proposal come before the Council we will work constructively with other member states to ensure that it is appropriately amended. We will not endorse the proposal if any of the limits are significantly different to those set by the CAA in CAP 371, which are in line with scientific advice that the CAA has received over the years.</p>

	<p pid=".545W.2/1">I have asked the Chief Executive of the Highways Agency, Tim Matthews, to write to my hon. Friend on these two issues.</p>

	<p pid=".545W.2/3" class="indent">David Jamieson has asked me to reply to your two recent Parliamentary Questions asking when work will start on the upgrading of the A74 to motorway standards between Carlisle and the Scottish border, and the expected start and completion dates for the upgrading of the A66 between Penrith, and A1.</p>
	<p pid=".545W.2/4" class="indentitalic">A74 Upgrading</p>
	<p pid=".545W.2/5" class="indent">In February this year, a contract was awarded for the design and construction of the A74 Carlisle to Guardsmill scheme using an innovative procurement method known as Early Contractor Involvement, by which it is expected that projects may be delivered more quickly. The current programme shows a start of works in September 2005 with road opening by September 2007. This is subject to completion of the necessary statutory procedures, which include the expected publication next January of draft formal proposals under the Highways Act that are required to give legal authority for the upgrading. The route being followed was announced in June 2002 and follows closely the existing A74.</p>
	<p pid=".545W.2/6" class="indentitalic">A66 Upgrading</p>
	<p pid=".545W.2/7" class="indent">In November last year it was announced that the Agency had appointed consultants to undertake preliminary survey and design work in order to determine the feasibility of upgrading the whole of the A66 between Penrith to the west and the A1 at Scotch Corner to the east to dual carriageway. A number of possible schemes have been identified on which preliminary work is continuing and on which it is expected that the public will be consulted towards the end of the year. If it is then decided that these schemes should be added to the Government's Targeted Programme of Improvements, it is expected that they would be completed within seven years of entry, or sooner.</p>
	<p pid=".545W.2/8" class="indent">In addition to the schemes that are still under investigation, preparation work is in progress on three schemes on this route which are already included in the Targeted Programme of Improvements. These schemes, with their estimated dates for completion, are as follows:</p>
	<p pid=".545W.2/9" class="indent">A66 Temple Sowerby and Improvements at Winderwath 2006&ndash;07</p>
	<p pid=".545W.2/10" class="indent">A66 Carkin Moor to Scotch Corner Improvement 2006&ndash;07</p>
	<p pid=".545W.2/11" class="indent">A66 Greta Bridge to Stephen Bank Improvement 2007&ndash;08</p>
	<p pid=".545W.2/12" class="indent">I hope this is helpful. If you would like any further information on the A74 Upgrading you may wish to contact the Agency's Project Sponsor for this Ziad El Balbisi, at Sunley Tower. Piccadilly Plaza, Manchester, M1 4BE telephone number 0161 930 5822. For further information on any of the proposals forming part of the A66 Upgrading would you please contact the Group Leader, David Harvey, at the same address telephone number 0161 930 5601.</p>

	<p pid=".548W.5/2">The numbers of students studying for A2 and AS examinations are collected through the Department's Annual Schools Census (ASC) and the Learning and Skills Council's Individualised Learner Record (ILR). The ASC information is a snapshot as at the third Thursday in January of each year. The ILR is a snapshot as at <phrase class="date" code="2003-11-01">1 November</phrase> of each year</p>
	<p pid=".548W.5/3">In both these data sources, information is collected on all the qualifications a student is studying for. However students often combine qualifications. In the departmental publication on the participation of 16&ndash;18 year olds, the figures are calculated on the basis of the highest qualification being studied. Part of this hierarchy of highest qualification is:</p>

	<p pid=".548W.5/7" class="indent">GCE A/AS level</p>
	<p pid=".548W.5/8">So, for example, someone studying for a GCE AS level alongside a Double Award VCE would be considered as having the VCE as their highest aim.</p>

	<p pid=".549W.3/1">The Special Educational Needs (SEN) Code of Practice gives statutory guidance to schools, local education authorities and others on assessing children's special educational needs and making provision to meet those needs, including the needs of children with autism.</p>
	<p pid=".549W.3/2">Autism is a spectrum disorder with children across the spectrum showing the full range of intellectual abilities. Many children within the spectrum can, with the right support, achieve in National Curriculum assessments and external qualifications alongside their non-autistic peers. Special arrangements are available under the National Curriculum and from awarding bodies to allow children with SEN to take examinations and tests on an equal footing.</p>
	<p pid=".549W.3/3">There are no assessment arrangements or qualifications that are specific to children and young people with autism or similar disabilities. However, there are a range of arrangements available for assessing the progress and recording the achievements of children with special educational needs, including those with autism, for whom the usual assessment arrangements and public examinations are not suitable. The Department, with the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority, has published guidance to help schools, including special schools, set targets for children with SEN who are performing below National Curriculum Level 1 or within Levels 1 and 2 in English, mathematics and science. The guidance contains Performance Criteria, the 'P' scales, which can be used to assess pupils' progress. Award schemes areavailable through which the key life skills of young people with SEN can be recognised and 'Progress Files' can be used to record their academic and non academic achievements. The Working Group on our 14&ndash;19 reforms, under the chairmanship of Mike Tomlinson, will be looking at assessment arrangements and how they can be used to motivate all learners.</p>
	<p pid=".549W.3/4">A primary aim of SEN support is that young people with SEN make successful transitions from school to further education, training and adult life. The revised SEN Code of Practice, effective from January 2002, contains strengthened transition planning arrangements involving the Connexions Service. In addition, under the Learning and Skills Act 2000, the Connexions Service, on behalf of the Secretary of State, must carry out assessments of all young people with statements of SEN who are in the last year of compulsory schooling and are intending to go on to further education or training or higher education and may carry out assessments in other circumstances. The assessments are of the young person's education and training needs and the provision required to meet those needs. The Learning and Skills Council must have regard to these assessments and the Connexions Service is expected to work with the Council and other providers to make suitable learning opportunities available to young people with SEN. Under the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 further and higher education and training providers must make reasonable adjustments to prevent discrimination against disabled students and potential students.</p>
	<p pid=".549W.3/5">More generally, the Government is developing an SEN Action Programme of practical measures to support local education authorities and schools, working in partnership with others, in improving provision for children and young people with special educational needs.</p>

	<p pid=".550W.5/1">While the Government has recognised British Sign Language as a language in its own right, we remain committed to preserving diversity and choice in relation to the different communication methods available for deaf and hearing impaired people. Children with hearing difficulties will continue to be taught in accordance with their and their parents' preferred style. Under the terms of the Special Educational Needs and Disability Act 2001, it is now unlawful for schools and further and higher education institutions to discriminate against disabled learners by treating them less favourably than others. In addition, institutions have a duty to provide reasonable adjustments to provision where people with disabilities might otherwise be substantially disadvantaged. The Government does not expect the statement of recognition to have any new implications for schools and colleges in relation to teacher supply, interaction between deaf children and others, or funding. We shall however be keeping all these issues under close review.</p>
	<p pid=".550W.5/2">The Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) is providing &pound;1 million to fund a discrete programme of initiatives to support the Government's statement of recognition. The DWP will shortly be consulting organisations of and for deaf people about how this funding should be allocated.</p>

UCAS does not cover students applying to part-time courses, the majority of whom are mature. Around three-quarters of all mature students enter part-time courses. Comparable figures for earlier years are not held centrally. In 2002, a new socio-economic classification was introduced, which is not directly comparable with the social class figures for previous years. The Department has increased significantly its targeted support for mature students, through increased Access and Hardship funds but also through a package of help for student parents including a generous childcare grant introduced in 2001. In addition, the AimHigher HE roadshow and advertising campaign have been launched to promote the benefits of higher education.</p>

	<p pid=".562W.2/1">Credit systems which make it possible to break off and start again without having to repeat learning are increasingly important for part time learners in higher education. We recognised this in the White Paper and this is why we are encouraging HEFCE to work with other partners in the HE sector to identify and build upon good practice in the use of credit systems. HEFCE will be undertaking a two year programme which will include a number of pilot schemes using credit to support flexible progression and transfer between institutions and qualifications.</p>

	<p pid=".562W.5/1">Higher education institutions themselves determine what programmes and courses they offer. They work increasingly with Regional Development Agencies and local Learning and Skills Councils to identify regional and sub-regional priorities and to develop appropriate programmes tailored to the needs of students and the economy.</p>
	<p pid=".562W.5/2">The Government recognise the importance of providing flexible ways of learning and new types of qualifications to meet the wide variety of needs of learners. Credit systems, which make it possible to break off and start again without having to repeat learning, will become increasingly important for part-time higher education students. We are building on the potential of e-learning to offer interactive, individualised learning at the pace, place and level most suited to the learner. The new foundation degrees are inherently flexible in how they are delivered: not only full-time or part-time at an institution but also through distance learning or in the workplace.</p>

	<p pid=".563W.2/1">All local education authorities (LEAs) with operational Schools PFI schemes contribute towards the costs of these schemes. Funding from this Department is intended to meet the capital repayment element of the unitary charge. LEAs must meet the facilities management element. They do this by recouping some of the funds which would otherwise have been devolved for this purpose to schools involved in the project, and by using their own resources.</p>
	<p pid=".563W.2/2">The contract for a Schools PFI scheme is usually between the LEA and the contractor. The DfES is not a party to the contract, so we are not aware of the unitary charge that the LEA would have agreed to pay each year. The size of the charge will of course be dependent on the overall value of the contract, however, a number of checks are put in place during the procurement process to try to ensure that LEAs agree deals that are affordable and offer good value for money.</p>

	<p pid=".566W.2/1">We said in the White Paper, &quot;The Future of Higher Education&quot;, that graduates enjoy different returns from different courses and according to the institution attended. Recent research found a 44 percentage point difference in average returns between graduates from institutions at the two extremes of the graduate pay scale. No specific estimates have been made of the distribution of lifetime earnings premia by type of course or institution attended, for either first-degree graduates or post-graduates. However, we will be publishing research evidence later this year on how lifetime earnings premia might differ according to institution attended.</p>
	<p pid=".566W.2/2">Academic research on graduate returns at a point in time shows that while higher education is a good investment for the average graduate, returns do vary according to degree subject. External research also indicates that graduate earnings vary according to the institution attended. These findings suggest that graduate lifetime earnings differentials may be influenced by degree subject and institution attended.</p>

I shall make arrangements for a copy of the &quot;Agreement between the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation and the European Union on the Security of Information&quot; and a document &quot;Defining the EU Capability Development Mechanism&quot; to be placed in the Library of the House.</p>

	<p pid=".581W.2/2">Whenever the Ministry of Defence becomes aware that a recruitment agency is advertising for staff holding a security clearance to work on MOD protectively marked contracts, we write to the agency concerned advising them to stop the practice. The agency is told that the wording used is incorrect, discriminatory and counter to Government policy, and could potentially place the company in breach of equal opportunities legislation. The agency is also requested to use more suitable wording, as suggested by MOD, when advertising job vacancies, making it clear that the successful applicant will require to be security cleared prior to confirmation of their appointment.</p>

	<p pid=".581W.5/1">As at May 2003, there are 119 United Kingdom military personnel deployed to Sierra Leone. Of these, 21 personnel form the UK contribution to the UN Mission in Sierra Leone (UNAMSIL), and 98 personnel form the core of the UK-led International Military Advisory and Training Team (IMATT). At the peak of the UK's military deployment in February 2001 there were around 907 personnel in Sierra Leone.</p>
	<p pid=".581W.5/2">The key objective for UNAMSIL is to assist the Government of Sierra Leone in the consolidation of peace and security. Progress is regularly reviewed against a range of benchmarks relating to the security situation in Sierra Leone, and wider governance, justice and human rights issues. These benchmarks are set down in the Fifteenth Report of the UN Secretary General on Sierra Leone of <phrase class="date" code="2002-09-05">5 September 2002</phrase>. UNAMSIL drawdown is driven by achievement of these benchmarks rather than by a set timetable. As a consequence of progress made, UNAMSIL started a phased drawdown in September 2002. Phase One of the drawdown is now complete, with Phase Two to be completed shortly. This will see a reduction in troop strength to around 13,000.</p>

	<p pid=".582W.2/1">A United Kingdom-led International Military Advisory and Training Team (IMATT) continues to help build the Republic of Sierra Leone armed forces into an effective, professional and democratically accountable force and to improve the capacity of the Sierra Leone MOD. The IMATT currently involves 114 personnel, comprising 98 UK military personnel plus a number of internationals. In addition, there are two UK Ministry of Defence civil servants serving in the Sierra Leone MOD.</p>
	<p pid=".582W.2/2">The UK is also making a major contribution to the restructuring of the Sierra Leone Police (SLP) through training and the provision and repair of police infrastructure. Training for the SLP is being provided under a scheme, managed by the Department for International Development, worth some &pound;13 million over three years. In all, about 4,000 police officers, from senior management to new recruits, have received some form of training under the project.</p>
	<p pid=".582W.2/3">In preparation for the gradual withdrawal of the UN Mission in Sierra Leone(UNAMSIL), the Government of Sierra Leone plan to recruit some 3,000 additional officers. The refurbishment and extension of the SLP training school is being paid for by DFID to enable training of these additional officers. The UK has also nominated 10 civilian police officers to UNAMSIL to work on capacity building programmes.</p>
	<p pid=".582W.2/4">The UK's reconciliation and reconstruction projects in Sierra Leone are carried out through the Community Reintegration Programme (CRP) and the ReAct Programme. Both of these provide community reintegration activities in the form of job opportunities and short-term skills training and education for ex-combatants. The activities are community-based, with ex-combatants working alongside other war-affected people. The CRP, to which &pound;14.4 million has been committed by DFID, operates in the northern region of Sierra Leone; ReAct operates in the eastern region of Sierra Leone and is co-funded by DFID and UNHCR. The DFID contribution to ReAct is &pound;1.8 million.</p>

It is hoped that all should have returned by the end of July 2003. There are some additional singleton appointments undertaken by medical personnel who will leave theatre as and when their parent Regular unit leaves theatre. TA personnel will be able to return to their employment with the national health service once they have been through the demobilisation process and taken their post operational tour leave which is commensurate with the period of their mobilised service.</p>

	<p pid=".600W.8/1">We are aware that the summer months can cause particular problems for patients with asthma because of factors such as high pollen counts. This phenomenon is however, well understood by both clinicians and patients so we do not feel that specific extra guidance is needed to help manage this. Patients with asthma are able to access the full range of national health service support services in both primary and secondary care settings throughout the entire year.</p>
	<p pid=".600W.8/2">We have welcomed guidance from the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) on inhalers for children under five in September 2000 and for older children, in the age range five to 15, on <phrase class="date" code="2002-04-11">11 April 2002</phrase>. The NICE recommendations provide clear evidence based on guidance on the most suitable inhalers for children.</p>
	<p pid=".600W.8/3">A new general medical services contract agreement was launched on <phrase class="date" code="2003-02-21">Friday 21 February 2003</phrase> which, if accepted by the profession, will lead to an unprecedented level of new investment in general practice to deliver a wider range of high quality services with better clinical outcomes for all patients.</p>
	<p pid=".600W.8/4">The national service framework (NSF) for children is being developed to set standards for the care of children and young people to ensure they have access to good quality care. While it is not the intention to look at specific conditions in the NSF, it has been agreed that asthma, as one of the most common childhood conditions, should be used as one of the exemplars which will accompany the main NSF report. These will illustrate how the standards should be applied to ensure that services delivered to children are effective and meet their needs.</p>
	<p pid=".600W.8/5">I welcome the publication of the National Asthma Campaign's Ten Point Charter. Those general practitioners who participate in the chronic disease management programme, around 93 per cent. of all GPs, are already providing services that help to meet many of the charter rights.</p>

In July, health organisations will be invited to bid for development funds to set up centres of expertise to develop clinical care, support clinical research and expand education and training programmes for health care professionals and to establish satellite community multidisciplinary teams.

	<p pid=".608W.8/1">The main Government agency for research into the causes and treatment of disease is the Medical Research Council (MRC), which receives its funding from the Department of Trade and Industry via the Office of Science and Technology. The MRC published a research strategy for chronic fatigue syndrome/myalgic encephalomyelitis (CFS/ME) on <phrase class="date" code="2003-05-01">1 May</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".608W.8/2">The strategy will enable researchers and funders to develop research proposals on all aspects of this illness. It was developed by an independent research advisory group in response to a request from the Chief Medical Officer, and was informed by contributions from pstients, carers, charities, researchers and clincians via a consultation exercise in summer 2002.</p>
	<p pid=".608W.8/3">The MRC has announced two initiatives in response to the strategy. One is a notice to the research community welcoming high quality proposals across the entire spectrum of CFS/ME research. The other is a scientific meeting to discuss the potential to use existing UK resources and infrastructures to undertake epidemiological studies in this country. In addition, the MRC has just announced funding for two trials that will look at the effectiveness of various treatments for CFS/ME. The results of these trials will help patients and their doctors to choose the best treatment. These complementary trials will assess a variety of treatments and in doing so will both help address important issues for those with CFS/ME.</p>
	<p pid=".608W.8/4">The first trial known as PACE (Pacing, Activity and Cognitive behaviour therapy: a randomised Evaluation) will make the first assessment of a treatment choice popular with patients called 'Pacing'. The second trial, known as FINE, (Fatigue Intervention by Nurses Evaluation) will test two different treatments that are particularly suited to helping reach those who are too ill to attend a specialist clinic as patients will be treated by nurses in their own homes.</p>

	<p pid=".613W.8/2">At the last board meeting on <phrase class="date" code="2003-05-01">1 May 2003</phrase>, the North Cheshire Hospitals National Health Service Trust reported the projected deficit for 2002&ndash;03 as being &pound;5.8 million. In order to ensure that the trust did not fail in its statutory duty to achieve financial balance, the Cheshire and Merseyside Strategic Health Authority (CMSHA) has made provision to cover the deficit with repayable brokerage.</p>
	<p pid=".613W.8/3">The CMSHA has asked for revised recovery plans from the North Cheshire NHS organisations, as the plans, agreed in June 2002 and revised in October 2002, were not felt to be working. The CMSHA has also asked the Audit Commission to review these financial recovery plans in order to identify the key factors contributing to the deficit, as well as to assess the effectiveness of the corporate governance arrangements of the organisations concerned. The Audit Commission is due to conclude its work in the near future.</p>

	<p pid=".617W.0/2">There have been significant increases in the number of stroke physicians, the proportion of patients being treated in specialist stroke units and the number of patients returning home following hospital treatment. There have been important improvements in care. For example, 83 per cent. of patients are receiving brain scans to improve diagnosis, which is more than ever before, and over the last four years, the proportion of hospitals with specialist stroke units has gone up from 45 per cent. to 73 per cent. We also know that 83 per cent. of the hospitals already now have plans to have a specialist stroke service in place by April 2004.</p>

	<p pid=".621W.9/1">The Government is committed to improve the quality of the built environment and we are working with a wide range of partners to deliver this through a number of policy initiatives and actions. The Government's recently launched Sustainable Communities action programme is central to achieving this. Through Sustainable Communities and as part of the wider agenda to raise the quality of life in our communities, we are providing a total of &pound;41 million over the next three years to support, among a range of initiatives, the work of the Commission for Architecture and the Built Environment to improve the design standards of buildings and spaces and the skills needed to deliver this. We are also promoting the establishment of &quot;design champions&quot; at both regional and local level and are working with the construction industry to develop the Design Quality Indicator (DQI) system that was launched in July 2002. Government planning policies have for some time made it clear that when submitting planning proposals applicants should be able to demonstrate how they have taken account of the need for good design. PPG1 &quot;General Policy and Principles&quot;, for example, underlines that &quot;good design should be the aim of all those involved in the development process and should be encouraged everywhere&quot;. The policy is supported by good practice guidance, &quot;By Design&quot;. The Government will restate its commitment to good design when it updates PPG1.</p>
	<p pid=".621W.9/2">In London, we are continuing to promote good quality higher density development through our planning powers, local authority development plans and we are working with the mayor, CABE, English Heritage and others to promote better design through good practice and pilot projects. We are also committed to establishing regional centres of excellence to promote best practice in the design and management of public spaces.</p>

	<p pid=".630W.2/1">As at November 2002, there were 17,800 pensioners receiving a key benefit in the Warrington South constituency. 3,500 people are aged 80 and over and if they are entitled to a winter fuel payment from this winter they will also be entitled to the additional payment announced in the Budget. There were 6,700 people aged 75 and over receiving a key benefit who would therefore be eligible to receive a free TV licence. 2,400 people received an average weekly minimum income guarantee of &pound;43.46.</p>

This is a work based development programme that aims to provide disabled people with their first step into a chosen career. As part of this programme we currently have two graduates on six month placements.

	<p pid=".639W.2/1">Recorded crime figures do not include details of whether drugs are an aggravating factor in offences, for example for burglary or robbery. Information on the number of recorded drug offences are available only at police force level. This information is not published at Basic Command Unit, or Crime and Disorder Reduction Partnership level.</p>
	<p pid=".639W.2/2">Percentages of drug offences recorded for the 39 police force areas in England are given in the following table.</p>
	<p pid=".639W.2/3">There was a change in counting rules for recorded crime on <phrase class="date" code="1998-04-01">1 April 1998</phrase>, which would have the tendency to increase the number of offences counted. Prior to April 1998, the only drug offences recorded were 'Trafficking in controlled drugs', which were recorded within the Other Offences Group. After this date the Home Office Counting Rules were revised and expanded to include the additional drug categories of 'Possession of controlled drugs', and 'Other drug offences'. Numbers of offences for years before and after this date, and figures calculated from them, are therefore not directly comparable.</p>
	<p pid=".639W.2/4">As a result of some police forces adopting the principles of the National Crime Recording Standard (NCRS) prior to its national introduction across England and Wales on <phrase class="date" code="2002-04-01">1 April 2002</phrase>, percentages given for 2000&ndash;01 or 2001&ndash;02 may not be comparable with other years.</p>

	<p pid=".642W.0/2">Members of the working group were selected either as representatives of Government Departments with a particular interest in consulting the faith communities, or as individuals from the faith communities with significant personal experience of having been involved in such consultations by Government. The need to restrict the group to manageable size meant that only one such individual could be included from each of the five largest faith communities, as well as two further members to represent the Black-led Churches and the smaller faith communities.</p>
	<p pid=".642W.0/3">All the faith community members of the group are members of the Inner Cities Religious Council or of organisations linked by the Inter Faith Network for the United Kingdom, or both. These highly experienced bodies are fully representative of the wide range of faith communities living in the United Kingdom. Both were consulted over the membership of the group, and both are themselves represented on it.</p>

	<p pid=".644W.2/1">The Special Priority Payment (SPP) Scheme, under which extra rewards may be paid to officers in the most difficult and demanding posts, was agreed by all parties in the Police Negotiating Board (PNB) as part of a ground-breaking package of reforms to police pay and conditions of service. The parties in PNB include representatives of the Association of Chief Police Officers, of police authorities and of the Police Federations. PNB decided that posts might qualify for a SPP where they: carry a significantly higher responsibility level than the norm for the rank; or present particular difficulties in recruitment or retention; or have specially demanding working conditions or working environments.</p>
	<p pid=".644W.2/2">PNB agreed that chief constables and police authorities should draw up a local scheme of payments in line with the national criteria. This was because PNB believed that the chief constable and police authority were best placed to decide locally which posts in their force met the national criteria. Consequently, the decision as to which posts in a given force qualify for a SPP is for the chief constable and the police authority, not for the Secretary of State. Where, therefore, a post qualifies for payment in one force but not in an adjacent force, it is due to the decision of the chief constables and police authorities of the forces concerned.</p>

	<p pid=".645W.2/1">There are no current plans to market test prisons in England or Wales. The Prison Service has, however, set up a programme of performance testing under which under-performing public sector prisons are required to deliver improvements. Failure to deliver improvements may ultimately lead to the prisons being contracted out to the private sector in a competition without a Prison Service in-house bid. Two prisons have been awarded service level agreements (Reading and Leicester) and two are being performance tested at present (Dartmoor and Liverpool); two more will be performance tested later in 2003 and a further six in 2004.</p>

	<p pid=".646W.8/1">In its White Paper, Justice for All (CM 5563) the Government said that they were developing a national strategy that would consider the availability of restorative justice across all age groups and all stages in the criminal process. The Prison Service, in conjunction with the National Probation Service, and other stakeholders, is contributing to the development of that strategy. The Government will issue a consultation document on the development of Restorative Justice in the criminal justice system during the summer.</p>
	<p pid=".646W.8/2">While awaiting the results of the consultation the Prison Service will continue to support the diverse range of restorative practices that are already taking place within prisons. The Prison Service is participating in Home Office funded pilot projects under the Crime Reduction programme which are testing the effectiveness of restorative justice at different stages, from caution through to custodial sentences. The final reconviction studies will be produced at the end of 2005 and these results will play an important role in the development of the long-term restorative justice strategy. Outside the pilots, direct victim-offender mediation work is taking place in a small number of prisons, victim awareness courses are also taking place and most prisons are involved in reparative projects where prisoners give something back to communities through activities such as Braille translation services, community artwork and refurbishment of wheelchairs.</p>

	<p pid=".649W.2/1">No statistics are gathered on the percentage of victims of crime who are kept informed of the trial date and outcome of the trial. The 1996 Victim's Charter states that, if a victim chooses, the police will give them this information. There are pilots taking place, or planned, in several parts of the country to establish better ways in which the police and the Crown Prosecution Service can keep victims better informed and to provide better services to them generally.</p>
	<p pid=".649W.2/2">One of our 2001 manifesto commitments was to legislate for a Victims of Crime Bill during the course of this Parliament. The Bill, which will be introduced as soon as parliamentary time allows, is likely to include a statutory victims' Code of Practice to replace the Victim's Charter. The Code will place some 70 to 80 obligations on criminal justice agencies to deliver specific services to victims and within prescribed deadlines. The obligations will include the police informing victims of trial dates and their outcomes. If the obligations in the Code are not delivered, victims will have an avenue of complaint to the Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration. We plan also to legislate for a Commissioner for victims, not only to oversee the effectiveness of the Code and protect victims' needs within the criminal justice system as a whole, but also to promote their interests across Government more widely, in areas such as, for example, health, housing and social security.</p>

	<p pid=".650W.2/1">For England and Wales we have made a number of proposals on juvenile offenders in the Criminal Justice Bill and the Anti-Social Behaviour Bill both of which are under consideration by this House. We believe these will help to strengthen the youth justice system's work to reduce reconvictions which is already showing good results. Our most recent results, published in February this year for offenders dealt between January and March 2001, show a 22.5 per cent. reduction in reconvictions compared to 1997. In addition, we plan to publish further proposals in the next few months new proposals in a Children's Green Paper. Youth justice in Scotland and Northern Ireland do not fall within my responsibility.</p>
	<p pid=".650W.2/2">These proposals will apply in the same way to Jarrow as to other areas. However I understand a local Youth Crime Prevention Strategy Group has been established. It is carrying out a Young People and Crime Audit which will help the development of a future local strategy.</p>

	<p pid=".652W.0/1">The National Land Information Service (NLIS) is ultimately intended to be a one stop electronic shop for information about land and property in England and Wales. It was developed and piloted in the 1990s by a group of public sector bodies led by the Land Registry. The work was then taken forward by the Local Government Information House Limited (LGIH), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Improvement and Development Agency.</p>
	<p pid=".652W.0/2">NLIS is now financially independent and receives no state aid. It comprises LGIH; a hub operated by Macdonald Dettwiler Associates (MDA); and three competing service channels, operated by NLIS Searchflow, Transaction Online and TM NLIS Search respectively. There is no NLIS board. Central Government were not a party to the contract and licence negotiations between LGIH and the hub and channel service providers and are not a party to NLIS now.</p>
	<p pid=".652W.0/3">Following criticism of the governance arrangements for NLIS in the Quinquennial Review of the Land Registry in June 2001, a Central Government Stakeholder Group (CGSG), chaired by the Land Registry, was set up to provide such assistance as central Government could to help NLIS become an established feature of the conveyancing process and to provide a means of communication between the NLIS partners and those stakeholders. We are reviewing the role of the CGSG. But the operation or governance of NLIS, the business plans of the NLIS service providers and their future viability are not matters for government. Any questions of possible infringement of competition law should be pursued with the Office of Fair Trading in the normal way. The Government continue to encourage local authorities to transfer their land and property information to electronic local land and property gazetteers so as to improve access to information.</p>
	<p pid=".652W.0/4">Since September 2001, when the commercial NLIS service was launched, neither I nor my ministerial colleagues at the Lord Chancellor's Department have received any external advice on the operation of NLIS or any representations from local authorities about its operation. In the same period, we have received a small number of letters from Members of Parliament and others commenting on a range of matters relating to the operation of NLIS.</p>

	<p pid=".653W.0/1">Public funding for the civil courts is available to applicants provided that the case is within the scope of the Community Legal Service scheme and that they satisfy the Legal Services Commission's means and merits tests for funding.</p>
	<p pid=".653W.0/2">Families bereaved by the Potters Bar rail crash have the same access to public funding as others wishing to bring, defend, or be party to, civil proceedings. Individual claims would be expected to be pursued privately if the claimant's means exceed the financial eligibility criteria for public funding. However, the Commission also has discretion to waive the upper financial eligibility limit in order to fund a case where funding relates to the generic issues in a multi-party action, where there is likely to be a significant wider public interest in doing so.</p>

	<p pid=".654W.2/1">My noble and learned Friend, the Lord Chancellor, regards Queen's Counsel as a working rank within the profession. Only lawyers who have, and are entitled to exercise, full rights of audience in the High Court or Crown Court, and who regularly appear as advocates in appropriate courts and tribunals, are eligible to apply for appointment. He also recommends to Her Majesty the Queen the appointment of a small number of lawyers who are not in private practice, but who have made a significant contribution to the law, as Queen's Counsel 'honoris causa', a purely honorary appointment.</p>
