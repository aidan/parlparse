A key element of this work is the all-island grid study involving research into the potential for renewable energy&mdash;and wind energy in particular&mdash;to be accommodated in the electricity grid systems in Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic. The study, which is due to be completed in mid-2007 will provide a firm evidence base on which to develop strategic investment decisions in relation to securing renewable sources of power.</p>
	<p pid="b.1861W.10/3">The detailed responses to the '2020 Vision' paper itself are being analysed by the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources (DCMNR) and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment (DETI) with a view to presenting the outcome to an industry forum in the new year.</p>
	<p pid="b.1861W.10/4">In addition to the '2020 Vision' work, the hon. Member will be aware that the Secretary of State's Environment and Renewable Energy Fund was launched in February 2006 with the aim of making Northern Ireland an exemplar region in renewables development. The &pound;59 million ring-fenced package is already being implemented through a number of programmes to enhance renewables actions and secure cleaner sources of power for Northern Ireland across both the public and private sectors.</p>

	<p pid="b.1870W.5/1">The European Commission's consultation paper on the impact of daylight running lights (DRL) stated that DRLs would increase the fuel consumption and CO2 emissions of a vehicle by up to 1.5 per cent. We think that this estimate is roughly correct. The impact of an EU-wide policy would be less than this; a portion of driving is at night anyway, many member states already have mandatory rules on the use of DRLs, and specially designed DRLs (rather than dipped beam headlamps) can be much more energy efficient.</p>
	<p pid="b.1870W.5/2">The UK opposes both mandatory fitment of dedicated DRLs and compulsory daytime use of dipped beam headlamps, due to concerns about increased risk to vulnerable road users (including motorcyclists), and increased costs to motorists, as well as the environmental impacts. We have expressed these concerns at international fora and will reiterate them in our response to the European Commission consultation.</p>

Transporters are required to record details of the actual journey undertaken and to explain any variations from the journey planned.</p>

	<p pid="b.1879W.11/2">The widespread availability of a CLA vaccine in GB would depend on a commercial decision by a vaccine manufacturer to apply for a Marketing Authorisation; however if CLA vaccine were to become generally available, its use could suppress clinical disease in infected flocks without eradicating infection. As vaccinated animals can transmit infection, the use of vaccine in the absence of health certification could increase the risk of spread of infection.</p>

	<p pid="b.1880W.2/1">The Government have made it clear on a number of occasions that they accept that the current arrangements for dealing with complaints against veterinary surgeons could be improved. This means looking at the scope of any complaints system, the range of actions that the regulatory body has at its disposal, and whether the system is sufficiently transparent and fair.</p>
	<p pid="b.1880W.2/2">We have received a number of ideas on how complaints against veterinary surgeons should be managed, including the appointment of an independent ombudsman. We will also look at whether better models exist for the way in which complaints against other professions are handled. These issues are being considered as part of a wider review of the existing regulatory framework for veterinary surgeons. However there is currently no set timetable for making changes to the Veterinary Surgeons Act 1966.</p>

The UK has offered forces up to a maximum of 12,500 troops, 72 combat aircraft and 18 warships plus support ships.

The UK provided a national Battlegroup on standby during the first half of 2005 and will do so again in 2008. With the Netherlands we have also offered an amphibious Battlegroup in 2010.

I am arranging for copies of this document to be placed in the Libraries of both Houses.</p>
	<p pid="b.1886W.6/2">The Government Art Collection (GAC) spends approximately &pound;130,000 from its annual Programme Vote on transport and installation in major Government buildings in the UK and all around the world, as well as the transport of works of art to and from conservators and framers. The GAC employs freelance specialist fine art transporters and installers for these jobs.</p>
	<p pid="b.1886W.6/3">It is not possible to provide a meaningful figure for the average cost of exchanging and installing an individual work of art in a Minister's office. For reasons of economy, the installation of groups of works of art in ministerial and other offices and areas in departmental buildings&mdash;such as entrance halls, waiting rooms, conference rooms, corridors, etc.&mdash;are almost always batched together in the same job. Additionally, time taken to remove and install works of art in offices may vary due to the size, weight, number and handling difficulties of individual works and physical considerations such as the type of wall involved, etc. Individual GAC staff costs would also have to be taken into consideration, to include recording all moves of works of art, assistance with initial selections of works of art, organising their transport and installation, and overseeing the installation itself.</p>

We are helping developing countries to collect data on the range and type of climate-related changes that are likely to take place in coming years. We are also helping developing country planners to interpret that data, so they can make informed decisions about how best to respond.

Afghanistan is DFID's fifth largest programme and we are Afghanistan's second largest bilateral donor, spending over &pound;100 million in 2005-06. We are focusing on: building effective state institutions; improving economic management and improving rural livelihoods. The best way to do this is by supporting Afghans themselves&mdash;which is why over 70 per cent. of our aid goes directly to the Government of Afghanistan. Afghanistan remains one of the UK's top priorities and we have provided valuable support to the Government who have made great progress over the last five years.</p>

	<p pid="b.1892W.8/1">DFID undertakes livelihoods projects, preferring to work through the Government of Afghanistan where possible. This support is essential to strengthen Government systems and build effective state institutions that will be able to continue to meet Afghanistan's development needs.</p>
	<p pid="b.1892W.8/2">In Helmand, DFID supports a number of livelihood programmes. I announced a &pound;30 million Helmand Agriculture and Rural Development Programme earlier this year. This programme aims to increase economic opportunities for the rural poor of Helmand by supporting the Government of Afghanistan in the roll-out of existing successful National Programmes in Helmand. These programmes will provide improved water and sanitation, essential small-scale rural infrastructure, greater access to small loans, improved roads and access to markets and agricultural inputs and training to the people of Helmand. Priority preliminary tasks have been undertaken: i.e. sites for road and well building have been identified; engineering surveys conducted; and the Government procurement process started. This programme will construct 200 wells in and around Lashkar Gah city by end March 2007, and 49km of road will be under construction by then. Should the security situation allow, we also expect to build a further 490 wells in four districts in central Helmand by end March 2007.</p>
	<p pid="b.1892W.8/3">Through the &pound;3 million DFID-funded Research into Alternative Livelihoods Fund (RALF), the Restorative Agriculture and Rural Economy Research Project, implemented by Mercy Corps, is working on export feasibility of grapes, tomatoes, mushrooms, eggplants and okra, and has made strong contacts with raisin importers (organic and fair-trade). The programme is evaluating at least 10 different small-scale agri-processing industries, and producing case studies of enterprises that prove to have value added. For example tomato paste. In addition the programme has introduced a simple technology for the production of mint as a herbal remedy.</p>
	<p pid="b.1892W.8/4">DFID has committed &pound;4 million to the UK Global Conflict Prevention Pool (GCPP) funding allocation of &pound;6.5 million for the delivery of quick impact projects (QIPS) in Helmand to get short-term development results and help build a platform for longer-term activities. From the total allocation, half has been committed and all will be spent by March 2007. To date, nearly fifty such projects have been funded and implemented. These funds have provided humanitarian assistance to victims of the drought, constructed permanent vehicle checkpoints to improve security, improved security around the shrine in Gereshk, reinforced the river bank walls and provided flood defences for the Bowlan bridge. A full list of UK funded QIPs under the four broad sub-headings (Reconstruction and Development, Security, Governance, and Counter Narcotics) is attached.</p>

	<p pid="b.1895W.2/1">The World Health Organisation has estimated that over 50,000 deaths in Sub-Saharan Africa in 2000 were due to climate change (World Health Report 2002). These deaths were due to diarrhoea, flood injury, malaria and malnutrition. 2 per cent. of all cases of diarrhoea and malaria and almost one fifth of cases of malnutrition during this period were attributed to climate change. In their recent report entitled &quot;The Climate of Poverty: Facts, Fears and Hope&quot;, Christian Aid estimated that 182 million people in Sub-Saharan Africa were at risk of dying from diseases directly attributable to climate change by the end of this century if temperatures rise by 6<sup>(o)</sup>C.</p>
	<p pid="b.1895W.2/2">At Gleneagles in 2005, the UK and other G8 countries acknowledged the urgent need to increase efforts to combat climate change in their own countries and in the developing world. The Department for International Development has allocated &pound;5 million over five years for work to improve the quality and availability of climate data in Africa and &pound;24 million over five years to improve the capacity of African countries to adapt to climate change by building and maintaining a body of skilled African researchers.</p>
	<p pid="b.1895W.2/3">We have funded assessments of the potential impact on health in 12 of the least developed countries' nine of which are in Africa including Sudan, Mozambique, Tanzania, Malawi, Zambia and Uganda. DFID is also the fourth largest donor to the Global Environment Facility contributing &pound;118 million between 2003-04 and 2006-07.</p>
	<p pid="b.1895W.2/4">DFID is also working with African countries to tackle the problem, through strengthening national health systems and providing targeted support to programmes against TB, malaria and other communicable diseases. In Kenya for example, DFID has funded the distribution of approximately six million insecticide-treated bed nets to protect against malaria. This year, DFID has also doubled its contribution to the Global Fund for AIDS, TB and Malaria to &pound;66 million.</p>

Where cooling cannot be avoided, designers are required to investigate systems which minimise environmental impact in terms of ozone depletion and global warming, using refrigerants with a zero ozone depletion potential (ODP) such as R134a and R66.</p>

The Frontex Management Board is currently considering its work plan and budget for 2007. Once it is finalised, we will consider the added value that UK participation could bring to planned operations and their value to the UK. We will then discuss and agree with Frontex appropriate financial and operational contributions.</p>

We note the most recent assessment by the ICTY Chief Prosecutor, Carla del Ponte, relating to Serbia, delivered on <phrase class="date" code="2007-10-16">16 October</phrase>, which stated that there remain grave deficiencies in Serbia's efforts, both at operational and political levels.

We urge all parties, in Somalia and across the region, to commit to dialogue and reject confrontation. We also urge the UIC and the Transitional Federal government to remain committed to the agreement reached in Khartoum earlier this year. Along with our international partners, we believe that the Transitional Federal Charter and the institutions created under it are the only existing mechanisms for restoring democratic governance in Somalia.</p>

	<p pid="b.1911W.2/1">We welcome the publication of the International Crisis Group report. It is a constructive input into international efforts to solve the crisis in Darfur.</p>
	<p pid="b.1911W.2/2">The UK believes that this appalling conflict is best addressed through sustained international pressure, including sanctions where appropriate. We fully back the UN sanctions currently in force&mdash;arms embargo on the Darfur region, travel ban and assets freeze against named individuals. All countries are required to implement the sanctions, including ensuring that financial institutions freeze any assets of listed individuals. We also strongly supported UN Security Council Resolution (UNSCR) 1591 which established a panel of experts to review the Darfur situation and submit recommendations on further sanctions to the Sanctions Committee. The panel reported at the end of September. We are considering with our UN Security Council partners whether further sanctions on any of the parties to the conflict will help solve it. Our priority is to press all parties to implement the Darfur Peace Agreement. A UN peacekeeping force, as foreseen in UNSCR 1706, is best placed to prevent further conflict. We are working at the UN to establish this force. We are, with our partners, pressing the government of Sudan to agree to it. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for International Development conveyed this message directly to President Bashir in Khartoum on <phrase class="date" code="2007-10-16">16 October</phrase>.</p>

	<p pid="b.1911W.5/1">The military situation in Darfur remains critical. There has been renewed fighting between Sudanese Government forces and the non-signatories to the Darfur Peace Agreement (DPA) since late August, in contravention of UN Security Council resolution 1591. This fighting has had a disastrous impact on delivery of much-needed humanitarian assistance. Over 50,000 people have been displaced since the fighting began. Some 1.9 million people are displaced in Darfur and 3.6 million need assistance to meet their basic needs. There has been a major increase in rape and gender-based violence. Many humanitarian organisations are considering pulling out altogether because of the security risk. Cross-border attacks from Darfur into Eastern Chad are also continuing, with Eastern Chad now host to some 200,000 refugees from Darfur. The UK utterly condemns this fighting and stresses urgently the need for all parties to end military attacks.</p>
	<p pid="b.1911W.5/2">A lasting solution to the Darfur conflict requires the end of military operations, the resumption of political dialogue in order to fully implement the DPA, and the deployment of a UN force. In co-ordination with UN, EU, African Union, Arab League and other partners the UK is working to achieve these aims. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for International Development set out our objectives directly to President Bashir during his visit to Sudan on <phrase class="date" code="2007-10-16">16 October</phrase>.</p>

This means that it is possible for a carer to have gross earnings well in excess of the earnings limit and still be eligible for carer's allowance.

The rules governing the provision of a MED 5 certificate do not allow it to be issued for a period of more than one month.</p>
	<p pid="b.1914W.0/3">However, a MED 3 certificate, the 'usual statement' can be given for longer periods; after the first six months, this includes 'until further notice'.</p>

	<p pid="b.1918W.2/1">A short course GCSE in citizenship studies has been offered since 2003. This was developed to give pupils the opportunity to obtain a qualification recognizing their achievements at key stage 4. Over 54,000 candidates took the GCSE in 2006, an increase from 38,000 in 2005. It remains the fastest growing GCSE subject. Due to demand from schools we have developed subject criteria for both a full course GCSE and A level with a view to examination boards offering these qualifications.</p>
	<p pid="b.1918W.2/2">There is no specified amount of time schools must teach citizenship. Schools are free to teach the subject in the way which best suits their school and pupils' circumstances. We believe this flexibility is important in maintaining the ability of schools to provide delivery of citizenship tailored to the needs of their pupils.</p>
	<p pid="b.1918W.2/3">Education can help to break down class and social barriers and plays a critical role in promoting respect and understanding. One of the aims of citizenship education is to educate pupils about appropriate forms of political engagement, legal and human rights and responsibilities and to engage in debates about political, moral and social issues. Schools are also required to teach pupils about the importance of resolving conflict fairly.</p>

	<p pid="b.1919W.3/2">There have been no discussions recently. But we continue to encourage and support developments in the HE sector that help UK graduates compete effectively in the domestic and global employment market.</p>
	<p pid="b.1919W.3/3">Bodies like the Council for Industry and Higher Education (CIHE) and Association of Graduate Recruiters (AGR) help to articulate the demands of very diverse groups of employers, and the sector skills councils are providing a detailed picture of the needs within particular sectors of the economy.</p>
	<p pid="b.1919W.3/4">In response, the HE sector continues to find practical ways to respond to the diversity of employers' needs. For example, the Higher Education Academy and its subject centres have, with CIHE's help, compiled Student Employability Profiles that map courses against the competencies and attributes graduate employers value when recruiting. Within subject centres there is active sharing of good practice in developing employability skills within degrees and other HE provision. Individual HE institutions are taking forward a range of measures designed to improve graduates employability, for example by introducing work placements, personal development planning or helping students to develop critical and interpersonal skills. In some cases employers are directly involved in the design and delivery of courses to ensure they will equip students with the necessary skills (for instance, the Ernst and Young degree in accounting, auditing and finance delivered in partnership with the Lancaster University Management School and the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Scotland).</p>

	<p pid="b.1932W.2/2">The cost of subsidising the annual rate of interest on the stock of English and Welsh maintenance loans was &pound;355 million in financial year 2005-06. This is the amount released from the interest subsidy provision as stated in the FY 05-06 departmental resource accounts. The calculation of annual cost is based on a number of variable factors, including the closing and average values of the loan stock, the cost of capital and interest added to the loans each year.</p>
	<p pid="b.1932W.2/3">Future cost estimates are calculated on a long-term basis over the lifetime of loans as part of the resource accounting and budgeting (RAB) charges, which take into account both interest subsidy and write offs. There are separate RAB charges for maintenance and fee loans. My written statement of <phrase class="date" code="2005-11-10">10 November 2005</phrase> provides future estimates of maintenance and fee loan RAB charge costs for accounting year 2006-07.</p>

The Department intends to issue a further consultation paper including a partial regulatory impact assessment once the detailed analysis work is completed. It is envisaged the outcome of the further consultation will determine whether BT continues to pay non-domestic rates for unbundled local loops or whether the non-domestic rates liability for the loops will shift to local loop unbundling operators.</p>

	<p pid="b.1938W.5/1">The simplified building energy model (SBEM) was developed to conform to the emerging European standards for energy calculations and therefore it has incorporated those energy flows for which procedures have been developed in the draft European Standards (prENs).</p>
	<p pid="b.1938W.5/2">The impact of thermal mass on energy demand is included in the energy calculation as far as its impact on normal heating and cooling strategies are concerned. SBEM does not address night cooling strategies because this is difficult in a monthly calculation method like SBEM. It was always recognised that certain design features would not be included in early versions of SBEM, and that is why the Government included in the overall national calculation methodology the option to use more detailed hourly simulation models, which can address features such as night cooling. This means that options exist whereby any design strategy can be assessed in terms of its contribution at achieving compliance with part L.</p>
	<p pid="b.1938W.5/3">The SBEM calculation method has been developed in close discussion with industry who have been provided with beta test versions and invited to test the tool and provide feedback on their experience. The tool has also been used on a number of case studies in both this country and abroad.</p>

	<p pid="b.1950W.5/1">Under agreements governing the application of VAT reliefs throughout the EU, successive Governments have agreed with European partners not to extend any existing VAT zero rates or introduce any new ones. The scope of the exemptions from VAT is similarly limited by European VAT agreements.</p>
	<p pid="b.1950W.5/2">These agreements do make reduced VAT rates of not less than five per cent. available in strictly limited areas. However, there is no reduced rate available that could be applied to all managing agreements between housing associations, regardless of the services carried out under these agreements.</p>
	<p pid="b.1950W.5/3">Where VAT reduced rates are available under European agreements, we have applied them sparingly and only where they offer the most cost-effective and best targeted support for our social objectives when compared with other policy instruments.</p>
	<p pid="b.1950W.5/4">In relation to housing, reduced VAT rates have, to date, been targeted in areas where a VAT reduction would have the greatest effect on the regeneration and renewal of the UK housing stock. For example, the Government have applied a reduced VAT rate for certain residential conversions, and on the renovation of housing that has been empty for more than three years. These VAT reductions are aimed at supporting better use of the existing housing stock and helping to bring vacant homes back into use.</p>

	<p pid="b.1951W.5/1">22 exemptions from inheritance tax for heritage assets were granted in the two years 2004-05 and 2005-06. 19 exemptions covered a total of 957 pre-eminent chattels, one exemption was for a historic house with 246 historically associated chattels, and two exemptions were for scenic land.</p>
	<p pid="b.1951W.5/2">Section 31 Inheritance Tax Act 1984 requires the public access to be reasonable. HM Revenue and Customs assesses what is reasonable on a case by case basis, on advice as appropriate from the relevant Government heritage advisory agencies. HM Revenue and Customs publishes guidance on their website about the criteria which apply to the public access condition in relation to objects of national etc. interest: <a href="http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/ihtmanual/Annex.htm">http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/ihtmanual/ Annex.htm</a> and the heritage advisory agencies provide detailed recommendations as regards land and buildings and their historically associated contents.</p>
	<p pid="b.1951W.5/3">Changes to improve the public access criterion were made by Finance Act 1998 so that it was reviewable and could no longer be satisfied by offering access only by prior appointment. The 1998 Finance Act also enabled agreements made in the past to be reviewed. Variation is by agreement between HM Revenue and Customs and the owner, but with recourse to an independent tribunal if agreement cannot be reached. HM Revenue and Customs reviews agreements at least every five years.</p>

	<p pid="b.1957W.5/3">The voluntary sector's irrecoverable VAT costs have been considered by the Government in two major reviews since 1997. In the course of these reviews it was not possible to find a VAT solution that was practical, efficient, affordable, well-targeted and based on principle. Therefore, the Government have focused their support for charitable giving outside the VAT system, for example through gift aid, under which charities can claim the equivalent of 28p for every &pound;1 donated. In 2005-06 the Government repaid &pound;728 million to charities under this scheme.</p>

	<p pid="b.1957W.8/2" class="italic"> Letter from Karen Dunnell, dated <phrase class="date" code="2006-10-24">24 October 2006</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="b.1957W.8/3" class="indent">As National Statistician, I have been asked to reply to your recent Parliamentary Question what the (a) average wage for (i) full-time male, (ii) full-time female, (iii) part time male and (iv) part time female employees and (b) average household income for working age households was for working age households was in (A) the London Borough of Haringey area and (B) across London in (1) cash and (2) constant price terms in each of the last 10 years. (96654).</p>
	<p pid="b.1957W.8/4" class="indent">Currently average earnings are estimated from the Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings (ASHE), and are provided for employees on adult rates of pay whose pay was unaffected by absence during the pay period. This is the standard definition used for ASHE. The ASHE does not collect data on the self employed and people who do unpaid work.</p>
	<p pid="b.1957W.8/5" class="indent">I have attached tables containing statistics on earnings from the ASHE for the years 1997-2005 for both the London Borough of Haringey and the Government Office Region of London. The second set of table shows these earnings statistics expressed in 2005 prices by uprating with the Retail Price Index (RPI).</p>
	<p pid="b.1957W.8/6" class="indent">Average household income for working age households by council area is not available. Household income statistics for all households in the UK, based on the Family Resources Survey, are produced by the Department of Work and Pensions. Additionally the Office for National Statistics has produced statistics for wards for 2001-02 only. These estimates are based on a statistical model and are experimental statistics&mdash;they have been developed in accordance with the principles set out in the National Statistics Code of Practice but are not accredited as National Statistics.</p>
	<p pid="b.1957W.8/7" class="indent">The ASHE, carried out in April of each year, is the most comprehensive source of earnings information in the United Kingdom. It is a one per cent sample of all employees who are members of pay-as-you-earn (PAYE) schemes, but because of its sampling frame, it has difficulty capturing data on people with very low pay. It is therefore likely to under-represent relatively low paid staff earning below the tax threshold.</p>

Waits for audiological diagnostics are covered by the 13-week stage of treatment diagnostic milestone to be reached by March 2007 as part of the drive to reduce waits towards the December 2008 referral to treatment waiting time target of 18 weeks, the milestone is not itself a target.

	<p pid="b.1961W.2/11">Cane Hill Hospital is included in the portfolio of properties to transfer to English Partnerships as part of a wider agreement with the Department for Communities and Local Government to support the Government's sustainable communities programme. In April 2005, English Partnerships took over responsibility for managing the site and paying for security. They have subsequently reviewed and increased the security arrangements. The increase in the costs reflects this review.</p>

	<p pid="b.1962W.5/1">The initial log-on to the choose and book application at the start of the day includes security and access controls as specified by the British Medical Association. The initial log-on session takes around 17 seconds and is only undertaken once at the start of the session. This is an important step in validating the credentials of the person accessing the system and helps to protect patient confidentiality. To complete the end-to-end booking process takes 48 seconds on average, if local infrastructure meets the minimum specified requirements and has been configured correctly.</p>

	<p pid="b.1964W.8/1">The numbers of primary care dentists on open national health service (NHS) contracts are collected and published quarterly. The latest information shows that there were 19,462 dentists (performers) on open NHS contracts as at <phrase class="date" code="2006-06-30">30 June 2006</phrase> in England.</p>
	<p pid="b.1964W.8/2">The final workforce information under the old contractual arrangements (as at <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-31">31 March 2006</phrase>) showed that there were 21,111 dentists on open NHS contracts in England.</p>
	<p pid="b.1964W.8/3">This comparison does not provide a reliable guide to the level of NHS dental services available. This depends not only on numbers of dentists but also, more importantly, on the amount of NHS work that they carry out. The aforementioned figures are consistent with the Department's estimate that around one in 10 dentists chose not to take up new NHS contracts from <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-01">1 April 2006</phrase>, but management information indicates that these dentists carried out only around 4 per cent. of NHS dental services. Since <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-01">1 April 2006</phrase>, primary care trusts have commissioned significant additional levels of NHS dentistry, more than making up for the 4 per cent. of services associated with dentists who did not take up new contracts.</p>

	<p pid="b.1967W.3/1">Progress on reducing health inequalities in England is measured against the public service agreement (PSA) target and the 12 headline indicators set out in the national health inequalities strategy, the Programme for Action. The most recent report, the Status Report on the Programme for Action, published in August 2005, shows that the gap in life expectancy and infant mortality has continued to widen since the target baseline. The life expectancy gap has increased by 1 per cent. for males and 8 per cent. for females. The gap in infant mortality has increased from 13 per cent. to 19 per cent. The 12 national headline indicators monitor those programmes and policies that are expected to make a significant impact on health inequalities. The report shows no change for most indicators but early progress in three key areas:</p>
	<p pid="b.1967W.3/2" class="indent">reductions in child poverty;</p>
	<p pid="b.1967W.3/3" class="indent">improvements in housing quality; and</p>

A further four areas are on track to narrow the gap for males or females. The remaining two areas are currently off track to meet the 2010 target.</p>

	<p pid="b.1968W.0/1">On infant mortality, the latest figures confirm the previously reported trend for England that, despite continuing improvements in infant mortality rates among all groups, the relative gap between routine and manual groups and the population as a whole has widened over recent years since the target baseline. The latest data, for 2002-04, show the infant mortality rate for the whole population (for all those with valid social class) was 4.9 deaths per 1,000 live births, compared to 5.9 per 1,000 for those in routine and manual groups. The gap in the rate between routine and manual groups and the population as a whole was 19 per cent. in 2002-04, compared with 13 per cent. in the baseline period of 1997-99. This gap has remained unchanged since 2001-03.</p>
	<p pid="b.1968W.0/2">The infant mortality target is a national target. The Department is exploring ways of interpreting historical data to try and assess progress on the infant mortality target at local level and is not routinely monitored at local level.</p>
	<p pid="b.1968W.0/3">Life expectancy has increased for both males and females for England as a whole but it has improved more slowly in the spearhead group of local authority areas with the worst health and deprivation indicators. In England, average life expectancy for males is 76.6 and for females 80.9, in the spearhead group it is 74.6 for males and 79.4 for females. The slower rate of improvement in has led to a widening of the relative gap in life expectancy between England and the spearhead group. The latest data for 2002-04, show that the average life expectancy in the Spearhead Group was 2.60 per cent. lower than the England average for males, and 1.90 per cent. lower than the England average for females. Therefore, the relative gap has widened by one per cent. for men and eight per cent. for women since the baseline, 1995-97.</p>
	<p pid="b.1968W.0/4">Five of the 11 spearhead local authority areas covered by the London strategic health authority are making sufficient progress to narrow the life expectancy gap for both men and women in line with target of reducing the gap by 10 per cent. by 2010. A further four areas are on track to narrow the gap for males or females. The remaining two areas are currently off track to meet the 2010 target.</p>
	<p pid="b.1968W.0/5">The London borough of Newham is on track to narrow the gap for males but not females.</p>

	<p pid="b.1972W.5/1">NHS Blood and Transplant (NHSBT), of which the National Blood Service (NBS) is an operating division, is currently developing a strategic plan. This will address how NHSBT must adapt to the challenges it faces in a rapidly changing health service and to continue to deliver the high quality services that patients need. This strategy is due to be presented to the board later this year, and therefore no decisions have been made yet.</p>
	<p pid="b.1972W.5/2">However, one of the draft proposals is for the NBS to consolidate testing and processing into three main centres. These draft proposals will not impact upon the service to hospitals and there are no proposals to close any blood donation sessions. The NBS will continue to provide critical services to hospitals (such as continuing to have a network of local blood banks to meet orders for blood) and is looking to broaden the choice of places where people can donate.</p>
	<p pid="b.1972W.5/3">The NBS employs 372 whole time equivalents in Newcastle, including those out-posted staff on mobile blood collection teams.</p>

	<p pid="b.1981W.2/1">A number of hospital trusts and primary care trusts have estimated the relationship between the spending on turnaround and the savings made. These indicate that the average spend as a percentage of in-year savings is 3 per cent. The majority of the savings are recurrent and so will be made in future financial savings while the spend on turnaround is usually entirely one-off expenditure. These estimates have been based upon a small sample group and therefore must be treated with caution.</p>

	<p pid="b.1983W.2/1">Awareness of the Welfare Food Scheme has been promoted to pregnant women in a number of ways. The booklet entitled 'Free Milk for pregnant women' is widely available in doctors' surgeries, health clinics, Job Centre Plus offices, Citizens Advice Bureaus as well as through health visitors and midwives. In addition, posters promoting this scheme have also been made widely available. All relevant Department of Health publications refer to the availability of free milk for pregnant women.</p>
	<p pid="b.1983W.2/2">The Welfare Food Scheme will become the Healthy Start scheme in November this year. Under Healthy Start, there will be enhanced promotion of the availability of Healthy Start vouchers for all eligible pregnant women including pregnant women under 18. Health professionals will receive an information pack to help them signpost the scheme to relevant families, and help them get the most out of the scheme.</p>

	<p pid="b.1983W.5/1">The proportion of eligible pregnant women claiming free vitamins cannot be estimated, as there has not been a dedicated women's vitamin supplement available under the Welfare Food Scheme for several years. Pregnant women have been directed to their GP to obtain a prescription for vitamins, if this is required.</p>
	<p pid="b.1983W.5/2">Free Healthy Start vitamin supplements for beneficiaries of the scheme are expected to be available for children in late 2006 and for women in mid 2007.</p>
	<p pid="b.1983W.5/3">Women's vitamin tablets will be offered to beneficiaries who are pregnant or have recently had a baby. This vitamin supplement will be provided to women for up to 12 months following the birth of their baby. Children will be entitled to vitamin drops from six months to four years under Healthy Start.</p>

An individual will continue to be entitled to request a subject access request under the Data Protection Act to review their record; in addition, the Government have indicated that they intend to introduce an online facility where, subject to secure remote authentication, an individual will be able to review their record and thus, ensure that it is accurate. Should an individual notice an error on their record, they will be able to contact the Identity and Passport Service through a number of different channels to rectify the error, subject to secure remote authentication.

	<p pid="b.2001W.0/1">Sir Michael Ogden QC was independent Assessor of compensation for miscarriages of justice from February 1978 to July 1989, succeeding Sir Walker Carter, who had discharged these duties since 1957. Sir Michael was formally appointed to the role in November 1985 and was appointed under section 133 of the Criminal Justice Act 1988 in November 1988. Sir David Calcutt QC succeeded Sir Michael Ogden on <phrase class="date" code="1989-07-27">27 July 1989</phrase>, and was re-appointed in July 1994 and July 1999. Lord Brennan assumed the role on <phrase class="date" code="2001-07-27">27 July 2001</phrase>. He remains in post, having been re-appointed by the Home Secretary on <phrase class="date" code="2007-07-27">27 July</phrase> this year for a second five-year term. No further competition for the post is intended until Lord Brennan's appointment is due to come to an end.</p>
	<p pid="b.2001W.0/2">I have placed copies of Sir David Calcutt's and Lord Brennan's terms and conditions of appointment in the Library. It has not so far been possible to trace those relating to Sir Michael Ogden.</p>
	<p pid="b.2001W.0/3">The only appointment that was subject to formal competition arrangements was Lord Brennan's. This was run in accordance with the guidance issued by the Office of the Commissioner for Public Appointments, and in partnership with Capita RAS. It was advertised in The Lawyer, The Law Society Gazette, and Counsel magazine, and on the Top Jobs and Home Office internet sites. The 57 applications were assessed against the requirements of Schedule 12 to the Criminal Justice Act 1988 and the job specification. An initial sift was undertaken by independent assessors appointed by Capita RAS, and the five shortlisted candidates were interviewed by a panel comprising Mr. David Cooke (the then Deputy Director of the Criminal Policy Group in the Home Office, who chaired the panel), Ms Petra Laidlaw (an independent member provided by Capita RAS), and Sir David Calcutt.</p>
	<p pid="b.2001W.0/4">The Assessor's fees are paid, per case, at Band C of the Cabinet Office's Fees for Judicial Appointment and Appointments to Tribunals, Inquiries and Appeal Boards. At the request of Sir David Calcutt, an additional, special daily fee rate was introduced on <phrase class="date" code="1992-08-01">1 August 1992</phrase> in respect of more complex cases. A table showing those rates follows. On <phrase class="date" code="2006-07-27">27 July 2006</phrase> a revised fee structure was implemented, under which Lord Brennan is paid &pound;360 per case for interim assessments and advice cases, &pound;500 per case for straightforward final assessments, and &pound;1,000 per day for complex cases.</p>

	<p pid="b.2004W.3/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="b.2004W.3/2">The need for medium secure psychiatric provision varies across England and Wales and there are no specific target numbers for units in each county. Government funding has been provided to support an increase in medium secure psychiatric beds in recent years as outlined in the NHS plan. The onus now rests with the commissioners of secure psychiatric services, who are expected to commission an appropriate number of medium secure psychiatric beds to meet the demand for such beds for the population that they cover.</p>
