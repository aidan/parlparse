	<p pid=".822W.14/1">I continue to play a role on international climate change discussions and negotiations on behalf of my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister. I work to foster effective relationships internationally at the highest political level. The UK's negotiating positions for international negotiations on climate change are agreed through the Cabinet Committee on the Environment, which I chair. The lead Department for climate change is DEFRA, which retains policy responsibility for international negotiations and implementation of the UK's policies. My office works closely with them and with other Departments with a key interest on strategic and cross-departmental issues.</p>

	<p pid=".824W.12/1">Indications of small original fabrication imperfections discovered during routine ultrasonic inspection of the Reactor Pressure Vessel (RPV) in HMS Sceptre identified the need for more detailed analysis to support the existing safety case for reactor plant operation. Inspection of Sceptre will be undertaken as part of her refit at Rosyth Dockyard. While imperfections have not been identified in either Sovereign or Superb, they have similar Reactor Pressure Vessel design. An acceptable safety case was produced for Superb and she has now returned to operations, pending further inspection later this year. Precautionary inspection of Sovereign is now taking place during her on-going maintenance at Clyde Submarine Base. The time scale and cost of work to return Sceptre and Sovereign to operations is subject to acceptable inspection results and the complexity of the associated safety case, so cannot be provided with accuracy at this stage.</p>

	<p pid=".829W.9/1">The European Council agreed at Helsinki in December 1999 that EU member states should be able by 2003, where NATO as a whole is not engaged, to deploy military forces, capable of conducting the full range crisis management operations known as the Petersberg tasks. These include humanitarian and rescue tasks; peacekeeping tasks; and tasks of combat forces in crisis management, including peace making. The European Council at Laeken in December last year agreed that the EU is now able to conduct some crisis- management operations within this definition. The EU will be progressively more able to take on increasingly demanding operations as the assets and capabilities available to it continue to develop and improve. Decisions to launch and participate in operations will be taken by national governments, on a case by case basis, in light of the circumstances at the time.</p>

Topmast is also planned to contribute to the reduction of overstretch and the achievement of manpower balance. Following successful trials, Topmast will be rolled out on a phased basis beginning in April 2002. Topmast has already received publicity within the Naval Service, and a comprehensive communication and information programme will ensure that members of the service are fully aware of its purpose and impact.</p>

	<p pid=".833W.8/1">The Ptarmigan system continues to meet the operational requirement for which it was originally procured. In response to the changing and wide ranging demands now placed upon the armed forces, a number of Ptarmigan enhancements are being procured to ensure the system remains fully effective in the modern environment. Improvements include an enhancement to the mobile communications capability and an update of the Electronic Repair Vehicle. Post design services tasks, such as generator replacement, also continue to ensure Ptarmigan remains fully effective. In the longer term, the Army's trunk communication's requirement will be met by project Falcon, due to replace Ptarmigan from 2006&ndash;07.</p>

	<p pid=".835W.5/1">The Ministry of Defence is seeking to modernise arrangements for warship support and achieve best value for money for the Defence budget. At the Clyde, as at the other Naval Bases at Devonport and Portsmouth, we have received proposals from the Dockyard Companies for potential partnering arrangements. We have also received alternative proposals from the Trades Unions for the pursuit of efficiencies at the Naval Bases. All options are currently being considered, and decisions on the way ahead will be made in the near future. We have no plans to privatise the facilities.</p>
	<p pid=".835W.5/2">The Naval Base Commander will remain in charge of the operation of the Base and in control of all the outputs. The proposals for partnering at the Clyde would entail Babcock Rosyth Defence Ltd. taking on the management of engineering support, facilities and estates management and certain logistics functions at the Naval Base. There would be no change to the overall operation of the Base. The proposals will not affect nuclear authorisation, or safety and security at the Naval Base.</p>

	<p pid=".836W.9/1">The main issues identified by the Aircrew Retention Review as to why aircrew leave the Services were:</p>
	<p pid=".836W.9/2" class="indent">(a) The pull of a buoyant external employment market (while current difficulties being experienced by the civil sector may result in a short-term reduction in the pull factor, long-term solutions will be needed.</p>
	<p pid=".836W.9/3" class="indent">(b) A push effect arising from a diminution in faith/belief in the influence of senior leadership (this phenomenon has also been detected by other nations' armed forces).</p>
	<p pid=".836W.9/4" class="indent">(c) A host of &quot;quality of life&quot; issues, including the level of operational tempo and some career-management issues.</p>
	<p pid=".836W.9/5" class="indent">(d) The push of a gratuity/pension being available should aircrew decide to leave in their late 30s.</p>
	<p pid=".836W.9/6">Action to address some of these issues was already in hand (such as the creation of a Defence Leadership Centre); for others it will take longer to make an impact but, under the direction of the Defence Management Board, plans are being drawn up to address each of the issues raised by aircrew. In some cases the retention-negative factors are an integral part of life in the armed forces and, as an acknowledgement of this, Service pay is augmented by the &quot;X&quot; factor (currently 13 per cent.).</p>

	<p pid=".837W.6/1">We are committed to equality of opportunity in the armed forces, and all posts are open to women unless there are specific reasons to the contrary. Women are not presently permitted to serve in submarines because of medical concerns for the safety of a foetus and hence of the mother. These concerns arise from the contaminants which build up in the atmosphere of our submarines, all of which are nuclear powered and may remain submerged for up to 90 days for operational reasons. These contaminants include carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide and about 30 other substances potentially harmful to a foetus. Medical studies have shown that these contaminants may occur at levels which, while they are not harmful to adults, exceed those considered safe for the foetus of a pregnant woman. There is no reliable test for detecting pregnancy in its very early stages.</p>
	<p pid=".837W.6/2">The medical advice on this issue has recently been subjected to independent review by the Defence Scientific Advisory Council and the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists; both have supported the key conclusions of the earlier research work. Accordingly, I have agreed that women should continue to be excluded from service in submarines for the time being. However, the medical research and advice will be kept under active review, together with other relevant factors such as the experience of other Navies.</p>

	<p pid=".839W.3/1">Responsibility for addressing the international trade in bushmeat lies with HM Customs and Excise, who implement the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES), and with the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA).</p>
	<p pid=".839W.3/2">In this context, DFID is involved in various initiatives that contribute to the conservation of wild animals and their habitats (see Annexe 1). We fund projects and studies that address sustainable forest management and bushmeat production where this is key to tackling poverty. We currently fund three projects in West Africa with direct links to bushmeat. Part of the Mount Cameroon Project (MCP) is supporting local communities to manage forest resources sustainably; this accounts for an estimated &pound;50,000 p.a. of the projects funds. The Cameroon Community Forestry Development Project has been assisting government to develop protocols for community timber management; now that these are in place, the project team is working to establish community wildlife protocols for sustainable bushmeat harvesting. Both projects will finish this year, though we expect to contribute to a forestry sector programme in 2003, which will include a substantial community natural resource management element.</p>
	<p pid=".839W.3/3">In Ghana we are funding the Natural Resources Institute (NRI) to undertake research into bushmeat production, and particularly into the distribution of the value of bushmeat between producers and traders and how this affects poverty. This study will be completed in 2002, when we will consider the value of an extension into at least one other West African country in 2003&ndash;04, with estimated funding of &pound;50,000 to &pound;100,000 p.a.</p>
	<p pid=".839W.3/4">DFID also supports some 155 initiatives in developing countries to help them manage their forests sustainably, and is also working to help reduce illegal logging. These initiatives promote sustainable forest management and thereby should have an indirect positive impact on wildlife. DFID's main efforts are directed at combating illegal logging at source and addressing the other underlying causes of poor forest management, since most illegally harvested timber (up to 80 per cent. in some countries) is consumed domestically.</p>

	<p pid=".841W.2/1">Our Department's procedures require that any new infrastructure project be screened for its potential impact on the environment. If initial screening indicates that the project could have significant impacts on the environment, then further investigation such as Environmental Analysis or a detailed Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) must be undertaken. All projects funded by this Department must comply with in-country guidelines or legislation. While we check the need for an EIA and the adequacy of them where they are required, the assessment itself is often financed and carried out by others.</p>

We look to WHO to help raise the awareness of this issue and to ensure that this is achieved through international collaborative efforts. We provide significant resources to WHO to support this work.</p>
	<p pid=".841W.5/3">WHO is currently working with Medecins Sans Frontieres and pharmaceutical manufacturers to ensure drug supplies for the treatment of sleeping sickness free of charge for the next five years. it will also increase surveillance teams and undertake research on better treatment regimens. We, along with other donors are working in partnership with the pharmaceutical industry and research organisations to support the development of new drugs. The Gates Foundation is currently funding the development and trials of a promising new drug for treatment.</p>
	<p pid=".841W.5/4">We also recognise the need to ensure that existing drugs are available, particularly to the poorest. This requires strengthening systems of delivery for quality assured drugs. We work with countries in improving systems to procure and distribute drugs, manage drug supplies and encourage appropriate drug use.</p>

We have also provided a specialist site planner to UNHCR in Pakistan to assist with the setting up of new refugee camp sites. In addition we have provided &pound;6 million to NGOs, much of which has been directed towards Afghans in neighbouring countries, including Pakistan, and &pound;11 million to support communities in Pakistan most affected by the influx of refugees.</p>

	<p pid=".842W.5/1">The World Food Programme (WFP) continues to make good progress in transporting food aid to Afghanistan. It delivered a record 116,000 metric tonnes of food during the month of December alone, using a network of some 2,000 trucks, as well as air and barge operations. It is working to keep routes open over the winter using all-weather vehicles and specialised snow teams.</p>

There are, however still pockets of insecurity where access is difficult, particularly in the south and east, around Kandahar and Jalalabad.</p>

If initial screening indicates that an activity could have significant impacts on the environment, further investigation such as Environmental Analysis or a detailed Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) must be undertaken. While our Department checks the need for an EIA and the adequacy of them where they are required, the assessment itself is often financed and carried out by others. Where we are funding the improvement of an existing enterprise or facility, an environmental audit would be undertaken rather than an EIA.

	<p pid=".850W.5/1">Day to day management of the Circle line is a matter for London Underground. This line, like other parts of the underground, has suffered historic under-investment and the service provided has encountered problems arising both from this and from staff shortages which affected the reliability of operations particularly in 2001&ndash;02. I am satisfied that these problems are in the process of being rectified in the short term, in particular through London Underground's programme of work to improve reliability across the network. In the medium and long term, the problems of under-investment will be resolved by the large-scale investment that will be brought into the system through our tube modernisation plans, which will deliver increased capacity, improved reliability and higher quality.</p>

Although this identified the benefits of removing bull bars, it did not identify benefits associated with fitting them. The cost to owners of removing bull bars was estimated at &pound;110 per vehicle, being &pound;35 for physical removal and &pound;75 related to assumptions linked to loss of utility.</p>

We have encouraged Cambridgeshire county council as the local transport authority to come forward with a full appraisal of the guided bus project within six months.

	<p pid=".856W.8/1">For the purposes of inspecting corporate governance arrangements in local authorities, these are defined as:</p>
	<p pid=".856W.8/2" class="indent">The systems and processes by which local authorities lead, direct and control their functions and relate to their communities and partners.</p>
	<p pid=".856W.8/3">This definition and the framework to inspect these arrangements are based on the framework for developing a local code of corporate governance published in 2001 jointly by the Chartered Institute for Public Finance Accountants (CIPFA) and the Society of Local Authority Chief Executives (SOLACE). This has five main themes: Community Focus; Structures and Processes; Risk Management and Internal Control; Service Delivery Arrangements; and Standards of Conduct. In addition, a corporate governance inspection will address other, cross- cutting elements or indicators of corporate performance, such as people and their relationships, the role of Information and Communications Technology, e-services and political and managerial leadership, among others.</p>
	<p pid=".856W.8/4">Corporate Governance inspections build directly on the methodological approach developed for best value inspections of local authority services, including the collection of evidence from an assessment of key council documents, interviews with key personnel, group discussions with staff, the public and stakeholders. Inspections last one week or two weeks, in lower and upper tier authorities respectively and as with best value service inspections, councils are briefed throughout the inspection process and have the opportunity to respond to the inspection findings, presented to them shortly after the on-site phase has ended, and on the draft report.</p>
	<p pid=".856W.8/5">Corporate Governance inspection teams will generally comprise one from each of the following personnel:</p>
	<p pid=".856W.8/6" class="indent">Managing Inspector (a senior inspector from the Audit Commission)</p>
	<p pid=".856W.8/7" class="indent">Best Value Inspector (from the Audit Commission)</p>
	<p pid=".856W.8/8" class="indent">District Auditor/Audit Manager, or alternative financial specialist</p>
	<p pid=".856W.8/9" class="indent">Chief Executive (or ex-CEX), or senior manager in a council</p>
	<p pid=".856W.8/10" class="indent">Council Leader, or senior member</p>
	<p pid=".856W.8/11" class="indent">Benefit Fraud Inspector</p>
	<p pid=".856W.8/12" class="indent">Ofsted Inspector (in inspections of upper tier authorities)</p>
	<p pid=".856W.8/13" class="indent">Social Services Inspector (in inspections of upper tier authorities).</p>
	<p pid=".856W.8/14">The Local Government White Paper, published on <phrase class="date" code="">11 December</phrase>, will require all upper tier authorities to be subject to a comprehensive performance assessment. These assessments will be informed by the experience of using the corporate governance inspection methodology.</p>

The total number of matters raised with, and disposed of by, auditors in any one year is in excess of 100. The majority of all such matters tend to relate to small sums of money in local councils. The Audit Commission does monitor complex and high-value audit cases. There are currently 11 such cases. In six of these the auditors' investigations have been ongoing for more than two years.

	<p pid=".861W.8/1">The Rough Sleepers Unit was established in April 1999 following a recommendation of the Social Exclusion Unit in their 1998 report into rough sleeping. The unit was tasked by the Prime Minister to reduce the number of people sleeping rough in England to as near to zero as possible and by at least two thirds by 2002.</p>
	<p pid=".861W.8/2">The Rough Sleepers Unit published its strategy on tackling rough sleeping, &quot;Coming in from the Cold&quot;, in December 1999. The strategy outlined a raft of new policies and services to deliver the target, which are now all in place across England. These services include helping people sleeping rough on the streets with drug, alcohol and mental health problems; helping former rough sleepers rebuild their lives through education, training and employment; and preventing a new generation of rough sleepers particularly those leaving care, the armed forces and prison.</p>
	<p pid=".861W.8/3">The Prime Minister announced on <phrase class="date" code="2001-12-03">3 December 2001</phrase> that his target had been met and figures show that there are now 532 people sleeping rough in England, compared with around 1,850 in June 1998.

	<p pid=".867W.0/1">It is estimated that in 2000 there were 2.8 million households in England in fuel poverty (based on income including housing benefit and income support for mortgage interest), or 3.9 million households (based on income excluding housing benefit and income support for mortgage interest), representing falls of 15 per cent. and 13 per cent. respectively compared to 1998. More detailed breakdowns of fuel poverty in 2000 are not available as the estimates for 2000 are broad estimates based on changes in incomes and fuel prices, rather than being based on survey data. Some more detailed breakdowns are available for 1998; however, for some particular analyses the latest information relates to 1996.</p>
	<p pid=".867W.0/2">The latest available figures indicate that in England 1.9 million (29 per cent.) households headed by an older couple or a single person over the age of 60 were in fuel poverty in 1998. This is based on fuel poverty being defined as when a household needs to spend more than 10 per cent. of its income (including housing benefit and income support for mortgage interest) on fuel in order to maintain a satisfactory heating regime. When fuel poverty is defined using income excluding housing benefit or income support for mortgage interest 2.3 million (35 per cent. of) households headed by an older couple or a single person over the age of 60 were in fuel poverty in England in 1998.</p>
	<p pid=".867W.0/3">The table presents estimates of the number of people and the number of households in England in fuel poverty in 1998, the latest year for which estimates of the number of people in fuel poverty are available.</p>

	<p pid=".869W.5/1">The issue of the appropriate job dust factor for training officers was recently referred to the Dust Reference Panel (DRP), an expert body that is jointly instructed by the claimants' solicitors' co-ordinating group (CG) and the Department. The DRP's report concludes that training officers would spend the majority of their time in a surface non-dusty environment, with only occasional visits underground, and as such should be classified as 'surface non-dusty'. The Department is in discussion with the CG about the DRP's conclusions. If both parties accept the DRP's report, training officers will not be eligible for compensation under the scheme. The category of mining instructor has not yet been referred to the DRP, and no request has been received from the CG for such a referral. The Department proposes to put the category to the DRP as soon as possible, subject to the CG's agreement.</p>

	<p pid=".870W.2/1">Commission Regulation (Euratom) No. 3227 came into force in 1977. The first Euratom safeguard inspection visit to the BNFL Sellafield facility took place in 1973 but, as was announced to Parliament in 1986, on <phrase class="date" code="1986-06-04">4 June 1986</phrase>, <phrase class="offrep" id="debates/1986-06-04.594"><i>Official Report,</i> columns 594&ndash;95</phrase>, the simultaneous processing of civil and non-civil material meant that, until then, Euratom safeguard inspectors had not had access to mixed civil/non-civil areas of the facility. However, the co-processing of civil and non-civil material was ended in 1986, since when safeguards procedures have been in place to enable Euratom safeguard inspection of all civil material at the Sellafield facility. The verification activities involved are designed to detect the possible diversion of civil nuclear material from its declared use. There are regular inspections to confirm that information provided by the facility operator pursuant to Commission Regulation (Euratom) No. 3227 is correct (i.e. that the facility, its inventories of nuclear material and changes in these inventories are as reported). Euratom safeguard inspection activities at places such as Sellafield include access to confirm the facility's design, extensive access to and evaluation of plant and process operational data, and independent verification of the nuclear material itself&mdash;either by means of direct sampling and/or measurement, or by the application of &quot;containment&quot; and &quot;surveillance measures&quot; (e.g. sealing containers or stores of material, or video surveillance of plant areas) to confirm that previously measured material remains unchanged.</p>

	<p pid=".871W.2/1">All Government Departments have been encouraged to 'Think Small First'. The Small Business Service (SBS) has consulted across Whitehall to ensure all Departments consider the impact their actions have on small businesses. Significant progress has been made in the Government's three priority areas of:</p>
	<p pid=".871W.2/2" class="indent">(i) entrepreneurial culture and environment;</p>
	<p pid=".871W.2/3" class="indent">(ii) regulatory framework for business; and</p>
	<p pid=".871W.2/4" class="indent">(iii) support for business.</p>
	<p pid=".871W.2/5">Examples of progress are as follows: an independent cross-departmental Review of Enterprise and the Economy in Education, led by Sir Howard Davies. The review is expected to report by the end of January 2002; enterprise and entrepreneurial skills are now included in the national curriculum; the launch of the Enterprise Insight &quot;Enterprising Schools&quot; initiative which encourages businesses to get involved in enterprise programmes; SBS consulted at an early stage by all Government Departments when UK regulatory policy issues affecting small businesses are being considered and their comments included in the final Regulatory Impact Assessment; implementation periods introduced for new legislation, which will give business clear guidance on new legislation 12 weeks before it comes into force; the Business Link Operator network re-structured and the national information and advisory service launched to provide a more consistent and customer focused service to small businesses. SBS working with other Government Departments to promote the Business Link Operator network as the route to market for business support services; 'NHS Plus' launched, which will enable a national network of NHS Occupational Health Departments to provide services specifically to small businesses.</p>
	<p pid=".871W.2/6">SBS have developed a range of performance indicators to measure the impact and benchmark the success of &quot;Think Small First&quot; (available on the website <a href="http://www.sbs.gov.uk/consultations">www.sbs.gov.uk/consultations</a>.) SBS intend to publish the initial findings early this year.</p>

	<p pid=".875W.6/1">In the UK, the DTI's civil aeronautics research programme supports long-term research in key aeronautics technologies by providing grants to industry, research organisations and universities. In March 2001, the then Secretary of State announced the continuation of this programme for five years covering the period from April 2001 to March 2006. Funding for 2001&ndash;02 is expected to total &pound;20 million. Future funding of the Department's civil aeronautics research programmes will be determined alongside the funding of other DTI budgets as part of the Department's business support review and the Government's Spending Review 2002.</p>
	<p pid=".875W.6/2">Additionally, funding for the science base provided through the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council and related to aerospace research totalled around &pound;14 million in 2000&ndash;01.</p>
	<p pid=".875W.6/3">The DTI also invests in the design and development of major civil aerospace programmes through launch investment. The most recent examples have been for Airbus UK to design and develop the wings for the Airbus A380 superjumbo programme (a Government investment of up to &pound;530 million) and for Rolls-Royce to design and develop the Trent 900 engine for the A380 and the Trent 600 engine for potential future Boeing large aircraft (a Government investment of up to &pound;250 million).</p>
	<p pid=".875W.6/4">As part of its Applied and Corporate Research Programmes and associated technology demonstrators, the Ministry of Defence spends about &pound;120 million per annum on aerospace-related work for specific defence needs.</p>
	<p pid=".875W.6/5">We have no directly comparable information for the other countries listed but our best estimate of expenditure on civil aeronautics research equivalent to the UK's civil aircraft research programme is about &pound;60 million for France and &pound;100 million for Germany. These nations also provide Launch Investment for new civil aerospace developments.</p>
	<p pid=".875W.6/6">In the USA, aeronautical research activity funded through NASA totals several hundred million pounds annually though the USA does not provide Launch Investment for aerospace developments. Canada, under the &quot;Technology Partnerships Canada&quot; programme, has made repayable investments worth around &pound;500 million in the last five years in aerospace and defence projects.</p>

However, using a proxy of households in Wales eligible for the Home Energy Efficiency Scheme (based on the Welsh House Condition Survey 1997&ndash;98), the strategy estimated that of the approximately 222,000 such households in Wales, 117,000 contain at least one person over the age of 60; 40,000 are lone parents; 32,000 contain at least one person who is sick or disabled and 33,000 are other forms of households with children.</p>

However, the House's restaurants and souvenir shops provide services primarily to Members and staff who work here, and to constituents visiting the House. The Refreshment Department is therefore not planning to accept payment for its catering or retail services in euros or any other foreign currency.</p>

Member will have noted from the Administration Committee's First Report on the 2001 trial opening of the Summer Line of Route (HC 433 of Session 2001&ndash;02) that at least 50 per cent. of the 86,000 visits last year came from overseas. If the Committee's recommendation that the summer opening of the Line of Route become a permanent feature is accepted, the potential benefits, costs and risks of accepting payment for tickets, souvenirs and refreshments in foreign currencies, including the euro, will be considered for this project.</p>

Although other collections in the UK continue to hold and display works by the artist, this represents the largest single national collection of Turner's work, where works may be viewed and studied in depth.</p>

Therefore, DCMS does not monitor prices charged by individual accommodation providers. However, my Department is concerned with price transparency and the need for guests to be able to form a judgment about how much it will cost them before purchasing a room. The Tourism (Sleeping Accommodation Price Display) Order 1977 requires hotels to display in their reception areas or entrances the highest and lowest prices for each type of room (e.g. single, double etc.) and those prices must include, where appropriate, any service charge or meals and whether VAT is included.</p>

Responses to that consultation are requested by the Treasury by <phrase class="date" code="2002-02-01">1 February 2002</phrase>. I intend to meet representatives of the Charity Commission shortly to discuss the extent of applications from sport for charitable status and the fuller guidance the Commission intends to issue on this subject in due course. These discussions will include the need for greater clarity on a range of issues in the current guidance including the treatment of different levels of skill among participants at sports clubs seeking charitable status.</p>
	<p pid=".885W.8/2">It is the Government's understanding that all skill levels can be catered for by a sports club promoting healthy recreation which obtains charitable status but that such a commitment will not rule out selection of teams on merit and/or different coaching offered to different ability levels. The Commission recognises that the provision of coaching to regional, national and international standards often acts as an incentive to other less able players to improve and/or to attract new people to the club.</p>

Applicants who are able to make simple conversation and communicate well enough to deal with everyday situations are considered to meet this requirement. The requirements for British nationality, including the language requirement, are currently under review and the Government will announce their conclusions in a forthcoming asylum, immigration and nationality White Paper.</p>

	<p pid=".897W.5/1">This ruling, along with the cases of Gloszczuk, Kondova, Barkoci and Malik, was welcomed by the United Kingdom Government. A detailed assessment of its implications is being made but our view is that the United Kingdom can continue to apply its Immigration Rules in such cases (paragraphs 211&ndash;223 of HC 395). Importantly, the rulings support our view that those here illegally cannot benefit from the association agreements.</p>
	<p pid=".897W.5/2">The provisions on self-establishment in the association agreements are subject to limitations justified on the ground of public policy. A member state is entitled to rely on the public policy limitation in relation to those seeking to establish themselves in its territory under the agreements as self-employed prostitutes where that member state has adopted measures designed to combat prostitution carried out by its own nations.</p>
	<p pid=".897W.5/3">Living off immoral earnings (pimping) and soliciting for prostitution are criminal offences under United Kingdom law and will continue to be prosecutable by the courts regardless of the nationality of the prostitute in question. We will rely on the public policy limitation to prevent Polish, Czech or Slovak nationals from establishing themselves as self-employed prostitutes in the United Kingdom under the association agreements.</p>
	<p pid=".897W.5/4">The right of establishment under the Article 43 of the EC Treaty is effected by EC Council Directive 73/148, which deals with the abolition of restrictions on movement and residence within the EU for nationals of member states with regard to establishment and the provision of services. Article 8 of that directive allows member states to derogate from the provisions of the directive on the grounds of public policy. We would seek to rely on that provision should a national of a member state seek to enter or live in the United Kingdom as a prostitute.</p>

	<p pid=".898W.5/1">The United Kingdom signed the Trafficking Protocol to the United Nations Convention on Transnational Organised Crime, which requires the specific criminalisation of trafficking in human beings in December 2000.</p>
	<p pid=".898W.5/2">The Government are currently negotiating a European Union (EU) Framework Decision, which is a binding European Union instrument. It contains most of the provisions in the United Nations (UN) Protocol and in certain aspects is more wide-ranging. The Government are committed to making it a criminal offence to traffic in human beings for the purposes of labour or sexual exploitation and is currently examining suitable legislative vehicles to facilitate this and other new offences on people trafficking. Under the provisions of the EU Framework Decision, the United Kingdom will be required to have implemented the instrument within two years of its adoption.</p>
	<p pid=".898W.5/3">The UK is also contributing to the EU STOP programme, which was set up by a joint action of the European Council in 1996. This programme provides support to member state organisations responsible for action against the trade in human beings and the sexual exploitation of children. A European Council decision of <phrase class="date" code="2001-06-28">28 June 2001</phrase> established a second phase of this programme (STOP II).</p>
	<p pid=".898W.5/4">As part of a multi-faceted approach, the protocol also requires work to be done to prevent people trafficking. We are in the process of drawing up a cross-departmental strategic approach to people trafficking that will include a comprehensive programme on prevention and the care of potential and actual people trafficking victims. In the last year, the Government funded overseas projects to tackle people trafficking in Turkey, Thailand and Cambodia. We have also contributed &pound;200,000 to an Organisation and Security Co-operation in Europe fund to help the victims of trafficking and raise awareness of the dangers among vulnerable groups.</p>
	<p pid=".898W.5/5">In addition, we set up Project REFLEX last year, a multi-agency task force chaired by the National Crime Squad, to co-ordinate action against organised immigration crime, including people trafficking, and to develop the intelligence and strategic planning to underpin them. It is now well established and has already resulted in some major successes involving partners overseas, by disrupting organised criminal groups involved in bringing people to the United Kingdom.</p>

In response, the Government are currently drawing up a coherent and comprehensive cross- Departmental strategy to address people trafficking on a national and international scale.

	<p pid=".902W.0/1">Information about average waiting times for student applications is not held centrally and could be obtained only by scrutinising individual case files, at disproportionate cost. We aim to decide 70 per cent. of new general and settlement applications within three weeks but at present it is taking up to eight weeks on average to consider new straightforward applications. The reasons for this are (i) the exceptionally high number of new applications received this year, especially in recent months; and (ii) process changes that are being introduced. We are working to reduce this to three weeks or less as soon as possible.</p>

The Scottish and Welsh Forestry Ministers and I have decided that the review will start shortly and report to us in the spring. It will consider the current administrative arrangements for delivering sustainable forestry policies in England, Scotland and Wales and the UK's international forestry commitments, including options for further devolution of these arrangements. The review will be undertaken by officials from the Forestry Commission, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, Scottish Executive, the National Assembly for Wales, the Cabinet Office and the Treasury. The Northern Ireland Department of Agriculture and Rural Development will also be involved in the review. Views will be sought from interested parties during the course of the review.</p>

	<p pid=".904W.6/2">My right hon. Friend the Minister for the Environment announced to Parliament on <phrase class="date" code="2000-07-28">28 July 2000</phrase>, <phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2000-07-28.947W"><i>Official Report</i>, columns 947&ndash;48W</phrase>, that central Government Departments and their agencies were committed to actively seeking to buy timber and timber products from sustainable and legal sources. In January 2001 the Office of Government Commerce wrote to departmental Heads of Procurement to confirm this policy. Departments have been asked to report annually on their timber purchases and the recent Greening Government report for the financial year 2000&ndash;01 includes a summary of the responses received. My Department, on behalf of an interdepartmental working group on timber procurement, has commissioned a study on the scale of central Government's timber requirements and the options available for developing the most effective implementation of this policy. An interim report is due to be published at the end of February 2002 with a final report due at the end of May 2002. My Department has consulted the Timber Trade Federation and environmental NGOs in pursuit of the Government's timber procurement policy and has been raising awareness among Departments and the wider public sector. In May 2001 a timber procurement workshop was held at the Greening Public Procurement conference organised by the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions and attended by a cross-section of the public sector. In October 2001 my Department gave a presentation at the local government's Central Buying Consortium conference and took that opportunity to promote the purchase of sustainable and legally harvested timber. Recently my right hon. Friend the Minister for the Environment has met the Timber Trade Federation to discuss implementation of the Government's timber procurement policy and he addressed a wide cross section of stakeholders and answered questions at the WWF 95+ Group 10th anniversary celebration event. My Department has arranged to meet the Department for Transport, Local Government and Rural Affairs to discuss how local authorities may be encouraged to purchase timber from sustainable and legal sources where they are not doing so already. My Department is working closely with the Department for International Development and other Departments to develop bilateral agreements with producing countries that will help to halt the export of timber that has been felled illegally.</p>

	<p pid=".905W.2/1">The Government's Forestry Strategy for England sets out our priorities and programmes for sustainable forestry in England. These priorities include supporting the strategic development of woodland resources. Specific actions include support for regional and local marketing initiatives, and ensuring the supply of timber from our woodland resource is available at levels indicated in long-term forecasts. In addition, through the Forestry Commission and in partnership with woodland owners and wood users we are supporting the Wood for Good campaign, the largest single timber promotion ever mounted in the UK. Other measures include purchasing research on timber use from the Building Research Establishment, the Timber Research and Development Association and other organisations. We are also working to ensure that small sized timber and woodland residues are recognised as a source of renewable energy. These measures will help to promote the viability of the hardwood and softwood industries.</p>

	<p pid=".907W.5/20">This information is taken from the IT system used by the State Veterinary Service in support of their TB control work and has not been checked against the quality criteria expected of 'national statistics'. Figures may therefore be unreliable (especially before 1996); they show trends rather than absolute numbers of new incidents.</p>
	<p pid=".907W.5/21">Precise forecasts of the number of future incidents are not possible because of unknown variables including, in particular, the effect of the suspension of TB testing during 2001 in order to limit the spread of foot and mouth disease. We expect the total of new herd incidents in 2001 to fall within the range 95 to 150 (final figures will not be available until April). In 2002, if the rising trend of the last four years continues in the Gloucester Division, a new herd incident figure of around 400 may be possible, although it is not yet clear how measures taken in respect of foot and mouth disease may affect the incidence of bovine TB.</p>

	<p pid=".908W.0/1">It is not possible to predict when full TB testing of cattle will resume. This will depend on when veterinary resource can be released from FMD work.</p>
	<p pid=".908W.0/2">Prioritisation of testing will vary according to local circumstances but in general tests will be ranked using two major criteria: likelihood of TB infection in a herd; and likely transmission of TB out of a herd. Top priority will be given to tests on herds where raw milk or raw milk products are manufactured and sold for human consumption or direct to consumers. Next in priority will be overdue tests on herds which have some association with an incident of TB. Of these, herds with high levels of movements other than direct to slaughter will be given priority.</p>
	<p pid=".908W.0/3">The major part of routine TB testing is delivered for the Government by local veterinary practitioners who work for the State Veterinary Service (SVS) as local veterinary inspectors (LVIs). Non-routine TB testing is delivered by both SVS veterinary officers and (LVIs) depending on local circumstances. SVS administrative staff provide office support for the testing programme. The resumption of full TB testing and clearing the overdue test backlog will place significant demands on these resources for quite some time to come.</p>

	<p pid=".909W.5/1">Hunting with hounds is not governed by a licensing system. At present a temporary system sets out the requirements against which hunting can be allowed to take place within the requirements of disease control measures. Hunting was one of the activities that was banned in order to stop the spread of foot and mouth disease and assist its eradication. The Government's priority has been to eradicate FMD and then to enable the countryside to return to normal as quickly as it is safe to do so. For each of the activities that were banned or limited the decision on resumption and on any residual limitations on the relevant activity has been based on a Veterinary Risk Assessment. For low risk activities like walking, implementation of such decisions have been relatively straightforward. The same was found to be the case in respect of grouse shooting and falconry. In the case of hunting with hounds, the Veterinary Risk Assessment reflected a much more complex set of circumstances in which different forms of hunting, different conditions in different parts of the country and concentrations of FMD susceptible species such as deer and the presence of Form A and Form D farms all posed different risks and are factors that have to be taken into account.</p>
	<p pid=".909W.5/2">On <phrase class="date" code="2001-11-15">15 November 2001</phrase> I published proposals for the way in which hunting might be allowed to resume, along with the Veterinary Risk Assessment on which the proposals were based. Essentially it was proposed that any hunt which wished to resume activity would have to show how they would observe the limitations which would be necessary to minimise the risk of starting another outbreak of FMD. Decisions were delegated to Divisional Veterinary Managers who would be familiar with local circumstances and would need to be satisfied that the hunt could meet the requirements of animal health controls. Hunts which met these requirements can be permitted to hunt within the defined limits.</p>
	<p pid=".909W.5/3">On <phrase class="date" code="2001-12-13">13 December 2001</phrase> I published details of the permit arrangements which included practical amendments responding to representations by both hunting and non- hunting groups. Since then our Divisional Veterinary Managers have sought to apply local knowledge and common sense to approaches from hunts. They have been widely praised for the way they have undertaken this additional task and I would like to place on the record my thanks to the DEFRA staff involved.</p>
	<p pid=".909W.5/4">It is against this background that the circumstances of the Worcestershire Hunt, the Croome and West Warwickshire Foxhounds and the North Cotswold Hunt have to be understood.</p>
	<p pid=".909W.5/5">All these hunts have applied for and given a permit to hunt. Limitations on hunting will continue as long as care is needed to achieve the eradication of FMD and the general requirements&mdash;which require hunts not to meet or hunt within 8 km of a Form A or a Form D premise&mdash;will be reviewed as and when there is any change in the Veterinary Risk Assessment. As indicated earlier, the disease control requirements are being applied with common sense in the light of local circumstances. So in the case of the Worcestershire Hunt several exceptions have been granted to this criterion which is that it may hunt closer to a particular Form A premise as the M5 acts as a natural buffer between the Farm and five of the proposed meets. Two other proposed meets have also been permitted within an 8 km restriction due to the low risk of hunting near to the relevant Form A premise.</p>
	<p pid=".909W.5/6">Special conditions have also been applied to the Croome and West Warwickshire Hunt forbidding it from hunting on the Ragley Hall Estate. This is in recognition of the estate having a large deer population.</p>
	<p pid=".909W.5/7">These conditions will continue to apply as long as the threat of FMD remains. The permit section at Worcester Animal Health Office is constantly reviewing the restrictions on individual Form A and Form D premises and as soon as any are lifted, the relevant Hunts are being informed. The temporary permit system for hunting will continue as long as restrictions are necessary to achieve eradication of FMD and will be removed when FMD has been officially eradicated from the whole of Great Britain.</p>

	<p pid=".911W.3/1">EU legislation requires testing, including animal testing, of all industrial chemicals produced in high volume (greater than 1,000 tons per manufacturer per year) and below this level, the generation of data on new chemicals according to the amount produced. Other chemicals may be required to be tested if there are justifiable concerns. Chemicals used for particular purposes, for example pesticides and biocides (including garden pesticides and household disinfectants) and pharmaceuticals, are also required to be tested before they are put on the market. We have no information about which chemicals will be coming forward for testing in future years. Animal tests are regulated by the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 which is a Home Office matter. The Government's policy is to reduce the number of animals used in tests and we are currently supporting changes to Pesticides Directive 91/44/EC to prevent the replication of testing on vertebrate animals.</p>

	<p pid=".917W.6/1">At the end of 2001 the EU and the Sudanese Government agreed to continue and intensify the EU-Sudan dialogue, chaired by our ambassador during the latter half of the year, for a further 12 months. The dialogue is therefore on-going. The continued dialogue will allow for regular joint assessments of concrete and verifiable progress achieved with respect to democracy and human rights and in the peace process. For its part, the EU agreed to achieve the launch of the Humanitarian Plus programme.</p>
	<p pid=".917W.6/2">We are pleased with the progress achieved during the course of the dialogue last year. There was some progress on human rights and democratisation. The Council of Ministers is somewhat more broadly based. The Umma Party is back and operating as a political party within Sudan. New newspapers are permitting a freer expression of political debate. There is some moderation of police and security activity, though abuses undoubtedly occur. Work continues to confront the problem of abductions. But in all these areas there is much more to do and we shall continue to address these issues during the course of this year.</p>

	<p pid=".918W.8/1">The Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group discussed developments in Fiji at its meeting in London on <phrase class="date" code="">20 December</phrase>. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State represented the United Kingdom. The Group welcomed the holding of broadly free and fair elections in Fiji in August and September 2001. In recognition of this and the fact that the Fiji Government were now addressing the current uncertainty over their own constitutionality in a responsible manner, the Group decided that the conditions were now right to readmit Fiji to the Councils of the Commonwealth. However, in view of the remaining uncertainty over the Government's constitutionality the Group also decided that Fiji should remain on its agenda and that the Secretary General's Special Envoy, Justice Pius Langa of South Africa should remain engaged.</p>
	<p pid=".918W.8/2">In view of this we decided on <phrase class="date" code="">20 December</phrase> to lift the targeted package of measures that the <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/718" name="John Battle">then Minister of State, my hon. Friend the Member for Leeds, West (Mr. Battle)</phrase> announced on <phrase class="date" code="2000-07-21">21 July 2000</phrase>. We will once again consider applications for funding for small projects from the Fiji Government in the areas of good governance, human rights, conflict prevention and the environment. We have also ended our blanket ban on joint military exercises and visits to Fiji by Royal Navy ships&mdash;possible co-operation in this area will be considered on a case-by-case basis. And in keeping with national and EU criteria, we will continue not to issue export licences for military or security equipment where there is a clear risk that it will be used for internal repression. We will not hesitate to re-impose these measures, and even consider extending their scope, in the event that the Government of Fiji fail to meet their constitutional obligations to all of Fiji's citizens.</p>

These organisations include the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine and the Popular Front for the Liberation&mdash;General Command. Hizballah also operates from within Syria. The UK has proscribed an element of Hizballah, its External Security Organisation, as terrorist. Syria is however co-operating with the international fight against terrorism and has taken some steps to rein in these organisations. Iran does not host terrorist organisations in the same way. However we have long-standing concerns about Iran's record of support for groups which use violent methods to oppose the Middle East Peace Process, including Hizballah.</p>

	<p pid=".923W.5/1">In recent weeks the security situation within Liberia has deteriorated. In north-western Liberia fighting has escalated between Guinean backed dissident groups and Liberian forces loyal to President Taylor. There is a risk that this increased instability could destabilise the sub-region, including neighbouring Sierra Leone, and have serious humanitarian consequences. Regional peace is dependent on the restoration of stability in Liberia, and we will continue working towards that goal.</p>
	<p pid=".923W.5/2">In March 2001 we co-sponsored United Nations Security Council Resolution 1343 imposing sanctions on Liberia. We are encouraged that Liberia has taken some positive steps, including rescinding the expulsion of the Sierra Leonean and Guinean ambassadors, and granting an amnesty to political opponents accused of treason. But as the UN Expert Panel Report on sanction made clear in October 2001, President Taylor has not fundamentally changed his behaviour. In response to this report, the UK is actively pursuing further actions in the Security Council. The EU recently held talks with Liberia to further increase pressure on President Taylor to stop backing rebel groups and start implementing democratic principles, good governance and respect for human rights. Through various diplomatic channels, including the EU presidency representative to the Mano River Union (MRU: Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone), the UN and ECOWAS, we are encouraging the leaders of the MRU countries to establish a meaningful dialogue.</p>

	<p pid=".925W.6/1">It is not always possible to determine, with certainty, the responsibility for terrorist attacks. Many attacks are unclaimed, and some claims of responsibility are unreliable. What is important is that President Arafat has committed the Palestinian Authority to an effort to prevent violence by all Palestinian groups operating from the occupied territories. We urge the Palestinian Authority to fulfil this commitment, and Israel to help create the conditions for a return to negotiations. Only a just and lasting peace can assure security for Israelis and Palestinians alike.</p>

Immediate help with costs arising on bereavement is provided by a lump sum bereavement payment of &pound;2000&mdash;double the old widow's payment of &pound;1000. There is a weekly benefit for widowed parents who satisfy the qualifying conditions. The bereavement allowance is also available for 12 months, to give widows and widowers aged 45 or over without dependants time to adjust to their new circumstances.</p>

	<p pid=".933W.5/1">Two parcels of land at Stoke Mandeville hospital have been disposed of. One is subject of a number of conditions which have yet to be satisfied, so the amount of the receipts will not be known until all of the conditions have been fulfilled, and the payment due is calculated.</p>
	<p pid=".933W.5/2">The strategy for disposal of the site was agreed by the previous Anglia and Oxford regional office of the Department. It was not advertised as it was considered that a negotiated disposal was the best way of obtaining &quot;best value&quot; measured in terms of cash receipts, optimum site uses, the trust's reprovision plans, planning consents, programming and risk transfer.</p>
	<p pid=".933W.5/3">The Stoke Mandeville hospital site itself is owned by the Stoke Mandeville National Health Service Trust. However, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State retains ownership of two parcels of land there. The first is the sports ground for the disabled, to the rear of the main hospital site. This is occupied by the British Wheelchair Foundation under the terms of a long lease. It is intended that the freehold interest of this area will remain with my right hon. Friend for the immediate future.</p>
	<p pid=".933W.5/4">The second parcel of land is used for hospital purposes. It will, however, become available for redevelopment, and it is intended that some of the site will be used for additional staff residential accommodation. A review of the NHS trust's long term staff accommodation needs is currently being undertaken. The site will be marketed and disposed of subject to provision by the purchaser of an agreed number of staff residential units.</p>
	<p pid=".933W.5/5">NHS Estates carries out performance management reviews of selected land disposals which are in progress or have been completed. In this case the review is not yet complete, and the disposal is subject of on-going negotiations, so it would be premature to respond to the question.</p>

	<p pid=".934W.2/1">The information requested on health authorities that have recently identified difficulties in recruiting general practitioners is not available. Information on vacancies is available in the GP Recruitment, Retention and Vacancy Survey.

	<p pid=".934W.2/2">The NHS Plan includes targets for at least 2,000 extra GPs and 450 extra GP registrars, since increased to 550, by 2004. The latest information available shows that on <phrase class="date" code="2000-09-30">30 September 2000</phrase> there had been a 9.1 per cent. increase in the number of GP registrars, to 1,659. This is the fourth consecutive annual increase and the largest annual percentage increase for 20 years.</p>
	<p pid=".934W.2/3">In order to deliver the recruitment targets a number of initiatives are under way. Various recruitment and retention initiatives are being pursued that are aimed at encouraging qualified GPs into, or return to, practice. They include: the Golden Hello scheme for those GPs taking up their first substantive appointment; the highly successful GP retainer scheme on which are around 1,120 GPs; the introduction of up to 20 days a year of protected time for higher professional training to help ease the transition from training to general practice; improving working lives with new measures for maternity and paternity leave and NHS child care; and the Cabinet Office review aimed to eliminate the amount of non-clinical paperwork and bureaucracy overheads.</p>
	<p pid=".934W.2/4">Last month we announced the lifting of the funding bar on recruiting non-European Economic Area doctors to GP registrar posts. To further increase supply, the Home Office's Highly Skilled Migrant Entry Programme now includes provision to facilitate the recruitment and retention of suitably qualified overseas doctors who wish to work as general practitioners for the national health service.</p>

	<p pid=".935W.8/1">There are currently no plans to establish a National Service Framework for lung disease. The NSF for Older People recognises the importance of respiratory diseases to the health and well being of older people. The NSF provides for a 10-year developing framework for action across health and social care, and within this arthritis and respiratory disease in older people are the next priorities for future work. The focus of this will be older people, but the service model will have implications for and apply to all who need these services, regardless of their age.</p>
	<p pid=".935W.8/2">There are a range of Government initiatives already in place which take a preventive approach to lung disease and have long-term objectives to improve treatment and care. These include the investment of &pound;53 million in smoking cessation services. Smoking is the major cause of lung cancer and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). In addition the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) has been asked to prepare clinical guidelines for the NHS for the diagnosis and treatment of lung cancer and the management and treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.</p>

Repayment from borrowers with income contingent loans are collected through the tax system.

The Government believe that decisions concerning the supply of school places are best taken locally by the main partners in the provision of education, who have knowledge of local needs. It is for local education authorities to plan and keep under review the supply of school places and to ensure there is sufficient provision to meet demand. They must publish annually a School Organisation Plan setting out how they plan to deal with any surplus or deficit of places over a five-year rolling period.</p>

	<p pid=".946W.3/1">The latest &quot;Performance Indicators in Higher Education&quot; published by the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) last month show that the proportion of entrants to full-time first degree courses in 1998&ndash;99 who did not continue beyond the first year was 10 per cent., the same proportion as in the two previous academic years. HEFCE's figures indicate that around one fifth of these students will re-enter HE after a year out. Although the UK has the second highest completion rate among OECD countries, the Government are not complacent. HEFCE have been asked to report on the measures being taken to bear down on the drop-out rate. HEFCE have produced an interim report and are expected to produce their complete report shortly.</p>
