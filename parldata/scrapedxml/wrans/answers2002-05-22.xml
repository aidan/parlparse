	<p pid=".326W.2/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid=".326W.2/2">The Scientific and Technical Research Committee (CREST) is a standing advisory committee to the Council and Commission which was established pursuant to a Council Resolution of <phrase class="date" code="1974-01-14">14 January 1974</phrase> on the co-ordination of national policies and the definition of projects of interest to the Community in the field of science and technology.</p>
	<p pid=".326W.2/3">A Council Resolution of <phrase class="date" code="1995-09-28">28 September 1995</phrase> defined the current role of CREST:</p>
	<p pid=".326W.2/4" class="indent">(i) to identify strategic priorities for Community policy, based on the criterion of added value while complying with the principle of subsidiarity, thereby helping the Commission to draw up Community research and technological development (RTD) programmes;</p>
	<p pid=".326W.2/5" class="indent">(ii) to promote co-ordination by the Community and the member states of their RTD activities in order to ensure mutual consistency between national policies and Community policy;</p>
	<p pid=".326W.2/6" class="indent">(iii) to review the independent assessment of the specific programmes and the framework programme, relying in particular on the programme committees, in order to learn useful lessons from them for Community RTD policy;</p>
	<p pid=".326W.2/7" class="indent">(iv) to contribute to the formulation of Community strategy for international co-operation in the sphere of research, including consultation within the Community in preparation for the proceedings of international bodies.</p>
	<p pid=".326W.2/8">CREST also devotes itself to the following activities:</p>
	<p pid=".326W.2/9" class="indent">(v) dissemination and exploitation of the results of RTD and demonstration activities and of their impact on competitiveness and employment in the Community;</p>
	<p pid=".326W.2/10" class="indent">(vi) training activities through and for research and their response to innovation needs.</p>
	<p pid=".326W.2/11">The CREST Committee discharges its functions either at the request of the Council or the Commission or on its own initiative. It comprises senior representatives responsible for RTD policies in the member states and of Commission representatives and is chaired by the Director General, Directorate General Research. The General Secretariat of the Council provides the secretariat for CREST. Since 2001 Candidate Countries to the European Union have been invited to attend as observers. CREST draws up it own rules of procedure and work programme. Records of meeting and opinions of CREST record the consensual opinion of its members, with reference to any minority views. They are forwarded to the Council and the Commission. CREST's work, reports and other documentation are publicly available.

	<p pid=".328W.0/2">The mandate of the Standing Committee is contained in Article 18 of the noise emission in the environment by equipment for use outdoors Directive, 2000/14/EC. In essence it is convened to consider matters of interpretation which are brought to its attention by member states. It has, however only met in its capacity as an advisory committee. Officials of the European Commission chair these meetings with a view to providing advice based on consensus in order to ensure that there is uniform interpretation of the directive throughout the European Union and also to ensure that any technical barriers to trade within the Single Market are removed. The committee, in particular, assists the Commission in the adaptation to technical progress of methods of measurement of airborne noise emitted by equipment for use outdoors by means of amendments to the technical annexes of the directive.</p>

	<p pid=".330W.5/1">The United Kingdom has protected zone status for Colorado beetle, making it an offence for the beetle to be moved into the country. To support this the Plant Health and Seeds Inspectorate in England and Wales and the similar inspectorates in Scotland and Northern Ireland inspect imports of plants and plant produce to ensure that the beetle, as well as many other pests and diseases, are not present. Added to this is the long-running campaign to promote and maintain a high level of public awareness of the beetle. This is instrumental in ensuring that members of the public, as well as importers and port operators, report findings of the beetle. These measures have all helped to prevent the Colorado beetle entering and establishing in the UK. Should an outbreak be detected, the Department has contingency plans to contain and eradicate the pest.</p>

	<p pid=".331W.3/1">In Lancashire, in common with the rest of the country, the farmgate price of milk has been falling for the last two months. The most recent official figures show that for milk delivered in March the average farmgate price of milk in the UK had fallen to 18.04 pence per litre. However, we expect the average milk price paid to farmers (in May) for milk delivered in April to fall substantially, reflecting the price cuts announced by many purchasers and reported widely in the trade press.</p>
	<p pid=".331W.3/2">The reasons for this fall are complex, but it is principally due to unusually high production in the UK so far this year, which has lead to severe competition between milk purchasers to find customers, at a time of weak world and Community markets for dairy commodities. The Government cannot, of course, prevent such overproduction and negotiations between farmers and purchasers, purchasers and their customers, or indeed, processors and supermarkets, are a commercial matter in which the Government cannot get involved. The Government can, however, influence the environment in which price negotiations take place through the Milk and Milk Products Management Committee and we have supported measures taken in Brussels to support EU markets and encourage exports.</p>
	<p pid=".331W.3/3">The Department received representations from the industry on the payment of agrimoney aid to the dairy sector. While we acknowledge the difficulties that the sector is facing and are working with them on the recommendations of the Policy Commission on the Future of Farming and Food, and the Milk Task Force, we decided not to make a claim for these funds given the many competing demands on the Exchequer at present.</p>

	<p pid=".332W.5/1">All pesticides used in this country, including Atrazine, must be approved by Ministers. Approval is only granted following thorough scientific evaluation of the risk that the pesticide might pose to people, wildlife and to the wider environment. Only if this evaluation shows that there is no unacceptable risk will approval be granted.</p>
	<p pid=".332W.5/2">Both the UK and the EU systems for regulating pesticides contain routine review programmes of older pesticides to ensure they meet current safety standards. Atrazine is currently being reviewed as part of the EU programme with the UK acting as Rapporteur Member State. The review covers both the possible effects of Atrazine on human health and the environment. The UK's report on Atrazine is currently being considered by the EU Standing Committee on Plant Health with particular attention being given to the levels of Atrazine found in ground water.</p>
	<p pid=".332W.5/3">In the UK restrictions were placed on the agricultural uses of Atrazine in 1992 as there had been widespread breaches of the EU Drinking Water Directive's limit. However, the levels found did not endanger the health of consumers or damage the environment.</p>

	<p pid=".339W.5/2">Different approaches to telecommunications planning apply in England and the devolved Administrations. In England, the installation of any telecommunications mast in protected areas, such as national parks, areas of outstanding natural beauty, sites of special scientific interest and conservation areas, and of masts above 15 metres in height elsewhere, is subject to an application for planning permission for determination by the local planning authority. The installation of masts up to 15 metres in height, elsewhere, would be subject to a prior approval procedure under Part 24 of Schedule 2 to the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 1995 (as amended). The planning arrangements do not distinguish between different generations of telecommunications equipment. The devolved Administrations have their own planning regulations.</p>
	<p pid=".339W.5/3">On <phrase class="date" code="2002-08-22">22 August</phrase> last year, following consultation, we introduced changes that significantly improved the planning procedures and guidance for telecommunications mast development in England. Our changes, which included amendments to the 1995 Order, were:</p>
	<p pid=".339W.5/4" class="indent">strengthened public consultation requirements on mast proposals of 15 metres and below so that they are the same as for planning applications;</p>
	<p pid=".339W.5/5" class="indent">increased the time for an authority to deal with prior approval applications to 56 days;</p>
	<p pid=".339W.5/6" class="indent">underlined that school governors must be consulted on all proposals for new masts on or near a school or college; and</p>
	<p pid=".339W.5/7" class="indent">increased fees to enable authorities to carry out full public consultation.</p>
	<p pid=".339W.5/8">These arrangements give authorities more time to consider proposals but with consent deemed to be granted if no decision has been made after 56 days so that development is not delayed.</p>
	<p pid=".339W.5/9">The new arrangements strike the right balance by improving consultation with local people while minimising delay for the rollout of telecommunications networks and giving the 45 million people who use mobile phones the service they want.</p>

	<p pid=".343W.6/2">The Advisory Committee on Restrictive Practices and Dominant Positions is the body through which the European Commission carries out its duty to consult member states on decisions and amendments to EC competition law which it proposes to adopt. For the UK, DTI and Office of Fair Trading officials and, where transport issues are under discussion, DTLR officials attend meetings of the committee.</p>
	<p pid=".343W.6/3">The committee meets only when there are decisions or legislative proposals to discuss. In the last 12 months, there have been four meetings on air transport matters and two on maritime transport. Issues currently on the agenda are a proposed extension of Air Transport Regulation 1617/93, the granting of clearance to a co-operation agreement between Lufthansa and Austrian Airlines and a review of Maritime Transport Regulation 4056/86.</p>
	<p pid=".343W.6/4">The process is transparent. The Commission publishes in the <i>Official Journal</i> of the European Communities the draft of any proposed change to legislation in advance of the committee meeting at which it will be discussed. Adopted decisions, which are open to challenge at the European Court of Justice, are also published in the <i>Official Journal</i>.</p>

	<p pid=".351W.0/1">We would like to see more children travelling to school by bus, especially where it is too far for them to walk or cycle or it is not safe for them to do so. There are currently two first yellow school bus pilots running in England with a further one due to start shortly in Wales. Once these pilot schemes have been running for about a year, they will be comprehensively evaluated by consultants working for my Department. Depending on the results of this evaluation, we will then consider whether we wish to encourage wider take-up of yellow school bus schemes, and if so how we will go about doing it.</p>

Only posts in the Royal Marines General Service, Household Cavalry, Royal Armoured Corps, the Infantry and Royal Air Force Regiment remain closed for reasons of combat effectiveness.</p>
	<p pid=".363W.2/2">Following a detailed study into the performance and suitability of women in these close-combat roles, I have concluded that the case for lifting the current restrictions has not been made. I am today placing in the House of Commons Library the report of this study, entitled &quot;Women in the Armed Forces&quot;, together with a short paper explaining the reasons for the decision.</p>
	<p pid=".363W.2/3">Although women are, on average, less able to meet the physical demands of these roles, some women would certainly be able to do so and this was not, therefore, in itself, a reason to exclude them.</p>
	<p pid=".363W.2/4">The key issue was whether the inclusion of women in close combat teams could adversely affect the combat effectiveness of those teams in a high-intensity direct fire battle. All the units in question operate primarily in small units as fire teams or tank crews.</p>
	<p pid=".363W.2/5">The evidence available suggests that on operations other than close combat the presence of women in small units does not affect performance detrimentally. However, there is no evidence to show whether this remains the case under the extraordinary conditions of high intensity close combat.</p>
	<p pid=".363W.2/6">Given the lack of relevant direct evidence, from either field studies or the experience of other countries, I have concluded that military judgment must form the basis of the decision. The military advice is that under the conditions of a high-intensity, close-quarter battle, group cohesion becomes of much greater significance to team performance and, in such an environment, the consequences of failure can have far-reaching and grave consequences. To admit women, therefore, would involve a risk without any offsetting gains in terms of combat effectiveness.</p>
	<p pid=".363W.2/7">The Sex Discrimination Act 1975 allows the armed forces to exclude women from close combat posts. The judgment of the European Court of Justice in Sirdar <i>v</i>. the Army Board and the Secretary of State and relevant European Community equality law uphold that position, subject to a requirement periodically to assess the position.</p>
	<p pid=".363W.2/8">The Ministry of Defence is committed to equality of opportunity consistent with the need to maintain combat effectiveness. It will continue to work with the Equal Opportunities Commission and discuss with it the results of further work to examine the wider issues raised by this study. Women must have the same opportunities as men to progress to the highest ranks.</p>

	<p pid=".365W.0/2">As part of the Government's wider market initiative, RAF Strike Command is considering the feasibility for commercial exploitation of irreducible spare capacity at RAF Leuchars. No other airfields in Scotland have so far been considered. The RAF Leuchars study is at an early stage with the team currently examining whether commercial exploitation of irreducible spare capacity is feasible. As a part of this work, consultants have sought the views of the airline operator community; however, the detailed findings are commercially sensitive. The feasibility study has no remit to address the issue of what the costs might be for a commercial airline company to operate scheduled services from RAF Leuchars. Initial indications suggest that there might be some irreducible surplus airfield capacity at RAF Leuchars. However, until the Ministry of Defence formally seeks proposals from industry as part of an open and competitive process, my officials cannot fully evaluate the potential for the commercial exploitation at RAF Leuchars. A security assessment has not been undertaken at this stage of the feasibility study.</p>
	<p pid=".365W.0/3">Some three weeks ago, Ryan Air expressed an interest in introducing new routes into Scotland, possibly using RAF airfields. Their formal proposals are awaited. No Ministry of Defence Minister or official has met representatives of commercial airline companies to discuss the commercial use of RAF stations in Scotland. Apart from occasional use by civil air operators permitted by existing MOD regulations, no formal proposals have been put forward by airline companies for the operation of scheduled services from any of the RAF stations located in Scotland.</p>

	<p pid=".368W.10/2">Under the enhanced heavily indebted poor countries (HIPC) initiative eligible countries should receive debt relief from all creditors. However, a number of commercial creditors decline to provide debt relief and sue the HIPC for payment. Vulture funds specialise in purchasing debt at a discount in the secondary market and then suing for repayment in full. At their last meeting, HIPC Finance Ministers raised the issue of lawsuits against them from various creditors in their declaration. The UK Government has proposed that the international community should consider giving technical assistance to any HIPC being sued by a commercial creditor and provide expert financial advice on debt restructuring to prevent future claims.</p>

	<p pid=".369W.3/1">I have today signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the Government of Jamaica to enable joint action to combat the use of air passengers to smuggle cocaine into the UK concealed in their bodies. The UK will be providing technical assistance and intelligence support to enable the Jamaican authorities to detect potential cocaine couriers before they board flights to the UK and take appropriate enforcement action.</p>
	<p pid=".369W.3/2">Action in Jamaica will be supported by increased activity by Customs here in the UK. As part of the recent Budget package, the Chancellor of the Exchequer has increased the resources available to Customs for law enforcement action at the frontier. Customs will be deploying more than 30 additional specialist anti- smuggling staff to combat a range of smuggling threats. Their first priority will be to enhance controls on flights arriving from Jamaica, focusing on identifying any couriers who have escaped detection in Jamaica and on the smuggling of cocaine in passengers' baggage and air freight.</p>
	<p pid=".369W.3/3">Customs will continue to work closely with a number of police forces, including the Metropolitan police's Operation Trident team, to maximise the impact of their efforts on cocaine smuggling and on associated, often violent, criminality across the UK.</p>

	<p pid=".374W.2/1">The Department reviewed the performance of SchlumbergerSema against a series of performance targets and other contractual obligations to be met by <phrase class="date" code="2002-03-31">31 March 2002</phrase> and has confirmed the contract extension to August 2005.</p>
	<p pid=".374W.2/2">The agreement with SchlumbergerSema contained a total of 45 key performance targets. These targets, in each of the three contract packages, covered the following areas:</p>
	<p pid=".374W.2/3" class="indent">IB examinations</p>
	<p pid=".374W.2/4" class="indent">DLA primary target for examinations</p>
	<p pid=".374W.2/5" class="indent">IISB primary and secondary examination targets</p>
	<p pid=".374W.2/6" class="indent">Customers turned away unseen</p>
	<p pid=".374W.2/7" class="indent">Customer waiting time</p>
	<p pid=".374W.2/8" class="indent">Customer satisfaction levels</p>
	<p pid=".374W.2/9" class="indent">Percentage of unacceptable (C grade medical reports)</p>
	<p pid=".374W.2/10" class="indent">Compliance with medical scrutiny guidelines</p>
	<p pid=".374W.2/11" class="indent">Complaint turnaround time and quality levels [ 5 targets]</p>
	<p pid=".374W.2/12" class="indent">Rework accuracy.</p>
	<p pid=".374W.2/13">SchlumbergerSema met 43 out of the 45 targets set by <phrase class="date" code="2002-03-31">31 March</phrase> and met the remaining 2 targets during April 2002.</p>
	<p pid=".374W.2/14">In addition to the key performance targets, the contract contains a number of other performance measures, the vast majority of which are now being achieved. Performance is formally monitored on a monthly basis. If performance falls below agreed targets remedial action is taken, including the application of financial remedies where appropriate.</p>
	<p pid=".374W.2/15">During 2000 (prior to the Department setting targets relating to contract extension) the Department set four challenging targets where tangible improvement in medical quality was required. These were:</p>
	<p pid=".374W.2/16">Within six months to reduce by 10 per cent. the proportion of &quot;C grade&quot; medical reports which fail to meet the Department's standards; and within one year to reduce the proportion of &quot;C grade&quot; reports across all benefits to less than 5 per cent.</p>
	<p pid=".374W.2/17">Within one year to demonstrate improvement in compliance with the agreed medical scrutiny guidelines for Incapacity Benefit claims so that the proportion of non-compliant reports is less than 5 per cent.</p>
	<p pid=".374W.2/18">Within one year to deliver training to all doctors covering: the assessment of people with mental health problems; behaviours, attitudes and sensitivities for dealing with people with disabilities; and distress- avoiding techniques for the examination of people with musculo-skeletal conditions.</p>
	<p pid=".374W.2/19">Within two years to improve customer satisfaction rates to at least 90 per cent.</p>
	<p pid=".374W.2/20">These service targets have all been met. The agreement to extend the Contract contains a further set of quality improvement measures, including even more challenging measures relating to the quality of medical reports, together with new a doctor capability measure and a new complaints target.</p>
	<p pid=".374W.2/21">Additionally, the agreement commits SchlumbergerSema to a programme of doctor recruitment and requires them to deliver a number of other important initiatives. These include:</p>
	<p pid=".374W.2/22">National implementation of the &quot;Did Not Attend&quot; initiative which will reduce the number of claimants who are given an appointment but fail to attend. Results from the pilot undertaken show significant reductions and this new process will be rolled out across all Medical Service Centres by the end of June 2002.</p>
	<p pid=".374W.2/23">National implementation of &quot;Evidence Based Medicine&quot; which aims to secure more consistency in conducting medical examinations and to improve the quality of medical reports by using fully researched medical protocols for examination supported by an IT application.</p>
	<p pid=".374W.2/24">Piloting a new approach to evidence gathering where Doctors advising on Incapacity Benefit claims will have access to relevant medical information from the claimant's General Practitioner case notes.</p>
	<p pid=".374W.2/25">Contractual milestones for the remaining life of the extended contract have been agreed for each of the key improvement projects underway, supported by financial remedies for failure to deliver against key milestones. The Department, through joint Project and Programme Boards, will continue to monitor closely the progress of each project.</p>
	<p pid=".374W.2/26">The Department has also secured a range of other contractual improvements including greater cost transparency to underpin future commercial negotiations.</p>

	<p pid=".380W.2/2">The information on reciprocal social security agreements with other countries follows.</p>
	<p pid=".380W.2/3">The main purpose of such reciprocal agreements is to protect the social security position of workers moving between the two countries during their working lives. They prevent employees, their employers and the self-employed from having to pay social security contributions to both the home state and the state of employment at the same time and ensure that such workers' rights to certain benefits are maintained. They vary to some extent from country to country depending on the nature and scope of the other country's social security scheme. Generally, they cover contributory benefits in respect of the following contingencies: sickness, invalidity, unemployment, retirement, bereavement and industrial injuries. Workers who have contributed to both countries' schemes during their working lives can usually receive an old age pension from each country which reflects the proportionate amount or their insurance in, or contributions to, each country's scheme.</p>

	<p pid=".383W.3/1">The Multiannual Community programme to stimulate the development and use of European digital content on the global networks and to promote the linguistic diversity in the information society (known as the eContent programme) was established under Council Decision 2001/48/EC. The Decision required the establishment of a committee, the mandate of which is to assist the Commission in running the programme. In particular the Committee will be informed of progress with the implementation of the programme as a whole on at least a half yearly basis. The Commission will also seek approval of the Committee for the funding of any projects with a Community contribution of over 700,000 euros. The Committee has met three times over the last 12 months. The UK representation is usually one official from the Department for Trade and Industry. It is not possible to calculate the cost to public funds of the work of the Committee without incurring disproportionate cost.</p>
	<p pid=".383W.3/2">Current issues before the Committee are drawing up a new work programme for the second half of the programme and overseeing a mid-term evaluation of the programme. It will also be involved in preparing a call for proposals towards the end of the year.</p>

As an obligation to this Decision, the Commission undertook to publish an annual report on the working of committees.

	<p pid=".389W.5/2">The items under discussion include the type and quality of information transmitted to the Commission for publication in the <i>Official Journal of the European Communities</i> and distributed to member states under various Articles contained within the regulation; areas of concern encountered by member states in implementing the regulation and addressing potential difficulties before they arise; and the exchange of views relating to a recent questionnaire distributed by the Commission to candidate countries concerning implementation of the regulation. The Co-ordination Group has met four times in the last 12 months and is attended by officials from the Department of Trade and Industry and other Government Departments as appropriate. Information on the annual cost to the UK Government is not held centrally and could be provided only at disproportionate cost.</p>
	<p pid=".389W.5/3">The committee has no power to take decisions that have any legal effect. Where the need for change to the regulation is found it is for the Commission to bring forward proposals for legislative amendments and all such proposals are subject to scrutiny in accordance with the existing arrangements for parliamentary scrutiny of Community legislation.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2002-05-22.55650.r0" oldstyleid="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2002-05-22.396W.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/960" speakername="Patricia Hewitt" colnum="396W"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200102/cmhansrd/vo020522/text/20522w16.htm#20522w16.html_spnew21">
	<p pid=".396W.0/1">I am answering these questions together since the individual programmes mentioned are all activities which come under the EU's multiannual framework programme for actions in the energy sector (1998&ndash;2002). The mandate for these activities is set out in Council Decision 1999/21/EC of <phrase class="date" code="1998-12-14">14 December 1998</phrase>. One committee meets in six different configurations. The aim of the framework programme is to contribute to the balanced pursuit of the energy policy objectives of security of supply, competitiveness and protection of the environment. A list of related Decisions follows.</p>
	<p pid=".396W.0/2">The role of the committee in the respective configurations is as follows: under the ALTENER Decision, the committee promotes renewable energy sources; under the SURE Decision the committee promotes safety of nuclear installations in countries supported by the EU's TACIS (Technical Assistance for the Commonwealth of Independent States) programme; under the CARNOT Decision the committee promotes the development and effective use of clean solid fuel technologies; under the SYNERGY Decision the committee reinforces international energy co-operation with reference to improving security of energy supply and improving countries' abilities to meet their environmental obligations under the Kyoto Convention; and under the ETAP Decision the Committee undertakes a programme of studies, analyses, forecasts and other related work concerning the future development of energy policy within the Community.</p>
	<p pid=".396W.0/3">Generally, the committee meets once per year in respect of each Decision. With the exceptions of its responsibilities under the ETAP Decision (for which there was no meeting in the period in question) and under the ALTENER and SAVE Decisions (on which the committee met twice combining the two subjects), the committee met to discuss each individual Decision once in the past 12 months (April 2001 to end of March 2002). Each meeting lasted one day with the exception of the second meeting on ALTENER/SAVE which lasted two days. Attendance is by an official from this Department with the exception of SAVE which is attended by an official from the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. The committee discussed issues relating to SURE in the same meeting as it discussed SYNERGY. These factors together make for a total of five meetings over the past year. It is not possible to calculate the cost to public funds of the work of the committee without incurring disproportionate cost.</p>
	<p pid=".396W.0/4">There are two key items currently under the consideration of the Committee of the Energy Framework Programme. The first is the result of the mid-term evaluation of the programme (1998&ndash;2002) carried out by independent experts. The second key item under the committee's consideration is the Commission's proposal for a Multiannual Programme for Action in the Field of Energy: &quot;Intelligent Energy for European&quot; Programme (2003&ndash;06) (COM (2002) 162 FINAL. This is in large part a continuation of existing activities in the Energy Framework Programme (1998&ndash;2002) though it would introduce also a new programme on the energy aspects of transport. In respect of SYNERGY, the committee will be considering applications for project support under the next SYNERGY tender later this year. The next meeting (to be arranged) in respect of ALTENER/SAVE will be considering the evaluation of the final call for proposals which closed in April 2002. The next meeting in respect of CARNOT will be doing likewise&mdash;though the Commission may decide to deal with this by written procedure. It is likely that EU support under SURE and ETAP will be discontinued.</p>

The first report was deposited in the Libraries of both Houses on <phrase class="date" code="2002-02-26">26 February 2002</phrase> (COM(2001)783 Final).</p>
	<p pid=".396W.0/7">As part of the review process, the UK Government have encouraged the Commission to produce and maintain an electronic database of every comitology committee, its agendas and recent actions, to be accessible through its website.</p>

	<p pid=".399W.8/2">The &pound;20 million first phase of the Major Photovoltaics Demonstration Programme is designed specifically to support the installation of solar electricity systems. Our rationale for supporting photovoltaics is that it is a technology at a relatively early stage of development, but with significant potential for further cost reduction and for meeting our electricity needs in the future. There are no plans to include support for other forms of solar energy under this programme.</p>

	<p pid=".400W.8/2">ECGD considers each case on its merits in order to determine the level of support that is appropriate.</p>
	<p pid=".400W.8/3">ECGD and other European Union export credit agencies can collaborate to support multi-national transactions in a number of ways. Increasingly, use is made of re-insurance between the agencies which often allows a single export credit guarantee or insurance policy to be issued for such a transaction by one agency acting as lead insurer. Liability is then borne by each of the other export credit agencies according to its re-insured share of the transaction.</p>
	<p pid=".400W.8/4">Sometimes each agency provides support for its own national content (possibly together with some non- national content) through the issues of separate guarantees or insurance.</p>
	<p pid=".400W.8/5">European Union export credit agencies may also provide support for both their own national and each others national content under reciprocal arrangements.</p>

	<p pid=".404W.13/3">I understand that Highlands and Islands Enterprise, in co-operation with Scottish Enterprise, is undertaking a study into the availability of LPG in Scotland. We expect this study to report its findings in July this year.</p>
	<p pid=".404W.13/4">If the wholesale or retail price for vehicle fuel raises competition concerns it should be brought to the attention of the Director General of Fair Trading, who is responsible for investigating allegations of anti- competitive behaviour. The Director General has investigated allegations of differential pricing in Highlands and Islands by oil companies and has found that the competition legislation has not been breached.</p>
	<p pid=".404W.13/5">The issue of the level of fuel taxation needs to be reviewed in the context of the overall cost of motoring taxes. Independent research commissioned by my Department has shown that the levels of taxation paid by private motorists in Scotland are lower than in other European countries such as Netherlands, Finland, Ireland and even Portugal.</p>
	<p pid=".404W.13/6">The Scottish Executive assists rural petrol stations through the operation of the rural petrol station grant (RPSG) scheme. This scheme aims to help maintain a network of rural petrol stations by assisting rural petrol stations to meet the cost of tank and pump replacement and to deal with ground water problems. This was expanded to include the installation of LPG tanks and dispensers in 2000. To date, 41 rural petrol stations have been supported under the RPSG scheme. Total awards made since the scheme commenced in 1998 are now &pound;856,765.</p>

	<p pid=".409W.2/1">With the Freedom of Information Act 2000 we have legislated to give to the people of this country, for the first time ever, a general statutory right to know. The timetable we have announced will ensure that full implementation of this new right is completed 11 months before the statutory deadline set out in the Act itself. The publication scheme provisions of the Act will be implemented first, on a rolling programme, starting with central Government in 2002. This roll out will be completed in June 2004 and the individual right of access to information held by all public authorities will be implemented in January 2005.</p>
	<p pid=".409W.2/2">This approach will give public authorities the time they need to put into effect the change of culture necessary to ensure the legal rights are delivered in practice. It also aligns with the 2004 target for the completion of the Government's electronic records management. This initiative will enable the fast retrieval and accurate creation and storage of records that will be necessary to meet the demands of the Freedom of Information Act.</p>
	<p pid=".409W.2/3">In his annual statutory report to Parliament in November 2001, the Lord Chancellor reported on the progress that had been made towards the implementation of the Act. In particular, he said that each Department had appointed a senior official to 'Champion' freedom of information within their Department and to lead culture change from the top of the organisation. Crucial developments are already taking place in the area of records management and Departments are preparing to meet the targets for the 2004 target for full electronic management of records. The Information Commissioner has already set up five pilot publication schemes with central Government organisation and I look forward to seeing similar pilots in local authorities and the police in the near future.</p>
	<p pid=".409W.2/4">The report also announced the formation of the Lord Chancellor's Advisory Group on Implementation of the Act. The group includes members from representative organisations from across the public sector and independent representatives to advise the Lord Chancellor on what users will need in order to take advantage of their rights under the Freedom of Information Act. It has already met twice and the next meeting will take place in July.</p>
	<p pid=".409W.2/5">A seminar for Ministers was held in March of this year, where Ministers were reminded of their key role in delivering compliance with the Act and a new culture of openness. In particular, we noted that there should be a Minister in each Department with responsibility for implementing freedom of information in that Department, its agencies and sponsored non-departmental public bodies; and those Ministers should take an active interest in the delivery of the Act within these Departments.</p>
	<p pid=".409W.2/6">I have recently completed a series of road shows around the country to raise awareness of the Act at a senior level in public authorities. These events were attended by around 1,000 officials from across the public sector and officials in my Department intend to run a series of workshops in the autumn to follow-up these road shows.</p>
	<p pid=".409W.2/7">This year's report, to be published in November, will contain further details of developments in all these areas. In the same month, publication schemes will come into force for central Government and other bodies already applying the Code of Practice on Access to Government Information. These schemes will provide greater access to information for all members of the public.</p>
	<p pid=".409W.2/8">Officials from the Freedom of Information and Data Protection Division in my Department have undertaken awareness-raising seminars and will continue to do so. These have been held in a wide range of Departments including: the Cabinet Office; the Home Office; the Department of Health; the Northern Ireland civil service as well as in my Department. Officials also speak at the civil service college course on freedom of information and have spoken on courses and conferences arranged by other organisations. In these sessions, officials are reminded of the requirement to comply with the existing Code of Practice on Access to Government Information when answering requests for information until the Freedom of Information Act comes fully into effect in January 2005.</p>
	<p pid=".409W.2/9">More information about the Code of Practice on Access to Government Information and the Freedom of Information Act 2000 is available on the Department's website at <a href="http://www.lcd.gov.uk">www.lcd.gov.uk</a>.</p>

	<p pid=".410W.2/1">There have been 77 magistrates' court houses closed since 1997 in England and Wales, as set out in the table. Of the 404 magistrates' courts in England and Wales currently in operation, almost all have had improvements made to them in one way or another, for example, improvements to environmental systems or enhancements to enable compliance with the Disability Discrimination Act or Health and Safety legislation, including security provisions.</p>
	<p pid=".410W.2/2">The Department is currently funding an ongoing programme of building works on magistrates' courts throughout England and Wales. It received a &pound;100 million capital grant allocation during the current Spending Review 2000 period for maintenance and other building enhancements. This is funding priority maintenance and improvement works such as facilities for victims and vulnerable witnesses, as well as Disability Discrimination Act and Security facilities. The grant provides 80 per cent. of the funding with a further 20 per cent. being provided by the local authority. There is also a public private partnership programme for the provision of new courts to meet the needs of a 21st century court system. &pound;210 million national credit approval (NCA) has been allocated over the CSR 2000 period.</p>
	<p pid=".410W.2/3">There have been 15 county court closures since 1997 in England and Wales, as set out in the table. There are two county court closure proposals (Gravesend and Gateshead) under consideration, both of which have gone out to public consultation.</p>
	<p pid=".410W.2/4">There have been no Crown court closures in England and Wales since 1997. There is, however, currently public consultation on the proposal to close the Crown court at Knutsford. Consultation commenced on <phrase class="date" code="2002-04-10">10 April</phrase> and will run until the end of May.</p>
	<p pid=".410W.2/5">There are 78 Crown court centres and 218 county courts (permanent) in England and Wales; many have had various renovation works undertaken. The nature of works covered varies but they include items such as health and safety works, security work, Disability Discrimination Act compliance and environmental improvements. In most instances these works have been undertaken within the scope of major maintenance schemes.</p>

It is for the originating Government Department to determine the release of papers relating to the royal family, wherever they are held. The policy under which this is conducted derives from the Open Government Code, which applies in the same way to public records relating to the royal family as it does to other public records. One of the Open Government criteria under which records may remain closed beyond 30 years covers documents whose release would cause 'substantial distress' either to an individual or to descendants of the individual. The inclusion of &quot;descendants&quot; means that the criterion may apply whether the relevant individual is alive or dead. Under the Open Government Code, 'potential embarrassment' is not a factor in determining closure or release.</p>

	<p pid=".418W.8/2">Resource effectiveness and affordability was one of the 10 criteria as part of the relative benefits of centralising transplantation services at Epsom and St. Helier NHS Trust, St. George's Healthcare NHS Trust or Guy's and St. Thomas' NHS Trust. The estimated short-term costs for centralising transplantation at either the St. George's or St. Helier sites are outlined in the consultation document as approximately &pound;320,000. The funding for a long-term purpose-built facility on either site would be subject to the development of an outline business case for consideration by the south-west London health authority. Any further development of a business case for an integrated facility at either site will be subject to the outcome of the public consultation on the future of renal transplantation services.</p>

	<p pid=".435W.2/1">The Human Resources and Equality Unit was created in its current form in May 1999, taking over functions from various other units at that time. It is responsible for pay and industrial relations for the Home Office, excluding the Prison Service and other agencies; human resource planning; diversity issues among Home Office staff; and for helping to modernise personnel systems in use across the Home Office.</p>

The Association is affiliated to the Civil Service Sports Council.</p>
	<p pid=".435W.2/5">The Association does not employ any staff. However the Home Office, since at least 1970, has provided it with a secretary and one assistant. The cost to the Home Office of the Association in 2001&ndash;02 was &pound;37,000, which covers the cost of the Secretariat. All money administered by the Association is received from staff through the Civil Service Sports Council and profits from a monthly work place lottery.</p>
