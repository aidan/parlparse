	<p pid="b.6W.5/2">Estimates of the carbon dioxide emissions arising from the construction (i.e. embedded carbon) of HS2 are set out in HS2 Ltd's December 2009 report and supporting documents. Total embedded carbon emissions are estimated at 1.2MtCO2, within a range of +0.29MtCO2 to +2.12MtCO2. This currently amounts to less than 1% of a single year's emissions from transport.</p>
	<p pid="b.6W.5/3">HS2 Ltd has estimated that the overall carbon impact of a new London-West Midlands high speed line would be broadly neutral. These impacts should be considered alongside the new line's economic benefits and, in particular, its capacity to cater for additional demand for inter-urban transport caused by long-term economic growth and to improve journey times between key economic centres. Looked at in the round, I do not believe that any other option can offer the same balance of environmental and economic benefits as high speed rail.</p>

It covers a wide range of animal collections, from large traditional zoos to butterfly gardens, and the Department's assessment is that sanctuaries may fall within the definition. The Act provides that where small numbers of animals are kept, or where the collection has only a small number of different species, dispensations can be made which reduce the inspection requirements for those establishments.

	<p pid="b.21W.5/1">It is a condition of their employment that members of the diplomatic service must be prepared to serve anywhere in the world at any time during their career, sometimes at very short notice. Those with children have a legal obligation as parents to ensure that their children receive a full-time education from the age of five years. Most parents prefer to take their children with them abroad, but in some countries we do not permit staff to take their children either for health or security reasons. In others, local schools of an acceptable standard are not available. It is long-standing practice that the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) helps staff meet their potentially conflicting obligations by providing financial support for their children's education in the UK where staff choose this, or are obliged to do so given local conditions in the country to which they are posted. Continuity of education is also an important factor, particularly at secondary level.</p>
	<p pid="b.21W.5/2">The FCO refunds standard term fees up to a ceiling which is reviewed annually. Staff choosing a more expensive school must pay the difference in cost themselves. The maximum amount the FCO will pay is determined by an independent survey conducted by ECA International, which is used by public and private sector employers whose staff work across the world. Various factors, including availability of places (sometimes at short notice) and proximity of other family members, influence which schools staff choose for their children. The FCO would allow staff children to attend the schools listed but would only refund fees up to the ceiling. The ceiling figure for a senior boarder for the academic year 2010-11 is &#163;8,236 per term. All but one of the schools named in the question charge fees above the ceiling, so parents using these schools would have to contribute to the fees.</p>
	<p pid="b.21W.5/3">We cannot provide details of payments made in connection with specific schools. This is necessary to avoid disclosures that could identify individual members of staff and their families.</p>

The Wellington-based Governor and Deputy Governor visit at least once a year and, on her visit to the island in September 2010, our current Governor discussed with the community ongoing development work to move Pitcairn towards greater self-sustainability, including the Government's investment in a windpower project to reduce its reliance on diesel.</p>

	<p pid="b.25W.3/1">Freedom of expression is a right recognised by the Constitution of Uganda. I am encouraged by some reports of progress in upholding this right, including the recent abolition of the crime of sedition by the Constitutional Court of Uganda, and continuing evidence of free and lively debate in Uganda's media. But I am concerned by reports of restrictions on freedom of expression, including the impounding by the Uganda Revenue Authority at Entebbe Airport of a shipment of Dr Kobusingye's book &quot;The Correct Line, Uganda under Museveni&quot;.</p>

This contradicted an earlier statement to Parliament by the Minister, in which he suggested that the shipment had been impounded for security reasons. I understand that part of the shipment has now been released and that Uganda's <i> Daily Monitor</i> newspaper is serialising Dr Kobusingye's book for a wide readership.</p>
	<p pid="b.25W.3/3">We will continue to raise the importance of upholding fundamental rights, including freedom of expression, with the Government of Uganda. This will be particularly important as Uganda prepares for presidential and parliamentary elections in 2011.</p>

	<p pid="b.25W.6/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2010-06-09">9 June 2010</phrase>, an opposition rally in Kampala led by Dr Kizza Besigye was broken up by the police. Members of a vigilante group known as the 'Kiboko Squad' assaulted Dr Besigye and other demonstrators. Members of the Kiboko Squad were arrested following the assault but were subsequently released without charge. We have raised concerns directly with the head of Uganda's police and the Ugandan Government about the activities of the Kiboko Squad. We have also raised the importance of the police balancing its responsibility to maintain order with its duty to act as an independent body that respects the freedoms of expression and assembly.</p>
	<p pid="b.25W.6/2">We assess that Uganda has made some progress in improving the framework for its next elections in 2011, partly in response to the recommendations of the Observation Missions to the 2006 elections. These include amendments to electoral legislation and update of the voter register. We do however retain concerns about the evenness of the playing field between Government and Opposition, and challenges to freedom of expression and assembly. It will be particularly important to the prospects for free, fair and peaceful elections in 2011 that Uganda's Electoral Commission and the Ugandan police force demonstrate their independence and competence during the campaign period and in the organisation of the polls.</p>
	<p pid="b.25W.6/3">We are providing a range of assistance to support democratisation in Uganda, including technical support to the Electoral Commission through a Deepening Democracy Programme funded by the Department for International Development. We will also continue to raise the importance of free, fair and peaceful elections with the Ugandan authorities and Uganda's political leaders. I did so myself with President Museveni and Professor Ogenga Latigo, the Leader of the Opposition in Parliament, when I visited Uganda in July.</p>

	<p pid="b.34W.6/1">The following table shows the total number of offenders released from determinate custodial sentences in each year from 1998-2009; the number and proportion who were released before the scheduled end of sentence; and the number and proportion who were released at or after the scheduled end of sentence. This is the most recent data available, and figures for 1997 are not held centrally.</p>
	<p pid="b.34W.6/2">The term &quot;scheduled end of sentence&quot; has been interpreted as the normal statutory release date when prisoners serving determinate sentences must be released automatically (e.g. the half-way point for prisoners serving a standard determinate sentence under the Criminal Justice Act 2003). Over the period 1998-2009, offenders could be released before their scheduled end of sentence under two early release schemes: Home Detention Curfew (which was introduced in 1999) and End of Custody Licence (which was introduced on <phrase class="date" code="2007-06-29">29 June 2007</phrase> and withdrawn in March 2010).</p>
	<p pid="b.34W.6/3">Using the data held centrally, it is not possible to distinguish between those released after and on the day of their scheduled end of sentence. The table therefore shows a total for these two groups.</p>

Now that the outcome of the Spending Review has been announced, the Ministry of Justice will decide how funding is to be allocated.

	<p pid="b.40W.2/1">The average direct establishment cost of keeping a person in prison for the years from 1997 is as detailed in the following table.</p>
	<p pid="b.40W.2/2">These average costs comprise the prison establishments' direct resource expenditure as published in the Annual Report and Accounts of Her Majesty's Prison Service (HMPS) (or for 2008-9 in an addendum to the NOMS Agency Annual Report and Accounts). Costs are allocated to categories on the basis of the major use of each prison at the end of each year.</p>
	<p pid="b.40W.2/3">In addition, for the two years 2007-08 and 2008-09 an overall cost per prisoner has been calculated and is included in the table. The overall average costs comprise the public and private sector establishments' direct resource expenditure, increased by an apportionment of costs borne centrally by HMPS and the National Offender Management Service. This involves some estimation. The figures do not include prisoners held in police and court cells under Operation Safeguard, nor expenditure met by other Government Departments (e.g. for health and education). The prisoner escort service is included.</p>
	<p pid="b.40W.2/4">Due to changes in scope and accounting treatment over this period, the figures are not necessarily directly comparable. Figures are subject to rounding.</p>
	<p pid="b.40W.2/5">Figures for 2009-10 are being produced and will be published later in the year.</p>

However, the employment tribunal does not hold information centrally on the number of owners of businesses, employing 10 people or fewer, who have applied to participate in the tribunal system as there is no business need or benefit in doing so. The information can be provided only at a disproportionate cost by manually checking each individual case file.

	<p pid="b.48W.2/1">Structural adjustment programmes (SAPs) were economic policy reform programmes supported by World Bank and International Monetary Fund (IMF) lending in the 1980s and 1990s, which aimed to improve macro-economic stability and economic growth. The SAPs of the 1990s helped to lay the macro-economic policy foundations for many sub-Saharan African countries to achieve faster economic growth since 2000. However, they were often criticised for inducing adverse social impacts.</p>
	<p pid="b.48W.2/2">The poverty reduction strategy paper (PRSP) approach was launched by the World Bank and IMF in 1999 to help guide their financing and aid received from other donors, and to ensure that debt relief under the heavily indebted poor countries (HIPC) programme would help to reduce poverty. Core principles of PRSPs are that strategies are country-owned, multi-year and designed to achieve poverty reduction results, particularly those linked to the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). PRSPs are still the basis for many World Bank and IMF lending programmes.</p>
	<p pid="b.48W.2/3">There have been numerous assessments of the impacts of SAPs and PRSPs. The Secretary of State has not made a formal assessment of the effectiveness of SAPs or PRSP's in reducing poverty in sub-Saharan Africa. What we are interested in going forward, is how to make faster progress against the MDGs and deliver value for money with all UK aid.</p>

My right hon. Friend the Home Secretary and I have both met French counterparts to discuss migration issues, including the juxtaposed controls and wider bilateral co-operation, and it is expected that agreement will soon be reached on the next phase of UK-France collaboration at the border controls at Calais and other northern ports.</p>
	<p pid="b.62W.2/2">The Secretary of State has not held any recent discussions with the French Government on border controls at Paris Gare du Nord or Charles de Gaulle airport. The UK Border Agency operates immigration controls at Gare du Nord where UK Border Agency officials are in regular contact with their French counterparts about matters of mutual interest and to ensure the security of the UK border. No rail services operate to the UK from Charles de Gaulle Airport and there is no UK border control at the location.</p>

	<p pid="b.65W.0/1">Since <phrase class="date" code="2004-01-01">1 January 2004</phrase>, extradition between EU member states has been governed by the Framework Decision on the European Arrest Warrant (EAW). The Serious Organised Crime Agency (SOCA) and Crown Office (for Scotland) are the designated central authorities for the receipt and transmission of EAWs within the UK. Under the EAW process &quot;surrender&quot; is used to describe &quot;extradited&quot; and &quot;transferred&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.65W.0/2">Since the inception of the EAW on <phrase class="date" code="2004-01-01">1 January 2004</phrase> up to <phrase class="date" code="2010-03-31">31 March 2010</phrase>, 145 UK citizens have been surrendered to other European member states pursuant to EAWs. Information on the member state that issued the EAW is available for the period <phrase class="date" code="2008-10-01">1 October 2008</phrase> to <phrase class="date" code="2010-03-31">31 March 2010</phrase>. It should be noted that surrenders do not correlate to the requests made in the same period. Some surrenders can occur weeks or months following the initial request. The following tables identify the member states that made the request.</p>
	<p pid="b.65W.0/3">Data on the member states which have issued EAWs for 101 UK citizens surrendered in the period prior to <phrase class="date" code="2008-10-01">1 October 2008</phrase> are unavailable. These data could be provided only by a manual examination of all SOCA case records for that period. This would incur a disproportionate cost.</p>
	<p pid="b.65W.0/4">The nationality of persons subject to extradition requests from EU member states was not routinely recorded prior to 2004. To provide the figures for 1997 to 2004 would incur disproportionate cost as this would require a manual examination of Home Office files.</p>
	<p pid="b.65W.0/5">The third table shows the number of extradition requests made to England and Wales (and Northern Ireland since <phrase class="date" code="2008-04-01">1 April 2008</phrase>) and processed by the Home Office since 1997. Due to the way in which extradition requests have been recorded by the Home Office, the following information will include all requests made outside the EAW framework. It will therefore include some requests made by EU member states prior to them operating the EAW. It has not been possible to break down these numbers so as to identify either the person's nationality or the state which requested extradition as this would entail a manual examination of all files, which would again incur disproportionate cost.</p>
	<p pid="b.65W.0/6">Finally, it should also be emphasised that an extradition request is not always finalised in the same year as a request is made. The figures quoted may, therefore, include extradition requests made before 1997.</p>

	<p pid="b.76W.2/1">The available data are provided in the following tables which show the total contracted hours lost to sickness by police force, 2007-08 to 2009-10. Figures are provided as 'hours lost' rather than 'days lost', as days lost to sickness are not collected centrally. This provides more accurate figures as it allows for the effect of different shift lengths.</p>

We have a rich diversity of voluntary organisations, charities, faith groups, co-operatives, social enterprises and local housing trusts-all of who already make a huge contribution to local life. The big society means using their potential and involving them even more in delivering what people want. I do not expect local authorities to respond by passing on disproportionate cuts to other service providers, especially the voluntary sector.</p>

	<p pid="b.93W.12/1">The Gould Report identified a number of contributory factors which led to a high number of spoilt ballot papers in 2007. Most of these, such as the introduction of a new electoral system and combined ballot papers, will not be in play on <phrase class="date" code="2011-05-05">5 May 2011</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.93W.12/2">The Report also recognised that there are benefits to combining elections such as reducing cost, achieving higher turnout and minimising disruption to voters. In evidence to the Scottish Affairs Committee on <phrase class="date" code="2010-09-21">21 September 2010</phrase>, Mr Ron Gould said:</p>
	<p pid="b.93W.12/3" class="indent">&quot;I do not believe that the same factors which led to voter confusion and the large number of rejected ballots at the last Scottish Parliamentary and Municipal elections would arise if both the (Scottish) Parliamentary Election and the Referendum were held on the same date. The marking of yes or no on a referendum ballot is much easier to understand and carry out than the requirements of marking an STV ballot.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.93W.12/4">The Electoral Commission will be responsible for running the referendum. After the Parliamentary Voting System and Constituencies Bill was introduced, the Commission released a statement on <phrase class="date" code="2010-07-22">22 July 2010</phrase> announcing that they believe it should be possible to deliver the different polls if the key risks are properly managed. We are working closely with the Electoral Commission and others to maximise the benefits of combination and ensure the polls on <phrase class="date" code="2011-05-05">5 May 2011</phrase> are delivered effectively.</p>

	<p pid="b.95W.2/1">The reduction in the under-18 conception rate over the last decade-to the point where it is at its lowest level for over 20 years-is positive. But it does not mask the fact that England still has high teenage pregnancy rates compared with many other countries.</p>
	<p pid="b.95W.2/2">We want local areas to continue to prioritise reducing teenage pregnancy rates, using the international evidence and the lessons from areas where teenage pregnancy rates have fallen fastest, to accelerate progress. There are clear social and economic benefits from investing in actions to prevent teenage pregnancies and improve outcomes for teenage parents and their children. These will contribute to local strategies to: reduce child poverty and health inequalities; and improve public health.</p>
	<p pid="b.95W.2/3">We are currently reviewing the curriculum, including the place of sex and relationships education (SRE) within it. We will be announcing our plans later this year. But whatever the status of SRE in future, we are clear that it should focus more on relationships. We know that parents are concerned about the early sexualisation of children and the worrying levels of violence reported in teenage relationships and believe that high quality SRE can help children and young people to: cope with the pressures they face to have sex-from both their peers and the media; and to understand what is meant by sexual consent.</p>
	<p pid="b.95W.2/4">We are also considering how best to ensure that sufficient accessible, young people-friendly contraceptive and sexual health services are available in each local area, so that sexually active young people do not risk having unprotected sex, which can result in an unplanned pregnancy or a sexually transmitted infection. We will be publishing a Public Health White Paper later this year.</p>

	<p pid="b.100W.8/4" class="indent">Figures on conceptions are estimates based on the number of live births, stillbirths or legal abortions. They do not include miscarriages and illegal abortions. Because of the confidentiality of data on abortions and stillbirths, figures on conceptions at specific ages are not published for small areas, such as Peterborough City Council, because of the risk of disclosing such information.</p>
	<p pid="b.100W.8/5" class="indent">There were 168 conceptions to women under 18 years of age in Peterborough Unitary Authority in 2008 (the most recent year for which figures are available). The data for 2008 are provisional.</p>

	<p pid="b.102W.0/1">The Government are keen to ensure that disabled people are supported to participate in political and public life and that the electoral process is accessible to all electors. This reflects our commitment to the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, and in particular the obligations set out in Article 29.</p>
	<p pid="b.102W.0/2">This is why the Cabinet Office has made an early commitment as part of our coalition document to introduce extra support for disabled people who want to become MPs, councillors or other elected officials. We are currently looking at the detail of how best to support disabled people who want to enter political life. In working up detailed policy proposals, we will draw on the evidence set out by the cross-party Speaker's Conference and involve the expertise of disabled people and disabled people's organisations at an early stage.</p>
	<p pid="b.102W.0/3">The Electoral Administration Act 2006 (&quot;EA Act 2006&quot;) and associated legislation contain measures aimed to make the voting process more accessible for disabled electors. Returning officers are required to display an enlarged version of the ballot paper in polling stations and to provide upon request at polling stations a large hand-held sample copy of the ballot paper for the assistance of visually impaired voters. Returning officers must also ensure that each polling station is supplied with a tactile voting device which is designed to enable blind and partially sighted voters to cast their vote independently without revealing their voting intentions to a third party.</p>
	<p pid="b.102W.0/4">Electoral officers are also required to make information and documents about the electoral process available to electors in other languages and formats, including Braille and audio format.</p>
	<p pid="b.102W.0/5">There are also a number of provisions in legislation which are specifically intended to support disabled electors to vote at elections. These include provision that, on application to the presiding officer, disabled voters in polling stations may cast their vote with the assistance of a companion.</p>
	<p pid="b.102W.0/6">Local authorities have a statutory responsibility for designating polling places and must carry out a full assessment of polling places at least every four years to ensure that, so far as it is practicable, all venues are accessible to electors who are disabled. This should mean that polling places are regularly checked for accessibility, and consideration given to making reasonable improvements where practicable.</p>
	<p pid="b.102W.0/7">The Government are also aware that for some groups in society, including electors who are disabled, e-voting can assist them to overcome barriers to participation. This may be an area that needs closer consideration as to how information technology can assist in the absence of a full e-voting solution being put in place alongside the existing paper-based model, which is a model that many trust and expect. Where there are issues with the existing paper-based system, the Government will look at the evidence and identify what needs to be taken forward to address those issues.</p>

	<p pid="b.105W.2/1">The use of quality management statements in the selection of suppliers, leading to contract award decisions, is recognised good procurement practice.</p>
	<p pid="b.105W.2/2">The vast majority of contracts by value for the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic games will be awarded by the Olympic Delivery Authority (ODA) with a significant number awarded by the London Organising Committee for the Olympic Games (LOCOG).</p>
	<p pid="b.105W.2/3">While LOCOG is a private company not bound by public procurement regulation, the ODA is a DCMS public body. As such, DCMS officials have reviewed ODA procurement policy and are satisfied that it encompasses good procurement practice.</p>
	<p pid="b.105W.2/4">Specifically, the ODA uses a &quot;balanced scorecard&quot; of criteria at both the prequalification stage to select a shortlist of suppliers to invite to tender and at the tender evaluation stage in selecting the successful supplier. The balanced scorecard considers five broad criteria areas including quality management and reviewing the quality management statements of prospective suppliers.</p>
	<p pid="b.105W.2/5">DCMS officials have also reviewed LOCOG procurement policy and are satisfied that LOCOG also adopts good practice consideration of quality management statements in its contract award process.</p>
	<p pid="b.105W.2/6">It is, however, recognised that a good quality management statement is no guarantee that a supplier will in fact perform well in practice. Therefore appropriate consideration of other factors, such as health, safety, environmental capabilities, financial viability, construction quality and others, are taken into account as part of the &quot;balanced scorecard&quot; to select suppliers.</p>

	<p pid="b.119W.0/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="b.119W.0/2">The National Drug Treatment Monitoring System (NDTMS) collects information on the number of young people in specialist substance misuse services in England. 498 young people under the age of 18 received pharmacological interventions in 2008-09. Of these, 66 were under 16 years old. NDTMS does not distinguish between opiate substitute drugs (such as methadone or buprenorphine) and other prescribed drugs (such as Ritalin for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder) and it is important to note that pharmacological interventions in this context include prescribing for detoxification, stabilisation and symptomatic relief of substance misuse. Information on the doses prescribed is not recorded within NDTMS or held centrally.</p>
	<p pid="b.119W.0/3">Young people's substance misuse is markedly different to that of adults. Young people tend to have shorter histories of substance use and have used lower levels of drugs for shorter periods. They are therefore much less likely to be physically dependent. Just 2% of young people in treatment in 2008-09 were using heroin or crack cocaine as their primary substance. Substitute prescribing for under-18s is therefore rare. Instead, interventions for young people centre on psychosocial counselling-based therapies.

It is not a fully mature technology and there are no immediate plans for the UK Government to develop a secure communications system for data transmission to and from EU member states based on it. Communications between EU member states are currently protected by Government approved cryptographic codes. There are currently no approved cryptographic codes using quantum cryptography for data transmission nor any immediate prospect of any being submitted for approval.</p>

	<p pid="b.133W.9/1">Employment legislation in the UK is constructed in a way that allows the greatest freedom for business and workers to find types and patterns of work that suit them while still maintaining universal basic minimum rights.</p>
	<p pid="b.133W.9/2">The employment regulation regime is one of the factors behind the success of the UK labour market and this is recognised by a number of international measures including the World Economic Forum's &quot;Labour Market Efficiency&quot; indicator (which ranks the UK eighth out of 139 countries) and the World Bank's Doing Business &quot;Employing Workers&quot; indicator (ranking the UK 35th out of 183 countries).</p>
	<p pid="b.133W.9/3">Furthermore the OECD in its seminal Jobs Study Review in 2006 identified the UK as one of the 'successful employment performers' and, despite the recession, the UK still has one of the highest employment rates in the world. Across the OECD, its &quot;Employment Protection Legislation&quot; indicator ranks the UK second only behind the US. This feature has worked in tandem with the Government's welfare to work policies. The Government's proposals for work programme and benefit reform aim to enhance these welfare to work policies.</p>
	<p pid="b.133W.9/4">The UK is rated as the best location in the European Union for the attraction of foreign skills<sup>(1)</sup> and a survey by Manpower conducted in 2009 found that companies in the UK have fewer difficulties in recruiting skilled workers than in most other European locations.</p>

Our reforms to higher education will provide strong incentives for institutions to focus on providing high quality teaching as efficiently as possible. Over time, popular and successful institutions will be able to grow and we expect new providers to enter the sector providing they can offer teaching to the high standards students will expect. HEFCE will monitor the financial health and sustainability of institutions to protect the public investment in higher education. But HEIs are autonomous institutions and, if a university mismanages its affairs, we cannot offer a guarantee of protection.</p>

	<p pid="b.136W.2/1">The Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) is charged with distributing teaching grant to higher education institutions according to a methodology it determines. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State plays no part in the discharge of that function. He cannot direct the amount of grant to be awarded to any particular subject or institution. In broad terms the funding system is designed to recognise the relative costs of teaching. Each subject is allocated to one of four price groups A to D. The range of teaching grant per full time equivalent undergraduate student ranges from &#163;15,804 in group A to &#163;3,951 in group D. In addition institutions receive fees of up to &#163;3,290 per student per year. So for example the fee would cover 45% of the cost of a price group D course such as business studies, whereas the fee would cover 17% of the cost of a group A course such as medicine. Once allocated to a price group all subjects in that are treated equally in terms of the allocation of core teaching grant.</p>
	<p pid="b.136W.2/2">The right hon. Member the then Secretary of State wrote to HEFCE in 2004 seeking advice on which subjects are of such national and strategic importance that without additional support they may not survive through the usual operation of the market in student applications. Those courses currently identified as Strategically Important or Vulnerable Subjects (SIVS) are:</p>
	<p pid="b.136W.2/3" class="indent">Chemistry, Engineering, Maths and Physics</p>
	<p pid="b.136W.2/4" class="indent">Modern Foreign Languages and some area studies</p>
	<p pid="b.136W.2/5" class="indent">Quantitative Social Science</p>
	<p pid="b.136W.2/6" class="indent">Islamic studies</p>
	<p pid="b.136W.2/7">Advances in science and technology are key to UK economic growth and social prosperity. To achieve long-term progress, the UK relies on a strong base of science and engineering skills at all levels within the population and a healthy and thriving research base.</p>
	<p pid="b.136W.2/8">However, it should be noted that not all Science Technology Engineering and Maths courses (STEM) are designated as SIVS. Equally SIVS status does not necessarily indicate that a subject is expensive to deliver. Foreign languages and maths are in price group C for example.</p>
	<p pid="b.136W.2/9">HEFCE has chosen to support SIVS through a series of projects and initiatives aimed at maintaining entry to these subjects and building capacity in the higher education sector. The total amount of funding since 2005/06 is &#163;350 million.</p>
	<p pid="b.136W.2/10">Future funding will be dependent upon the outcome of the spending review for higher education and the Regional Development Agencies. It will inform my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State's annual grant letter to HEFCE which will set the level of funding for 2011-12 and the allocations to the Regional Development Agencies in the same period.</p>
	<p pid="b.136W.2/11">The Browne Review recommended that future public funding of higher education should concentrate on priority subject areas. In addition it recommended changes to the bodies currently funding and regulating the system. The Government will respond to these and the other recommendations in its forthcoming Higher Education White Paper.</p>

	<p pid="b.144W.2/2">Unemployment among young people is unacceptably high and the range of programmes we inherited is confusing. For these reasons, we will introduce a new single Work Programme in the first half of 2010. This will offer young people targeted personalised help and will be delivered through the best of private and voluntary sector providers.</p>
	<p pid="b.144W.2/3">However, we recognise that, in itself, the Work Programme will not be enough. On <phrase class="date" code="2010-10-04">4 October</phrase> we launched two new measures: Work Clubs as a way of encouraging people who are out of work to exchange skills and share experiences and Work Together as a way of developing work skills through volunteering. We also announced the new enterprise allowance which will support unemployed people who wish to move off benefits into self-employment. We are continuing to develop further measures to encourage pre-employment training and work placements.</p>

It shows expenditure on legal advice by HM Treasury charged to some but not all relevant accounting codes. For the years 2007-08 and following, reference to all relevant codes shows the following spend for those years:</p>
	<table>

		</tbody>
	</table>
	<p pid="b.146W.5/11">These figures include spend on both internal and external legal services. A substantial portion of the latter was expended in connection with HM Treasury's interventions in the financial sector and has been recovered from the institutions concerned, so the figures do not reflect the net cost to HM Treasury. It is not possible to distinguish advice from other legal services such as litigation.</p>
	<p pid="b.146W.5/12">The increase in expenditure between 2007-08 and 2008-09 was due to the increased legal work required to enable the Treasury to respond to the financial crisis. The slight decrease between 2008-09 and 2009-10 reflects the changing nature and level of the interventions required.</p>

	<p pid="b.157W.0/2">Unemployment amongst Britain's youth is unacceptably high and this range of programmes is confusing. For these reasons, we will introduce a new single work programme in the first half of 2010.

In the meantime we will ensure young people continue to have access to employment support prior to the implementation of the work programme.</p>

Customers wishing to re-enter the workplace can benefit from a range of help, including advice on jobsearch techniques, signposting to appropriate job-search channels, skills training and help with costs associated with returning to work. However, eligibility for these services is often dependant on the customer's circumstances, including the benefits they receive and the length of time they have been unemployed.</p>

Personal Advisers work with each customer to agree a personalised return to work plan. This may include participation in one, or more, of our employment and training initiatives, providing help such as support with developing a CV, confidence building, work trials, or work-focused training.</p>

So we instigated the Making Automatic Enrolment Review to ensure that automatic enrolment is implemented in the most effective way.</p>
	<p pid="b.163W.2/4">We estimate that the introduction of a three month Waiting Period would reduce the total number of people eligible for automatic enrolment by around 500,000 at any particular point in time. Of course, many of these people would go on to be automatically enrolled after three months.</p>
	<p pid="b.163W.2/5">Analysis of the 2007 Labour Force Survey indicates that 22 percent of those in the eligible group, and in employment for less than three months, are employed through an agency. This compares to 14 percent of the total eligible group who are employed through an agency. Thus, we estimate that the introduction of a three- month waiting period will exclude around 110,000 people employed through an agency from the eligible group for automatic enrolment.</p>
	<p pid="b.163W.2/6">There is little direct evidence of the effect of waiting periods on the likelihood of an individual choosing to opt-out following automatic enrolment, and it is very difficult to estimate the likely impact. What evidence there is from the United States, where schemes already operate waiting periods of up to 12 months, shows that take up rates are still high and waiting periods do not seem to adversely affect opt-out rates.</p>
	<p pid="b.163W.2/7">Our assumptions of the numbers of people who will opt out of automatic enrolment into a qualifying pension scheme is based on analysis of the Department for Work and Pension's 2009 survey of individual's attitudes and likely response to the workplace pension reforms. These rates are not dependent on the length of time an individual has been in employment, and therefore do not change as a result of introducing a 3 month waiting period.</p>

The reference period for Households Below Average Income figures are single financial years. Three survey years have been combined as regional single year estimates are subject to volatility.<br/> 4. The income measures used to derive the estimates shown employ the same methodology as the Department for Work and Pensions publication 'Households Below Average Income' (HBAI) series, which uses disposable household income, adjusted (or 'equivalised') for household size and composition-an income measure that acts as a proxy for the standard of living.<br/> 5. For the Households Below Average Income series, incomes have been equivalised using Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) modified equivalisation factors.<br/> 6. Numbers of adults and children in low-income households have been rounded to the nearest 100,000, while proportions have been rounded to the nearest percentage point.<br/> 7. Relative poverty is defined as the number (or percentage) of given group (all people, children, pensioners) living in households with less than 60% of contemporary median household income.<br/> 8. Poverty for all people is presented on both a BHC and AHC basis. Children poverty is presented on a BHC basis and pensioners poverty on an AHC basis. This takes account of the notion that housing costs reflect the standard of living of working age families (with children), while they do not for pensioners, nearly three quarters of whom own their own home and therefore gain value from it that is not captured by the corresponding low housing costs relative to the working age population. Considering pensioners' incomes compared to others after deducting housing costs allows for more meaningful comparisons of income between working age people and pensioners, and overtime.<br/> <i> Source:</i><br/> Households Below Average Income, DWP</td> </tr>

	<p pid="b.172W.6/1">The information requested is not available. Data on Cold Weather Payments is not available by constituency, but only by weather station. In 2009-10, Livingston was linked to the weather station Edinburgh Gogarbank. This weather station triggered payments on 5 occasions and each eligible individual in Livingston constituency therefore received 5 Cold Weather Payments, each worth &#163;25.</p>
