<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2011-01-24b.35010.r0" oldstyleid="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2011-01-24b.7W.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40418" speakername="Richard Benyon" colnum="7W"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm110124/text/110124w0001.htm#1101245000369">
	<p pid="b.7W.0/1">There are several reasons why the in-year reallocation of unused quota is not currently undertaken, eg quota holders may be retaining their quota to fish later in the year, or to use as swap currency to acquire different quota. The prospect of such reallocation can encourage a race to fish, which could mean that fish is targeted out of season, thus increasing effort and discards of other stocks. Such reallocation may also impact on prices due to a surplus of fish on the market. Furthermore, there is also a risk of 'ghost' fishing in order to secure ongoing access and prevent reallocation-something that is difficult to enforce against.</p>
	<p pid="b.7W.0/2">I recognise the difficulties currently facing the under-10 metre fleet, and that relying on quota swaps and gifts is not sustainable. I am committed to reform of the fisheries management arrangements, and a consultation is due to be launched in the spring, including a further look at the issue of quota uptake and distribution. In the meantime, discussions continue with producer organisations to consider what support they can offer the under-10 metre fleet in the short-term.</p>

	<p pid="b.11W.0/1">The Government's approach to broadband is to drive the rollout of superfast broadband to as much of the country as possible and to deliver at least a decent level of broadband access to virtually everybody as part of that commitment. That approach is underpinned by the work that BDUK conducted over summer 2010 examining the choice of cost effective solutions available to provide a minimum level of coverage to all premises without access to at least 2 MBps. Among the conclusions of that exercise was that a universal service commitment should not be seen as separate from the superfast broadband objective, but rather an integral part of pushing next generation networks deep into rural Britain. The &#163;530 million allocated to support broadband rollout up to 2015 will help the UK achieve its aim of having the best superfast broadband network in Europe by 2015.</p>

	<p pid="b.19W.5/1">My right hon. Friend, the Foreign Secretary discussed North Korea most recently with the Chinese Government during the visit of Li Keqiang earlier this month. We talk regularly to the US Government in Washington and Seoul on North Korea. We strongly support a process which involves building trust and confidence between North and South Korea with the view of seeing a return to negotiations. All parties in the region have a strong interest in this and we have made clear that we would consider any request to provide practical assistance.</p>

	<p pid="b.23W.6/1">The Academies Act 2010 provides minimal prescription in legislation in order to provide autonomy and freedom to schools who gain academy status. All academies are however required by their funding agreements to make provision for the teaching of religious education. It is an academy's funding agreement that has, since the inception of the programme, been used as a mechanism to uphold the core principles that an academy must agree to follow and there are no plans to change this.</p>
	<p pid="b.23W.6/2">The Department for Education has also worked closely with both the Church of England and the Catholic Education Service to ensure that those faith voluntary-controlled or voluntary-aided schools who wish to convert have their religious position protected. The faith model documentation therefore protects on conversion the position around religious education and instruction in these schools.</p>

We are consulting a wide range of academics, teachers and other interested parties to ensure that our core curriculum can compare favourably with those of the highest performing countries in the world.</p>
	<p pid="b.23W.9/2">We know that some 90% of primary schools are already teaching languages to at least some of their seven to 11-year-olds. We appreciate the efforts that teachers are putting into making sure that children in primary schools are taught languages. It is thanks to their work that pupils not only learn a language but also come to appreciate other cultures. Given its importance, primary schools that are teaching languages should continue to do so.</p>

	<p pid="b.27W.5/1">Sexual exploitation of children and young people is horrific. It is a form of child sexual abuse which affects all sorts of children-boys as well as girls, younger as well as older children-and is perpetrated by people from all ethnic and socio-economic backgrounds. It can be found in all areas of the country and the coalition Government are determined to act decisively to tackle it.</p>
	<p pid="b.27W.5/2">To deal with such a complex problem effectively, we need to look at every aspect, from awareness-raising and prevention through to crime detection and victim support. That means that there must be a collaborative approach involving Ministers from a range of Government Departments as well as local authority children's services, Local Safeguarding Children Boards, and organisations like the Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre (CEOP), Barnardo's and others, including voluntary organisations around the country.</p>
	<p pid="b.27W.5/3">CEOP has agreed to conduct a thematic assessment, involving a range of agencies and organisations, which will consider the extent and scale of child sexual exploitation and the police response to it.</p>
	<p pid="b.27W.5/4">Within Government, and working with national and local partners, I will lead our urgent consideration of what further action needs to be taken to safeguard children and young people from sexual exploitation. This will build on existing guidance and our developing understanding of this appalling abuse including through local agencies' work around the country on effective prevention strategies, identifying those at risk of sexual exploitation, supporting victims, and taking robust action against perpetrators.</p>

	<p pid="b.31W.2/1">Religious education RE is a statutory part of the basic curriculum of maintained schools in England, but not a part of the National Curriculum. This means that there are no statutory national programmes of study, attainment targets or assessment arrangements. However, the locally agreed syllabus, which is designed by Standing Advisory Councils on Religious Education SACRE and adopted by the local authority, is statutory, and that means that local authorities must provide such a syllabus and that maintained schools must follow it. Schools with a religious character can either follow the locally agreed syllabus, or use a syllabus which has been agreed by their governing body. It is the responsibility of the head teacher, governors and local authorities (LAs) to make the necessary provisions for RE in all maintained schools.</p>

	<p pid="b.32W.9/1">The School Teachers Review Body (STRB) examines and reports on matters relating to statutory conditions of employment of school teachers in England and Wales as may be referred to it from time to time by the Secretary of State for Education. The School Support Staff Negotiating Body (SSSNB) was established by the previous Government in 2009, with a remit that includes considering, with a view to reaching agreement on, matters relating to the remuneration and conditions of school support staff working in maintained schools in England.</p>
	<p pid="b.32W.9/2">No changes are planned to the role or remit of the STRB, but on <phrase class="date" code="2011-10-28">28 October</phrase> the Secretary of State for Education announced his intention to introduce legislation at the earliest opportunity to abolish the SSSNB. I refer the hon. Member to the written ministerial statement issued by the Secretary of State for Education on <phrase class="date" code="2010-10-28">28 October 2010</phrase>, <phrase class="offrep" id="wms/2010-10-28.14"><i> Official Report,</i> columns 14-15WS</phrase>. In reaching this decision, full account was taken of the associated equality impact assessment, a copy of which is being sent to the union and employer representatives on the SSSNB.</p>
	<p pid="b.32W.9/3">Since its establishment, the SSSNB has not submitted any agreements to the Secretary of State who has now withdrawn the matters that had been referred to the SSSNB by the previous Secretary of State. Because of this, the process used to determine the pay and conditions of school support staff remains unchanged and these will continue to be determined at a local level. Employers are, of course, under an obligation to ensure that any pay and grading structure that they put in place complies fully with the requirements of equality legislation.</p>
	<p pid="b.32W.9/4">The Government believe that schools should be free to organise staff and resources to address local priorities and needs, without undue or unnecessary influence, or intervention, from Government. The existence of a national negotiating body for support staff pay and conditions is not consistent with this aim.</p>

	<p pid="b.33W.2/1">While some school sport partnerships have helped schools to raise participation rates in areas targeted by the previous Government, they have also locked schools into a rigid network while forcing them to report on progress which impedes schools' ability to promote sport. The Government are also concerned that, despite this heavy focus on targets, the proportion of pupils playing competitive sport regularly has remained disappointingly low. Only around two in every five pupils play competitive sport regularly within their own school, and only one in five plays regularly against other schools.</p>
	<p pid="b.33W.2/2">Good schools know that playing sport has many benefits. Our approach is to maximise the resources available to schools to allow school leaders to decide how best to provide those benefits for pupils, without specifying a national blueprint of partnerships, programmes and central support.</p>

	<p pid="b.35W.10/1">Licensing arrangements and terms and conditions for porters at Billingsgate market is not for central Government. It is a local issue. The City of London corporation is the landlord of Billingsgate market and the porters are employed by individual fish merchants. I understand that the Billingsgate market byelaws cover aspects of licensing arrangements for porters, but there may of course be licensing issues that extend beyond the reach of byelaws. The City of London has made an application to the Department for Communities and Local Government for the revocation of byelaws relating to Billingsgate market. At present, the application is being considered by officials in my Department and no decision has yet been made as to whether or not to grant provisional approval for the revocation.</p>
	<p pid="b.35W.10/2">The Department for Communities and Local Government does not give any financial assistance to fund the restructuring of terms and conditions of employment for licensed porters at Billingsgate fish market, and the EU Fisheries Fund does not cover the restructuring of the terms and conditions of employment for the licensed porters.</p>
	<p pid="b.35W.10/3">I can confirm that my Department has had no discussion with the City of London corporation on the licensing arrangements.</p>

	<p pid="b.41W.2/1">The Family Justice Review is considering the process around divorce and financial settlement on divorce (ancillary relief) but not the substantive law. Concurrent consideration of these technically difficult areas would have been unmanageable and impinge on the deliverability and timescale for much needed reform of the family justice system overall. The review is due to publish an interim report in the spring.</p>
	<p pid="b.41W.2/2">On <phrase class="date" code="2011-01-11">11 January</phrase> the Law Commission launched a public consultation on marital property agreements, following the decision of the Supreme Court last year in Radmacher <i> v.</i> Granatino. The Law Commission is seeking views on the desirability and feasibility of a range of potential options for reforming the law of pre-nuptial, post-nuptial and separation agreements-contracts made by couples before or during their marriage or civil partnership that are intended to govern their financial arrangements if the relationship ends. The consultation closes on <phrase class="date" code="2011-04-11">11 April 2011</phrase>. The Government will await recommendations from the Law Commission before considering how to proceed.</p>

	<p pid="b.58W.6/1">The UK Border Agency is committed to combating illegal immigration in line with the agency's strategic threat assessment and crime control strategy. By working with UK and international law enforcement organisations, the agency focuses its investigative effort to disrupt and dismantle organised crime networks that cause the greatest harm.</p>
	<p pid="b.58W.6/2">Over 55% of all passenger movements into and out of the UK are currently covered by the e-Borders system. This is being used to target would be illegal immigrants, as well as terrorist suspects and known criminals, before they cross the border. Additionally, a network of staff in key countries abroad issue biometric visas, collect intelligence and prevent people with forged documents from boarding planes, to prevent high risk individuals from entering the UK.</p>
	<p pid="b.58W.6/3">Teams working around the country investigate immigration offences and take action against illegal workers and those that employ them. The Government also allow only restricted access to a limited range of state funded benefits to those here illegally. The UK Border Agency deports foreign national prisoners and removes illegal immigrants who have no lawful basis to remain here, and who refuse to leave the country voluntarily.</p>
	<p pid="b.58W.6/4">This Government have committed to creating a new National Crime Agency. This will include a new Border Police Command to strengthen the operational response to organised crime and better secure our borders-a key national security requirement. This command will enable the development and execution of a single coherent border security strategy, drawing on a single national threat assessment. This will deliver our commitment, made in the coalition programme for government, to establish a border police force to &quot;enhance national security, improve immigration controls and crack down on the trafficking of people, weapons and drugs&quot;.</p>

	<p pid="b.68W.2/2"><i> </i>It is estimated that meeting the UK 2020 15% renewable energy target may require around 30% of electricity to come from renewable sources, but there is no target for the electricity sector, nor for individual technologies. Onshore wind, offshore, tidal and solar technologies are expected to contribute to meeting the target, incurring expenditure through the renewables obligation (RO) and feed-in tariffs (FITs) that have been defined by the Office for National Statistics as 'tax and spend'. Nuclear and carbon capture and storage coal are not classified as renewables and will not be able to contribute to the 2020 target.</p>
	<p pid="b.68W.2/3">The following table shows the estimated cumulative expenditure from 2011 to 2020 through the RO and FITs on onshore wind, offshore wind, tidal and solar technologies.</p>
	<table>
		<tbody>
			<tr pid="b.68W.2/6"> <td><i> Technology</i></td> <td><i> Expenditure through RO and FITs</i><i> </i><i> (2010 prices discounted to 2011) (&#163; billion)</i></td> </tr>

		</tbody>
	</table>
	<p pid="b.68W.2/14">This is based on 2009 and 2010 analysis of one potential scenario amongst many. The exact shares of effort between sectors and technologies will depend on how investors respond to the renewable financial incentives put in place, and the relative success in overcoming non-financial barriers to renewables deployment such as planning, supply chain and grid issues.</p>
	<p pid="b.68W.2/15">We are currently reviewing the level of support for all renewable electricity technologies under the RO, and will consult on any changes to RO bands this summer. As part of that process, we have asked our consultants Arup and Ernst &amp; Young to provide updated assumptions on potential deployment and costs for each renewable electricity technology. The Government are also currently consulting on reforms to the electricity market, including options for a phased transition from the RO to a feed-in tariff for large-scale generation. Both of these developments are expected to change the Government's assessments of the total public cost of meeting the UK's share of the 2020 renewables target. The Government are committed to controlling the cost of increasing the deployment of renewable technologies and have brought forward the review of the renewable obligation mechanism.</p>
	<p pid="b.68W.2/16">Note that these figures represent the total level of public support<sup>(1)</sup>. The Renewable Energy Strategy 2009 published lower public support cost figures based on the additional level of public support resulting from the increase in renewables ambition, on a different price basis.</p>
	<p pid="b.68W.2/17" class="indent"><sup>(1)</sup> The costs of the renewables obligation and feed-in tariffs fall on electricity suppliers who pass them on to electricity consumers. In the case of FITs, public support costs are estimated in 'net' terms ie net of the value of electricity exported back to the grid.</p>

	<p pid="b.70W.2/1">The information is not available in the format requested. Quarterly statistics on feed-in tariffs (FITs) are published by both DECC and Ofgem and currently cover the first two quarters of the FITs scheme (April to September 2010). This confirms that of the 10,531 solar photovoltaic installations accredited for FITs in that period, 99.2% were domestic, 0.4% commercial, 0.4% community and there was one industrial scheme (under 0.01%). The total FITs payments over this period for all technologies was &#163;2,686,712.55.</p>
	<p pid="b.70W.2/2">Under the FITs scheme, funds are not allocated in the manner described. However, the analysis and projections undertaken by the previous Administration which informed the FITs impact assessment suggested that in the first three years of the scheme (April 2010 to March 2013) only PV installations of 0-4kW would be incentivised under the scheme.</p>

	<p pid="b.73W.5/1">The provision of training and other similar support to carers is largely a matter for local determination, by the national health service and local authorities.</p>
	<p pid="b.73W.5/2">The Caring with Confidence programme ended in September 2010. Government announced in October 2010 that over &#163;4 million previously earmarked for the programme was being reinvested across 11 projects, these include:</p>
	<p pid="b.73W.5/3" class="indent">&#163;1.8 million funding to a range of voluntary sector organisations supporting carers including the Afiya Trust, in recognition of the particular needs and challenges faced by carers from ethnic minority communities;</p>
	<p pid="b.73W.5/4" class="indent">over &#163;1 million funding for training and carer awareness raising for key health and social professionals being delivered by Skills for Care and Skills for Health and training for general practitioners (GPs) and their practice staff being carried out by the Royal College of GPs; and</p>
	<p pid="b.73W.5/5" class="indent">&#163;1.35 million funding for a grant scheme aimed at encouraging bids from patient led and condition related organisations wishing to do more to support carers by reaching out to people who do not necessarily see themselves as carers. We received over 270 bids from a wide range of organisations and plan to fund over 80 organisations who were successful bidders.</p>
	<p pid="b.73W.5/6">The Government have also made all the training materials from Caring with Confidence available free of charge on the Carers Direct website and worked with the national carers' organisations and other interested parties to promote their availability. The materials can be used at a local level to support the continued provision of training to carers.</p>

	<p pid="b.74W.6/1">There are no exemptions to delivering high standards of privacy and dignity. The national health service is expected to eliminate mixed-sex accommodation, except where it is &quot;in the overall best interests of the patient, or reflects patient choice&quot;. However, same sex requirements allow sufficient flexibility to provide scope for specialist facilities for children and young people, where patients may choose to share facilities on the basis of age and diagnosis, rather than gender. In this context, the choice has to be a genuine one-not influenced by background factors such as staff convenience, the poor state of buildings or lack of facilities. If the child would prefer to be nursed in proximity to members of the same sex, then this preference should where possible be accommodated.</p>
	<p pid="b.74W.6/2">The Department has made available guidance<sup>(1,)</sup><sup>(2)</sup> which specifically focuses on children. This makes clear that decisions about where children and young people receive their care should be based on the clinical, psychological and social needs of the individual child or young person. It states that this approach be conveyed to the child, (where they are old enough to understand), and to their parents/carers. In emphasising that young people be offered choice, there remains an emphasis that the location and environment are; safe, healthy, child-friendly and suitable to their age/stage of development.</p>
	<p pid="b.74W.6/3">This guidance was developed following extensive consultation with clinical staff and patient representative groups.</p>

	<p pid="b.77W.2/1">While there are very significant areas of commonality in health provision in the home nations, there are already some divergences that reflect the differing local priorities, health being a devolved issue, and it is the responsibility of each administration to identify and address these priorities.</p>
	<p pid="b.77W.2/2">The Department participates in discussions with local health boards in Wales, primary care trusts and the Welsh Assembly Government to ensure that funding and commissioning issues arising from the differences in health provision regimes are understood. The cross-border commissioning protocol exists to define the commissioning and payment arrangements for patients living along the Anglo-Welsh border. It is the mechanism through which the two health Departments address the principle that neither commissioners nor patients should be disadvantaged by differences in health commissioning or provision processes between the two countries. The other key principle under the protocol is that the patient's safety and well being must be paramount at all times. No treatment must be refused or delayed due to uncertainty or ambiguity as to funding the health care provision.</p>
	<p pid="b.77W.2/3">The Secretary of State for Health met Ministers of the Welsh Assembly Government on <phrase class="date" code="2010-12-01">1 December 2010</phrase> and wrote to the Minister of Health and Social Security for the Welsh Assembly Government following the meeting to say that departmental officials remained committed to agreeing an appropriate level of financial transfer to the Welsh Assembly Government arising from issues around national tariff rates and how these are applied to Wales.</p>
	<p pid="b.77W.2/4">The cross-border commissioning protocol is due to expire on <phrase class="date" code="2011-03-31">31 March 2011</phrase> and officials from the Department are also in discussion with the Welsh Assembly Government with the intention of renewing the protocol, to run seamlessly from 2011. Until the forthcoming changes to the manner in which health care in England is commissioned are finalised in the Health and Social Care Bill currently going through Parliament, the intention is that no substantial changes to the cross-border protocol should be introduced. For this reason, the protocol is expected to be renewed for just one year.</p>

	<p pid="b.91W.2/1">The Department for Transport has used the National Transport Model (NTM) to estimate that in 2035 there will be 210 million passenger trips per weekday on average by surface modes (including road and rail, but excluding freight), in Great Britain. Of these, 4.2 million are expected to be over 50 miles long, and 1.5 million trips over 100 miles long.</p>
	<p pid="b.91W.2/2">In addition, the Department for Transport published its most recent air passenger demand forecasts in &quot;UK Air Passenger Demand and CO2 Forecasts&quot; in January 2009, which is available at:</p>
	<p pid="b.91W.2/3" class="indent"><a href="http://www.dft.gov.uk/pgr/aviation/atf/co2forecasts09/">http://www.dft.gov.uk/pgr/aviation/atf/co2forecasts09/</a></p>
	<p pid="b.91W.2/4">Under a scenario assuming no additional runways in the South East, and using the then latest available GDP projections, this set of forecasts implied that there would be 37.6 million domestic air journeys per year between UK airports in 2030. The Department keeps its aviation forecasts under review and will publish updated forecasts as appropriate.</p>
	<p pid="b.91W.2/5">Growth of trip numbers over the period to 2033 by particular modes, and for particular parts of the network, may differ from these overall figures.</p>
	<p pid="b.91W.2/6">In addition, HS2 Ltd has published a forecast showing it expects there to be 7 million 'long distance' trips daily in 2033. However, this is not comparable to the preceding NTM figures. This is because HS2 Ltd's model of 'long distance' travel is based on a subset of trips which differs from the national set used in the NTM, and its 'long distance' trips include some that are less than 50 miles long. This different dataset was chosen by HS2 Ltd to enable effective and efficient modelling of the likely impacts of HS2.</p>

	<p pid="b.95W.8/1">For ESA claims in Bexley local authority which started since the introduction of ESA in October 2008 up to February 2010 (the latest published national data), 830 out of 2,230 (22%) have been found fit for work.</p>
	<p pid="b.95W.8/2">180 appeals have been heard against these fit for work decisions to date and 80 of them found in favour of the appellant, i.e. 4% of all ESA claims assessed.</p>
	<p pid="b.95W.8/3">Note that further appeals are due to be heard against the 830 decisions.</p>
	<p pid="b.95W.8/4">Figures are rounded to the nearest 10</p>
	<p pid="b.95W.8/5">Equivalent national figures can be found in table 5 at the following link:</p>
	<p pid="b.95W.8/6" class="indent"><a href="http://research.dwp.gov.uk/asd/workingage/esa_wca/esa_wca_26102010.pdf">http://research.dwp.gov.uk/asd/workingage/esa_wca/esa_wca_26102010.pdf</a></p>
	<p pid="b.95W.8/7" class="italic"> Background</p>
	<p pid="b.95W.8/8">Due to the time it takes to hear an appeal (on average around six months) and that we do not record an appeal until it is heard, comparing the latest fit for work figures with the latest appeal figures will usually underestimate the proportion of people appealing the fit for work decision. Latest figures for Bexley suggest that around 22% of people found fit for work have gone on to have an appeal hearing, to date. However this figure will rise as more appeals are heard. The latest national figures show proportions of around 40% for the earliest cohorts of ESA claims but we expect that this will also continue to increase (we anticipate to around 50%).</p>
	<p pid="b.95W.8/9">The success rate of 56% (which is unlikely to change much as more appeals are heard) is higher than the national rate of 40%, however at local level we would expect some variation from the national figures due to various factors, particularly different disability and health condition profiles experienced across the country.</p>

	<p pid="b.97W.2/3" class="indent">The Secretary of State has asked me to reply to your question about how many people the Birkenhead Jobcentre Plus actively helped into work in each of the last 12 months. This is something which falls within the responsibilities delegated to me as Chief Executive of Jobcentre Plus.</p>
	<p pid="b.97W.2/4" class="indent">Jobcentre Plus provides information on the services and help available to people to look for work. There are many routes into employment and throughout the customer's journey they may have accessed a number of channels. The type of help required or provided will vary from customer to customer. This help is not limited solely to Jobcentre Plus, as we recognise the importance of the private and voluntary sector.</p>
	<p pid="b.97W.2/5" class="indent">The table below, which is taken from data available from the NOMIS website for Jobseeker's Allowance customers only, gives the number of people that have moved into work either with our assistance or through other channels. The numbers only show those Jobseeker's Allowance customers who notified us that they have started work. It does not include those people who flowed off benefit into other destinations, e.g. claimed other benefits or went into Government supported training. We estimate off-flow into work as generally representing about 50% of the total number of people leaving the register. Our published off-flow figures (not yet available for the whole of 2010) will include all customers who started work, as confirmed by Her Majesty's Revenue &amp; Customs.</p>

	<p pid="b.98W.2/1">Jobcentre Plus rose ably to the challenges presented by the recession and, while its work load doubled, the agency continued to perform strongly against its published targets, each day helping thousands of people to move quickly back into work. In 2009-10, Jobcentre Plus achieved 1.67 million recorded job outcomes. The latest available performance information, up to June 2010, shows Jobcentre Plus 20% above profile and on track to deliver the 2010-11 Job Outcome Target. Performance information is updated regularly and can be accessed through the Department's website:</p>
	<p pid="b.98W.2/2" class="indent"><a href="http://www.dwp.gov.uk">http://www.dwp.gov.uk</a></p>
	<p pid="b.98W.2/3">It is important that Jobcentre Plus maintains this strong performance going forward, while we take steps to reduce waste and tackle the budget deficit to make every penny of taxpayers' money count. From April, we will be putting in place a new performance framework for Jobcentre Plus to further strengthen the focus on helping people move quickly off benefit into employment.</p>
	<p pid="b.98W.2/4">Our partners in the private sector are focused on helping some of our most disadvantaged customers into employment and provider performance information is also published regularly on the Department's website. The latest figures show that, in October 2010, flexible new deal providers delivered 4,570 job outcomes and 3,320 sustained jobs. This summer, we will be introducing the work programme which represents a step change for Welfare to Work in this country, creating a structure that treats people as individuals and allows providers greater freedom to tailor the right support to the individual needs of each customer.</p>

Although they are not required to do so by law, generally airlines pass on the duty charge to their passengers by way of a separately identified charge in the ticket price, which may also include other elements such as passenger service charges, insurance surcharges or tax imposed by other governments. Since any additional charges applied at the discretion of the airline are outside the remit of HMRC, no estimates of their value are available.</p>

	<p pid="b.121W.5/1">The Treasury takes its equalities responsibilities very seriously. At the Budget, the Government published more information than ever before about the impact of the Budget in Annex A which showed the impact of tax and welfare changes on households.</p>
	<p pid="b.121W.5/2">At the spending review, the Treasury published the document &quot;Overview of Equalities Impacts of the Spending Review&quot; alongside the announcement. This set out a qualitative analysis of the likely impacts of the spending review on groups protected by equalities legislation, including women.</p>
	<p pid="b.121W.5/3">For each of the policies listed, the Treasury has made the following assessment of the proportionate impact on <i> (a) </i>men and <i> (b)</i> women:</p>
	<p pid="b.121W.5/4" class="italic"> (i) Increase the rate of value added tax</p>
	<p pid="b.121W.5/5">The effect of the VAT change on men and women was considered and it was concluded that no effect on gender equality was expected as a result of this measure (because spending is best measured at a household level).</p>
	<p pid="b.121W.5/6">Accordingly no specific results were included in the published impact assessment, although that document notes that gender equality was one of the types of testing undertaken.</p>
	<p pid="b.121W.5/7" class="italic"> (ii) Increase capital gains tax</p>
	<p pid="b.121W.5/8">No estimate has been made of the proportionate impact on men or women of proposals to increase capital gains tax.</p>
	<p pid="b.121W.5/9" class="italic"> (iii) Use the consumer price index for calculating benefits and tax credits</p>
	<p pid="b.121W.5/10">It is not possible to calculate robust estimates of the proportionate impact on men and women arising from the switch to CPI indexation for public sector pensions and benefits.</p>
	<p pid="b.121W.5/11">This is because any such estimates would be based on assumptions about future rates of inflation, which would become more uncertain in later years. There is also uncertainty about behavioural or macro-economic effects which would affect the accuracy of any estimates for later years.</p>
	<p pid="b.121W.5/12" class="italic"> (iv) Abolish the child trust fund</p>
	<p pid="b.121W.5/13">No specific gender impact of the ending of eligibility to the Child Trust Fund has been identified. The Child Trust Fund was intended to be for the benefit of the child, and children of both genders were eligible in exactly the same way. As such there will be no specific gender impact.</p>
	<p pid="b.121W.5/14">A gender impact assessment was published alongside the Savings Accounts and Health in Pregnancy Grant Bill (now the Savings Accounts and Health in Pregnancy Grant Act 2010). This is available at:</p>

	<p pid="b.121W.5/19" class="italic">  (vi) Reduce the Sure Start maternity grant</p>
	<p pid="b.121W.5/20">The effect of the restriction of SSMG to first children on gender was considered by DWP as part of its equality impact assessment, which will be published in due course. DWP do not have individual level data to assess this impact. However, DWP expects that the majority of recipients of the SSMG are female and therefore likely to be particularly affected by this measure.</p>
	<p pid="b.121W.5/21" class="italic"> (vii) Change public sector pensions</p>
	<p pid="b.121W.5/22">The value of a pension depends on unique individual factors such as work history, salary and personal financial decisions. Therefore it would not be possible to give an assessment of the proportionate financial impact of the switch to CPI indexation by gender without making large and sweeping assumptions about a complex set of inter-relating factors.</p>

	<p pid="b.126W.2/6" class="indent">We have not assessed the impact of the change in VAT on levels of unemployment or the construction sector. However, the OBR applied a range of fiscal multipliers to help inform its judgement on the impact of VAT on aggregate demand in the economy. These multipliers are set out in Table C8 of the interim OBR's June Budget document. A figure of 0.6, for example, means that a measure which has a direct effect of raising revenue by 1 per cent of GDP is estimated to reduce aggregate demand in the economy by 0.6 per cent in the short run.</p>
	<p pid="b.126W.2/7" class="indent">The interim OBR's June 2010 Budget forecast and the OBR's November forecast assumed that the increase in the standard rate of VAT from 17.5 per cent to 20 per cent would reduce the level of real GDP in 2011/12 by around 0.3 per cent.</p>

	<p pid="b.128W.3/1">Given the interaction of tax credit measures with other benefits, it is the overall impact of measures that is important for a household.
