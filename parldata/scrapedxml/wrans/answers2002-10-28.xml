	<p pid=".514W.8/2">as I have ministerial responsibility for the Northern Ireland Court Service, which includes the administration of the Coroners Service. A coroner in the exercise of his judicial discretion may order a post mortem examination in respect of deaths notified to him under the Coroners (Northern Ireland) Act 1959. Where organs are removed for forensic analysis following such a post mortem they may be retained for such period as the coroner thinks fit. It is now policy to inform the relatives of a deceased person if any organs have been retained following a post mortem. At a later stage after the cause of death has been established the Coroner will usually exercise his judicial discretion to return the retained organs to the family.</p>

	<p pid=".516W.0/1">The Government are very aware of the need to provide more good quality affordable housing for both workers and social housing tenants in Battersea and other parts of London.</p>
	<p pid=".516W.0/2">By 2003&ndash;04 #482 million of the #1.2 billion funding from the Housing Corporation's Approved Development Programme will go directly to London projects. The Challenge Fund of #200 million is also being targeted on the south-east to increase supply. I expect London to get a significant proportion of this.</p>
	<p pid=".516W.0/3">#146 million of the #250 million funding dedicated through the starter home initiative has also been allocated to London schemes. We expect about 4,600 nurses, teachers, police and other key workers to benefit as a result.</p>
	<p pid=".516W.0/4">The Government Office for London and the Housing Corporation are working with local authorities to increase the delivery of affordable housing across London. They will encourage and support innovative schemes maximising the potential for redevelopment of local authority and other public sector assets for affordable housing; achieve improvements in planning performance; and identify and get action on blockages to the speedy delivery of sites for affordable housing.</p>
	<p pid=".516W.0/5">The Government are aware of concerns that the current overcrowding standards need updating as they date from the Housing Act 1935 and have not been revised since then. We are considering the best way to tackle the problem.</p>

	<p pid=".518W.2/1">We want to see a modern, efficient electoral system, so that voting for all electors is as convenient and as straightforward as possible. We are therefore concerned that in 2004 many electors are being asked to vote on two separate occasions within the space of five weeks. Firstly, in local council elections or elections for the London Mayor and Assembly on <phrase class="date" code="2002-05-06">6 May</phrase>, and secondly, for the European Parliament on <phrase class="date" code="2002-06-10">10 June</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".518W.2/2">As a result, I am, along with the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/818" name="Yvette Cooper">the Member for Pontefract and Castleford (Yvette Cooper)</phrase>, who is responsible for European Parliamentary elections in England and Wales, launching today a consultation document inviting views on our proposal to postpone the English local elections and the Greater London Authority elections from <phrase class="date" code="2004-05-06">Thursday 6 May 2004</phrase> to <phrase class="date" code="2004-06-10">Thursday 10 June 2004</phrase>, the same day as the European Parliamentary election.</p>
	<p pid=".518W.2/3">In this consultation we are seeking views on the practical issues that would arise from making this change. We are also seeking views on the option of weekend voting. We are seeking views by January 2003. I am placing a copy of this document in the Library of the House.</p>
	<p pid=".518W.2/4">We would need primary legislation to make this change. We are therefore considering introducing a clause in the proposed Local Government Bill, which would allow us to change the date of the 2004 local and GLA elections by means of Statutory Instrument. Subject to the outcome of our consultation, and to Parliament's approval of the necessary legislation, our aim would be to put in place any postponement of the 2004 local and GLA elections by autumn 2003. We are considering separately whether the programme of election pilots such as voting by the internet, by phone, or by all-postal voting should go ahead in full in 2004, were we to move the local and GLA elections to coincide with the European Parliamentary elections. We intend to reach a firm conclusion on this in good time, taking into account that any piloting in such combined elections would require separate primary legislation.</p>

The level of training is dependent on the skills already held by personnel and the role that they would perform in the event of a strike. Drivers and basic crew only require a short training package because of the simple nature of the equipment. Fire Rescue Teams fulfil a more difficult role, which utilises technical equipment in dangerous situations. Some Fire Rescue Teams are already trained and experienced in the use of breathing apparatus and other specialist equipment but additional personnel have also been trained in these techniques. Other support training as well as driver training includes first aid training and specialist equipment maintenance training.</p>

All military personnel carrying out firefighting duties are being issued with protective kit.

Normal insurance cover and support would be provided to all members of the Armed Forces, as they would be for any other operational duty.</p>

	<p pid=".524W.6/1">As the Deputy Prime Minister set out in his statement to the House on <phrase class="date" code="2002-10-22">22 October</phrase>, the Government have put a range of measures in place to secure public safety in the event of industrial action by the FBU. Our focus has been on taking what steps we can to safeguard life and, as far as possible, to protect property where the normal fire cover is not available. Detailed planning began in August and training started on <phrase class="date" code="2002-08-28">28 August</phrase>. The plans are based on support from the armed services, and the acceptance by the police of additional responsibilities during an industrial action.</p>
	<p pid=".524W.6/2">There are three main elements to the plans. First, on the assumption that the fire control centres will not be operating during the strike, arrangements are being made for fire service 999 calls to be redirected. Every call will be answered. Secondly, emergency cover will be provided by a range of appliances staffed by crews from the Army, RAF and Navy. Nationwide, there will be 827 Green Goddesses, which will be able to provide a basic firefighting capability. There will also be 331 specialist breathing apparatus rescue teams and 59 regional equipment support teams that will offer specialist skills.</p>
	<p pid=".524W.6/3">Thirdly, the Government has made available basic safety guidance and information to the public and to business. That is being supplemented by a range of other measures such as a public information campaign on radio and television, a mail drop to some 4 million households and a letter to the 15,000 largest businesses giving specific advice on fire safety and general health and safety issues. In the event of a strike by the FBU, the military and police, assisted by those firefighters and fire officers who choose to continue to work, will be in a position to provide a basic emergency service. We have always emphasised that the military cannot seek to replicate the cover provided by the Fire Service. With that in mind, the government has been working with industry and other players to introduce a range of measures to mitigate the effects of a FBU strike.</p>

	<p pid=".525W.2/1">When a local authority determines council tax liability, a member of the armed services who spends time abroad is treated in the same way as anyone else who spends time abroad. Section 6 of the Local Government Finance Act 1992 sets out the basis of liability to pay council tax. A key factor in determining liability is whether the property is the person's sole or main residence. There is significant case law on this subject for local authorities and their legal advisors to call upon.</p>

This appointment ended in December 2001. Deloitte and Touche acted as accountancy adviser to the Department on BNFL from March 2000. Following a competitive tender the Department decided in July 2002 to reappoint Deloitte and Touche as its accountancy adviser on BNFL and the proposed Liabilities Management Authority. In August 2002 Deloitte and Touche completed its transaction with Andersen UK under which partners and staff of Andersen UK joined Deloitte and Touche.</p>

	<p pid=".529W.9/1">The Government attaches great importance to ensuring that UK exports are not misused, diverted or re-exported to undesirable end-uses, and this risk is among those identified in the consolidated EU and national aims export licensing criteria. The consolidated criteria set out factors to be considered by Member States in assessing the risk of diversion. The Government believes the best way of minimising the risk of diversion is a thorough risk assessment at the licensing stage and this process includes careful examination of information about the proposed end-use and end-user of the goods. After a detailed assessment of the individual circumstance&mdash;less than &frac12; ounce of the application it was judged that the proposed export of 10 grams of beryllium, to the University of Science and Technology in Tehran, did not give rise to concern about use in connection with weapons of mass destruction. In addition, after thorough scrutiny of the application, the Department and its advisors assessed the stated end use as legitimate.</p>

	<p pid=".533W.0/1">Broadly speaking, the great majority of employment legislation applies to employees working on board ship, provided their ship is registered as belonging in a port in Great Britain, they do not work wholly outside Great Britain under their contract of employment and they are ordinarily resident in Great Britain. Where statutory minimum standards apply to terms and conditions of employment, employees can complain to the employment tribunals if they believe that those standards have not been met. There are some exceptions to the application of employment legislation to UK seafarers and I understand that the Department for Transport's Shipping Task Force is examining their position under the legislation.</p>
	<p pid=".533W.0/2">Turning to the Working Time Directive, sea transport is one of the sectors that were excluded from the original Directive as it is covered by other legislation. Non-mobile workers are covered by the Horizontal Amending Directive (2000/32/EC), which is due to be implemented by <phrase class="date" code="2003-08-01">1 August 2003</phrase>. Seafarers are covered by Council Directive 1999/63/EC, implemented by the Merchant Shipping (Hours of Work) Regulations 2002 and Merchant Shipping (Medical Examination) Regulations 2002 and Council Directive 1999/95/EC, implemented by the Merchant Shipping (Hours of Work) Regulations 2002. These regulations came into force in September 2002 and are enforced by the UK Maritime and Coastguard Agency as part of its normal inspection and enforcement regime.</p>

	<p pid=".534W.2/2">My Department is aware of recent increases to the cost to business of employers' and public liability insurance, which are the consequence of a number of factors, most notably the tightening of global insurance markets since September 11 last year. Although this is a cause for concern, Government generally do not interfere in what is essentially a competitive market on the basis that the terms and conditions of insurance policies are best set by insurers themselves in the light of their customers' needs, taking a commercial assessment of the risk to determine premiums. Companies experiencing difficulties in obtaining insurance cover are advised to contact Peter Staddon at the British Insurance Brokers' Association on 020 7397 0204 for general advice and assistance in finding a suitable insurance broker.</p>

	<p pid=".535W.5/1">I have received a number of representations about the erroneous transfer of gas and electricity supply by energy companies. Such transfers may arise from administrative or data problems or from sales malpractice. In January 2001, the Office of Gas and Electricity Markets (OFGEM), which regulates the sales activities of energy suppliers, imposed undertakings on npower following a rise in marketing complaints. These undertakings were lifted in April 2002 after npower met objectives agreed with OFGEM. OFGEM continues to monitor npower and other suppliers, and can investigate any company that appears to have breached the terms of its supply licence.</p>

	<p pid=".536W.2/1">'Your passport to export success' is a national Trade Partners UK programme, delivered regionally, to develop small businesses in international trade. Promotion is done regionally. There has been no national campaign, but the press has picked up success stories.</p>

	<p pid=".536W.2/8">To date 1,137 companies are taking part in the programme, 734 of which have been recruited in this financial year. Of these, 37 are located in Surrey. There is a mix of promotional activity tailored to the needs of each region's business community. In Surrey, for example, this has included a promotional event reinforced by articles in local media and publicity from partner organisations such as Chambers of Commerce.</p>
	<p pid=".536W.2/9">Passport did not operate in financial year 2000&ndash;01, and there was no programme budget. In financial year 2001&ndash;02, 403 businesses joined the programme from its inception in autumn 2001.</p>

	<p pid=".542W.2/1">The FCO has recently implemented a major web infrastructure project to enhance our global web presence. This has been achieved using funds from the Treasury Capital Modernisation Fund for e-Government initiatives. The objectives of the project are: to promote the UK more effectively to an overseas audience; to save running costs for UK missions' websites; to avoid duplication of effort; to provide a more customer-focused approach and improve service delivery of visas, passports and consular services; to join up on-line information offered by our public diplomacy partners (British Council, Trade Partners UK, Invest UK, British Tourist Authority and BBC World Service).</p>
	<p pid=".542W.2/2">In January 2001 Logica plc won a competitive tender to provide a new web platform for hosting and running UK missions' websites world-wide and allowing future electronic submission of passports and visa applications. The following are on the platform already:</p>

	<p pid=".542W.2/6">In addition over 100 UK missions world-wide currently run their own websites. These are linked from the FCO main site.</p>
	<p pid=".542W.2/7">The total cost of developing and implementing the infrastructure and the first year of support has cost 6.6 million. We estimate substantial future staff and business efficiency savings from this new infrastructure. The web platform is hosted in-house and uses our global telephony network. Operating costs for e-Media Unit in the FCO are 269,000 pa, excluding staff.</p>
	<p pid=".542W.2/8">The above sites were built following extensive market research and consumer surveys. A 'balanced scorecard' approach is taken to site assessment and benefits measurement. A company called 'Flow Interactive' has recently undertaken usability testing of the FCO main site with members of the public.</p>

	<p pid=".543W.0/1">The biennial EU-SADC ministerial meeting was originally scheduled to take place in Copenhagen on 7 to <phrase class="date" code="2002-11-08">8 November</phrase>. In recent months, EU partners have regularly discussed the timing and location of this meeting in order to ensure there it remains coherent with wider EU policy, including targeted sanctions against named individuals in the ZANU (PF) regime.</p>
	<p pid=".543W.0/2">The EU presidency&mdash;on behalf of the EU&mdash;expressed EU concerns in a series of meetings with Governments in the SADC region in August. In September, recognising that a meeting could no longer go ahead in Copenhagen as originally planned, Mozambique offered to host the meeting in Maputo on behalf of SADC. The EU decided on <phrase class="date" code="2002-10-17">17 October</phrase> to accept the offer. The UK fully supported this decision.</p>
	<p pid=".543W.0/3">The EU's relationship with SADC is important and wide-ranging. The Government have always made clear that a meeting should take place, but that the integrity of the EU's targeted sanctions on named Zimbabweans should be maintained. The Government will use the meeting to engage SADC countries on a range of issues. As a member of SADC, Zimbabwe is likely to attend the meeting. There are no plans for British Ministers to meet their Zimbabwean counterparts at Maputo. We are not aware of other international meetings having been relocated in 2002.</p>

	<p pid=".545W.7/1">It is a fundamental principle of the international and bilateral agencies working in Zimbabwe and elsewhere that food aid is targeted on the basis of need alone, and is not politically determined. The World Food Programme is working through non-governmental organisations under an agreement with the Government of Zimbabwe that enshrines this principle. Our bilateral feeding Programmes also work through NGOs on the same criteria, and within NGOs' established operational agreements with the Government of Zimbabwe. DFID and other donors are closely monitoring events on the ground to ensure that principles and agreements are honoured, and where problems are found or reported, that these are resolved through transparent complaints procedures.</p>
	<p pid=".545W.7/2">Food assistance through the Government of Zimbabwe does not operate to similar levels of openness and transparency. I share the concern that there appears to be selective distribution. Whilst I am very concerned about malnutrition and hunger, it is premature to suggest there is starvation. But I have joined the UN in urging donor countries to help reduce the food gap in Zimbabwe to avoid crisis which remains all too possible.</p>

	<p pid=".546W.0/1">There has been no systematic obstruction of food aid provided by the UN agencies and international donors in Zimbabwe. There have been particular problems in one or two areas and for particular organisations apparently attributable solely to bias on the part of the authorities or local activists. There is on-going negotiation in country on problems for two UK NGOs. Where problems have arisen, aid has been suspended until the organisations concerned have been satisfied that unfettered distribution can resume. At present the major constraints to food aid are the need to scale up the capacity of all the implementation organisations, and to get full funding of the UN appeal.</p>
	<p pid=".546W.0/2">This House is well aware of Government's concern about the on-going abuse of human rights in Zimbabwe. We deplore the continuing record of oppression and human rights abuse to suppress legitimate opposition and criticism of its disastrous policies.</p>

I attended a launch event in Geneva on <phrase class="date" code="2002-09-16">16 September</phrase>, along with Dr. Supachai Panitchpakdi, Director General of the World Trade Organisation, and Dr. Kamil Idris, Director General of the World Intellectual Property Organisation. The report has been widely commended as an important contribution to the debate on how intellectual property rules and practices can work better for developing countries, and contribute to the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals.</p>
	<p pid=".546W.9/2">The Government established the commission as part of its wider effort to ensure global rules and institutions serve all countries equitably and take full account of the needs of developing countries. The commissioners, two of whom were from developing countries, brought a wide range of expertise to bear in science, law and economics. They included representatives from Government, the legal profession, academia and industry. The report is available in the Libraries of the House and on the commission's website <a href="http://www.iprcommission.org">www.iprcommission.org</a>.</p>
	<p pid=".546W.9/3">The Government are grateful to the commission for its report. We welcome it as a very useful and constructive contribution to the debate on these important issues. We will encourage the widest possible debate on its proposals and will make it available in all relevant fora. Although commissioned by the British Government, the recommendations of the commission are directed at policymakers in all Governments, at the national and international institutions involved in intellectual property policy, and other important stakeholders such as industry and NGOs. The Government hope serious consideration will be given by these bodies to the recommendations of the report.</p>
	<p pid=".546W.9/4">There is much detail in the report which requires careful consideration. The Government are currently considering its own response to the detailed recommendations of the commission and hopes to publish this early next year.</p>

	<p pid=".548W.5/1">DFID supports the Government of Malawi's efforts to provide comprehensive sexual and reproductive health, communicable disease control, and health systems development. Sexual and reproductive health assistance is increasing access to reproductive, maternal and sexual health services, and fostering adoption of safer sex practices especially among the poor, young people and marginalised groups. It will also have a positive effect in countering the rate of increase of HIV/AIDS. The communicable disease control elements support strategies to combat the spread of tuberculosis, to improve immunisation coverage of childhood diseases, and to increase treatment and prevention of malaria. Systems development activities will strengthen the government's Central Medical Stores and drug supply chain, develop a cost effective essential medical laboratory service, and develop an Essential Health Package.</p>

	<p pid=".549W.5/1">Health sector-wide approaches (SWAPs) enable better priority setting in the context of locally-owned strategies for improving health outcomes for the poorest. They facilitate joined up working between development partners, Governments and other stakeholders, and eliminate duplication and ineffective donor activity. Assessments of health SWAPs have been undertaken by inter alia the Overseas Development Institute. These show that SWAPs are more than a change in the form which development assistance takes. They are responsible for increased Government ownership and commitment to delivering accessible health care to the poorest through strengthened health systems.</p>
	<p pid=".549W.5/2">In most cases it is still too early to assess the long term impact of SWAPs on health outcomes for the poor. However, there are many early positive outcomes. In Uganda and Tanzania the SWAP has helped better identify the health needs of the poorest. In Uganda, Mozambique and Ghana, more people are using health services. But SWAPs are a partnership: they will only deliver real pro-poor benefits with the continued political will and investment of both donors and developing country partners.</p>

	<p pid=".550W.2/1">The presence of land mines in Angola has understandably led Angolans to believe that they cannot move around their country in safety. This affects all aspects of rural life, and has meant that much farmland remains unused. Given that the season for planting seeds is now coming to an end, this is likely to have a significant impact on food production in Angola. As a result, demining of residential areas targeted for returnee communities, and their agricultural land, is the main priority for the clearance agencies after roads and bridges.</p>

	<p pid=".550W.5/1">Along with almost all other elements of the national infrastructure, the network of roads, bridges and railways has been severely damaged by the civil war. The Angolan Government has made rehabilitating the transport infrastructure a top priority, and some progress is now being made with vehicles able to reach the interior of the country, bringing goods and people. Arguably, however, rebuilding the physical infrastructure is only one of the key tasks which confronts the Government of Angola. They also urgently need to re-focus government spending on the social sector, in particular health and education, and to improve the macro-economic management of the country.</p>

In addition, the United Nations, in partnership with the Angolan Government, have recently completed an assessment of public financing of social sectors in Angola. The objective of the study was to make practical recommendations regarding the distribution of resources and budget management mechanisms.

	<p pid=".551W.2/1">UNHCR estimates that there are around 440,000 Angolan refugees in Zambia, Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and Namibia. UNHCR are co-ordinating the return and resettlement of these refugees. However plans are at an early stage, and although some refugees have chosen to return to Angola under their own steam, UNHCR do not expect to begin their return programme until 2003. The reintegration of refugees will take place against the backdrop of the widescale return of internally displaced people (IDPs) and former fighters anticipated by the Government. In reintegrating all three groups, it will be vital to ensure that adequate services reach the resettlement areas. We expect the Government of Angola to take the lead in this, and are pressing them to ensure that all resettlement is carried out in line with the Norms for Return and Re-settlement which are now part of Angolan law, and are based on the guiding principles drawn up by Francis Deng, the UN Special Rapporteur.</p>

	<p pid=".552W.5/1">Angola is a very fertile country, and its agricultural potential is significant. Many of the internally displaced people (IDPs) and ex-combatants around the country have begun to plant, using seeds and tools provided by the international community. If this agricultural development is to be a success, Angolans will need timely provision of seeds and tools, and access to food and shelter (as well as a civil administration, schools and medical services and a functioning local judicial system) during the growing period. They will then need access to markets to exchange their surplus agricultural products for goods and services which they cannot themselves provide. A holistic approach is therefore essential.</p>

	<p pid=".555W.2/1">The humanitarian situation in Angola is very serious. Prior to April 2002, more than 80 per cent. of the country was inaccessible. Since the cease-fire, already over-stretched aid agencies have been able to reach many thousands more severely malnourished people. The UN Under Secretary for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Co-ordination, Kenzo Oshima, estimated that a quarter of the population&mdash;3 million people&mdash;would require assistance in the next few months. WFP has raised its caseload figure of people requiring assistance to 1.9 million and this is expected to rise further following a DFID funded comprehensive needs assessment.</p>
	<p pid=".555W.2/2">The UK has been working hard to ensure that donors and implementing partners develop a consensus view on future needs. The Government remain in close contact with international partners, and will remain at the forefront of diplomatic and political efforts to ensure that humanitarian assistance can be delivered more effectively.</p>

However plans are at an early stage, and although some refugees have chosen to return to Angola under their own steam, UNHCR do not expect to begin their return programme until 2003. UNHCR have been keeping donors up to speed with their plans, but my Department had no specific discussions with them at this stage. Our focus to date has been on the urgent needs of internally displaced people (IDPs) and the former UNITA fighters, many of whom have begun to be resettled by the Government. We are in very close touch with WFP, and other agencies, on this and have recently given #250,000 to the International Organisation for Migration (IOM) for a project to assist the return and reintegration of IDPs in the Kuanza Sul and Huambo Provinces.</p>

	<p pid=".557W.0/1">Low public sector wages are one of the major constraints to the improved provision of services in many of our partner countries. However, all countries, not only developing ones, have limits regarding the affordability of pay increases. My Department is working with developing country governments in reforming all aspects of public sector management, which includes, where relevant, strategies to increase revenue as well as improving terms and conditions of service. Other reforms are also important&mdash;such as better recruitment practice and performance management for all staff. But these reforms can be implemented only where Governments are committed to their implementation; we cannot demand that action be taken.</p>

It is widely assumed that extremely low public sector wages create a motivation for corrupt practices.

	<p pid=".561W.6/1">The Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) provide an internationally agreed framework for assessing the overall effectiveness of the development effort. A working set of 48 indicators has been agreed against which to measure progress. These provide a baseline for the international community to help ensure an adequate set of internationally available indicators that the UN will use to report global progress annually.</p>
	<p pid=".561W.6/2">Within individual countries DFID and other donors are committed to using Government performance indicators and data whenever possible to monitor progress. This minimises additional demands for information on developing countries, and allows us to strengthen country statistical systems at the same time as improving data for measuring our own effectiveness.</p>
	<p pid=".561W.6/3">Most of the world's poorest countries are developing Poverty Reduction Strategies (PRSs) which set out how their Governments will address poverty. These PRSs must set out a monitoring framework which specifies the indicators which the Government and donors will use to assess progress. These frameworks have focussed attention on the poor quality and availability of existing data, and have encouraged increased and better co-ordinated Government and donor support to build capacity to collect the information required. DFID is currently supporting the PRS monitoring process in several countries, including Uganda, Malawi, Pakistan and Ghana, both directly and by helping to build general statistical capacity to underpin the PRS framework. Other bilateral donors are supporting efforts here and elsewhere. Strengthening country data systems also improves the availability and quality of the data required for global MDG monitoring. DFID is currently working with the UN and the World bank to improve the systems for collecting the required data from countries and disseminating these internationally.</p>
	<p pid=".561W.6/4">In addition, there are several multilateral initiatives which aim to improve the quality of data available within partner countries. The IMF's General Data Dissemination System project&mdash;partly funded by DFID&mdash;supports African countries in drawing up and implementing plans for improving their statistical systems. The World bank is currently considering ways of improving its capacity for results-based management, including new ways of increasing the funding available for statistical capacity building. The EC is in the process of drawing up guidelines for good practice in donor reporting and monitoring and working to encourage greater harmonisation among donors.</p>

	<p pid=".564W.2/1">Requests for market access as part of the general agreement on trade in services (GATS) are made on a bilateral basis with WTO members making requests directly to other members. The commitments then offered by countries receiving requests will be made public by the WTO and will apply to all WTO members according to the Xmost favoured nation&quot; principle. Countries are therefore not under any obligation to make their requests public and any information regarding these requests would ordinarily be treated as confidential by the WTO secretariat. The European Commission has, however, published a summary of its requests on its website (<a href="http://europa.eu.int/comm/trade/services/gats-sum.htm">http://europa.eu.int/comm/trade/services/gats&mdash;sum.htm</a>).</p>
	<p pid=".564W.2/2">It should be stressed that regardless of the requests being made or the Member making them, no country receiving requests is under any obligation to make commitments in any sector. The GATS is a Xbottom-up&quot; agreement whereby countries individually choose in which sectors they want to make binding commitments and in which they do not.</p>
	<p pid=".564W.2/3">For developing countries to make informed decisions regarding the liberalisation of service sectors (or any other area of trade liberalisation) they must have a clear understanding of the likely impact any such actions will have on their domestic economies and the livelihoods of their citizens, especially the poor. This is why DFID is engaging with a variety of donor organisations (primarily the World bank and UNCTAD) to help ensure that developing countries are given adequate support in this area.</p>
	<p pid=".564W.2/4">However, the number of developing countries involved in the GATS negotiations is very large (the majority of WTO members are developing countries) and it would not be possible for DFID to collect and present impact assessments for all these countries.</p>
	<p pid=".564W.2/5">Instead, each country will be responsible for carrying out its own assessments which it may or may not choose to make public. DFID's role is to help ensure that developing countries have the necessary capacity to carry out informative and useful impact assessments which take proper account of the interests of the poor and of sustainable development issues.</p>

	<p pid=".565W.10/1">My right hon. Friend has made it clear that students will not suffer financial disadvantage as a result of changing their institution due to regrading of A-level results. The A-level claims fund has been established to meet the legitimate costs of students who are able to transfer and students have until <phrase class="date" code="2003-01-31">31 January 2003</phrase> to apply. The fund can meet accommodation, books, travel and, where necessary, tuition fees, as well as other costs at the discretion of the institution.</p>
	<p pid=".565W.10/2">The costs falling to the fund are not likely to be high, given the relatively small number of students affected. Institutions will pay claims from students in the first instance and they will be fully reimbursed.</p>

	<p pid=".568W.2/1">Through the Special Educational Needs and Disability Act 2001, the Government have amended the Disability Discrimination Act to place new duties on providers of post-16 education. These duties started to be effective from September 2002. It is now unlawful to discriminate against disabled students by treating them less favourably than others, and responsible bodies have a duty to provide reasonable adjustments to provision where disabled students might otherwise be substantially disadvantaged. This duty includes ensuring that any course materials provided to disabled students are available in an accessible format.</p>

	<p pid=".568W.5/2">The Industrial Training Act 1982 gives industrial training boards the power to raise a levy from employers in the industry they cover. The Engineering Construction Industry Training Board (ECITB) makes annual proposals to me for its levy arrangements, including the rates of levy that it feels are needed to encourage adequate training. The proposals must have the agreement of organisations representing the majority of those employers who pay most of the levy. Parliamentary approval is also required before I can make an order to put them into effect. I have no plans at present to change the legislation.</p>

Our reform of secondary education will improve attainment levels and encourage greater numbers to enter higher education.

	<p pid=".576W.9/1">Commercial trade in ivory is currently prohibited under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES). In order to prevent illegal trade, the UK has strict controls which are actively enforced by HM Customs and Excise. Between <phrase class="date" code="2002-04-01">1 April</phrase> and <phrase class="date" code="2002-09-30">30 September 2002</phrase>, Customs made 55 seizures of ivory, including two weighing 26.6kg and 445kg. Under the Customs and Excise Management Act (1979) the illegal import or export of ivory can result in an unlimited fine and/or up to seven years imprisonment. Similarly, under the Control of Endangered Species (Enforcement) Regulations (1997) the illegal, commercial use of ivory within the UK can lead to an unlimited fine and/or up to two years imprisonment.</p>
	<p pid=".576W.9/2">The UK has also provided #60,000 towards the Elephant Trade Information System (ETIS) which provides information on the worldwide illegal trade in ivory. ETIS has just produced a detailed report which will be considered at the twelfth Conference of CITES Parties (CoP12), in Chile, next month, when the issue of whether to allow the resumption of trade in ivory from five southern African states will be discussed. The UK will not support any proposal which seems likely to undermine the conservation of the elephant, or lead to an increase in the illegal killing of elephants.</p>

	<p pid=".577W.5/2">We are clear that there needs to be a significant increase in kerbside recycling. We have provided significant extra funds to local authorities through the standard spending assessment and a separate ring-fenced fund for recycling and waste minimisation. We are currently assessing the second tranche of bids for funding from that budget. The Prime Minister's Strategy Unit is currently reviewing waste strategy and its funding and is due to report shortly.</p>

	<p pid=".585W.8/1">Concessionary travel, as it currently stands, contributes to social inclusion by making transport more affordable to older and disabled people, who are often on lower incomes. However, others who may be socially excluded might also benefit from cheaper bus fares, but cannot do so under the current arrangements. We are therefore considering, in the context of our review on bus subsidies, whether local authorities should have greater discretion to extend lower fares to other groups such as those who are seeking employment, or for people in full-time adult education. The review will report to Transport and Treasury Ministers in February 2003.</p>

	<p pid=".590W.6/1">Buses and coaches have consistently been one of the safest forms of passenger transport. Since 2001 we have introduced requirements to improve their very good safety record such as the fitment of anti lock braking systems, seat belts in coaches and improved designs of buses to cater for disabled passengers. In the longer term we are working with others to improve the European standard for the protection of coach passengers in the event of a roll over accident. The revised standard is not expected to be applied to new coaches until after 2004.</p>

	<p pid=".593W.3/1">The Government announced in the Communications White Paper in December 2000 that they were considering establishing a new tier of access radio to allow the provision of very local and very niche services.</p>
	<p pid=".593W.3/2">It was agreed with the Radio Authority that it should pilot this idea and in August 2001 the Radio Authority invited 15 groups to participate in the pilot scheme during 2002. The purpose of the pilot scheme is to establish whether access radio is viable and how it might be licensed, regulated, funded, promoted and organised. The completed evaluation is expected to be published next spring. The Communications Bill, when enacted, will allow the Secretary of State to introduce access radio, and any decisions will be informed by the outcome of the current pilot study.</p>
	<p pid=".593W.3/3">If the Government decide to introduce access radio, it is anticipated that future access radio stations would:</p>
	<p pid=".593W.3/4" class="indent">demonstrate evidence of social gain and/or public service aims;</p>
	<p pid=".593W.3/5" class="indent">be small-scale neighbourhood schemes, or be designed to serve a community of interest;</p>
	<p pid=".593W.3/6" class="indent">be funded either through non-commercial funding or by a mixture of commercial and non-commercial funding (for which limits may be specified);</p>
	<p pid=".593W.3/7" class="indent">be not-for-profit or non-profit distributing;</p>

	<p pid=".593W.3/9" class="indent">provide opportunities to allow access among those within the target group to the operation of the service.</p>
	<p pid=".593W.3/10">In drawing up arrangement for licensing and regulating access radio stations, the Government and OFCOM will take full account of the possible impact of access radio on the local broadcasting ecology in each potential locality.</p>
	<p pid=".593W.3/11">The Government are considering the creating of an access radio fund which could support access radio stations. No decisions have yet been taken on such a fund. It will be for the lottery distributing bodies to decide whether access radio stations will be eligible for grants.</p>

	<p pid=".602W.8/21">In the financial year 2000&ndash;01 the cost of running the official history programme was #147,000. This includes fees and expenses of historians and research assistants, costs associated with publication and staff costs of Cabinet Office administrative support. However, it excludes accommodation related overheads. In the case of the SOE histories, no fee is paid for the authors' work. Instead they seek recompense through royalties from their publishers.</p>

	<p pid=".605W.3/1">Customs and Excise's New Export System (NES) went live at all Maritime and Inland locations (including Inland Clearance Depots) throughout the UK on <phrase class="date" code="2002-10-27">27 October 2002</phrase>. NES is an electronic-based system which enables exporters and agents to send their export declarations to Customs electronically.</p>
	<p pid=".605W.3/2">It replaces the current paper-based system, facilitates legitimate trade and helps combat VAT and Excise fraud. NES provides a number of tailored models and procedures to meet the needs of different trade sectors. It will allow Customs to target their controls more effectively and therefore minimise disruption to legitimate trade; and there will be a reduction in the time it takes to process an export declaration.</p>
	<p pid=".605W.3/3">The legal basis for the information supplied by exporters and their agents under NES is the Community Customs Code (Council Regulation (EEC) 2913/92) and the Implementing Regulation (Commission Regulation (EEC) 2454/93). Article 15 of the Community Customs Code imposes an obligation of privacy on customs authorities. NES complies with the Data Protection Act (DPA) 1998.</p>
	<p pid=".605W.3/4">The Paymaster General received one representation on NES from the British International Freight Association (BIFA) on <phrase class="date" code="2002-12-20">20 December</phrase> last year, to which the Financial Secretary replied on <phrase class="date" code="2002-01-24">24 January 2002</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".605W.3/5">To operate the New Export System electronically a digital certificate may be required. Either an individual or an organisation may apply for a digital certificate.Customs require Level 2 Security to meet authentication and non-repudiation requirements for all non-European Community declarations made via the world wide web to their export declaration processing system.</p>
	<p pid=".605W.3/6">The policy of the e-Envoy's Office is that Level 2 security requirements should be met by use of digital certificates. Customs have adopted the e-Envoy's Office's policy for Level 2. Agreements concerning digital certificates are a contractual matter between the issuer and applicant; the Electronic Communications Act 2000 and the EU Electronic Signatures Directive determine the general legal admissibility of digital certificates.</p>
	<p pid=".605W.3/7">The Government do not approve or carry out audits of digital certificate providers, but it encourages them to seek approval from tScheme, a voluntary, not-for-profit, industry-led body or an equivalent approval scheme. Equifax is one of several digital certificate suppliers undergoing tScheme accreditation. tScheme is the organisation set up to create strict service criteria and to approve electronic trust services, including qualified certificate services. Any digital certificate provider that meets the tScheme requirements and is technically compatible is able to supply digital certificates that can be used with the Government Gateway. Other providers are ChamberSign and BT Trust Services (available from mid-November 2002).</p>
	<p pid=".605W.3/8">The only contract between these digital certificate providers and the UK Government are a standard Xrelying party agreement&quot;. This contract ensures that each provider supplies up-to-date lists of all digital certificate holders so that the UK Government can verify their identities when transacting through the Government Gateway.</p>
	<p pid=".605W.3/9">The information supplied by applicants will depend on the certificate issuer and the intended use of the certificate. Any personal information provided and not intended for public access is covered by the DPA. It is not the Government's role to make assessments on the compliance of certificate issuers with the DPA but they are bound by its requirements.</p>
	<p pid=".605W.3/10">Whether or not a digital certificate complies with US export laws is a matter for the firm and the issuer of the certificate, not the UK Government. The certificate policy should make clear the extent of any liability of the certificate issuer to the certificate relying party. This is a matter for the certificate issuer and the applicant.</p>

The effective duty rate in the UK is currently 3.13 pence per litre. This rebate is specific to the UK. While many other EU member states operate rebate schemes that are similar to the UK's, they are applied in very different ways so no direct comparison is possible.</p>

This enables the police to deal with situations where young people's drinking is causing a nuisance to others or may lead to bad behaviour.

	<p pid=".613W.3/1">The advisory group, chaired by Professor Sir Bernard Crick, will be making recommendations on language and citizenship education for people seeking naturalisation. The advisory group is working on a programme of study, which will be part of English for Speakers of Other Languages (ESOL) language teaching for those assessed as not having sufficient English. The Group has had two meetings so far and intends issuing an interim report early in the New Year, with a final report around Easter 2003.</p>
	<p pid=".613W.3/2">The Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Bill refers to applicants having to deomonstrate Xsufficient English (or Welsh or Scottish Gaelic)&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".613W.3/3">The Group is presently interpreting 'sufficient English' as meaning enough linguistic ability to sustain unskilled employment in an English-speaking environment. For those with that minimal level already, they consider that attendance at classes should raise their level of competence to the next entry level, as defined in the existing adult learning language skills criteria. In other words, the Group is considering the concept of attendance and progression, rather than requiring all applicants to reach an absolute standard that for some might never be achievable.</p>
	<p pid=".613W.3/4">The Group has considered whether there might be some sort of screening process to filter out those people who already have sufficient English. While we do not want to make unnecessary work for people who already have a good command of one of the UK languages, we do want them to demonstrate their knowledge of life in the UK. Screening might also be used to allocate people to programmes which best meet their needs. ESOL teachers are well used to assessing linguistic capability to get people on to the right course and a number of such tools already exist.</p>
	<p pid=".613W.3/5">Defining these borderlines more precisely will of course take a little time. Issues of numbers and resources, as well as standards, will also need to be considered. And, as I have said already, those with good English already may not be required to attend all the classes and may study privately for the citizenship element of the programme. This will require some innovative thought about delivery methods, bearing in mind that the overall objective is to facilitate integration and not just to test knowledge.</p>
	<p pid=".613W.3/6">For those people for whom any course of study would be too challenging, perhaps by virtue of their age or infirmity, or because they have learning difficulties, the Bill includes a provision to waive these requirements. So, people who can provide sound reasons for not demonstrating progress or achievement will not be debarred from acquiring British citizenship.</p>
	<p pid=".613W.3/7">The Group is currently considering a XLiving in the United Kingdom&quot; programme under six broad heads. These are:</p>
	<p pid=".613W.3/8" class="indent">Information on everyday needs&mdash;for instance, types of housing, paying bills, and schooling;</p>
	<p pid=".613W.3/9" class="indent">Knowing the law&mdash;for instance, the rights and responsibilities of a citizen;</p>
	<p pid=".613W.3/10" class="indent">Sources of help and information&mdash;including both national and local voluntary and community bodies;</p>
	<p pid=".613W.3/11" class="indent">Employment&mdash;for instance, understanding how to get a job, and employment rights and responsibilities;</p>
	<p pid=".613W.3/12" class="indent">Britain as a changing and multi-cultural society&mdash;including the four historical nations, the new ethnic and religious groups and changing patterns in family life and relationships;</p>
	<p pid=".613W.3/13" class="indent">British national institutions&mdash;political, economic and social<i>.</i></p>
	<p pid=".613W.3/14">The level would obviously be basic, and dependent on someone's needs at a particular point in their immigration history. But the Group is involved in ongoing discussions as to whether a more in-depth programme on the last two items would not be sensible for those with good English already.</p>
	<p pid=".613W.3/15">I understand that, because some migrants do not become eligible for free education immediately, the Group intends recommending that the kind of information contained in the XLiving in Britain&quot; programme should be made available, perhaps at the point at which entry clearance is granted, to people such as work permit holders or spouses who have an avenue to indefinite leave to remain. For this purpose, the members will be proposing that the Government produces a 'Living in Britain' booklet to be given out at ports of entry or at posts abroad. Such a booklet could be translated into a number of languages to help those who, as yet, have not acquired language skills but who could, nevertheless, benefit from what it contains in their path to becoming active, involved citizens.</p>
	<p pid=".613W.3/16">The Group intends to make an interim report early in the new year for public discussion and hopes to make a final report around Easter. The group will shortly be embarking on a widespread programme of consultation.</p>

	<p pid=".619W.11/1">Discussions with European colleagues about the problem of child prostitution have been largely in the context of negotiations over a Draft European Union Council Framework Decision on combating the sexual exploitation of children and child pornography. This will require member states to criminalise particular aspects of the sexual exploitation of children aged up to 18, including those involved in prostitution. The UK fully supports this framework decision as a significant step to increase protection for children throughout Europe. We hope it will be agreed shortly.</p>
	<p pid=".619W.11/2">Strengthening our laws to meet the requirements of the framework decision will form part of our plans to reform the framework of laws dealing with sexual offences on which we will be publishing a paper later this autumn. This follows on from XSetting the Boundaries&quot;, the report of the Review of Sex Offences published in July 2000, which made a number of recommendations to strengthen the law, including providing better legal safeguards against those who seek to exploit children in prostitution.</p>
	<p pid=".619W.11/3">We also issued in May 2000 guidance to the police and other agencies on XSafeguarding Children Involved in Prostitution&quot;, which highlighted the importance of children involved in prostitution being treated primarily as abused children. This followed discussions with representatives from the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) and the other agencies concerned.</p>
	<p pid=".619W.11/4">Moreover, we have been supporting under the Crime Reduction Programme a number of local projects aimed at evaluating best practice in dealing with prostitution, including how best to help young people leave behind their involvement in prostitution. All these projects are supported or led by the police and involve local agencies working together to find practical solutions. The aim is to identify the most effective strategies so that these can be disseminated.</p>

	<p pid=".620W.2/2">A public awareness campaign was launched by the Home Office in December 2001, following discussion in the Task Force, to alert children of 14&ndash;16 and parents of younger children to the dangers presented by paedophiles using the internet, to deliver key safety messages, and to advise them of sources of information and support. The campaign used advertisements in national newspapers and magazines, radio, cinemas, satellite TV, and online. The key points were to make clear that someone a child meets on the internet may not be who they seem, and that children should not give out personal information online. This was well received and evaluation showed that it was successful in raising awareness of the key messages. We are now considering further activity to be carried out later this year.</p>

	<p pid=".620W.5/1">Improvements in the protection of children held in prison custody are being taken forward by the development of child protection policy and practice, involving co-operation between the Prison Service, the Youth Justice Board and social services, as well as a range of community-based charities.</p>
	<p pid=".620W.5/2">Considerable progress has already been made. Through the revision of the child protection protocol and the policy set out in the relevant Prison Service order, the relationship between young offender institutions holding juveniles and their local Area Child Protection Committees (ACPC) have been greatly improved with most governors now having representation on the local ACPC.</p>
	<p pid=".620W.5/3">Each YOI in the juvenile estate has appointed a child protection co-ordinator (and deputy) and has established a child protection committee within the establishment, with some having representation on that committee from the local ACPC, police and other relevant agencies.</p>
	<p pid=".620W.5/4">A child protection training programme has been developed for all staff within the juvenile estate.</p>

	<p pid=".623W.5/1">Crime against the elderly is horrifying, but is thankfully uncommon; levels fell by 20 per cent. between British Crime Survey (BCS) 1996 and BCS 2000, and older people are on average only a sixth as likely as the young to suffer a personal crime. We are making special efforts to reduce the chances still further, and in particular we have developed and implemented a strategy to clamp down on the despicable crime of distraction burglary. Levels of fear of crime among older people are still too high; we are committed to reducing them, and we are working with charities such as Help The Aged to find new and better ways of tackling fear of crime among seniors as well as crimes against them.</p>

	<p pid=".624W.3/1">Specific reconviction figures are not collected for first time prisoners. The Prison Service has been set a target to reduce the rate of reconvictions of all released prisoners by five per cent. compared to the predicted rate by 2004. To meet this target the Prison Service draws on 'What Works' research to provide regimes which are effective in tackling offending behaviour and the factors which contribute towards re-offending.</p>
	<p pid=".624W.3/2">There is no evidence to suggest that segregating prisoners leads to a reduction in recidivism or overall drug use. There are no statistics available on which to base an estimate of the numbers of prisoners who adopt a drug habit whilst in prison; drug taking by its nature is a covert activity.</p>
	<p pid=".624W.3/3">Voluntary drug testing programmes are available for prisoners who wish to make a commitment to remain drug free. Ninety prisons currently have voluntary drug testing units in operation. These do not provide segregation but they do provide a degree of separation from prisoners not making a formal commitment to remain drug free.</p>

	<p pid=".627W.8/2">Following their redesignation earlier this year as removal centres, the prison service detention facilities at Dover, Haslar and Lindholme ceased to operate under Prison Rules. As a consequence, detainees no longer had the opportunity to undertake paid employment in the centres and the practice of relying on such work for the provision of certain ancillary services came to an end. Work formerly undertaken by detainees at these centres has been contracted out or transferred to agency staff. For this year this has resulted in a net additional cost of #1.09 million. This will be met from the Immigration and Nationality Directorate's budget.</p>
	<p pid=".627W.8/3">Regimes in immigration removal centres provide detainees with a wide range of constructive activities based on education, crafts, physical education, religion and recreation. All activities are voluntary although detainees are encouraged to take part in them. Some centres provide a cash allowance, although not as an incentive to engage in activities, and we are considering standardising this and making it universal. While we are considering incentives and further ways to enhance activities available to detainees, we have no plans to require detainees to undertake paid work or to assist in the running of removal centres.</p>

Sadly, however, we recognise that there is a small minority of young people&mdash;just 4 per cent. of those juveniles dealt with by police and courts each year&mdash;whose offending is so serious or so persistent, that custody may be the only immediate answer. In those cases, we must ensure that such a sentence is as constructive an experience for them as possible, and to this end we have introduced the new Detention and Training Order for juveniles and improved the custodial regimes with supervision and support after release.</p>

	<p pid=".628W.5/1">Together with my right hon. and noble Friend Lord Filkin and my noble Friend Baroness Scotland, I represented the United Kingdom at the Justice and Home Affairs Council in Luxembourg on 14 and <phrase class="date" code="2002-10-15">15 October</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".628W.5/2">The A points were approved as in document PTS A 48 (12810/02) (a copy of which has been placed in the Library) with the exception of item 9. The Council also reached political agreement on the Directive on legal aid and the Framework Decision on combating sexual exploitation of children and child pornography.</p>
	<p pid=".628W.5/3">The Framework Decision on combating corruption in the private sector and the Framework Decision laying down minimum provisions on the constituent elements of criminal acts and penalties in the field of drug trafficking remained subject to reservations on the scope of the offence and the penalties for trafficking in small quantities of drugs respectively.</p>
	<p pid=".628W.5/4">The Council discussed whether the Framework Decision on confiscation of crime-related proceeds, instrumentalities and property should create an obligation on member states to provide for confiscation of property beyond that arising directly from the offence. Lord Filkin argued that it should and that the burden should be on the offender to prove that the property was acquired legitimately. The majority of member states agreed but argued that this obligation should arise only in circumstances involving a limited number of offences and that the burden should be on the court to establish the origin of the property. Member states shared the view that there should not be an automatic assumption that the property of a spouse or</p>
	<p pid=".628W.5/5">co-habitee was also acquired from criminal proceeds.</p>
	<p pid=".628W.5/6">The Council examined some of the outstanding reservations on the Framework Decision on the application of the principle of mutual recognition to financial penalties. There was agreement to include a provision recognising the application of fundamental human rights, subject to negotiation of an accompanying Recital. Member states were, however, divided on the level of the financial threshold below which member states could refuse to execute a financial penalty. Four member states were also unable to accept the absence of a dual criminality requirement in the instrument.</p>
	<p pid=".628W.5/7">The Council reached a general approach on the Council Decision on the investigation and prosecution of war crimes, genocide and crimes against humanity subject to parliamentary scrutiny reserves from five member states, including the UK, and pending the opinion of the European Parliament.</p>
	<p pid=".628W.5/8">The Presidency sought agreement to the Council Decision establishing a mechanism for evaluating the legal systems and their implementation at national level in the fight against terrorism. Lord Filkin expressed the Government's broad support for the measure but said that it could not enter into a political agreement since the text remained subject to parliamentary scrutiny in the UK. He reserved the right to return to the substance. Two other member states also maintained parliamentary scrutiny reserves.</p>
	<p pid=".628W.5/9">The Council agreed the principles for determining the selection procedure for the appointment of the Europol Directorate as part of the proposal for amending the Europol Staff Regulations. Lord Filkin said that it was essential to establish a fair and open procedure which led to appointment on merit.</p>
	<p pid=".628W.5/10">Justice and Home Affairs Ministers of the member states and of candidate countries met in the margins of the Council and discussed the timetable for the removal of internal frontier controls in the Schengen area post-enlargement. There was also a discussion of the obligations and responsibilities created by new instruments applying the principle of mutual recognition. Lord Filkin emphasised that the successful application of these instruments required trust in each other's judicial systems. He welcomed the Commission's new proposals for monitoring arrangements to be included in the accession treaties. A Declaration was agreed condemning violence against commercial lorry drivers. The candidate countries were informed of the Council's intention to agree, the following day, a declaration concerning applications for asylum from citizens of the candidate countries.</p>
	<p pid=".628W.5/11">The Commission presented its two proposals for a Council Directive on minimum standards on procedures in member states for granting and withdrawing refugee status and a Council Directive on the conditions of entry and residence of third-country nationals for the purposes of studies or other purposes. The Commission also reported on its progress in negotiating readmission agreements with third countries. The Presidency presented a draft programme on EU returns to Afghanistan.</p>
	<p pid=".628W.5/12">The Presidency provided information on member states' planned projects to follow up the plan for the management of the external borders and the plan for fighting illegal immigration and trafficking in human beings. The Council agreed conclusions on action to be taken as a matter of urgency to further prevent and combat illegal migration and trafficking in human beings.</p>
	<p pid=".628W.5/13">The Council discussed the criteria for assigning responsibility for an asylum claim and the deadlines for transfers in the Regulation establishing the criteria and mechanisms for determining the member states responsible for examining an asylum application lodged in one of the member states by a third-country national (Dublin II). Lord Filkin supported the existing qualifying period for the application of the illegal presence criterion and called for the deletion of the requirement to prove illegal entry before applying this criterion.</p>
	<p pid=".628W.5/14">The Council discussed the definitions of a refugee and the concept of Xserious and unjustified harm&quot; in the Council Directive on minimum standards for the qualification and status of third-country nationals and stateless persons as refugees or as persons who otherwise need international protection. The UK and the Presidency welcomed a proposal from Commissioner Vitorino reformulating the definition of Xserious and unjustified harm&quot; to clarify its scope of application in conflict situations, responding to UK concerns.</p>
	<p pid=".628W.5/15">The Presidency sought adoption of the Directive laying down minimum standards for the reception of asylum seekers in member states. One member state maintained the view that the provision on access to labour markets should be deleted. The Presidency agreed that the Council should work with a view to incorporating an addition to the Directive, proposed by the UK, to allow a member state to refuse support in cases where the applicant does not submit his claim as soon as reasonably practicable. The Council would seek to approve the Directive at its November meeting.</p>
	<p pid=".628W.5/16">The Council agreed conclusions on the integration of third country nationals and discussed the outstanding issues on the Council Directive concerning the status of third-country nationals who are long-term residents. The majority of member states were able to accept the inclusion of refugees within the scope of the text and favoured a five year residence requirement. There was also general support for the measures regarding rights of mobility for third country nationals. The UK has not opted in to the adoption of this measure.</p>
	<p pid=".628W.5/17">Ministers agreed a Declaration asserting that from the point of signature of the Accession Treaties applications for asylum from citizens from the EU candidate countries should be treated as manifestly unfounded.</p>

	<p pid=".631W.5/1">A number of Government agencies have responsibility for combating money laundering in the United Kingdom.</p>
	<p pid=".631W.5/2">In England and Wales, the Economic Crime Branch of the National Criminal Intelligence Service (NCIS) is responsible for the receipt, analysis and dissemination of all reports made in the United Kingdom which are indicative of a suspicion of money laundering. Subsequent investigations of a suspected money laundering offence are undertaken primarily by police forces, the National Crime Squad or Her Majesty's Customs and Excise (HMCE), but can also fall within the investigative remit of other agencies such as the Serious Fraud Office or Inland Revenue. Prosecutions for money laundering offences are conducted by the Crown Prosecution Service and HMCE.</p>
	<p pid=".631W.5/3">In relation to Scotland, investigations of a suspected money laundering offence are carried out by the police and Customs and Excise under the direction of the procurator fiscal. Prosecutions are conducted by the Lord Advocate or his representative, the procurator fiscal.</p>
	<p pid=".631W.5/4">In addition, the Financial Services Authority has the power to make rules on money laundering, and impose civil penalties for breaches of those rules. It also has the power to prosecute breaches of the Money Laundering Regulations. HMCE has responsibility for the oversight of Money Service Operators and has powers to prosecute for a range of money laundering offences.</p>
	<p pid=".631W.5/5">In November 2001, the Government published its National Asset Recovery Strategy drawn up by the Asset Recovery Committee. One of the central aims of the strategy is to prevent criminals and their associates from laundering the proceeds of criminal conduct, and to detect and prosecute such laundering where it occurs. The strategy has the support of the Departments and agencies involved in the fight against money laundering activity who have committed themselves to acting in accordance with its principles.</p>

	<p pid=".633W.5/2">Last week we announced that a persistent offender scheme will start in February 2003 across the whole criminal justice system. Its aim will be to target the most prolific offenders, to bring more offences committed by them to justice, and to rehabilitate them more effectively. This scheme is an important part of the 'Narrowing the Justice Gap' programme which aims to reduce the difference between the number of crimes reported to the police and the number of offences brought to justice. In addition the Government have already: given the courts new secure remand and tagging powers for 12 to 16-year olds who repeatedly offend on bail; funded the Youth Justice Board's intensive supervision and surveillance programmes for the most prolific young offenders; and renewed its commitment to maintain the time from arrest to sentence for persistent young offenders at or below 71 days.</p>

An essential element of the course is that officers should recognise the need to give priority to public safety above all other considerations such as attending an incident or apprehending a suspect. Where pursuits are concerned, there is a nationally agreed ACPO Pursuit Code of Practice and it is already police policy to consider continuously the consequences of a pursuit and whether to break it off. In addition, all forces have adopted some or most of the recommendations from the 1998 Lind Report on Police Pursuit Driver Training.</p>

	<p pid=".636W.5/1">The Government believe that prison is right for those convicted of an offence who are a danger to the public or who are serious or persistent offenders and that sentences served should be as long as necessary for punishment, public protection and rehabilitation but no longer. It also recognises that short sentences with no support and no supervision after release do not allow the correctional services to do effective behavioural or rehabilitation work with offenders. We set out our proposals for reducing the use of short sentences in the White Paper XJustice for All&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".636W.5/2">Home detention curfew plays an important role in managing the prison population by enabling prisoners to be released from prison early, while still subject to restrictions placed on their liberty. This facilitates a smoother and more effective integration back into the community and helps offenders to serve or resume employment or training as soon as possible.</p>
	<p pid=".636W.5/3">As also announced in the White Paper XJustice for All&quot; I have commissioned an independent review of the correctional services in England and Wales looking particularly at effectiveness and value for money in the delivery of services to reduce re-offending and how we improve our ability to manage the prison population. This review is in progress. As well as the correctional services, other professional and voluntary sector stakeholders have also been invited to submit their views.</p>

These estimates are derived from studies on the reconviction of offenders for more serious crimes, with assumptions made to relate them to unsolved crimes. Details of the relevant research can be found in Annex B of the White Paper XCriminal Justice: the Way Ahead&quot; (February 2001).</p>

	<p pid=".642W.5/3" class="indent">1. commission research into the effectiveness of strip searching;</p>
	<p pid=".642W.5/4" class="indent">2. introduce procedures to ensure that new receptions understand they will be strip searched and what is involved;</p>

	<p pid=".642W.5/8" class="indent">6. issue guidance on strip searching of pregnant, disabled or elderly prisoners;</p>
	<p pid=".642W.5/9" class="indent">7. post-operative and bedridden prisoners, and those who are in severe pain or have recently given birth, should be strip searched only in exceptional circumstances;</p>

	<p pid=".642W.5/13" class="indent">11. consider using the sideways stance for rub down searching of violent prisoners;</p>
	<p pid=".642W.5/14" class="indent">12. ensure managers set and communicate realistic targets for rub down searches;</p>
	<p pid=".642W.5/15" class="indent">13. cease the practice of randomly rub down searching official and professional visitors to Category C and D prisons and to most women's prisons and YOIs;</p>
	<p pid=".642W.5/16" class="indent">14. draw a distinction between solicitors and barristers, and legal advisers who are not counted as solicitors for the purposes of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act (PACE), and should be searched as though they were domestic visitors;</p>
	<p pid=".642W.5/17" class="indent">15. issue guidance on how to react to a passive drug dog indication; and</p>

	<p pid=".642W.5/21">Recommendation 2 will be implemented when the Prison Service Order on Reception, which is currently being reviewed, is re-issued. Recommendations 11 and 14 will be covered in the revision of the Security Manual, which is under way. Recommendation 4 is that the Prison Service should make arrangements for the statistical recording and monitoring of strip searches. An IT solution to this requirement is being considered by the Prison Service's IT provider, although its achievement will depend on an assessment of the relative priority compared with other major IT developments needed by the service.</p>
	<p pid=".642W.5/22">Recommendation 3 was to set aside resources to evaluate technology to replace routine strip searching. The Prison Service has set aside resources to enable the Police Scientific Development Branch to do this. As present, there are no suitable available alternatives capable of finding all items found during a search, such as drugs, weapons or other contraband.</p>
	<p pid=".642W.5/23">There are no plans to use metal detectors in place of strip searching at Holloway prison, or elsewhere. Metal detectors are unable to detect drugs and any non-metallic contraband hidden beneath clothing.</p>
	<p pid=".642W.5/24">A Prison Service Instruction issued in August 2000 dealt with the minor changes in procedures covered in recommendations 5, 6, 7, 10, 12 and 16. Governors were asked to comply with recommendations 9, 13 and 15 in separate guidance and correspondence.</p>
	<p pid=".642W.5/25">The Prison Service has commissioned research into strip searching procedures and perceptions (to meet recommendation 1). The research will be carried out by a research team from Nottingham University. The research methodology is being developed, and the research will be carried out in a representative sample of prisons over the next nine months. The researchers are due to make their report to the Prison Service by September 2003.</p>

	<p pid=".646W.3/2">Disability living allowance and attendance allowance are designed to provide a contribution towards the extra costs associated with severe disability. The benefits are assessed by looking at the disabled person's care needs and, in the case of disability living allowance, mobility needs.</p>
	<p pid=".646W.3/3">Disability living allowance was introduced in 1992 by bringing together the separate attendance and mobility allowances into a single benefit, which gave additional help to severely disabled people under age 65 for whom disability is more financially disruptive in terms of lost opportunity to earn and save.</p>
	<p pid=".646W.3/4">The vast majority of people can expect to have some restrictions as they get older and it is reasonable to expect people to make provision for this. Attendance allowance continues to be available for severely disabled people aged 65 or over who need help with personal care.</p>
	<p pid=".646W.3/5">Disability living allowance unified and simplified the six months qualifying test inherited from attendance allowance and the 12-month prospective qualifying test inherited from mobility allowance by providing that a severely disabled person must have satisfied the entitlement conditions throughout the past three months and be likely to continue to satisfy them throughout the next six months.</p>
	<p pid=".646W.3/6">Attendance allowance retains a six month qualifying period because a prospective test is less likely to be relevant to the disabilities&mdash;often degenerative&mdash;suffered by older people.</p>
	<p pid=".646W.3/7">The Government believe that this broad framework is fair and sensible, and in particular that it is right to give the most help to those who are severely disabled early in life and who may face limited opportunities to work and save.</p>

	<p pid=".649W.6/1">Information on delayed discharges has been collected at health authority rather than individual trust level, on a quarterly basis. As of Quarter 1 of 2002&ndash;03 this information will be collected quarterly at primary care trust level. All available information has been placed in the Library.</p>
	<p pid=".649W.6/2">The Government recognises that delayed discharges are a problem across the south. Health and local authorities are working together to take action to improve the situation. In October 2001 the Government announced an extra #300 million in the 'Cash for Change' initiative to tackle delayed transfers of care. Last year Somerset received over #700,000, this year over #1.5 million.</p>

In addition to these efforts, the Government have spent approximately #10,000 on a breast awareness teaching kit for primary care in conjunction with the European Community and the cancer research campaign. #38,500 has also been spent nationally on XBe Breast Aware&quot; leaflets and #131,000 on information leaflets for women about breast screening.</p>

The annual numbers of deaths in England has decreased from 11,240 in 1997 to 10,609 in 2000.

	<p pid=".659W.2/1">The Department and the national cancer director, Professor Mike Richards, have received both formal and informal representations about cancer funding from national health service and voluntary organisations as well as individual clinicians and managers providing cancer care. Professor Richards is working with chief executives of strategic health authorities to ensure that the money gets through to cancer services and that cancer plan targets are met.</p>
	<p pid=".659W.2/2">We are devolving power from the centre to locally run services, to allow the freedom to innovate and improve care for patients. The increased resources that we have made available and will continue to make available to support the implementation of the cancer plan will move to the NHS frontline. Primary care trusts will have freedom to decide where NHS resources are best spent, but they will need to account publicly for how they have used resources against the test of high clinical standards and good value for money.</p>

This Department works closely with other Government Departments to ensure that policy initiatives on health, sport and recreation, education and transport are co-ordinated and contribute to our shared goal of increasing access and rates of physical activity. This has been backed up by significant investment, including #581 million from the new opportunities fund for a physical education and sports programme, #459 million to transform physical education, school sport and club links over the next three years and #2.5 million for a new programme of local exercise action pilots, led by primary care trusts (PCTs).</p>

	<p pid=".671W.8/2">Information on waiting times for magnetic resource imaging (MRI) scans is not collected centrally. The length of time that a patient may have to wait for any scan is dependent on their clinical condition. Emergency cases need to be seen immediately. Other cases will be carried out as quickly as possible, however this is dependent on the clinical priority of all the remaining patients waiting to be scanned. To increase the capacity of diagnostic services, we are making unprecedented investment for the provision of new and replacement scanners. By 2004, 88 new MRI scanners and 186 new computed tomography (CT) scanners will have been delivered through central purchasing initiatives. In addition to this, workforce initiatives are underway that aim to improve recruitment and retention of staff and we are streamlining the way care is delivered through the cancer services collaborative.</p>

	<p pid=".672W.2/1">We have today published proposals to reform the welfare food scheme under the title Healthy Start.</p>
	<p pid=".672W.2/2">The welfare food scheme has done great service for the last 60 years in providing milk and vitamins, primarily to expectant and nursing mothers, babies and children under five years of age in low income families. In line with our commitment in The NHS Plan, we are seeking to bring the scheme up to date in line with the latest expert advice on nutrition. Our proposals for this #142 million scheme will broaden the nutritional base of the scheme and offer a wider choice to families. We propose to do this through the introduction of a fixed face value voucher that can be exchanged for fruit and vegetables, cereal based foods, other foods suitable for weaning, as well as milk and infant formula. We are also proposing to link the scheme more closely with the NHS through antenatal and post-natal clinics. The new scheme will provide a healthier start for children from poorer families and link with our wider efforts to tackle health inequalities, and improve nutrition and food access.</p>
	<p pid=".672W.2/3">We are already working with the devolved administrations and actively seeking the views of interested parties and stakeholders on these proposals, including the users of the scheme, health professionals, the food and dairy industry and small firms. This consultation will run until <phrase class="date" code="2002-12-13">13 December</phrase>.</p>

	<p pid=".676W.2/1">The Ministry of Defence has two central schemes, which have not been subject to a national roll out. In the last academic year the Department rolled out its Skill Force programme to 11 pilot locations: Ashfield (Nottinghamshire), Birmingham, Bristol, Great Yarmouth (Norfolk), Knowsley (Merseyside), North Lanarkshire, Leicester, Rochdale, Newcastle, West Norfolk, Islington (London). The budget for the Skill Force programme was approximately #1 million funded by the Treasury's Invest to Save Budget, Ministry of Defence and co-funding from local partner organisations. The initiative is expanding to 23 schemes with a start date of November 2002. This expansion is being co-funded by the DfES and Welsh Assembly.</p>
	<p pid=".676W.2/2">The Army Cadet 'Outreach' programme is being undertaken by 25 counties within the UK: Berkshire, Bristol, Bucks, Cheshire, Cleveland, Dorset, Durham, Dyfed, Essex, Glamorgan, Gloucestershire, Gwent, Hampshire, Kent, Middlesex, Northumbria, Oxfordshire, Powys, Surrey, Yorkshire, Perthshire, Lancashire, Hertfordshire, Leicestershire, and Wiltshire. The cost for this programme is some #150,000.</p>
	<p pid=".676W.2/3">The Ministry of Defence has a number of other schemes/initiatives, which have not been rolled out nation wide, such as Ministry of Defence base specific conservation projects. However, details of these types of scheme are not held centrally and could be provided only at disproportionate cost.</p>
