	<p pid="a.625W.3/1">The EU Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), in its current form, impacts on agricultural markets in Africa by increasing world supply, thus lowering world prices; by artificially raising EU prices; by heavily subsidising exports; by undermining world price stability and by limiting access to our markets through the use of high import tariffs.</p>
	<p pid="a.625W.3/2">This imposes high costs on developing countries. Empirical research has shown that amongst rich countries, the EU is responsible for the biggest costs to developing country farmers. Reform of the CAP could increase developing countries' food and farming income by $7.5 billion per year, which could significantly reduce poverty for those producers in Africa.</p>
	<p pid="a.625W.3/3">DFID and the UK are committed to reform of the CAP in order to facilitate freer and fairer agricultural trade between developing countries, including in Africa, and the EU. This issue is being analysed in theCommission for Africa Report, expected in March2005.</p>
	<p pid="a.625W.3/4">DFID will continue to press for reforms on the EU side including by weakening the link between EU farm support and domestic production to discourage over production (which lowers the world market price), and providing better market access by reducing tariffs andwill also continue to build supply-side capacity of agricultural producers including infrastructure and technological development to improve quality andcompetitiveness of African products.</p>

	<p pid="a.630W.3/1" class="holdinganswer">holding answer <phrase class="date" code="2005-02-21">21 February 2005</phrase></p>
	<p pid="a.630W.3/2">A wide range of regional activities on the environment are co-ordinated and prioritised through the West Midlands Regional Assembly's Regional Environmental Partnership, to which many of Defra's agencies actively contribute. Although only formed recently, it is currently considering a number of sectors, including waste, energy, biodiversity, urban design, Water Framework Directive, area-based approaches, etc. This group also contributes to the implementation and review of the Regional Spatial Strategy.</p>
	<p pid="a.630W.3/3">The work of individual agencies is very varied, but includes the following:</p>
	<p pid="a.630W.3/4" class="italic">Environment Agency</p>
	<p pid="a.630W.3/5">The priorities of the Environment Agency are set out in its corporate strategy, entitled Making it happen&quot;. They are as follows:</p>
	<p pid="a.630W.3/6" class="indent">An enhanced environment for wildlife</p>
	<p pid="a.630W.3/7" class="indent">Cleaner air for everyone</p>
	<p pid="a.630W.3/8" class="indent">Improved and protected inland and coastal waters</p>
	<p pid="a.630W.3/9" class="indent">Restored, protected land with healthier soils</p>
	<p pid="a.630W.3/10" class="indent">A greener&quot; business world</p>
	<p pid="a.630W.3/11" class="indent">Wiser, sustainable use of natural resources</p>
	<p pid="a.630W.3/12" class="indent">Limiting and adapting to climate change</p>
	<p pid="a.630W.3/13" class="indent">Reducing flood risk</p>
	<p pid="a.630W.3/14" class="italic">English Nature</p>
	<p pid="a.630W.3/15">(i) Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI): There are 439 SSSI in the West Midlands region and currently 65 per cent. are either in favourable or recovering management condition. Only around 5 per cent. have been classified as declining in management condition. In some cases improvements in management condition are secured by English Nature through management agreements under its Wildlife Enhancement Scheme and in others by the Rural Development Service through agri-environment schemes. On other sites improved management has been achieved with support from the Heritage Lottery fund, for example at Cannock Chase and Sutton Park under the Tomorrow's Heathland Heritage initiative.</p>
	<p pid="a.630W.3/16">One major outstanding issue which relates to the condition of river and other wetland SSSIs is diffuse pollution, invariably from agricultural sources. Under the Modernising Rural Delivery Programme a specific pilot scheme is now underway to tackle diffuse pollution issues on the river Teme through collaborative working among both relevant agencies including the Integrated Agency confederation and the Environment Agency together with local individuals and groups.</p>
	<p pid="a.630W.3/17">(ii) Biodiversity: The Government is supporting the co-ordination the of six Local Biodiversity Action Plan (LBAP) Partnerships operating in the West Midlands and the delivery of specific nature conservation actions for a selection of each area's most threatened habitats and species. This ranges from restoration of lowland heathland in Staffordshire and Worcestershire to the survival of water voles in Birmingham and Herefordshire. The region's Biodiversity Strategy (to be launched March 2005), and the associated regional biodiversity audit and regional habitats targets work, has derived from strong Government engagement with and facilitation of partnership outputs. The ODPM's Regional Planning Guidance (June 2004) incorporates policy intent to achieve effective protection and measurable gains in the conservation status of 23 priority habitats by 2010.</p>
	<p pid="a.630W.3/18" class="italic">England Rural Development Programme (ERDP)</p>
	<p pid="a.630W.3/19">The Rural Development Service, through its West Midlands offices, operates a range of agri-environment schemes as part of the ERDP. Expenditure under these in 2003&ndash;04 was as follows:</p>

	<p pid="a.634W.2/2">The road in question is the responsibility of Somerset county council, the local highway authority. It is understood that journey speeds on the A39 in Bridgwater have been monitored twice, in 2001 and 2004. The results showed a 7 per cent. and 11 per cent. decrease in peak and off-peak speeds respectively. However, partly as a result of the completion in January 2003 of the Bridgwater Northern Relief Road, these decreases were considerably lower than on other routes in the town.</p>

	<p pid="a.636W.5/2">I understand that sixteen four-car Meridian trains have been successfully introduced into service on Midland Mainline and will continue to operate throughout the life of the franchise. There are also seven nine-car Meridians which are not yet in service. Discussions about them continue between the owning Rolling Stock Company and Midland Mainline. Careful consideration will be given to any proposal for their possible future use.</p>

	<p pid="a.639W.7/1">Along with other Government Departments, the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister is committed to improving the lives of people across the whole of the United Kingdom. For example, the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister is determined that everyone should have the opportunity to have a decent home, and since 1997 we have reduced the number of non-decent homes nationally by one million.</p>
	<p pid="a.639W.7/2">Warrington borough council was awarded a place on Round 3 of the Arms Length Management Organisation (ALMO) programme in July 2003, with initial funding of &pound;18.3 million for 2004&ndash;05 and 2005&ndash;06, to help improve council stock to the decent homes standard. In November 2004 the Arms Length Management Organisation, Golden Gates Housing, qualified to access this funding by achieving a two star (good) rating from the Housing Inspectorate.</p>
	<p pid="a.639W.7/3">Since April 2003, the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister has also provided &pound;16 million of Supporting People grant to Warrington metropolitan borough council, to enable it to deliver housing related support services to vulnerable people in the area. Currently this provides over 3900 dwellings of support to a range of people-including homeless families, older people, people with learning disabilities and young people at risk.</p>
	<p pid="a.639W.7/4">More broadly, since May 2002 (when the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister was established) we have been able to increase the total amount of Government grant given to local authorities by &pound;11.1 billion. This is a 22 per cent. increase in real terms. Warrington has received average annual increases in formula grant of 6.5 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="a.639W.7/5">The Neighbourhood Statistics Service provides a wide range of statistical information at parliamentary constituency level, taken from the 2001 census and other sources. This service is available on the National Statistics website at <a href="http://neighbourhood.statistics.gov.uk">http://neighbourhood.statistics. gov.uk</a>./.</p>

	<p pid="a.656W.0/1">We have asked our posts in the relevant countries, and UKDel Geneva, to obtain the information requested from the UN High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR). It has become clear from the information received that the available figures are incomplete. Furthermore, the categories used to collect data vary from country to country, making it extremely difficult to collate comparable statistics. In many cases, the figures for the ethnic background of refugees are unreliable and the Kurdish element in the overall total for refugees from Iraq is not identified. To obtain further information would involve our posts making extensive inquiries and commissioning specific research which could be compiled only at disproportionate cost. The information that we have obtained is set out as follows.</p>
	<p pid="a.656W.0/2">In Iran, in early 2003, before the mainly&quot; spontaneous repatriation movement, the UNHCR estimates that there were 63,000 camp based and identified non-camp based Iraqi Kurdish refugees. The UNHCR estimates that there are currently 20,000 Iraqi Kurds still in Iran. The UNHCR estimates that there are also some 8,000 Faili Iraqi Kurds in Iran. Some of these are included in the overall number of Iraqi Kurds.</p>
	<p pid="a.656W.0/3">In Syria, the largest single influx of Iraqi refugees occurred in 1991, when about 8,000 persons, mainly Kurds, arrived. There are currently 234 Kurds registered with the UNHCR office in Damascus.</p>
	<p pid="a.656W.0/4">In Turkey, the UNHCRs active caseload of Iraqi refugees and asylum-seekers totals 1,576 persons, of whom 227 (14.4 per cent.) are ethnic Kurds. The UNHCR in Turkey has also registered 1,146 Iranian refugees who previously resided in Iraq for varying periods. These refugees are ethnic Kurds who entered Turkey between 2001 and 2003, prior to the onset of hostilities.</p>

	<p pid="a.666W.3/1">The administration of Jobcentre Plus is a matter for the chief executive of the Jobcentre Plus, David Anderson. He will write to the hon. Member.</p>
	<p pid="a.666W.3/2" class="letterfrom">Letter from David Anderson to Mr. Howard Flight, dated <phrase class="date" code="2005-02-23">23 February 2005</phrase></p>
	<p pid="a.666W.3/3" class="indent">The Secretary of State has asked me to reply directly to your questions concerning the average time taken to process a claim for Incapacity Benefit, Income Support, Income-Based Jobseeker's Allowance and Contribution-Based Jobseeker's Allowance in each year since 1975. This is something which falls within the responsibilities delegated to me as Chief Executive of Jobcentre Plus.</p>
	<p pid="a.666W.3/4" class="indent">Jobcentre Plus sets internal performance measures for managing its workloads in addition to the published targets set by Ministers. These internal measures include clearance times for Incapacity Benefit, Income Support and Jobseeker's Allowance. Currently, these internal measures are being met.</p>
	<p pid="a.666W.3/5" class="indent">You will see from the following tables that the Average Actual Clearance Time for each of the benefits shown has increased, although our performance targets are still</p>
	<p pid="a.666W.3/6" class="indent">being met. The upward trend in clearance times reflects the greater emphasis on secure and accurate payment of benefit. Changes to the Claims and Payments regulations in 1997 put the onus of proof on customers to provide supporting evidence for a claim.</p>
	<p pid="a.666W.3/7" class="indent">Increasing effort has been applied to enforcing this regime and we believe that this has been reflected in reductions in fraud (fraud and error losses have reduced by 37 per cent. between 1998 and 2004).</p>
	<p pid="a.666W.3/8" class="indent">There has also been a significant period of change across the Department; the creation of Jobcentre Plus and The Pension Service involved considerable movement of staff between the two agencies and consequently required the training</p>
	<p pid="a.666W.3/9" class="indent">of new benefit processing officers.</p>

	<p pid="a.672W.5/1">Rehabilitation and support allowance will be for people with less severe impairments that can be well managed with the right support and so need not be a major long- term obstacle to getting back to work. Disability and sickness allowance will focus more on those with the most severe impairments where the health problem or disability will, for some time, form a very significant obstacle to getting back to work. However, we know many people with severe impairments still do work, and want to do so. Disability and sickness allowance recipients will still be able to access any appropriate programme or financial support.</p>
	<p pid="a.672W.5/2">The basis of the division between the two benefits will be the severity of functional limitation as a result of a health condition or disability. Much more detailed work and consultation will be required in order for us to establish a settled boundary between the two allowances and how we provide for movement between the two.</p>

These will place greater accountability on managers to deal with absence and take into account recommendations of the recently published Managing Attendance in the Public Sector report.

Our overall approach revolves around building management capability, through training and support, to underpin the new policies.</p>

	<p pid="a.681W.5/13">1.Expenditure is taken from audited health authority accounts and summarisation forms which are prepared on a resource basis and therefore differ from cash allocations in the year. The expenditure is the total expenditure accounted for by the health authority. Figures are given in cash terms.</p>
	<p pid="a.681W.5/14">2.Allocations per weighted head of population provide a much more reliable measure to identify differences between funding of health.</p>
	<p pid="a.681W.5/15">3.In many HAs, there are factors which distort the expenditure. These include:</p>
	<p pid="a.681W.5/16">the HA acting in a lead capacity to commission healthcare or fund training on behalf of other health bodies; and</p>
	<p pid="a.681W.5/17">asset revaluations in national health service trusts being funded through HAs.</p>
	<p pid="a.681W.5/18">4.The majority of general dental services expenditure is not included in the individual health authority accounts or summarisation forms and is separately accounted for by the Dental Practice Board (DPB). An element of pharmaceutical services expenditure is accounted for by the Prescription Pricing Authority (PPA) and not by HAs. Total expenditure on these items by the DPB and the PPA cannot be allocated to individual health bodies and are therefore omitted from the answer.</p>
	<p pid="a.681W.5/19">5.For these reasons expenditure per head cannot be compared reliably between HAs or between different years.</p>

	<p pid="a.686W.5/1">The national service framework (NSF) for mental health provides a rationale and evidence base for a national standard for mental health services relating to carers of people with mental health problems. In accordance with the NSF, all individuals who provide regular and substantial care for a person on the care programme approach should have an assessment of their caring, physical and mental health needs repeated on at least an annual basis.

	<p pid="a.686W.5/3">In line with the NHS Plan, mental health provider trusts are recruiting 700 carer support workers to increase the breaks available for carers and to strengthen carer support networks.

	<p pid="a.697W.9/1">The Government are taking forward work to tackle alcohol-related crime and disorder through the Alcohol Harm Reduction Programme. Recent achievements include: the Alcohol Misuse Enforcement Campaigns which took place over the summer and winter last year, the introduction of new fixed penalty notices for minor alcohol offences from November last year and the launch of the first tranche of the Tackling violent Crime Programme&mdash;providing extra help to those areas which have the highest volumes of violent crime. We are also working with the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister to develop guidance for local authorities to help them manage the night-time economy.</p>
	<p pid="a.697W.9/2">To build on this work, the Government published a consultation document called Drinking Responsibly&quot; on <phrase class="date" code="2005-01-21">21 January 2005</phrase> outlining new policy proposals for tackling the problems of alcohol-related disorder. The proposals included: Alcohol Disorder Zones for town and city centres, Drinking Banning Orders, a review ofthe penalties associated with alcohol-related crimes and new police closure powers for premises selling to under-age children. Replies to the proposals in the consultation paper are due by the <phrase class="date" code="2005-02-28">28 February 2005</phrase>. We will consider all of the responses before making any final decisions on the proposals.</p>

	<p pid="a.699W.0/1">It is not the practice to give specific information about a particular case.

Cases in the Stage 2, in-custody queue currently being allocated to a Case Review Manager are, on average, 19 months old. The Commission would expect applications received in February 2005 to wait a comparable time, but this is subject to other factors such as the need to prioritise certain cases and the time taken to complete case reviews in progress. The majority of cases (some 77 per cent.) are, however, allocated for review with minimal delay, because they are assessed as requiring less than five caseworker-days' work.</p>

	<p pid="a.702W.0/1">The Government have put in place policies in the areas of crime reduction, antisocial behaviour, policing and active communities that are yielding considerable benefits for the Clwyd, South constituency, as well as for all parts of the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.702W.0/2">For example, between March 1997 and March 2004, the number of police officers in the North Wales Police Force increased by 256 from 1,369 to 1,625. The Government's introduction of Community Support Officers (CSOs) in 2002 has put 21 CSOs on North Wales' streets to tackle crime and antisocial behaviour. Between 1997 and 2003&ndash;04, North Wales has seen a reduction in recorded domestic burglary crimes of 5 per cent. and in recorded vehicle crimes of 4 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="a.702W.0/3">North Wales police will receive &pound;78.0 million in general grants for 2005&ndash;06, an increase of 3.76 per cent. (&pound;2.8 million) over 2004&ndash;05. North Wales benefits from the decision to provide a funding floor of 3.75 per cent. If the funding formula had been strictly applied, the Force would have received &pound;1.9 million less. General grants funding to North Wales has increased by 28.3 per cent. between 1997&ndash;98 and 2005&ndash;06. In addition to general grants, North Wales will also receive around &pound;9.5 million in specific grants funding for targeted initiatives and capital provision in 2005&ndash;06. The distribution of resources locally is a matter for the Police Authority and the Chief Constable.</p>
	<p pid="a.702W.0/4">As crime prevention requires action across communities, every area has had a local Crime and Disorder reduction Partnership (CDRP) since 1998 which brings together the police, health services, drugs agencies and council and community representatives to decide how to prevent and deter crime and antisocial behaviour. social behaviour.</p>
	<p pid="a.702W.0/5">The Crime Reduction Programme (CRP) was a pioneering government intervention programme which ran for three years from April 1999 in England and Wales and took an evidence-based approach to crime reduction. Grants of over &pound;340 million were allocated to over 1,470 projects, including CCTV, under 20 initiatives that formed part of the programme. For example, nine CCTV projects in the Clwyd, South area (which includes the three Community Safety Partnerships (CSPs) of Wrexham, Flintshire and Denbighshire) received a total of &pound;666,835 under the CRP.</p>
	<p pid="a.702W.0/6">Since 2001, a number of successive initiatives have provided direct funding to each of the 376 Crime and Disorder Reduction Partnerships (CDRPs) and specific projects. These include Communities Against Drugs, the Safer Communities Initiative, the Small Retailers in Deprived Areas scheme and the Building Safer Communities Fund. Since 2001 under these initiatives, a total of &pound;1.97 million has been allocated to the Clwyd, South area. A further &pound;1.42 million has been provided over the two years 2003&ndash;04 and 2004&ndash;05 to the Home Office Regional Director in the National Assembly for Wales for CSP capacity building across Wales.</p>
	<p pid="a.702W.0/7">It is estimated that out of a million active offenders, 100,000 have three or more convictions and are responsible for half of all crime. There is a Prolific and other Priority Offenders (PPO) scheme in Wrexham, Flintshire and Denbighshire set up to target those offenders who cause a disproportionate amount of crime, disorder and antisocial behaviour in the community.</p>
	<p pid="a.702W.0/8">The Government's Crime Reduction website provides further information on the work being done to reduce crime across the country, including information about action and results in local areas. It is available at <a href="http://www.crimereduction.gov.uk">http://www.crimereduction.gov.uk</a>.</p>
	<p pid="a.702W.0/9">New legislation has given local agencies a raft of powers, from antisocial behaviour orders to local dispersal orders and crack house closure powers, to work with local people to tackle antisocial behaviour and nuisance. In the three Community Safety Partnerships that include Clwyd a total of 11 antisocial behaviour orders are currently in force as of <phrase class="date" code="2005-02-11">11 February 2005</phrase>.

	<p pid="a.702W.0/10">The Government are working to ensure that citizens, communities and the voluntary sector are more fully engaged in tackling social problems, and there is more equality of opportunity and respect for people of all races and religions. Active community participation in England has increased by 1.5 million people between 2001 and 2003. Charities have been supported more effectively, and &pound;125 million is being invested across the country through the futurebuilders fund in voluntary and community organisations that help provide valuable public services.

	<p pid="a.706W.2/1">The Government has put in place policies in the areas of crime reduction, antisocial behaviour, policing and active communities that are yielding considerable benefits for the Blackpool South constituency, as well as for all parts of the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.706W.2/2">For example, between March 1997 and March 2004, the number of police officers in the Lancashire Police Force increased by 332 from 3,247 to 3,579. The Government's introduction of community support officers (CSOs) in 2002 has put 117 CSOs on Lancashire streets to tackle crime and antisocial behaviour. Between 1997 and 2003&ndash;04, Lancashire has seen a reduction in recorded domestic burglary crimes of 41 per cent. and in recorded vehicle crimes of 39 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="a.706W.2/3">Lancashire Police Force will receive &pound;190.8 million in general grants for 2005&ndash;06, an increase of 4.31 per cent. (&pound;7.9 million) over last year. Lancashire Police also gains around &pound;0.4 million from the Amending Report for 2003&ndash;04, bringing the overall increase to 4.52 per cent. General grants funding to Lancashire has increased by 14.5 per cent. between 1997&ndash;98 and 2000&ndash;01 and by 13.5 per cent. between 2001&ndash;01 and 2005&ndash;06. In addition to general grants, Lancashire will also receive &pound;17.4 million in specific grants funding for targeted initiatives in 2005&ndash;06. The distribution of resources locally is a matter for the police authority and the chief constable.</p>
	<p pid="a.706W.2/4">As crime prevention requires action across communities, every area has had a local crime and disorder reduction partnership (CDRP) since 1998 which brings together the police, health services, drugs agencies and council and community representatives to decide how to prevent and deter crime and antisocial behaviour.</p>
	<p pid="a.706W.2/5">The crime reduction programme (CRP) was a pioneering Government intervention programme which ran for three years from April 1999 in England and Wales and took an evidence-based approach to crime reduction. Grants of over &pound;340 million were allocated to over 1,470 projects, including CCTV, under 20 initiatives that formed part of the programme. Two CCTV projects in the Blackpool CDRP area received a total of &pound;666,350 from the CRP.</p>
	<p pid="a.706W.2/6">Since 2001, successive initiatives have provided direct funding to each of the 376 crime and disorder reduction partnerships in England and Wales. These initiatives include Communities Against Drugs, the Safer Communities Initiative, the Small Retailers in Deprived Areas scheme and the Building Safer Communities Fund. Since 2001, a total of &pound;1.05 million has been allocated to Blackpool CDRP under these initiatives. A further &pound;2.3 million has been provided over the two years 2003&ndash;04 and 2004&ndash;05 to the Home Office Regional Director in the North West for CDRP capacity building across the region.</p>
	<p pid="a.706W.2/7">It is estimated that out of a million active offenders, 100,000 have three or more convictions and are responsible for half of all crime. There is a Prolific and other Priority Offenders (PPO) scheme in Blackpool set up to target those offenders who cause a disproportionate amount of crime, disorder and antisocial behaviour in the community.</p>
	<p pid="a.706W.2/8">The Government's Crime Reduction Website provides further information on the work being done to reduce crime across the country, including information about action and results in local areas. It is available at <a href="http://www.crimereduction.gov.uk">http://www.crimereduction.gov.uk</a></p>
	<p pid="a.706W.2/9">New legislation has given local agencies a raft of powers, from antisocial behaviour orders to local dispersal orders and crack house closure powers, to work with local people to tackle anti-social behaviour and nuisance. In Blackpool a total of 20 antisocial behaviour orders have been issued as of <phrase class="date" code="2005-02-10">10 February 2005</phrase>.

(A copy of the Updated Drug Strategy 2002 is held in the Library.) Under this, the Government has invested substantially in measures to reduce the harms caused by illegal drugs, focussing on the four strands of:</p>
	<p pid="a.706W.2/11" class="indent">reducing the supply of illegal drugs;</p>
	<p pid="a.706W.2/12" class="indent">preventing young people from becoming problematic drug users;</p>

	<p pid="a.706W.2/14" class="indent">reducing drug-related crime.</p>
	<p pid="a.706W.2/15">Direct annual funding nationally to tackle drug misuse amounted to &pound;1,244 million in 2003&ndash;04, rising to &pound;1,344 million in 2004&ndash;05. Blackpool has seen a significant increase in direct funding for tackling drugs, in particular for drug treatment services and the throughcare and aftercare elements of the Drugs Intervention Programme. In 2003&ndash;04 the allocation for Blackpool Drug Action Team amounted to &pound;1.05 million, rising to &pound;1.53 million in 2004&ndash;05.

	<p pid="a.706W.2/16">The Government is working to ensure that citizens, communities and the voluntary sector are more fully engaged in tackling social problems, and there is more equality of opportunity and respect for people of all races and religions. Active community participation in England has increased by 1.5 million people between 2001 and 2003. Charities have been supported more effectively, and &pound;125 million is being invested across the country through the 'futurebuilders' fund in voluntary and community organisations that help provide valuable public services.

	<p pid="a.706W.2/17">This year, 2005, is the year of the volunteer which is being delivered by the Home Office in partnership with Community Service Volunteers and Volunteering England. This will include a whole range of events in local communities across the country that aim to celebrate the contribution which volunteers make to the quality of people's lives, and encourage more people to volunteer. We are particularly keen to encourage young people, black and minority ethnic groups, those with no qualifications and disabled people to get involved.

	<p pid="a.713W.2/3">Thames Valley police will receive &pound;220.6 million in general grants for 2005&ndash;06, an increase of 3.75 per cent. (&pound;7.9million) over last year. Thames Valley benefits from the decision to provide a funding floor of 3.75 per cent. If the funding formula had been strictly applied, the force would have received &pound;4.1 million less. General grants funding to Thames Valley has increased by 28.9 per cent. between 1997&ndash;08 and 2005&ndash;06. In addition to general grants, Thames Valley will also receive around &pound;23.8million in specific grants funding for targeted initiatives and capital provision in 2005&ndash;06. The distribution of resources locally is a matter for the police authority and the chief constable.</p>
	<p pid="a.713W.2/4">As crime prevention requires action across communities, every area has had a local crime and disorder reduction partnership (CDRP) since 1998 which brings together the police, health services, drugs agencies and council and community representatives to decide how to prevent and deter crime and antisocial behaviour.</p>
	<p pid="a.713W.2/5">The crime reduction programme (CRP) was a pioneering Government intervention programme which ran for three years from April 1999 in England and Wales and took an evidence-based approach to crime reduction. Grants of over &pound;340 million were allocated to over 1,470 projects, including CCTV, under 20 initiatives that formed part of the programme. One CCTV project in the Reading CDRP area received a total of &pound;749,500 from the CRP and one CCTV project in the west Berkshire CDRP area (which includes part of the Reading west constituency) received a total of &pound;16,500 from the CRP.</p>
	<p pid="a.713W.2/6">Since 2001, successive initiatives have provided direct funding to each of the 376 crime and disorder reduction partnerships in England and Wales. These initiatives include communities against drugs, the safer communities initiative, the small retailers in deprived areas scheme and the building safer communities fund. Since 2001, a total of &pound;1.56 million has been allocated to Reading CDRP and &pound;587,626 to west Berkshire CDRP under these initiatives. A further &pound;2.57 million has been provided over the two years 2003&ndash;04 and 2004&ndash;05 to the Home Office Regional Director in the south east for CDRP capacity building across the region.</p>
	<p pid="a.713W.2/7">It is estimated that out of a million active offenders, 100,000 have three or more convictions and are responsible for half of all crime. There is a prolific and other priority offenders (PPO) scheme in Reading and in west Berkshire set up to target those offenders who cause a disproportionate amount of crime, disorder and antisocial behaviour in the community.</p>
	<p pid="a.713W.2/8">The Government's crime reduction website provides further information on the work being done to reduce crime across the country, including information about action and results in local areas. It is available at <a href="http://www.crimereduction.gov.uk">http://www.crimereduction.gov.uk</a>.</p>
	<p pid="a.713W.2/9">New legislation has given local agencies a raft of powers, from antisocial behaviour orders to local dispersal orders and crack house closure powers, to work with local people to tackle antisocial behaviour and nuisance. In Reading a total of 12 antisocial behaviour orders (ASBOs) have been issued and in west Berkshire a total of four ASBOs have been issued as of <phrase class="date" code="2005-02-17">17 February 2005</phrase>. Local contacts for tackling antisocial behaviour can be found on <a href="http://www.together.gov.uk/authority.asp">http://www.together.gov.uk/authority.asp</a>.</p>
	<p pid="a.713W.2/10">Tackling drug misuse is a priority of this Government and its policy is set out in the 10 year national drug strategy launched in 1998 and updated in December 2002. (A copy of the updated drug strategy 2002 is held in the Library.) Under this, the Government have invested substantially in measures to reduce the harms caused by illegal drugs, focussing on the four strands of:</p>
	<p pid="a.713W.2/11" class="indent">reducing the supply of illegal drugs;</p>
	<p pid="a.713W.2/12" class="indent">preventing young people from becoming problematic drug users;</p>
	<p pid="a.713W.2/13" class="indent">providing effective treatment to all who need it; and</p>
	<p pid="a.713W.2/14" class="indent">reducing drug-related crime.</p>
	<p pid="a.713W.2/15">Direct annual funding nationally to tackle drug misuse amounted to &pound;1,244 million in 2003&ndash;04, rising to &pound;1,344 million in 2004&ndash;05. Reading and west Berkshire has seen a significant increase in direct funding for tackling drugs, in particular for drug treatment services and the throughcare and aftercare elements of the drugs intervention programme. In 2003&ndash;04 the allocation for reading drug action team amounted to &pound;1.71 million, rising to &pound;2.01 million in 2004&ndash;05. For west Berkshire drug action team, the 2003&ndash;04 allocation amounted to &pound;597,102, rising to &pound;729,165 in 2004&ndash;05. Details of action taken to tackle drugs in the Reading, West constituency can be obtained from the Reading drug action team and west Berkshire drug action team for contact details see <a href="http://www.drugs.gov.uk/Links/DrugActionTeams">http://www.drugs.gov.uk/Links/DrugActionTeams</a>.</p>
	<p pid="a.713W.2/16">The Government are working to ensure that citizens, communities and the voluntary sector are more fully engaged in tackling social problems, and there is more equality of opportunity and respect for people of all races and religions. Active community participation in England has increased by &pound;1.5 million people between 2001 and 2003. Charities have been supported more effectively, and &pound;125 million is being invested across the country through the 'futurebuilders' fund in voluntary and community organisations that help provide valuable public services. Advice on ways to engage local people in helping their communities is available on the Active Citizenship Centre website <a href="http://www.active-citizen.org.uk">http://www.active-citizen.org.uk</a>.</p>
	<p pid="a.713W.2/17">Investment is also being made in voluntary and community sector infrastructure under the ChangeUp Scheme, so that frontline groups and organisations can access the support and expertise they need to improve and expand. &pound;100,000 has been made available to the Reading area and &pound;100,000 has been made available to the west Berkshire area in 2005 to take forward this work.</p>
	<p pid="a.713W.2/18">Reading borough council also participates in the south east community cohesion learning network which is managed by the Government Office for the south east. The network is made up of representatives from 16 south east community cohesion priority areas including local authority officers, the police, and other regional organisations with an interest in community cohesion. The network facilitates the sharing of information, learning and good practice on community cohesion issues in the region.</p>
	<p pid="a.713W.2/19">This year, 2005, is the year of the volunteer which is being delivered by the Home Office in partnership with Community Service Volunteers and Volunteering England. This will include a whole range of events in local communities across the country that aim to celebrate the contribution which volunteers make to the quality of people's lives, and encourage more people to volunteer. We are particularly keen to encourage young people, black and minority ethnic groups, those with no qualifications and disabled people to get involved.

	<p pid="a.716W.2/1">The Government has put in place policies in the areas of crime reduction, antisocial behaviour, policing and active communities that are yielding considerable benefits for the Wokingham constituency, as well as for all parts of the UK.</p>

	<p pid="a.719W.11/1">The Home Office-led review looked at the experience of a range of other countries, all of which regard intercept product as a valuable contribution to evidence used in their courts. However, the review found that there was no evidence that other countries do better than the UK in securing the convictions of terrorists or serious criminals through the use of intercept as evidence.</p>
	<p pid="a.719W.11/2">The review found that the United Kingdom could not simply transplant the evidential regimes of other countries because our legal system is very different, being both adversarial and subject to ECHR considerations. No other country examined had a statutory basis for intelligence agencies to assist law enforcement agencies as is the case in the United Kingdom. The review underlined the importance and value of the unparalleled co-operation between the United Kingdom's intelligence and law enforcement agencies but noted that this would be at risk, in a way that did not apply to the same extent to other jurisdictions, if there was a possibility that sensitive capabilities and techniques might be exposed.</p>

	<p pid="a.724W.2/1">Although the Home Secretary decides in principle whether compensation should be paid, the assessment of the amount of compensation is undertaken by an Assessor, appointed by the Home Secretary under section 133(4) of the 1988 Act, who is experienced in the assessment of damages. The current Assessor is Lord Brennan QC. Each case is considered on the basis of the circumstances relating to that individual claimant.</p>
	<p pid="a.724W.2/2">The assessment is made on the basis of written submissions setting out the relevant facts. When the claimant or the claimant's representative is informed that a payment will be made, they are invited to submit to the Claims Assessment Team, in the Office for Criminal Justice Reform, any information or representations which they would like the Assessor to take into account when considering the amount of compensation to be paid. The Claims Assessment Team prepares a draft memorandum based on this material.</p>
	<p pid="a.724W.2/3">The draft memorandum will be sent to the claimant, or the claimant's representative, for their comments. Factual inaccuracies in the draft memorandum will be corrected and a copy of any comments made by the claimant will be sent to the Assessor with the memorandum. The Assessor may, through the Claims Assessment Team, seek further information or clarification arising from the material placed before him. For example, he may ask them to instruct independent accountants to advise him as to the reasonableness of certain pecuniary loss claims.</p>
	<p pid="a.724W.2/4">In reaching his assessment, the Assessor will apply principles analogous to those governing the assessment of damages for civil wrongs. The assessment will take account of pecuniary and non-pecuniary loss arising from the wrongful charge or conviction and loss of liberty that results from it. The Assessor will take into account any reasonable expenses, legal or otherwise, incurred by the claimant in reversing the conviction or pursuing the claim for compensation.</p>

To this end, convicted prisoners are allowed to send one letter a week and unconvicted prisoners two at public expense by 2nd class post.

For Foreign National prisoners, Governors have the discretion to provide a free 5-minute call provided that the prisoner in question has not received a domestic visit in the preceding month. Governors also have the discretion to provide prisoners with access to an official telephone or make a call on their behalf to a close relative or partner within the first 24 hours of their arrival into prison. The only other occasion where prisoners are provided with calls at official expense is in urgent domestic circumstances involving a close relative or partner.</p>

	<p pid="a.743W.3/1">The Government have put in place policies in the areas of crime reduction, antisocial behaviour, policing and active communities that are yielding considerable benefits for the Worcester constituency, as well as for all parts of the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.743W.3/2">For example, between March 1997 and March 2004, the number of police officers in the West Mercia Police Force increased by 325 from 2,040 to 2,365. The Government's introduction of Community Support Officers (CSOs) in 2002 has put 67 CSOs on West Mercia streets to tackle crime and antisocial behaviour. Between 1997 and 2003&ndash;04, West Mercia has seen a reduction in recorded domestic burglary crimes of 10 per cent. and in recorded vehicle crimes of 36 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="a.743W.3/3">West Mercia Police Force is receiving &pound;111.8 million in general grants for 2005&ndash;06, an increase of 3.75 per cent. (&pound;4.1 million) over this year. West Mercia benefits from the decision to provide a funding floor of 3.75 per cent. If the funding formula had been strictly applied, the Force would have received &pound;2.5 million less. General grants funding to West Mercia has increased by 27 per cent. between 1997&ndash;98 and 2005&ndash;06. In addition to general grants, West Mercia will also receive around &pound;10 million in specific grants funding for targeted initiatives in 2005&ndash;06. The distribution of resources locally is a matter for the Police Authority and the Chief Constable.</p>
	<p pid="a.743W.3/4">As crime prevention requires action across communities, every area has had a local Crime and Disorder Reduction Partnership (CDRP) since 1998 which brings together the police, health services, drugs agencies and council and community representatives to decide how to prevent and deter crime and antisocial behaviour.</p>
	<p pid="a.743W.3/5">The Crime Reduction Programme (CRP) was a pioneering Government intervention programme which ran for three years from April 1999 in England and Wales and took an evidence-based approach to crime reduction. Grants of over &pound;340 million were allocated to over 1,470 projects, including CCTV, under 20 initiatives that formed part of the programme. One CCTV project in the Worcester CDRP area received a total of &pound;643,832 from the CRP.</p>
	<p pid="a.743W.3/6">Since 2001, successive initiatives have provided direct funding to each of the 376 Crime and Disorder Reduction Partnerships in England and Wales. These initiatives include Communities Against Drugs, the Safer Communities Initiative, the Small Retailers in Deprived Areas scheme and the Building Safer Communities Fund. Since 2001, a total of &pound;446,583 has been allocated to the Worcester CDRP under these initiatives. A further &pound;2.03 million has been provided over the two years 2003&ndash;04 and 2004&ndash;05 to the Home Office Regional Director in the West Midlands for CDRP capacity building across the region.</p>
	<p pid="a.743W.3/7">It is estimated that out of a million active offenders, 100,000 have three or more convictions and are responsible for half of all crime. There is a Prolific and other Priority Offenders (PPO) scheme in Worcester set up to target those offenders who cause a disproportionate amount of crime, disorder and antisocial behaviour in the community.</p>
	<p pid="a.743W.3/8">The Government's Crime Reduction Website provides further information on the work being done to reduce crime across the country, including information about action and results in local areas. It is available at <a href="http://www.crimereduction.gov.uk">http://www.crimereduction.gov.uk</a>.</p>
	<p pid="a.743W.3/9">New legislation has given local agencies a raft of powers, from antisocial behaviour orders to local dispersal orders and crack house closure powers, to work with local people to tackle antisocial behaviour and nuisance. In Worcester a total of 28 antisocial behaviour orders have been issued as of <phrase class="date" code="2005-02-09">9 February 2005</phrase>. Local contacts for tackling antisocial behaviour can be found on <a href="http://www.together.gov.uk/authority.asp">http://www.together.gov.uk/authority.asp</a>.</p>
	<p pid="a.743W.3/10">Tackling Drug Misuse is a priority of this Government and its policy is set out in the 10-year National Drug Strategy launched in 1998 and updated in December 2002. (A copy of the Updated Drug Strategy 2002 is held in the Library.) Under this, the Government have invested substantially in measures to reduce the harms caused by illegal drugs, focusing on the four strands of:</p>
	<p pid="a.743W.3/11" class="indent">reducing the supply of illegal drugs;</p>
	<p pid="a.743W.3/12" class="indent">preventing young people from becoming problematic drug users;</p>
	<p pid="a.743W.3/13" class="indent">providing effective treatment to all who need it; and</p>
	<p pid="a.743W.3/14" class="indent">reducing drug-related crime.</p>
	<p pid="a.743W.3/15">Direct annual funding nationally to tackle drug misuse amounted to &pound;1,244 million in 2003&ndash;04, rising to &pound;1,344 million in 2004&ndash;05. Worcestershire has seen a significant increase in direct funding for tackling drugs, in particular for drug treatment services and the throughcare and aftercare elements of the Drugs Intervention Programme. In 2003&ndash;04 the allocation for Worcestershire Drug Action Team amounted to &pound;2.5 million, rising to &pound;1.5 million in 2004&ndash;05. Details of action taken to tackle drugs in the Worcester constituency can be obtained from the Worcestershire Drugs Action Team, for contact details see <a href="http://www.drugs.gov.uk/Links/DrugActionTeams">http://www.drugs.gov.uk/Links/DrugActionTeams</a>.</p>
	<p pid="a.743W.3/16">The Government are working to ensure that citizens, communities and the voluntary sector are more fully engaged in tackling social problems, and there is more equality of opportunity and respect for people of all races and religions. Active community participation in England has increased by 1.5 million people between 2001 and 2003. Charities have been supported more effectively, and &pound;125 million is being invested across the country through the 'futurebuilders' fund in voluntary and community organisations that help provide valuable public services. Advice on ways to engage local people in helping their communities is available on the Active Citizenship Centre website <a href="http://www.active-citizen.org.uk">http://www.active-citizen.org.uk</a>.</p>
	<p pid="a.743W.3/17">This year, 2005, is the year of the volunteer which is being delivered by the Home Office in partnership with Community Service Volunteers and Volunteering England. This will include a whole range of events in local communities across the country that aim to celebrate the contribution which volunteers make to the quality of people's lives, and encourage more people to volunteer. We are particularly keen to encourage young people, black and minority ethnic groups, those with no qualifications and disabled people to get involved. More details can be found at <a href="http://www.yearofthevolunteer.org">www.yearofthevolunteer.org</a> .</p>
	<p pid="a.743W.3/18">Detailed information on the impact of Home Office policies across the full range of responsibilities is set out in the Home Office Annual Report and in the Strategic Plan for 2004&ndash;08, available on the Home Office website at <a href="http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk">http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk</a>.</p>
