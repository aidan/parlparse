	<p pid="b.2505W.3/2">In the event of an avian influenza outbreak, we would control the disease by culling all birds on any infected premises and dangerous contacts. Depending on veterinary risk assessment advice, additional strategies could include a cull of flocks in the immediate area to prevent the spread of disease. These arrangements are described in Defra's published Animal Disease Contingency Plan.</p>

	<p pid="b.2506W.0/2">We have recently published on the Defra website a report on Defra-funded research conducted by the Sea Mammal Research Unit (SMRU) on by-catch observations and mitigation work in the UK bass pair trawl fishery. A copy of this report will also be placed in the Library of the House. Since the introduction of the 12 mile pair trawl prohibition, no pair trawl activity has taken place within-12 miles. As the SMRU report outlines, common dolphin by-catch in this fishery has reduced from 429 animals in the 2003&ndash;04 season to 139 in the 2004&ndash;05 season.</p>
	<p pid="b.2506W.0/3">In addition, we have in place observer schemes to monitor by-catch in other fisheries which may be responsible for by-catch both inside and outside 12 miles. The first report from this work also being conducted on our behalf by SMRU is due in spring 2006.</p>
	<p pid="b.2506W.0/4">Strandings data is obtained under the Defra-funded Cetacean and Turtle Strandings Scheme, carried out by the Natural History Museum in partnership with the Institute of Zoology and Scottish Agricultural College. Cetacean strandings have shown a steep decline this year in the area covered by the 12 mile pair trawl prohibition. Between <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-01">1 January</phrase> and <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-18">18 July 2005</phrase>, there were 68 common dolphin strandings in Cornwall, Devon and Dorset compared with 178 for the same period in 2004.</p>

	<p pid="b.2512W.12/1">The EU Biofuels Directive allows member states to set their own indicative targets for biofuel sales. Starting from a low base, total UK sales in 2005 were equivalent to 0.24 per cent. of overall road fuel sales, representing a six fold increase on 2004. Some other member states with an established biofuels production industry were able to meet higher targets, but many are in a similar position to the UK.</p>

	<p pid="b.2512W.12/3">The level of obligation has been set at 5 per cent. for 2010 because this is currently the maximum permitted blend of biofuel allowed under EU fuel quality standards for petrol and diesel. We will look to move beyond 5 per cent. as soon as these standards allow.</p>

	<p pid="b.2513W.9/1">Under the existing Eurocontrol Multilateral Agreement for Route Charges, the United Kingdom has exempted all military flights flown in UK airspace. The current draft text of the Single European Sky (SES) Implementing Regulation on air navigation charges reflects the existing Eurocontrol policy and UK intends that this exemption will remain.

Work is under way to identify a cost neutral solution for military aviation based on the contribution made to UK air navigation services by military air traffic control.</p>

At the launch of the plan at the World Economic Forum in Davos in January, the Chancellor called for G8 countries to designate tuberculosis a top priority at the St. Petersburg summit in July, and to pledge new funding to implement the Global Plan.

	<p pid="b.2519W.5/1">There was no specific agreement or commitment at the G8 Finance Ministers' meeting in Moscow in February on funding for the Global Plan to Stop Tuberculosis for 2006&ndash;15, which sets out a strategy to treat 50 million people and prevent 14 million deaths over the next 10 years. The UK fully supports the plan and at its launch plan at the World Economic Forum in Davos in January, the Chancellor called for G8 countries to designate tuberculosis a top priority at the St. Petersburg summit in July, and to pledge new funding to implement the Global Plan. At Davos, the Chancellor also announced &pound;41.7 million of funding for India's Revised National Tuberculosis Control Programme.</p>
	<p pid="b.2519W.5/2">Throughout the preparations for the G8 meeting the UK will continue to encourage G8 partners fully to fund tuberculosis control as part of the comprehensive package of measures agreed at the Gleneagles summit in July 2005. In addition, the UK will push for long-term adequate financing to the Global Fund to fight AIDS, TB and malaria (GFATM), as well as the development of innovative financing mechanisms to scale up the resources available for development. Last year the UK doubled its funding to the GFATM, and will provide &pound;100 million in both 2006 and 2007.</p>

	<p pid="b.2522W.6/1">Depending on their personal circumstances, carers have access to the full range of social security benefits. Those who provide regular and substantial care of at least 35 hours a week for a severely disabled person receiving attendance allowance or the equivalent rates of the disability living allowance care component can be entitled to a carer's allowance and if on a low income, to the carer premium in the income-related benefits or the carer's additional amount in pension credit.</p>
	<p pid="b.2522W.6/2">Information and advice about entitlement to carer's allowance and other benefits are available from a range of outlets including social security offices, Jobcentre Plus offices, DWP and other helplines, DWP and other internet sites, local authorities, Citizens Advice and welfare benefit offices, public libraries, health clinics, doctors' surgeries and health visitors. Officials from the Department's disability and carers service also discuss carer's allowance at outreach events throughout Great Britain.</p>
	<p pid="b.2522W.6/3">This Government has recognised the contribution and concerns of carers through the National Carers' Strategy published in 1999. We have increased the funding available to support carers from &pound;20 million in 1999 to &pound;185 million in 2005&ndash;06, providing an extra &pound;635 million for carers. We have announced our intention to continue the funding at &pound;185 million a year until at least 2007&ndash;08. This means that, by 2008, we will have invested just over a billion pounds in support for carers.</p>
	<p pid="b.2522W.6/4">Local authorities should be taking the needs of carers into account when planning and commissioning all services. Their role is crucial in promoting independence in individuals wishing to remain in the community both as part of the care team and as individuals in their own right.</p>

Over the last months it became increasingly clear that the PA were unable to do this. While we are unable to comment on the specific nature of any intelligence, there were a number of developments which caused concern.</p>
	<p pid="b.2532W.5/2">In 2005, we received two independent reports which noted that security for the monitors was not adequate. Towards the end of 2005 the risk to our monitors increased: the prison became overcrowded; there were riots inside and outside the prison; there were kidnaps of British nationals in Gaza and in December the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine kidnapped two teachers demanding the release of Ahmed Sa'adat, one of the prisoners. On <phrase class="date" code="2005-12-15">15 December 2005</phrase>, we informed the PA that unless the safety of our monitors could be improved we would have to withdraw. We proceeded to raise this issue frequently with the PA leading to the letter being delivered to President Abbas on <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-08">8 March</phrase>.</p>

For example, we promote the OECD guidelines for Multinational Enterprises which reflect the high expectations of business and set out clear standards for their performance including on social and environmental issues. We have written to FTSE 100 companies to raise awareness of the Guidelines.</p>
	<p pid="b.2535W.9/3">We also support the UN Global Compact, an agreement between the UN and business to uphold and promulgate a set often principles covering human rights, labour rights, environmental protection and combating corruption.</p>

	<p pid="b.2536W.2/1">DTI continues to coordinate across Government to work closely with business to create the right framework to encourage companies to make socially responsible practice an integral part of their business operations, to the benefit of both society and business. We have worked to establish the CSR Government website and the CSR Academy which provides companies with skills to take forward CSR, and have funded the Corporate Responsibility Index run by Business in the Community to encourage companies to adopt CSR and benchmark themselves against other companies.</p>

The NHS Cancer plan set out maximum waiting time targets for cancer treatment which may include radiotherapy where this is given as a first definitive treatment.

A national programme of cancer peer review is currently under way. This process seeks to accelerate the pace of improvement in the quality of cancer services across the whole system of patient care. All 34 cancer networks in England are due to have been peer reviewed by the end of November 2006.</p>
	<p pid="b.2553W.3/4">Following each visit, a local peer review report is produced.

The Healthcare Commission is responsible for assessing progress of healthcare organisations towards achieving developmental standards, and they will be consulting on its proposals for assessing these standards shortly. However, the results of the cancer peer review will be shared with the Healthcare Commission to support them in this work.</p>

	<p pid="b.2555W.8/1">The new contracts are not in themselves expected to have a significant effect on the number of national health service dentists. The current indications from the NHS are that the great majority of NHS dentists will agree new contracts.</p>
	<p pid="b.2555W.8/2">From April 2006, primary care trusts (PCTs) will have devolved responsibility and ring-fenced budgets for commissioning primary dental services. This means that if a dentist chooses not to take up the new contract, the resources stay with the PCT to be re-invested in local dental services.</p>

	<p pid="b.2556W.0/15">1.Personal dental service (PDS) schemes have varying registration periods. To ensure comparability with corresponding general dental service (GDS) data, PDS registrations are estimated using proxy registrations, namely the number of patients seen by PDS practices in the past 15 months. There will be a break in the registrations series at the point at which PDS schemes were introduced as the proxy registrations build up. Falls in registration rates will be particularly pronounced in the financial year 2004&ndash;05, when the majority of PDS schemes were introduced.</p>
	<p pid="b.2556W.0/16">2.Data for 2003 and earlier do not include those PDS schemes that do not have any registrations, for example, dental access centres, and is therefore not directly comparable with 2004 and 2005 data.</p>

	<p pid="b.2556W.6/3">The Department has indicated to the BDA that we regard the new contracts as offering a good deal for dentists. They will have a guaranteed annual contract value based on their current national health service earnings, which give an average net income of &pound;80,000 per year for a committed NHS dentist, for at least five per cent, fewer (weighted) courses of treatment compared with the current general dental services system. The Department has expressed concern that the BDA appears to be overlooking the evidence of the personal dental services pilots, which have shown that abolishing the fee-per-item remuneration system, also supports dentists in carrying out simple courses of treatment, with more time available for preventative work.</p>

	<p pid="b.2563W.3/1" class="holdinganswer">holding answer <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-16">16 March 2006</phrase></p>
	<p pid="b.2563W.3/2">The NHS Prostate Cancer Programme confirmed the NHS Plan commitment to increase the Department's funding for directly commissioned prostate cancer to &pound;4.2 million by 2003&ndash;04. The Department's expenditure on directly commissioned prostate cancer research was &pound;4.3 million in 2003&ndash;04, and &pound;4.4 million in 2004&ndash;05. Expenditure in future years will depend on the quality of research proposals received.</p>
	<p pid="b.2563W.3/3">The Government are committed to introducing a national population screening programme for prostate cancer if and when screening and treatment techniques are sufficiently well developed for such a programme to be introduced.</p>
	<p pid="b.2563W.3/4">The Department is supporting the development of screening technology for prostate cancer by having a comprehensive research strategy into all aspects of prostate cancer. We are jointly with other National Cancer Research Institute (NCRI) members funding two NCRI prostate cancer research collaboratives and the Department is funding half of the total &pound;7.4 million cost.</p>
	<p pid="b.2563W.3/5">The research undertaken by the collaboratives covers all aspects of prostate cancer and has already generated the groundbreaking discovery of the overactive E2F3 gene in prostate cancer tumours. This discovery provides the potential not only to identify those at risk of developing the disease, but for the first time allows theprediction of how aggressive the cancer will be. Research is under way to turn this into a diagnostic test so that we can identify those patients whose prostate cancers are aggressive and urgently need treatment.</p>
	<p pid="b.2563W.3/6">It is important to note that in order for a screening technology to contribute to saving lives it is essential for there to be effective treatments for the disease detected. That is why the Department is funding a &pound;20 million trial of treatments for prostate specific antigen (PSA) screen-detected early prostate cancer (the ProtecT trial).</p>
	<p pid="b.2563W.3/7">Phase one of the trial showed that such a trial was feasible in the United Kingdom and that the majority of men recruited agreed to take part in a three-arm trial, comparing active monitoring, surgery or radiotherapy as treatment options. The primary end-point for phase two is survival to 10 years, with secondary end-points including disease progression, morbidity, quality of life impact, sensitivity/specificity of diagnostic tests and associated basic science research.</p>
	<p pid="b.2563W.3/8">Since 2004, the ProtecT trial has been extended to evaluate the impact of screening using the PSA test by establishing a control arm to the study. Half of the men in the control study will be PSA tested and the other half not. All men in the study will be flagged with the national health service central registry and cancer registries to ensure notification of death and cancer.</p>
	<p pid="b.2563W.3/9">On behalf of the prostate cancer advisory group, discussions are ongoing with the NCRI and the prostate cancer research collaboratives with a view to hosting in the UK a global summit on prostate cancer testing.</p>

Attacks on schools from anti-Government elements are increasing, but it is not possible attribute all of these to the Taliban. In 2006 to date, at least 114 schools have been destroyed, and 18 teachers, 24 students, and six school officials killed. This is a large increase compared to previous years. In 2002 the total number of incidents recorded targeting schools was 9, in 2003 and 2004 it was around 45 per year, and in 2005 it was 99.</p>

	<p pid="b.2566W.2/1">DFID has not provided direct assistance to the education sector in Afghanistan, with the exception of very limited support (&pound;47,000) for primary education of refugees in 2001&ndash;02. However, through ourfunding to the Afghanistan Reconstruction Trust Fund (ARTF), DFID supports the Government of Afghanistan's budget, which finances significant expenditure in the education sector. Since 2002&ndash;03 the operating budget for education as a whole has risen by 250 per cent.. Overall civil service numbers have remained stable, but there has been a major increase in the number of teachers, who constitute one of the largest portions of the civil service. DFID's contribution to the ARTF, to which we are the biggest donor, has thus played a big part in increasing the number of children in school since 2002.</p>
	<p pid="b.2566W.2/2">Support to development projects in the education sector was budgeted to rise by 60 per cent. in 2005&ndash;06. Other donors have taken the lead in providing direct support to the education sector, including the World Bank, the United States Agency for International Development, Denmark, and United Nations Agencies. The UK is therefore also supporting the education sector in Afghanistan through its contributions to multilateral agencies. Through donor support to the education sector, over a thousand schools have been built or rehabilitated since 2001, which has enabled the enrolment of 5.6 million children, 37 per cent. of them girls.</p>

	<p pid="b.2566W.5/1">It is important that post tsunami reconstruction is properly co-ordinated and meets the requirements of the Governments and those in most need. We have been working closely with the affected country Governments and other donors and agencies to ensure that necessary needs are met.</p>
	<p pid="b.2566W.5/2">DFID allocated &pound;65 million to meet longer-term reconstruction needs, the bulk of which has been committed to Indonesia.</p>
	<p pid="b.2566W.5/3">Reconstruction in Indonesia is gathering momentum and the detailed preparation and community planning processes carried out throughout last year have laid a good foundation for further progress this year, particularly in the area of reconstruction of infrastructure, including housing. DFID is working through the Multi Donor Fund to support the rebuilding of infrastructure, which continues to remain the top priority of donors amongst fears of escalating cost of building materials, which mean that earlier estimates on numbers of houses to be built by donors and non-governmental organisations (NGO)s are being revised down. DFID will work with the Government of Indonesia and other donors through the fund to ensure that the continuing needs of Acehnese are met despite these challenges. The restoration of livelihoods, including cash for work, training and micro-finance schemes is also a high priority for this year. DFID is supporting this area through the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), which is working with a number of local and international NGOs.</p>
	<p pid="b.2566W.5/4">There were no shortages of resources for reconstruction in Sri Lanka. Following its substantial support for the relief effort, DFID's focus in the reconstruction phase for Sri Lanka has been to build capacity in country to manage the longer term recovery effort and &pound;2.8 million has been committed towards this, in addition to the &pound;45 million debt relief which is being provided by the UK over the next 10 years.</p>
	<p pid="b.2566W.5/5">By the end of 2005 in Sri Lanka, over 53,000 transitional homes had been built and fewer than 150 families remained in tented accommodation. In addition to houses built by NGOs, a 'home owner' driven approach allows people to take ownership of rebuilding their homes and rebuilding their lives&mdash;in effect helping them to help themselves.</p>
	<p pid="b.2566W.5/6">Progress is being made with the fishing industry, which is of key importance to the livelihoods of many affected families. 70 per cent. of people whose main source of income is from fishing have now regained some source of income and the Sri Lankan Government expect the fishing industry to have recovered by the end of 2006.</p>
	<p pid="b.2566W.5/7">Recovery in India is proceeding and our support to long-term reconstruction, through the UN Country Team, followed a multi agency (the UN, the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank) assessment of reconstruction needs in affected areas. DFID has contributed &pound;3 million for technical assistance to help ensure effective, transparent and equitable programming of tsunami reconstruction funds.</p>
	<p pid="b.2566W.5/8">The Government of the Maldives have set up a Tsunami Relief and Rehabilitation Fund (TRRF) to receive resources from local and international sources and to channel these for relief and reconstruction. The international community has provided significant financial and technical support through the World Bank and EU, to the Maldives to help the reconstruction effort.</p>
	<p pid="b.2566W.5/9">The Government are using their tsunami reconstruction program to implement their long-term development strategy of resettling and concentrating thepopulation in a few 'focus' islands. This includes improving services in heath and education and protecting them from rising sea levels.</p>

	<p pid="b.2568W.0/1">The majority of DFID assistance in Burma is implemented through UN agencies and international non-governmental organisations. However, as part of our humanitarian support in response to the HIV and AIDS epidemic in Burma, a small amount of funding (less than 7 per cent. of our total expenditure on HIV and AIDS) is used for service delivery through Burmese Government technical teams. These carry out specific and crucial work, for example the blood safety testing, national and local surveillance of HIV prevalence, and the township STD (Sexually Transmitted Disease) teams under the National AIDS Programme. Decisions on funding are taken after careful analysis of the team and its activities. Funds are managed by the UN, which is directly responsible for all procurement and are subject to audit. They do not pass through the Burmese Government budget.</p>

	<p pid="b.2569W.0/1">In December 2004, my right hon. Friend, the Secretary of State for International Development, proposed a package of reforms to the international humanitarian system to improve the quality, timeliness, and co-ordination of response to emergencies. These are now being led by the United Nations. Two of the reforms are strengthening the role, remit, and authority of the UN Humanitarian Co-ordinator at country level, and development of pooled donor funds behind the Humanitarian Co-ordinator to disburse on the most urgent unmet needs.</p>
	<p pid="b.2569W.0/2">A third key reform is the establishment of a new Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) to enable UN humanitarian agencies to respond quickly to sudden crises without having to wait for donor funds to arrive first, and to ensure essential humanitarian activities take place in ongoing under-funded, or forgotten&quot; crises.</p>
	<p pid="b.2569W.0/3">During 2005, DFID Ministers and senior officials held a range of discussions about the role of the UN in co-ordination of disaster relief with international partners, including European Union member states, the G8 countries, and with the United Nations, (particularly the Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs, Jan Egeland, as Head of the Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs), and heads of key agencies including UNICEF, the United Nations High Commissioner of Refugees (UNHCR), and the World Food Programme (WFP). In addition, the matter was discussed at the meeting of the UN Economic and Social Council in July 2005, and at the Millennium Review Summit in September 2005.</p>

	<p pid="b.2569W.3/1">Fairtrade can make a real contribution towards helping poor people to trade their way out of poverty. There are now over 800 certified Fairtrade product lines and sales are growing. In 2004, the estimated UK retail sales of Fairtrade products was &pound;140 million, about a 50 per cent. increase on 2003. This makes the UK the largest market for Fairtrade in Europe.</p>
	<p pid="b.2569W.3/2">By building more equitable trading partnerships between North and South, by securing the rights for, and offering better prices to, disadvantaged southern producers, Fairtrade is helping poor producers capture more of the gains from trade, which is a key objective of the Department for International Development. There are over 400 producer groups involved in Fairtrade certified production across the developing world, detailed evaluation of the impacts of this would be difficult but it is estimated that the benefits of Fairtrade reach around five million people in developing countries.</p>
	<p pid="b.2569W.3/3">The UK Government are a strong supporter of Fairtrade products. Many Government Departments, including DFID, use Fairtrade tea and coffee. And DFID supports initiatives to help more producers benefit from Fairtrade certification and develop new products.

	<p pid="b.2570W.2/1">The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, TBand Malaria was set up in January 2002, to date, US$8.5 billion has been pledged to the Global Fund through to 2008. Of this, the Fund has approved US$4.9 billion to over 350 grants in 131 countries. As of <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-27">27 January 2006</phrase>, US $2 billion has been disbursed to public and private recipients.</p>
	<p pid="b.2570W.2/2">The Global Fund describes its results on its website <a href="http://www.theglobalfund.org">www.theglobalfund.org</a> In addition each month it publishes a monthly report. Expected outcomes after five years of grants include:</p>
	<p pid="b.2570W.2/3" class="indent">More than 1.8 million people on antiretrovirals</p>
	<p pid="b.2570W.2/4" class="indent">Over one million orphans supported;</p>
	<p pid="b.2570W.2/5" class="indent">Five million additional TB cases treated;</p>
	<p pid="b.2570W.2/6" class="indent">109 million bed nets financed to protect families from malaria.</p>
	<p pid="b.2570W.2/7">The January 2006 report specifically focuses on a few countries: in Bangladesh over 5,000 people have been trained to deliver youth education for the prevention of HIV and AIDS, and in Nicaragua 82,000 insecticide-treated bed nets have been distributed across 36 municipalities.</p>
	<p pid="b.2570W.2/8">To ensure that grant funding continues to go where it is being managed and spent effectively, only grants with satisfactory performance measured against agreed targets continue to receive funding for the remaining years of the grant. To date, the Global Fund Board has approved 107 requests for phase 2 funding worth US $1.1 billion.</p>
	<p pid="b.2570W.2/9">An effective fund means working with international and national development partners to combat AIDS, TB and malaria. There have been a number of initiatives in the last year to move this forward. Examples include the Global Task Team on Improving AIDS Co-ordination Among Multilateral Institutions and International Donors, the Replenishment Conferences and the Best Practise Principles for Global Health Partnerships presented at the High Level Forum for Health. As a result of these initiatives we are seeing the Global Fund further increase its effectiveness.</p>
	<p pid="b.2570W.2/10">The UK uses its position on the Board to work with the Fund and others to ensure the Global Fund is operating effectively.</p>

	<p pid="b.2571W.5/1">DFID's Agriculture Policy Paper, 'Growth and poverty reduction: the role of agriculture', makes no reference to genetic use restriction technologies (GURTs). DFID's view, expressed in this paper, is that a wide range of agricultural technologies will be needed to tackle poverty and hunger, from traditional knowledge to sophisticated plant breeding. DFID puts priority on improving poor farmers' access to technology, to enable them to make their own choices matched to need.</p>
	<p pid="b.2571W.5/2">This approach was informed by, amongst other sources, a background review paper, Technology and its contribution to pro-poor agricultural development', which has been in the public domain since mid 2004 and can be found at <a href="http://dfid-agriculture-consultation.nri.org">http://dfid-agriculture-consultation. nri.org</a>. I have arranged for copies of the document entitled 'Technology and it's contribution to Pro-Poor Agricultural Development' be placed in the Libraries of the House.</p>
	<p pid="b.2571W.5/3">DFID's Agriculture policy paper does, however, recognise that there are both potential benefits and risks associated with gene technologies and GM crops, and argues that developing countries should be able to make their own informed choices. To this end, DFID has worked with the Department for the Environment and Rural Affairs (DEFRA), other government departments and the international community to establish the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety, under the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD).</p>
	<p pid="b.2571W.5/4">As a party to the CBD, the UK Government agreed in 2000 to take a precautionary approach to the use of GURTs while research into the possible impacts of these technologies was carried out. It is expected that at the CBD meeting on 19&ndash;<phrase class="date" code="2006-03-31">31 March</phrase> this year, signatories to the convention will consider emerging research on the impacts of GURTs, including a progress report by the Convention's scientific sub-group. The UK Government have considered this research and do not propose to change their position on a precautionary approach to the use of GURTs. Parties to the CBD will also address capacity building for decision making in developing countries.</p>

	<p pid="b.2573W.2/1">Governance is central to DFID's engagement in Latin America. Our focus on poverty and exclusion means that we are committed to embedding principles of transparency, accountability, representation and democratic development in Latin America. DFID promotes good governance through various channels: directly with Latin American Governments, through the International Finance Institutions, via support to Civil Society organisations and through global initiatives.</p>
	<p pid="b.2573W.2/2">During 2005&ndash;06, DFID supported governance initiatives through its Latin America regional programmes and through bilateral programmes in Nicaragua, Brazil and Bolivia. A new programme was established with the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) and the World Bank (WB) to take forward work on governance in Latin America&mdash;the Accountable and Responsive Public Sector Management and Political Systems Programme (&pound;7.5 million over four years). This programme aims to enhance the impact of the IDB and WB on the ability of poor people to shape, participate in and benefit from more accountable and responsive public sectors and political systems. The programme will support governance reform agendas in the World Bank and IDB. DFID supports the work of civil society on governance and other areas through Partnership Programme Agreements with six international NGOs and through the Civil Society Challenge Fund. We work with the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) and the Ministry of Defence (MOD) on the Global Conflict Prevention Pool for Latin America.</p>
	<p pid="b.2573W.2/3">Recent work supported by DFID on governance in Latin America includes:</p>
	<p pid="b.2573W.2/4">Financial Accountability and Transparency work in Nicaragua with the National Comptroller's Office and the audit of municipal accounts to improve transparency and citizen monitoring. In Brazil, our work has promoted Public Audit as a tool of citizen participation. In Central America, we are working with other donors on a Programme of Fiscal Reform. In Peru, we contribute to implementing greater transparency in respect of extractive industries resulting from the signing in 2005 of the EITI (Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative) Agreement by Peru.</p>
	<p pid="b.2573W.2/5">Strengthening political institutions and processes has included support to the Central America Political Parties Initiative; strengthening the ability of citizens to voice their demands to Government through work with civil society groups in a number of countries; and work with the EC seeking to reinforce law and democracy in Colombia. With the IDB and WB, we contribute to the development and use of analytical tools that will improve understanding of the political context and incentive structures within countries, including through Governance Reviews in the Andes Region. Work on the politics of the budget process in Latin America is ongoing.</p>
	<p pid="b.2573W.2/6">Conflict and Human Rights work has included Police Human Rights Training in Venezuela and support to a national centre in Peru to professionalise the management and reduction of conflict.</p>
	<p pid="b.2573W.2/7">Strengthening demand for good governance through voice and accountability, includes support to civil society organisations to improve oversight of Highly Indebted Poor Countries funds and work in the Andean Region for poor and excluded people to get state identity cards (Right to Identity). An identity card allows a person to be officially recognised by the state and enables then to vote and access education and health services.</p>

	<p pid="b.2575W.3/1">DFID funded the Commonwealth Local Government Good Practice Scheme, launched in 1998, which supported 30 technical co-operation projects between local authority partners in Commonwealth countries. In Malawi, these were Crawley borough council with Lilongwe, South Staffordshire borough council with Zomba, and East Staffordshire county council with Blantyre city council. An evaluation of the scheme in 2000 recommended that it focus on selected countries, of which Malawi is not one, although some of the links are still active, such as that between East Staffordshire and Blantyre. In addition, DFID funds, through a Strategic Grant Agreement, the secretariat of the UK Local Government Alliance for International Development, which encourages UK local authorities to engage more closely with international development issues, including through technical cooperation links with local authorities in developing countries.</p>
	<p pid="b.2575W.3/2">The Scottish Executive and Malawi signed a Co-operation Agreement in November 2005 which encourages Scottish organisations and individuals to make links with organisations in Malawi. This policy is supported by the Scottish Executive's International Development Fund. Scottish non-governmental organisations (NGO)s with a Malawian partner are eligible to bid for funds assuming they meet basic criteria in line with the Co-operation Agreement. There are also health links between several UK national health service trusts and tertiary and training health institutions in Malawi.</p>
	<p pid="b.2575W.3/3">While civic and town twinning are not priorities for DFID's bilateral programme with Malawi, the British High Commission supports and facilitates existing links between towns and churches through representation at ceremonies to donate equipment and assisting with inquiries from institutions in the UK or Malawi wishing to set-up a twinning arrangement. DFID advises UK institutions seeking to develop links with Malawian institutions to collaborate with other development partners and to align with Malawi's own strategies, priorities and funding mechanisms.</p>

	<p pid="b.2576W.0/1">The information is as follows.</p>
	<p pid="b.2576W.0/2" class="italic">Support for reconstruction following tsunami</p>
	<p pid="b.2576W.0/3">Following the tsunami the UK provided emergency humanitarian assistance directly to the Maldives totalling &pound;1.6 million and included funding to a number of UN agencies (the United Nations Environment Programme, the United Nations Development Programme, the World Health Organisation and UNICEF). The activities funded included: emergency waste management; restoration of livelihoods; disaster preparedness; water and sanitation.</p>
	<p pid="b.2576W.0/4">DFID provides support to the Maldives through the European Commission, the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank.</p>
	<p pid="b.2576W.0/5">The Government of the Maldives has set up a Tsunami Relief and Rehabilitation Fund (TRRF) to receive resources from local and international sources and to channel these for relief and reconstruction. The Asian Development Bank and the World Bank have helped the Government to ensure that procedures used in the TRRF are compatible with international standards. The Government of the Maldives are using the reconstruction programme to implement their long-term development strategy of resettling and concentrating the population in a few focus islands. This includes improving services in health and education and protecting them from rising sea levels.</p>
	<p pid="b.2576W.0/6">Under its 2005&ndash;06 tsunami indicative programme, the European Commission (EC) pledged &euro;16 million to the Maldives. The UK share of the EC assistance is 18 per cent. Of the &euro;16 million, &euro;2 million will be channelled to a United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) led programme to restart livelihoods and repair housing on the damaged atolls. The remaining &euro;14 million will be channelled through the TRFF via the World Bank.</p>
	<p pid="b.2576W.0/7" class="italic">Eradicating poverty in the Maldives</p>
	<p pid="b.2576W.0/8">The Maldives has had much success in tackling poverty to date, with a GNI per capita income of $2,300 per annum. There has been a significant reduction in income poverty, decline in maternal and infant mortality and increase in school enrolments. It is clear that the tsunami will have temporarily affected future progress. Funding provided by the EU post tsunami forms part of the EU's ongoing development assistance for the Maldives and will cover the heightened development needs of the country post tsunami and also longer term development planned before the tsunami.</p>
	<p pid="b.2576W.0/9" class="italic">Auditing funds, transparency and impact of UK aid programmes</p>
	<p pid="b.2576W.0/10">The fact that much of DFID's relief and recovery assistance is being channelled through familiar partner organisations, including NGOs, helps ensure the funds are spent effectively. Individual agencies providing relief and reconstruction assistance are expected to have set their own targets for monitoring, taking into account the needs assessments undertaken by the Maldives' Government. In line with the Charity Commission's Statement of Recommended Practice 2004 annual reporting on progress and activities will be provided against their stated objectives.</p>
	<p pid="b.2576W.0/11">The European Commission (EC) has also played an important role by gathering data on individual member states humanitarian, rehabilitation and reconstruction funding and putting this on their website.</p>
	<p pid="b.2576W.0/12">The EC and the World Bank have undertaken joint evaluations of the national reconstruction plan (TRRF), as well as assisting the Government of Maldives in taking corrective measures when needed. We will continue to ensure that monitoring and technical assistance provided to the Maldives is in line with EU and UK policy. Regular monitoring of the TRRF will provide donors with the structure and opportunity to assess the impact and effectiveness of the support provided.</p>
	<p pid="b.2576W.0/13" class="italic">UK conditions</p>
	<p pid="b.2576W.0/14">Aside from support directed through multilateral institutions, the UK also provides limited non-humanitarian assistance, from programme budgets or the Small Grants Scheme to support individual projects that further Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) and or/DFID objectives.</p>
	<p pid="b.2576W.0/15">We understand that the relationship between the Government of the Maldives and Hill and Knowlton is a commercial one to which we are not a party.</p>

	<p pid="b.2577W.2/1">Since King Gyanendra suspended democratic rule on <phrase class="date" code="2005-02-01">1 February 2005</phrase>, the DFID programme in Nepal has been kept under review. DFID has looked carefully at the effectiveness of the different aid instruments we use to deliver development assistance and the risks posed to field staff.</p>
	<p pid="b.2577W.2/2">We continue to use financial aid in health, education and agriculture, where in my judgment it remains possible to help poor people and contribute to progress towards the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) by channelling resources through Government. However, the political context and the conflict do adversely affect the performance of these programmes and we are currently closely monitoring possible increases in fiduciary risk in relation to government programmes. In other areas such as forestry, infrastructure, water, community support, anti-corruption, support to democratic groups and peace-building, we are channelling funds through DFID managed Technical Co-operation, through national NGOs or directly to communities.</p>
	<p pid="b.2577W.2/3">DFID will shortly take stock of the political and conflict situation in Nepal and the outlook for development work, taking account of fiduciary and other risks and will consider how best we can continue to sustain essential services to the poor, and contribute to progress towards the MDGs and to a future peaceful and democratic Nepal.</p>

	<p pid="b.2578W.2/1">DFID's India country office, had discussions with Government of India (GoI) on population stabilisation issues in February 2006 in the context of the multi-donor review mission of the Reproductive and Child Health Programme, phase-2 (RCH-2). RCH-2, launched in April 2005, is the GoI's key programme to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDG)s for reducing maternal and child mortality. Population stabilisation is one objective of the overall programme through promoting the principal of choice: allowing couples to choose family size and spacing.</p>
	<p pid="b.2578W.2/2">The multi-donor mission was satisfied that the frontline workers in the health Department do not have any 'targets' for controlling population. The current programme, based on the GoI's National Population Policy 2000, is free of targets. It is based on voluntary choices to address the unmet need for contraception with a focus on improving the quality of services. Many states in India are piloting innovative approaches of partnership with the private sector in order to expand the scope and reach of contraceptive services. Some of the state Governments, such as Madhya Pradesh have reversed their earlier decision to debar individuals with more than two children from standing for elections to local governing bodies. Legislation has now been passed by the Madhya Pradesh Government permitting individuals to take office in local governing bodies irrespective of their family size.</p>

	<p pid="b.2578W.5/1">The Government are working hard to help Pakistan recover from the earthquake. DFID has pledged a total of &pound;58 million to meet relief needs, of which &pound;53.3 million has been programmed to specific relief actions, and a further &pound;70 million towards reconstruction. The European Commission has pledged &euro;93.6 million (around &pound;63.7 million) to relief and reconstruction. The UK's share of this is around &pound;11 million. We are the second largest donor to the relief effort.</p>
	<p pid="b.2578W.5/2">DFID provided more than &pound;2.4 million worth of urgently needed relief items, including 9,000 winterised tents, 32,000 tarpaulins, 19,700 collapsible 10-litre jerry cans, 36,000 blankets and 38,000 pieces of plastic sheeting. DFID has sent a total of 15 relief flights, including Ministry of Defence airlifts of priority relief items such as water and rations, and has funded 78 relief flights on behalf of the Disasters Emergency Committee to ensure that money raised by the public is spent on relief items and not transportation.</p>
	<p pid="b.2578W.5/3">As part of the overall &pound;58 million pledge, DFID has allocated over &pound;19 million in support of the UN's relief effort. This includes &pound;1 million to the World Food Programme (WFP) for helicopters, logistics support, vehicles, and coordination and &pound;1.7 million to United Nations Humanitarian Air Service (UNHAS) for helicopters. DFID further supported UN activities through a &pound;2 million pledge in support of the NATO airlift, transporting relief items from UN warehouses in Europe and the Middle East to Pakistan, and further DFID support to helicopter provision including three Chinook helicopters provided through the Ministry of Defence from <phrase class="date" code="2006-10-26">26 October</phrase> until <phrase class="date" code="2006-11-28">28 November</phrase>. DFID support to helicopter provision did not reduce at this point, but instead, at the request of WFP, DFID contracted four helicopters for four months, starting from <phrase class="date" code="2005-11-24">24 November 2005</phrase> as part of a &pound;5.5 million package of support to UNHAS.</p>
	<p pid="b.2578W.5/4">DFID also provided funding for an 86 strong team drawn from 59 Independent Commando Squadron Royal Engineers, deployed under NATO command, to undertake emergency shelter building operations in remote high-altitude areas in the Bagh region. The Royal Engineers unit are highly specialist troops who are trained to operate in winter and mountainous conditions.</p>
	<p pid="b.2578W.5/5">DFID is one of the largest bilateral donors for reconstruction, and is a trusted partner of the Government of Pakistan. We committed &pound;70 million for reconstruction at the Donors' Conference last November. DFID Pakistan will undertake programming for this during March, leading to preparation of a Programme Memorandum for Ministers approval during April. DFID funds are likely to be routed through the Government of Pakistan for general reconstruction purposes as well as some more specific technical assistance funds for capacity building and disaster risk reduction.</p>
	<p pid="b.2578W.5/6">We are providing technical support to the Earthquake Rehabilitation and Reconstruction Authorities (ERRA) to draw up a master plan for implementation and monitoring of the overall reconstruction programme. DFID support to the Government of Pakistan also includes developing a single, comprehensive monitoring and evaluation framework, providing the Pakistani authorities and donors with a common framework, ensuring no duplication of effort.</p>
	<p pid="b.2578W.5/7">The first &pound;5 million tranche of DFID's support for reconstruction is available immediately. We have consulted with international programme partners in Pakistan and the Governments of Azad, Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) and the North West Frontier Province (NWFP) about how the &pound;5 million can best be deployed for immediate reconstruction purposes. In light of theseconsultations, we will be making the following allocations:</p>
	<p pid="b.2578W.5/8" class="indent">Up to &pound;4 million for reconstructing critical bridges in the affected area;</p>
	<p pid="b.2578W.5/9" class="indent">Up to &pound;800,000 to the United Nations educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO) for training teachers and administrators, in order to underpin support for rehabilitation of the education sector;</p>

We have not produced a range of assessments but estimate that a home information pack will cost between &pound;600 and &pound;700 for the average home. The most expensive elements of the pack are likely to be the home condition report (HCR) and local searches. The cost of the HCR will vary according to a number of factors, as is the case with surveys now. Local searches are usually charged at a standard rate by search providers, regardless of the size of the home in question.</p>

	<p pid="b.2584W.6/1">The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister strongly encourages local authorities to establish rent deposit schemes and did fund the National Rent Deposit Forum (NRDF) in 2005&ndash;06 to enable the Forum time to develop an on-going strategy to sustain the organisation. Officials have also met with the NRDF and provided advice on possible ways forward, for example merging with other homeless charities, generating additional income and /or extending its membership base. I understand however that the NRDF has decided to close. This is a time when the number of rent deposit schemes has increased and been mainstreamed within housing advice and homelessness prevention. Recent local authority homelessness survey returns summarised in Survey of English Local Authorities About Homelessness Policy Briefing 13&quot; which is available on the ODPM website showed that 87 per cent. of responding local authorities have established rent deposit/bond schemes as part of their homelessness prevention services. It is unfortunate that as a membership organisation that should exist on the basis of services it offers to members the NRDF was not able to benefit from the increase in rent deposit schemes.</p>
	<p pid="b.2584W.6/2">Under the provisions of the Housing Act 2004, the Government are introducing tenancy deposit protection, which is scheduled to come into force in October 2006. It will apply to assured shorthold tenancies in England andWales. Following a consultation that ended on <phrase class="date" code="2006-02-01">1 February 2006</phrase>, the Government are preparing the secondary legislation required to commence the schemes. A competitive tendering exercise is under way to select suppliers to run the schemes and award contracts in early summer 2006.</p>

Potential developers will need to satisfy the local planning authority concerned that unacceptable risk from contamination will be successfully addressed through remediation. Environmental impact assessment requirements will apply if the development is likely to have significant environmental effects. Local planning authorities themselves are expected to plan for land uses that are appropriate in the light of all the relevant circumstances, including known or suspected contamination and, when determining planning applications, be satisfied that the site concerned is suitable for the new use and that the development does not create unacceptable risks. Planning conditions may require that land is remediated in the course of development to an appropriate standard, taking account of its intended use, and that, if necessary, is properly maintained subsequently. The Environment Agency is likely to be consulted on the redevelopment of former landfill sites and may require specific applications for authorisations within the pollution control framework it operates. The Building Regulations 2000 include requirements to protect buildings from the effects of contamination.</p>

	<p pid="b.2593W.3/1">In 1998 when the Patten Commission was conducting its investigation, only 8.3 per cent. of regular officers were from the Roman Catholic community. In less than five years under the temporary 50:50 provisions Catholic composition among regular officers has risen to 19.45 per cent. with 2,172 recruits having been selected for appointment on a 50:50 basis. In the same time female composition has also risen from 13 per cent. to 20.21 per cent. Our goal is to increase Catholic representation to 30 per cent. by 2010&ndash;11; the date envisaged by Patten to achieve this aim. I am pleased to say that we are very much on target to reach this goal with a further interim target of 23.5 per cent. set for March 2008.</p>
	<p pid="b.2593W.3/2">In terms of the steps taken to recruit police officers, the Oversight Commissioner has commented that the advertising programme has been both imaginative and assiduous. It has varied between competitions, but has included press, television, billboard, cinema and online advertising, all designed to reach groups currently under-represented in the police service. The responses from all communities have been extremely positive and the results have exceeded expectations. In an effort to adapt the volume of applicants to the number of recruits that can actually be appointed to training, television advertising has now been eliminated, and the number of press insertions reduced.</p>
	<p pid="b.2593W.3/3">The Oversight Commissioner found that in addition to a large number of Northern Ireland applicants, applications have been received from Great Britain and the Republic of Ireland, as well as from a number of other countries. Nearly 25 per cent. of all applicants entering training are graduates.</p>
	<p pid="b.2593W.3/4">The Government recognises that 50:50 recruitment is an exceptional means of addressing an exceptional problem and we firmly believe that these temporary provisions are justified to rectify an acute historical imbalance in the composition of the police service. These exceptional measures are reviewed triennially and will expire unless specifically renewed by an order made by the Secretary of State. Section 47 of the 2000 Act was last renewed by the Police (NI) Act 2000 (Renewal of Temporary Provisions) Order 2004 allowing for their continuation until <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-28">28 March 2007</phrase>.</p>

	<p pid="b.2598W.5/1">Where a prisoner is eligible to be considered for release on HDC the Governor will consider suitability based on the merits of each individual case. Where the Governor considers there is a significant risk to the public or risk of reoffending on HDC or that the prisoner is likely to breach the curfew conditions, then release will not be granted. In order to assist Governors inform their future decisions, when offenders are recalled from HDC the releasing prison is now provided with copies of the revocation order and a police information sheet which provides details of the reasons for recall.</p>

	<p pid="b.2602W.3/1">Since 1997, the Government have placed an increasing emphasis on addressing the causesand effects of offending behaviour. The 1998 comprehensive spending review (CSR) provided the first large scale, discrete investment in prison regimes, to allow prisoners to address offending behaviour and helpwith rehabilitation. This has been reinforced in subsequent spending reviews. Since 2002, partnerships with the Departments of Health and Education and Skills, which have transferred the budgets and policy responsibility from the Prison Service, have put provision of prisoners' health care and education on a par with that of the rest of society, to ensure equality and continuity of care and opportunity inside and outside of prison.</p>
	<p pid="b.2602W.3/2">The Youth Justice Board (also established as one of the outcomes of the 1998 CSR) has concentrated resources and efforts across the criminal justice system to help address the specific issues and problems associated with juveniles in a positive and constructive way. The new commissioning arrangements currently being designed and implemented in the new National Offender Management System, will allow regional offenders managers to similarly positively address the issues of adult offenders, both in custody and when held under community sentences.</p>

	<p pid="b.2603W.5/1">The continued introduction of safer cells across the prisons estate is based on a policy set out in December 2003 by the Prison Service Investment Board (PSIB). This states that for new accommodation in existing public prison establishments, all Category A, Category B and local prisons would be fitted 100 per cent. with full specification safer cells; Category C prison establishments would be fitted 25 per cent. with full specification safer cells; while RTUs ('ready to use') and MTUs (modular temporary units) would not generally be fitted with full specification safer cells and risks would be managed operationally. The PSIB further agreed that, for refurbished accommodation in local prison establishments, consideration should always be given to include safer cell provision in all business cases commissioned by the Estates Planning Committee.</p>
	<p pid="b.2603W.5/2">Some issues around ventilation in safer cells were raised during the independent evaluation of safer cells, carried out by the Jill Dando Institute of Crime Science in 2003, as a result of which the Prison Service has developed an alternative safer ventilator design. The evaluation concluded that safer cells have much to commend them. Three prisoners stated to evaluators that being in a safer cell had prevented them from killing themselves.</p>

	<p pid="b.2605W.5/1">The War Crimes Act 1991 was passed by Parliament to allow the prosecution of war crimes committed during the Second World War in Germany or German occupied territory by people who are now British citizens or resident in the UK.</p>
	<p pid="b.2605W.5/2">The Metropolitan Police War Crimes Unit, which disbanded in 1999, conducted enquiries into a large number of cases arising from the 1989 Report of the War Crimes Inquiry and elsewhere. Most cases did not lead to criminal proceedings because either the suspect was no longer alive or there was insufficient evidence for prosecution. There has been one conviction under the Act. Anthony Sawoniuk was sentenced to life imprisonment in 1999 and died in custody in 2005. In one other prosecution, against Syzmon Serafinowicz in 1997, the court found the defendant unfit to plead and the then Attorney General entered a Nolle Prosequi (permanent stay of prosecution).</p>

	<p pid="b.2606W.2/1">Openness of judicial proceedings is a fundamental principle of the criminal justice system. However, courts have common law powers to restrict public access to proceedings where it is deemed necessary for the administration of justice and to ensure that justice is done, such as for witness protection.</p>
	<p pid="b.2606W.2/2">Section 25 of the Youth Justice and Criminal Evidence Act 1999 enables the court to exclude the public (apart form one press representative) in a case involving a vulnerable or intimidated witness, where the case involves a sexual offence or.intimidation.</p>
	<p pid="b.2606W.2/3">There are also provisions in the Official Secrets Acts 1920 and 1989 which empower the court to exclude the public on grounds of national safety in prosecutions under those Acts.</p>
