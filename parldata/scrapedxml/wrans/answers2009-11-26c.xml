	<p pid="c.256W.0/1">The impact assessment for the pilot implementation of Part 1 of the Commons Act 2006 concluded that the completion of an application form by applicants would impose a very small administrative burden on applicants. In addition, the costs of giving notice of an application to prescribed persons would also generally be low. The impact assessment noted that DEFRA intended to gather further information about the burden on applicants, but to date no applications have been submitted under paragraph 4 of Schedule 2 to enable this to be done.</p>

	<p pid="c.256W.3/1">DEFRA and its delivery network are contributing to the Government's target of &#163;35 billion VFM savings in CSR07. Overall progress towards the target will be reported in departmental autumn performance reports. Current savings include those arising under DEFRA's Workplace Support Initiative which will bring much of the DEFRA estate (which currently covers over 234 sites across the Department and its agencies) into a single facilities management contract. DEFRA will save &#163;6 million per year in 2010-11 compared to the preceding year through economies of scale and increasing the flexibility of its facilities. Savings will rise to &#163;11 million per year by 2013-14.</p>

The Highways Agency's Information Asset Owner (IAO) has ensured that the information is accredited to Information Security ISO27001 standards. In September 2009 Lloyd's Register Quality Assurance (LRQA) conducted a review of procedures at the NTCC and confirmed that standards still met the requirements of ISO27001.</p>

	<p pid="c.262W.5/2">A site survey was carried out on behalf of the Strategic Rail Authority in 2005, as part of the consultation strategy behind the Access for All Programme. This identified that Cheadle Hulme did not meet modern standards for accessibility in a number of respects, and recommended installation of a new footbridge and lifts to all platforms. We currently expect this work to take place during 2010-11.</p>

	<p pid="c.276W.0/1">The figures in the following table are based upon information provided to Sport England by national governing bodies at the time their 2009-13 awards were made in December 2008.</p>
	<p pid="c.276W.0/2">For some NGBs (highlighted by asterisks) an exact Grow/Sustain/Excel breakdown was difficult to determine as their plans for the sport to grow and sustain participation, in particular, are hard to separate. In these cases, the figures are assumptions made by Sport England based on wider information contained in the Whole Sport Plans.</p>
	<p pid="c.276W.0/3">As a result of some amendments made to the final figures in contractual discussions between Sport England and the NGBs concerned, there are some minor discrepancies between the Grow/Sustain/Excel figures in the breakdown and the actual final awards made.</p>

	<p pid="c.289W.0/1">It is our policy that armed forces personnel should be recruited to be fully fit for deployment worldwide on operations. For this reason, the services do not recruit or commission personnel with existing medical conditions which require special diets, such as those with nut allergies. We currently have no plans to review this policy.</p>
	<p pid="c.289W.0/2">This policy is intended to protect such individuals from military circumstances which may adversely impact upon their condition and to ensure the effectiveness of the armed forces. Although it may be possible to accommodate the special dietary requirements of those with nut allergies in a UK-based unit, or possibly on a large ship or at a major overseas base, we cannot guarantee to provide a special diet in the field or when deployed on operations, and individuals are recruited on the basis that they will be able to deploy world-wide. In such circumstances, it would be quite wrong to run risks which could impact on the individual and his or her colleagues on operations. In some cases, personnel will depend on food supplied locally, and our ability to assure nut-free status would not always be possible-as would certainly be the case if an individual were to be captured by enemy forces, for example.</p>
	<p pid="c.289W.0/3">The single services manage individuals who develop nut allergies during their service careers according to their specific operational requirements and each case will be considered on an individual basis. While we will make every effort to retain in-service individuals who subsequently develop this and similar conditions, provided that there are worthwhile military roles for them to fulfil, they may have to be re-graded and will probably not be able to deploy on operations. Again, this will depend on the severity of the individual's allergy; those with life-threatening allergies will almost certainly not be deployed to operational theatres, due to factors such as requirement of access to emergency treatment and storage requirements of the medication required by these individuals. This also applies to other disabilities which arise in service, but the forces do not recruit individuals where they would only be able to serve in a medically restricted capacity from the outset.</p>
	<p pid="c.289W.0/4">The total number of individuals who were diagnosed with nut allergies while serving in the armed forces and are currently still serving is not held centrally, and could be provided only by examining the medical records of all personnel at disproportionate cost.</p>
	<p pid="c.289W.0/5">Since individuals with nut allergies will not usually be deployed, ration packs tailored for such individuals are not produced. Since most food consumption on deployment is delivered by mass catering, often using local sources, and for other reasons noted above, provision of such ration packs would not circumvent the barriers to deployment for those who suffer nut allergies.</p>

	<p pid="c.299W.2/1">The Government have made no recent assessments as the independent regulator Ofcom has responsibility for telephone numbers in the UK.</p>
	<p pid="c.299W.2/2">Ofcom, in 2006, strengthened its price publication rules, requiring operators to make it easier for consumers to find out about the cost of calling 08 numbers. Operators are now required to state maximum charges for calls to 08 numbers in promotional material and also to specify whether 08 calls are included in call packages.</p>
	<p pid="c.299W.2/3">Calls to 0845 numbers are often charged at a small premium from fixed networks. For instance, BT's maximum charge for an 0845 call is 3.867p per minute (including VAT) but most BT customers pay no more than 1.9p per minute. There are also signs that competition is exerting downward pressure on prices. Earlier this year, BT included 0845 in its calling plans on the same basis as 01, 02 and 03 numbers and at least one other operator has since followed BT's lead.</p>

In addition, the department also recently announced a &#163;20 million Preventing Repossessions Fund to enable local authorities to extend small loans to families at risk of homelessness through repossession or eviction. We have also provided &#163;2.5 million funding to the National Homelessness Advice Service (NHAS) which is a partnership between Shelter and the Citizens Advice Bureaux (CABx) providing high quality advice on homelessness prevention through the network of participating CABx and other voluntary agencies across England.</p>

	<p pid="c.310W.2/3">New cases of homelessness acceptances have reduced by 69 per cent. since the last peak in 2003.

In response to our recent consultation, &quot;Strengthening Local Democracy&quot;, the Leader of Cornwall council commented that powers involving the delegation of funding, duties for regional and national bodies to co-operate and the ability to flex national policy to make it appropriate to local circumstances could be helpful in relation to the Cornwall and Isles of Scilly Economic Forum. The Government will be publishing their formal response to the consultation shortly.</p>

	<p pid="c.322W.0/1">The current economic downturn is causing real hardship for many hardworking consumers and the Government are determined to do all they can to help those in financial difficulties, while balancing this against creditors' rights to recover their debts wherever possible, both now and in the future.</p>
	<p pid="c.322W.0/2">Currently, it is not possible for the Lord Chancellor to control either advertising or the fees charged by debt management scheme providers. However, the powers contained in chapter 4 of part 5 of the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007 (TCEA) would permit this in respect of approved schemes.</p>
	<p pid="c.322W.0/3">Following concerns about the operation of this sector, the consultation paper 'Debt Management Schemes-delivering effective and balanced solutions for debtors and creditors' was published on <phrase class="date" code="2009-09-18">18 September</phrase> and looks at the current operation of the debt management market. It seeks views on whether any changes are needed in this area and, if so, what those changes should be.</p>
	<p pid="c.322W.0/4">It sets out three broad options: continue with the measures currently under way to raise awareness about current schemes and enforce existing rules with operators (Option 1); improve current schemes without regulation, possibly through the introduction of a protocol (Option 2); or implement the Lord Chancellor's powers to approve debt management schemes contained in chapter 4 of part 5 of the TCEA 2007 (Option 3).</p>
	<p pid="c.322W.0/5">The consultation asks specific questions about how debt management schemes should be supervised and, for example, whether any existing scheme could be used or adapted to achieve the aims. This could include using the process for debt relief orders.</p>
	<p pid="c.322W.0/6">It is expected that the results of the consultation will be available in the new year, at which time the Government will announce what action they plan to take in this area. However, advertising generally will be considered during the compliance review currently being carried out by the Office of Fair Trading. Its report will be issued in spring 2010.</p>
	<p pid="c.322W.0/7">Separate to this consultation, the Government intend to issue guidance on what consumers should expect from debt management plan operators shortly. This guidance will explain that operators should advise on all debt assistance options available to those approaching them and give clear information about the fees that they charge. This guidance will supplement the more detailed guidance 'In Debt? Dealing with your creditors', published by the Insolvency Service on <phrase class="date" code="2009-07-02">2 July 2009</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="c.322W.0/8">An initial impact assessment was published alongside the consultation paper which considered the potential effectiveness of all of the options contained in the consultation paper. The impact assessment considers, as far as possible, the potential effects of all of the options on various sectors of society but also requests additional information to assist in the development of this assessment.</p>

	<p pid="c.330W.2/1">It is Government policy that, where possible, offenders should contribute to victims' services as part of their reparation. Provisions were therefore included in the Domestic Violence, Crime and Victims Act 2004 providing for a surcharge to be payable on criminal convictions, penalty notices for disorder and on fixed penalty notices for road traffic offences where the offences are persistent and serious.</p>
	<p pid="c.330W.2/2">The victim surcharge was introduced on <phrase class="date" code="2007-04-01">1 April 2007</phrase> and has been applied initially only to fines imposed in magistrates and Crown courts at a rate of &#163;15. We intend to add the surcharge to other disposals as soon as it becomes feasible to do so. Proceeds raised from the surcharge provide a ring-fenced source of funding for a wide variety of organisations providing non-financial support to victims and witnesses of crime.</p>

	<p pid="c.333W.6/2">Primary care trusts are responsible for commissioning mental health care in prisons. Where possible they aim for an equivalent service to that provided in the community with general practitioners providing the initial assessment and a gateway to psychological therapies, visiting psychiatrists and prison in reach teams. When prisoners' mental health problems require them to be sectioned under the Mental Health Act, they are transferred to secure mental health units.</p>
	<p pid="c.333W.6/3">Measuring relative effectiveness is complicated by the different levels of care provided in each setting. However, the Department has recently commissioned a call for research into the evidence base on secure forensic inpatient services in England (high, medium and low secure forensic services). This review will systematically assess the context and mechanisms through which high, medium and low secure forensic inpatient services produce outcomes. It is envisaged this review will improve current evidence about why services work, what might work in specific circumstances, and the impact on resources, deliverability and health equity.</p>

It is essential throughout this process that the high standard of service consumers expect is maintained, while also ensuring that staff receive full support. Any arrangement will be aligned with the assurance I made to this House that, in creating the OLC, the principles of TUPE will apply to the transfer of staff.</p>

	<p pid="c.352W.5/1">Drug treatment in England consists of various types of treatment, depending on the circumstances of the service user, including opiate substitute prescribing. A service user may therefore receive many different treatments over time which makes it difficult to isolate the cost of a single component such as substitute prescribing.</p>
	<p pid="c.352W.5/2">The National Drug Treatment Monitoring System operated by the National Treatment Agency for Substance Misuse (NTA) records the type of treatment interventions each person receives, e.g. 'specialist prescribing' (from a specialist drug service) and 'GP prescribing' (from their general practitioner). It does not record the medication prescribed.</p>
	<p pid="c.352W.5/3">The annual cost of a person in a prescribing intervention is estimated at between &#163;2,000 and &#163;5,000, depending on the medication prescribed, the intensity of their treatment and ancillary support.</p>
	<p pid="c.352W.5/4">Data on the length of time that an opiate substitute is prescribed are not collected centrally, however research shows that staying in treatment for at least 12 weeks has a lasting positive benefit in reducing the harm associated with dependence.</p>
	<p pid="c.352W.5/5">It is important to note that the duration of drug treatment varies markedly according to individual need and that it is not unusual for drug users to go in and out of treatment several times, often over several years, before becoming drug-free. Additionally, national clinical guidelines do not specify how long a person should be in treatment.</p>
	<p pid="c.352W.5/6">Prescribing an opiate substitute has benefits for both the patient and society. It allows the patient an opportunity to stabilise their drug intake and lifestyle while breaking with the cyclic nature of illicit drug use and dependency, allowing them to take responsibility for their children, earn their own living and to keep a stable home.</p>

	<p pid="c.354W.8/1">A proposal document has been accepted by the Liver Selection and Allocation Working Party-part of NHS Blood and Transplant's (NHSBT) Liver Advisory Group-with four key stages: agreeing the aims of transplantation (maximising survival from the point of registration onto a transplant list); developing statistical models which can predict as accurately as possible a patient's survival without a liver transplant; developing models to predict survival after liver transplantation; and comparing four possible models of allocation.</p>
	<p pid="c.354W.8/2">The process is being overseen by the Liver Selection and Allocation Working Party, reviewed by the Liver Advisory Group at NHSBT who will make final recommendations to the NHS BT Board for their ratification. The modelling is expected to finish by March 2010. A 12 month simulation will then follow, with the aim of having a final model for implementation by April 2011.</p>

The National Cancer Director has encouraged all networks and trusts to review their own data and to take action, especially if they fall below the helpful benchmarks set out at the end of the report. The NHS Information Centre has offered trusts a local action planning toolkit to help them do this effectively.</p>

	<p pid="c.355W.3/1">We are committed to raising awareness of the signs and symptoms of cancer, and this is a key focus of the &quot;Cancer Reform Strategy&quot;, published in December 2007. A copy has already been placed in the Library.</p>
	<p pid="c.355W.3/2">We know that awareness weeks and months for specific cancer types can be an effective way of raising awareness of cancer. As part of this year's Lung Cancer Awareness Month, we have provided funding of &#163;15,000 for lung cancer awareness leaflets to be sent to all pharmacies in England for public distribution. This is the second year that we have provided funding for these leaflets.</p>
	<p pid="c.355W.3/3">A stakeholder group has been formed to address lung cancer awareness at a strategic level. The Lung Cancer Awareness Action and Advisory Group is working to raise awareness of lung cancer.</p>
	<p pid="c.355W.3/4">Through the National Awareness and Early Diagnosis Initiative, formally launched in November 2008, we are working to raise awareness of the signs and symptoms of cancer, including lung cancer, amongst the public and health professionals. This work includes: the development of key messages on a number of cancers (key messages for lung cancer are available on the NHS Choices website at:</p>

	<p pid="c.355W.3/7">As part of the Initiative, almost &#163;5 million has been allocated to the national health service to support cancer networks and primary care trusts in implementing local services that will improve awareness of cancers, including lung cancer, and promote early diagnosis.</p>
	<p pid="c.355W.3/8">The Department is investing in a campaign to raise awareness of the signs and symptoms of lung, breast and bowel cancers to encourage people with symptoms to seek help earlier than they do currently. The Improvement Foundation's Healthy Communities Collaborative is working in 20 of the most deprived areas of the country to target those most at risk and is working with local people to develop and test methods of awareness raising.</p>
	<p pid="c.355W.3/9">In addition, the Department and the Football Foundation are jointly funding the Ahead of the Game programme. Ahead of the Game is a one-year pilot programme that uses the appeal of football to raise awareness of lung, bowel and prostate cancers in men aged 55 and over.</p>

Many more staff, more community mental health services and increased access to psychological therapies have transformed services since 1997. Our New Horizons vision, to be published shortly, will build upon these achievements.</p>

	<p pid="c.358W.2/1">Our advice to everyone is to continue to protect themselves and their babies by observing good respiratory and hand hygiene (use a tissue when they cough and sneeze and then throw it away and the frequent use of soap and water or sanitizer). People should contact their general practitioner (GP) if they have a child under one year old who has flu-like symptoms.</p>
	<p pid="c.358W.2/2">A GP will assess children under one year and give advice on the use of the antiviral medication, any other relevant medication and on symptom management. People should keep a close eye on their child's symptoms and if their child suddenly gets much worse or does not improve, they should contact their GP again.</p>
	<p pid="c.358W.2/3">The appropriate antiviral medication for children under one is oral oseltamivir solution, which is made up in national health service hospital pharmacies. We have enough of the powder for 50 per cent. of under ones. This is a sufficient amount based on current advice about the numbers who may be ill during the pandemic.</p>
	<p pid="c.358W.2/4">Advice on the use of antiviral medicines for children under the age of one year has been placed in the Library (&quot;Pandemic Influenza: Recommendations on the use of antiviral medicines for pregnant women, women who are breastfeeding and children under the age of one year&quot;) and advice on breastfeeding and swine flu, including ways of reducing the risk of passing flu from mother to baby is given on the Department's website at:</p>

	<p pid="c.362W.2/1" class="holdinganswer">holding answer <phrase class="date" code="2009-11-23">23 November 2009</phrase></p>
	<p pid="c.362W.2/2">The allocated budget for this spending round has been set at &#163;959 million (2008-11).The actual spend for Year 1 (2008-09) was &#163;395 million, while the planned spend for financial years 2009-10 and 2010-11 is &#163;369 million and &#163;195 million respectively. Budgets for future years will be considered as part of the next spending round.</p>
	<p pid="c.362W.2/3">Warm Front does not operate in the devolved Administrations and thus all scheme expenditure will be incurred in England.</p>
	<p pid="c.362W.2/4">The Carbon Reductions reported for the scheme are based on figures calculated by the external energy analysis company, the Energy Audit Company, using property data collected by the Scheme Manager. Calculations for total carbon savings achieved under Warm Front are calculated annually at the end of each year, as such, the process does not yield projected estimates for incomplete or future years. The last period for which figures are available is 2008-09 (the last complete scheme year) when the scheme reported an average reduction on 1.233 tonnes per household assisted. I refer the hon. Member to the answer given to my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1850" name="David Drew">the Member for Stroud (Mr. Drew)</phrase> on <phrase class="date" code="2009-11-12">12 November 2009</phrase>, <phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2009-11-12.677"><i> Official Report</i>, column 677W</phrase>, for further information on carbon savings under Warm Front.</p>
	<p pid="c.362W.2/5">The scheme aims to assist over 205,000 households this year, with a current estimate of 90,000 in 2010-11. This reduction in numbers is a result of &#163;50 million of scheme funding being brought forward from the 2010-11 budget in order to assist vulnerable households sooner. It is not possible to make estimates for future years as budgets have not been set.</p>
	<p pid="c.362W.2/6">Given the length of the scheme's supply chain, it is difficult to estimate the number of jobs that Warm Front creates. At the 2008 pre-Budget report, the Government announced that &#163;3 billion of capital investment would be brought forward from 2010-11 to 2009-10 to support a number of different industries and sectors through the economic downturn. This included a green stimulus of &#163;535 million, which included &#163;100 million, in new funding for Warm Front and &#163;50 million brought forward from 2010-11. The Prime Minister announced that total public sector capital investment was expected to create or support 100,000 jobs across the country this year.</p>
