	<p pid="a.225W.8/2">The Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs announced UK support for the NTC on policing and in support of their building of a vibrant civil society. He made clear that the UK stood ready to respond to additional requests from the Libya authorities. The UK is funding a project to provide training for lawyers and justice officials in order to improve understanding and adherence to international human rights standards. We will continue to work closely with the NTC as well as our EU and UN counterparts to determine what further specific bilateral support the UK can provide.</p>

	<p pid="a.227W.2/1">The Open Public Services White Paper, published in July 2011, states that we are giving public sector workers who want to form mutuals or co-operatives to deliver public services a right to provide. This will enable public sector workers who want to form new employee-owned mutual companies to take over the running of services. We are working closely with Cabinet Office to help facilitate this in children's services where the conditions are right, and have already made some initial good progress. As part of the Cabinet Office's mutuals pathfinder programme, a small number of local authorities are currently working with their employees in children's services to explore new models of delivery. A grant with 4Children is exploring a range of children's centre delivery models to encourage increased commissioning out of children's centres services by local authorities. This will include exploring opportunities for public sector workers to take over the running of services.</p>
	<p pid="a.227W.2/2">We are also testing employee owned delivery arrangements through our social work practices (SWPs) pilots. The SWP pilots, announced in December 2008, have seen the creation of independent, social worker-led organisations to deliver services for children and young people in care, including social workers moving out of public sector employment to form their own employee-owned social enterprise. These initiatives will help us to understand, by learning from the front line, what type of support and structures will best enable the development of employee-led mutuals on an ongoing basis.</p>

	<p pid="a.240W.5/1">Table 1 as follows shows that the total number of young people aged 10 to 17 years, serving indeterminate sentences which started between 2005-06 (when the indeterminate sentence came into effect) and 2009-10 is 178, and the proportion who were discharged over this time period is 6%. Table 2 shows data on the average time served in custody (in days) for 10 to 17-year-olds with indeterminate sentences in each year from 2005-06 to 2009-10.</p>
	<p pid="a.240W.5/2">This information set out in Tables 1 and 2 was supplied by the Youth Justice Board (YJB). The YJB does not have information on young people once they have turned 18 years old (and may transfer to the adult secure estate). Table 1 therefore does not include data on those who had been released after they had turned 18; and Table 2 refers to the average time in custody where the young person was released before their 18th birthday. In order to gather this information including those aged 18 or more would involve manually extracting and matching YJB and MOJ data and as such would incur a disproportionate cost.</p>

The default objective of the Water Framework Directive (subject to certain exemptions) is to aim to achieve good ecological and chemical status for natural rivers and good chemical status and ecological potential for heavily modified rivers by 2015.

	<p pid="a.245W.5/1">In 2010, 22% of English river water bodies were assessed to be at good ecological status or good ecological potential. Ecological quality may be impacted by multiple environmental pressures, including changes to land use, river channel modifications, chemical quality, and alterations to flow. Obstructions can impact on the connectivity of rivers, which can affect the suitability of river habitats for different species, or may present a barrier to fish migration. Natural or man-made barriers impacting on fish migration are a contributing pressure in about 6% of English river water bodies failing good ecological status. Other factors affecting the connectivity, form and function of rivers are a contributing pressure in about 21% of rivers failing good ecological status. The main polluting pressures include nutrients, in about 46%, and organic (sanitary) pollutants in about 21%.</p>

However, the Government are encouraging local authorities to develop proposals for permit schemes under the Traffic Management Act 2004, which requires authorities to treat their own works in the same way as those carried out by utility companies and other statutory undertakers. The Government's draft guidance on lane rental schemes, currently out to consultation, also encourages local authorities to apply the same financial incentives to their own works contractors as they propose to require of utility companies.</p>

	<p pid="a.256W.2/2">It is estimated that in social rented housing in England there are between 1,000 and 6,000 households where the household reference person and partner have a combined income over &#163;100,000 per annum. There will be other cases where households in the social rented sector have total incomes exceeding &#163;100,000&#8212;for example because of the earnings of flat sharers, lodgers, or grown-up children&#8212;but such cases are not counted here. It is not possible to provide a breakdown of this estimate by local authority because of the sample sizes of the sources, the English Housing survey and the Family Resources survey.</p>
	<p pid="a.256W.2/3">I am minded to introduce a &#8220;pay to stay&#8221; scheme for social tenants on incomes greater than &#163;100,000 who want to stay in their properties. We will be publishing a consultation on this in due course, which will consider how best to configure the scheme and ensure it is appropriately targeted at genuine high earners.</p>

	<p pid="a.257W.6/1" class="holdinganswer">holding answer <phrase class="date" code="2011-10-24">24 October 2011</phrase></p>
	<p pid="a.257W.6/2">Prior to May 1987, service personnel (or their dependants in the case of a fatality) were prevented from pursuing claims for compensation from the Ministry of Defence (MOD) by Section 10 of The Crown Proceedings Act 1947. Section 10 was repealed by The Crown Proceedings (Armed Forces) Act 1987.</p>
	<p pid="a.257W.6/3">When the House debated the repeal of Section 10, the question of retrospection was considered and motions to allow all past and present members of HM Forces or their dependants to pursue compensation claims for injury or death were moved: they were defeated or withdrawn. The view then, as it is now, was that there was no logical point at which to draw a line, short of trying to cover all types of injury, and this would create more examples of unfairness and injustice.</p>
	<p pid="a.257W.6/4">This position was challenged in the other place on the basis that Section 10 of The Crown Proceedings Act 1947 is incompatible with the European Convention on Human Rights. The noble Lords, Lord Bingham, Lord Hoffman, Lord Millett, Lord Hope and Lord Walker heard the matter on 13 and <phrase class="date" code="2003-01-14">14 January 2003</phrase> and a unanimous judgment was handed down on <phrase class="date" code="2003-02-13">13 February 2003</phrase> in favour of the MOD. The MOD's position concerning the payment of claims predating the repeal of Section 10 of The Crown Proceedings Act remains unchanged.</p>
	<p pid="a.257W.6/5">When compensation claims are submitted, they are considered on the basis of whether or not the MOD has a legal liability to pay compensation. Where there is a legal liability to pay compensation we do so. As the incident leading to Sergeant Major Adamson's tragic death was before the repeal of Section 10 in 1987, any claim in respect of this tragic death is prevented by law.</p>

	<p pid="a.261W.6/1">The Ministry of Defence (MOD) takes a proactive approach to the assessment of land quality across the estate and to the management of the risks to human health and the environment. This includes radium 226 associated predominantly with the historical maintenance and disposal of luminised instruments especially during and after the second world war and which are present to some degree at many current and former MOD sites.</p>
	<p pid="a.261W.6/2">Where radium-226 contamination has been identified the potential risks are managed at site level. Such contamination on MOD sites is present in a relatively non-mobile form, with there being little to no leaching to soils and limited solubility in groundwater. As such, it is believed that radium and for that matter radiological contamination on MOD sites poses a relatively low risk to human health and the wider environment.</p>

	<p pid="a.262W.2/1">Government recognises that some people find unsolicited mail and phone calls a real nuisance. That is why we have made sure that there are preference services in place to stop them. More information about postal preference services can be found on the Mailing Preference Service website:</p>
	<p pid="a.262W.2/2"><a href="http://www.mpsonline.org.uk">www.mpsonline.org.uk</a></p>
	<p pid="a.262W.2/3">We strongly advise people to be very wary of unsolicited offers which sound too good to be true, as they often are. Where people receive material through the postal system which they believe is either misleading or may promote a scam or fraud, they should inform the appropriate authorities (Advertising Standards Authority, Trading Standards or Action Fraud). Consumers and businesses are protected from unsolicited marketing telephone calls through the Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations 2003 (PECR). This prohibits calls to a consumer who has either previously notified the caller that they do not wish to receive such calls or has been registered with the Telephone Preference Service (TPS), or for business through the Corporate Telephone Preference Service (CTPS) scheme, for at least 28 days. Companies are legally required not to call a number that has registered on the TPS or CTPS list. Redress is available if registration is ignored. The Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) is responsible for enforcing the TPS and CTPS and is able to issue a fine of up to &#163;500,000 for the most serious breaches of the regulations.</p>
	<p pid="a.262W.2/4">Consumers are also protected from unsolicited automated recorded calls through the same PECR regulations. Companies that make recorded calls to sell or promote their product or business have to comply with Regulation 19 (1) and (2) of the Privacy Regulations, which require that prior consent of the recipient has to be obtained before such calls can be made. Regulation 24 (1) (a) states that all messages must include the identity of the caller and an address or freephone number at which the caller can be contacted.</p>
	<p pid="a.262W.2/5">In addition, most telecom service providers offer a range of services that can reduce the need to answer an unsolicited marketing call.</p>

Although HMG is unable to intervene directly in individual cases, we will continue to remind the Libyan authorities of their commitment and urge them to honour it.

	<p pid="a.272W.3/1">Improving social mobility is the principal goal of the Government's social policy. It is central to my vision of a fair, open society where no-one is prevented from fulfilling their potential by the circumstances of their birth and where skills, talent and hard work are what counts in determining success.</p>
	<p pid="a.272W.3/2">Published in April 2011, the Government's Social Mobility Strategy&#8212;&#8220;Opening Doors, Breaking Barriers: A Strategy for Social Mobility&#8221;&#8212;aims to tackle unfairness at every stage of life with specific measures to improve social mobility. I chair a group of key Ministers to supervise delivery of this strategy.</p>
	<p pid="a.272W.3/3">The strategy also sets out robust mechanisms to underpin our commitments on social mobility. This includes a set of key indicators to help us track progress, and the creation of a new Social Mobility and Child Poverty Commission to hold the Government to account.</p>

	<p pid="a.277W.5/1">The emergence of drug resistant strains of tuberculosis (TB) poses a serious threat to TB control. Improving basic TB control is critical to prevent the further spread of drug resistant tuberculosis. Our three priorities are to help increase access to and use effective diagnosis and treatment of TB; to invest in research and product development into more effective vaccines and diagnosis and treatment of TB, including drug resistant TB; and to support countries to strengthen health systems to deliver quality TB programmes. We do this through our support to UNITAID, the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria, and our research and bilateral support.</p>
	<p pid="a.277W.5/2">The UK Government have made a 20 year commitment to UNITAID of up to &#8364;60 million per year. UNITAID aims to help expand access to quality-assured multi-drug resistant TB (MDR TB) treatment and push for price reductions. The Department for International Development is also supporting the Foundation for Innovative New Diagnostics (FIND) to carry out research for the development of new diagnostics for TB, including rapid diagnosis for MDR TB for use in peripheral laboratories and clinics.</p>
