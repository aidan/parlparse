	<p pid="b.1226W.6/1">In December 2004 Peterborough was given indicative allocations for highway maintenance in the Local Transport Plan settlement of &pound;2.409 million for 2005&ndash;06 and &pound;2.209 million for 2006&ndash;07.</p>
	<p pid="b.1226W.6/2">These sums were calculated by formula and included specific amounts for strengthening structures on the primary route network. The formula had a dampening mechanism that prevented maintenance allocations varying by more than 25 per cent. from the previous year, and in the case of Peterborough the sums given to them for primary route work had the effect of depressing the amount available to them for other maintenance work.</p>
	<p pid="b.1226W.6/3">A consultation on the LTP maintenance formula took place in 2005, and it was decided that from 2007&ndash;08 primary route network allocations will not be included when applying the 25 per cent. year on year dampening mechanism. This will rectify the problem experienced by Peterborough.</p>

Within DTI, there is no single Minister with specific responsibilities for world heritage sites and any issues relating to DTI are dealt with by the appropriate Minister concerned.</p>

	<p pid="b.1232W.0/1">DFID tracks its bilateral expenditure by monitoring expenditure against specific sector objectives, one of which is improved governance. This includes different aspects of state building such as support to improve popular participation in the decision making process, and building capacity to improve government's accountability to its citizens. It also covers the encouragement of more pluralist and democratic political systems.</p>
	<p pid="b.1232W.0/2">Some funding decisions are still being taken, however, given the importance that DFID attaches to governance, I would expect the share of bilateral governance expenditure to be at least maintained at current levels, and probably increased. Based on figures for 2005&ndash;06 this suggests somewhere in the order of &pound;347 million or 13.9 per cent. of the total bilateral spend.</p>
	<p pid="b.1232W.0/3">In addition, DFID provides funding to a number of multilateral institutions such as the European Development Fund, World Bank, United Nations Agencies and Regional Development Banks, and this is pooled with other donors. In many cases these institutions support a range of activities, including governance. The UK share of this is not tracked.</p>

In essence, if a scheme were assessed as scoring zero on any one of the relevant assessment criteria or scoring less than 75 per cent. of the total possible score on the relevant criteria then it would fail the test. Any such failure would cause the Government to consider changing the status of that scheme in respect of the level of assurance it would accept.</p>

	<p pid="b.1236W.5/1">The Government currently accept certificates from the Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification (PEFC) scheme as assurance of legal and sustainable timber sources. This acceptance is subject to the UK Government being satisfied that national forest certification schemes endorsed by PEFC are all applying the PEFC standard consistently in their own countries. A sample check has been undertaken to establish to position. The initial findings led the Government to conclude that further examination and consultation should be undertaken before reaching a decision and that the forthcoming review of PEFC and the other schemes assessed by the Central Point of Expertise on Timber would provide an appropriate opportunity to do that.</p>
	<p pid="b.1236W.5/2">The Government cannot ensure that PEFC includes mandatory and enforceable minimum standards for all its national members.

	<p pid="b.1237W.3/1">The outstanding issues relate to the decision making process for forest management standard setting as adopted by the national schemes that have been endorsed by the Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification (PEFC). The PEFC Council's new requirement for standard setting is that</p>
	<p pid="b.1237W.3/2" class="indent">&quot;The formal approval of standards shall be based on evidence of consensus&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.1237W.3/3">An initial examination of some of the national schemes showed that the various national decision making processes were not identical. Subsequent information supplied by the schemes indicated that the processes adopted may nevertheless result in compliance with the PEFC Council requirements but the situation was not at all clear-cut and called for more examination.</p>
	<p pid="b.1237W.3/4">Another factor considered was the impending review of all the forest certification schemes assessed by CPET in 2004. The Government has decided that this review will, in addition to examining published scheme requirements, consider evidence of failure to adopt scheme system requirements. A decision now on PEFC's probationary status may be overturned following the review. That would create significant confusion in the market place and loss of credibility for the CPET assessment process.</p>
	<p pid="b.1237W.3/5">The UK Government was mindful of the implications any ill judged decision would have on all the stakeholders involved and was anxious to be as objective and fair as possible. Consequently, the decision was to postpone making a decision on PEFC's probationary status until after the review of schemes scheduled for late spring 2006.</p>

	<p pid="b.1238W.2/1">75 of the 80 equine data supplier organisations are already providing the compulsory passport data and some voluntary data. It is in the voluntary data that the value of National Equine Database (NED), and its use to the public, lies&mdash;to enable the combination of pedigree and performance data to inform the breeding and buying public so that they can purchase horses and make breeding decisions with a greater degree of confidence.</p>
	<p pid="b.1238W.2/2">NED already holds over 673,000 records, however we do need more pedigree data in NED if the on-line services are to be launched on schedule later this year. The Industry/Government partnership delivering NED is in direct contact with the few breed societies yet to supply pedigree data, with a view to helping them come to a decision to provide this information this summer. Personal presentations on the benefit of NED to the industry and NED Newsletters have proved an excellent tool to promote NED&mdash;see <a href="http://www.ned.uk.com">www.ned.uk.com</a> for information.</p>
	<p pid="b.1238W.2/3">We are planning an extensive marketing campaign to inform the equestrian public of the value of NED and its relevance to their particular interests. This will begin in August, leading to the launch of <a href="http://www.nedonline.co.uk">www.nedonline.co.uk</a>, which is scheduled for end October.</p>

In addition, it was announced in the 2005 Pre-Budget Report that an additional &pound;300 million would be made available to tackle fuel poverty across the UK over the 2005&ndash;08 period.

	<p pid="b.1247W.3/1">As of <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-21">21 April 2006</phrase>, the Home Office operates 40 websites.</p>
	<p pid="b.1247W.3/2">The core Home Office website also has a number of sub-domains, such as police.homeoffice.gov.uk, which act as portal sites for practitioners around policy issues.</p>
	<p pid="b.1247W.3/3">After a major redevelopment in September 2005, which brought nine separate websites under the main Home Office domain, a plan is under way to consolidate all of our sites by March 2007.</p>

The information requested about numbers of reports published on the internet in March 2006&mdash;and also made available in paper copy&mdash;can therefore not be collected without incurring disproportionate cost.</p>

	<p pid="b.1250W.11/3">No separate estimate has been made of the costs of bridging the gap between education inside and outside prisons. The new providers being appointed by the Learning and Skills Council are required contractually to deliver the requirements of the Offender's Learning Journey, the document that specifies the service to the offender. That document includes a requirement on the provider to join up learning commenced in custody with that available in the community. The costs of bridging that gap are straightforwardly part of the contract price.</p>

The Government welcomes ideas such as visits from Commissioners as part of the Plan D programme.

It is not possible to give a time series back to 1997/98 using the whole year count for all years, so the snapshot count has been used for consistency.

	<p pid="b.1259W.2/2">The LSC is currently in the process of consulting staff and making appointments to posts in the new structure. The final number of staff who leave the LSC as a result of the restructuring will depend to a significant degree on individual circumstances. The LSC is looking for every opportunity to redeploy staff to other suitable positions and has expressed its commitment to maximise the appointments of existing employees and to minimise compulsory redundancies.</p>
	<p pid="b.1259W.2/3">The cost of potential redundancies resulting from the restructuring of the LSC depends upon the individual circumstances of each person affected. The current estimate is that the cost of redundancies will be around &pound;32 million.</p>

In this second year of transition from the old arrangements to the new it is possible to identify separately the funding for vocational training, but that is unlikely to be possible for future years.</p>

	<p pid="b.1262W.5/2">A recent survey was conducted by the Voluntary Sector Unit of the National Offender Management Unit. This did not focus specifically on organisations engaged in delivering education but these were included among those delivering employment, training and education (ETE). This shows that as of February 2006 there were 583 organisations delivering ETE across the prison and probation services, of which 450 were working with prisons.</p>
	<p pid="b.1262W.5/3">Most of these organisations are small and work at a very local level. Funding is already provided to a number of organisations through grants and contracts and it is anticipated that the introduction of full commissioning in NOMS will increase the range of opportunities available to the voluntary and community sector. There are already established recognition schemes such as the Butler Trust which has included awards to organisations providing education services to prisons.</p>

UK personnel have also deployed from within the NATO Command Structure to help co-ordinate the lift of national contingents, as liaison staff at the African Union (AU) headquarters in Addis Ababa and to provide capacity building training for AMIS staff. Further NATO-hatted UK staffs are likely to be deployed in the event that the AU requests additional NATO support.

	<p pid="b.1269W.3/1">There is no factual evidence to either support or discount an uncommanded flying control movement of 12 degree nose pitch down by RAF Chinook ZD576 prior to impact into the Mull of Kintyre. There is, however, the physical evidence at the crash site and wreckage characteristics which indicate that the aircraft first impacted the hillside while climbing at relatively high forward ground speed in an erect, steeply nose up attitude. The evidence for this is the alignment of the aircraft controls. The collective control, which controls power was set at or near full travel at impact, with the cyclic control, which controls pitch or elevation, at 25 per cent. aft and 23 per cent. left of neutral, all indicating a demand for high power and nose-up attitude prior to impact.</p>

	<p pid="b.1269W.6/1">Autorotation is defined as the unpowered rotation of helicopter rotor blades that may occur during engine failure, thereby allowing the aircraft to effectively 'glide' to a safe landing. The minimum height at which autorotation is considered safe for a Chinook HC2 is 100 ft above ground level. Weight has no significant impact on autorotation flight performance. However, practice autorotations for Chinooks are not allowed to be carried out above the regulatory maximum weight of 20,000 kg.</p>

	<p pid="b.1273W.8/1">In 1983, the Ministry of Defence commissioned from the National Radiological Protection Board and Imperial Cancer Research Fund an independent epidemiological study of participants of the UK atmospheric nuclear tests, including those present at the 1958 Christmas Island tests. The study compared a representative group of over 20,000 participants with a control group of men who did not take part in the tests but were otherwise similar. Analyses of mortality and cancer incidence in the groups have been published in the peer-reviewed mainstream medical literature in 1988, 1993 and 2003. These studies showed that overall mortality and cancer incidence was similar both in the participant and control groups and lower than the UK national rate, The 1988 study suggested a slightly raised level of multiple myeloma in participants compared with controls. However, this was not confirmed in the 1993 and 2003 reports and is likely to have been due to chance. There does appear, from all three studies, to be a small increased risk of leukaemias in test participants, apart from chronic lymphatic leukaemia, especially in the early years after the test. The MOD has not formally assessed the health of offspring of UK atmospheric nuclear test participants and is unaware of any such studies in the international published peer-reviewed medical or scientific literature.</p>

Different organisations undertake submarine and surface ship build and support, even though skills and facilities cross over in some areas.</p>
	<p pid="b.1275W.5/2">We further recognised that Industrial restructuring and consolidation is a priority and fundamental to creating a viable and sustainable maritime industrial base; one that retains in the UK those technologies, infrastructure, skills, Intellectual Property and capacity needed to ensure appropriate sovereignty. The aim is to encourage greater efficiency and profitability within the industry, while maximising the opportunities for exports, in order to meet the anticipated demand for ensuring in future that the UK's armed forces are provided with the equipment they need, on time, and at best value for money.</p>
	<p pid="b.1275W.5/3">Having stated the case for streamlining the business, it is not for Government to micromanage the industrial restructuring. However we recognise that as the predominant client we must be confident that consolidation will be beneficial to Ministry of Defence and industry. We expect to be consulted early and are likely to express preferences as any approaches emerge.</p>

	<p pid="b.1280W.5/2">Contingent liabilities are reported in government accounts and to Parliament. They are defined as being contingent on an event, or a set of events, whose likelihood of occurring has been judged as remote.

	<p pid="b.1289W.0/1">We announced in &quot;Opportunity Age&quot; our intention to pilot a LinkAge Plus service, providing a fully integrated service for older people. The Social Exclusion Unit Report 'A Sure Start to Later Life' also proposed a new approach to delivering services to and for older people, building on the principles of the Sure Start model for children and families, LinkAge Plus will deliver this service.</p>
	<p pid="b.1289W.0/2">The programme will test ways of delivering fully integrated services for older people&mdash;from employment, health and benefits to leisure and learning.

	<p pid="b.1289W.0/3">The whole programme is overseen by a steering group drawn from a range of central government, voluntary sector and local government organisations. In fact, the whole programme is based on partnership working&mdash;with older people, national key stakeholder organisations and agencies, local authorities and Government Departments, all playing a crucial role.</p>
	<p pid="b.1289W.0/4">The programme plans to run up to eight pilots in England and a number of local authorities are currently helping to develop the 'LinkAge Plus' concept further and advise on how it can be delivered practically on the ground. One of these local authorities is Leeds City Council. Final announcements on the programme will be made shortly, including details of final pilot selection. We anticipate that the first pilot will start in July.</p>

	<p pid="b.1292W.3/1">The Disability Discrimination Act 2005 placed new duties on public authorities to promote equality for disabled people, 'the Disability Equality Duty'. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister (ODPM) is working closely with the Disability Rights Commission as a pathfinder Government Department while it develops its disability equality scheme over the next few months. The partnership should help ODPM to develop a high quality disability equality scheme, develop best practice to share with other Government Departments, and provide experience for the Disability Rights Commission on implementing the duty.</p>
	<p pid="b.1292W.3/2">In 2004 ODPM carried out a benchmarking exercise developed by the Employers Forum on Disability, to find out more about the problems faced by disabled people in the Department. As a result, a disability action plan was developed. Most of the actions from the plan are underway, and over half have already been completed, such as a major consultation with disabled staff, guidance on organising accessible events and improved building access. Other actions taken by ODPM to help it prepare for the Disability Equality Duty include:</p>
	<p pid="b.1292W.3/3" class="indent">The screening of ODPM policies and functions to ensure that they promote equality of opportunity for disabled people;</p>
	<p pid="b.1292W.3/4" class="indent">Engaging with ODPM stakeholders to help ensure compliance with the duty;</p>
	<p pid="b.1292W.3/5" class="indent">The delivery of a consultation implementation plan, following a major consultation of disabled staff in ODPM;</p>
	<p pid="b.1292W.3/6" class="indent">Organising of a series of seminars on making events accessible to disabled people;</p>
	<p pid="b.1292W.3/7" class="indent">The development of an evidence base to support implementation of the duty.</p>
	<p pid="b.1292W.3/8">Implementing the Disability Equality Duty within local government is a matter for the local authorities. However ODPM has commissioned a study which examined the extent to which local authorities are implementing the Disability Discrimination Act (DDA) in ways that promote and support the social inclusion of disabled people. The findings of this study should help local authorities fulfil their duties under the Act. My senior officials and I have also spoken at conferences held by the Disability Rights Commission on the importance of the duty to local authorities.</p>
	<p pid="b.1292W.3/9">Other actions taken by my Department to help promote equality for disabled people include the following:</p>
	<p pid="b.1292W.3/10" class="indent">Removing the means test for families of disabled children who apply for Disabled Facilities Grant;</p>
	<p pid="b.1292W.3/11" class="indent">Incorporating disability accessibility standards into the new Code for Sustainable Buildings;</p>
	<p pid="b.1292W.3/12" class="indent">Together with the Department for Work and Pensions and the Department of Health, piloting individualised budgets for disabled people by bringing together sources of funding, services, equipment and adaptations;</p>

A composite hereditament comprises both non-domestic and domestic elements. Dwellings are listed in the Valuation List but a corresponding entry may not appear in the Rating List if the non-domestic part is exempt, for instance a farm or market garden.

	<p pid="b.1295W.9/2">Monitoring of the costs of agenda for change in 28 sample sites in 2005 suggested that in the first 12 months from October 2004 to September 2005 direct earnings costs exceeded those originally estimated by 0.5 per cent., of the agenda for change pay bill, or around &pound;120 million a year in cash terms. In the same period, this data suggested that the indirect earnings costs of replacing additional hours and leave arising from agenda for change exceeded those originally estimated by at least &pound;100 million a year. An exercise was subsequently carried out by strategic health authority (SHA) finance directors in late 2005 to validate these effects. This broadly confirmed the findings from the sample site monitoring in terms of the overall effect, although there were significant variations between SHAs.</p>
	<p pid="b.1295W.9/3">The funding envelope for agenda for change is &pound;1.4 billion in 2006&ndash;07 and &pound;1.8 billion in 2007&ndash;08, an increase of &pound;440 million and &pound;830 million respectively over 2005&ndash;06. Actual costs for 2006&ndash;07, 2007&ndash;08 and 2008&ndash;09 will depend to a significant extent on experience of the operation of the new agenda for change pay progression arrangements and matters are being kept under review.</p>

	<p pid="b.1296W.8/2">NHS Blood and Transplant (NHSBT) is responsible for managing blood supplies in England and north Wales and for managing the British Bone Marrow Register (BBMR). It does this through its operating division&mdash;the National Blood Service (NBS). The NBS recruits blood donors from the general public and potential bone marrow donors from the active blood donor populations.</p>
	<p pid="b.1296W.8/3">Over the last three years, the NBS has added over 100,000 people to the BBMR. The NBS's strategy over the coming year is to maintain the BBMR at its current size and focus their recruitment activity towards under represented ethnic groups.</p>
	<p pid="b.1296W.8/4">In 2004 the NBS commissioned the Central Office of Information (COI) to lead on a long-term strategy to attract more people from ethnic communities to give blood and join the BBMR. A campaign called &quot;One Blood&quot; is addressing existing barriers by</p>

	<p pid="b.1298W.2/1">NHS Connecting for Health has never had a contract with ComMedica.</p>
	<p pid="b.1298W.2/2">ComMedica was selected as a sub-contractor to provide picture archiving and communications services (PACS) for the national programme for information technology's North West and West Midlands regional cluster area, under contract to the CSC consortium, in September 2004. CSC is one of four supplier organisations that have contracts as local service providers (LSPs) with NHS Connecting for Health under the national programme.</p>
	<p pid="b.1298W.2/3">The role of the LSPs is to integrate existing local systems, and where necessary implement new systems, to ensure that the programme's national applications can be delivered locally in each of the five cluster areas. They do this largely through contracts with sub-contractor companies such as ComMedica providing, for example, hardware, software and consultancy support. NHS Connecting for Health's contractual relationship is with the LSPs.</p>
	<p pid="b.1298W.2/4">CSC is negotiating with another company for the supply of a PACS solution in the North West and West Midlands cluster area as a result of repeated failure by ComMedica to deliver its solution to agreed deadlines. This company will deploy its PACS product within the next three months. NHS Connecting for Health has not incurred, and will not in future incur, any additional financial costs as a result of this change of provider.</p>

	<p pid="b.1299W.2/2">Systems and services delivered through the national programme for information technology incorporate stringent security controls and safeguards to prevent unrestricted or uncontrolled access to personal information. Access is controlled via a unique user identity, involving a passcode and smartcard, which can be obtained only on verification of identity and through a formal user registration process. Only those National health service staff having a legitimate relationship with the patient will be able to see a patient's health record, and under arrangements known as role based access control, access to a patient's care record is limited to only as much information as is needed for the purpose of the care or other job role being performed in relation to the patient.</p>
	<p pid="b.1299W.2/3">In addition, up-to-the-minute security protection has been designed in, across the system, and international security standards are applied across all system implementations. These include the use of encryption to communication links between systems, and to user interfaces with systems. The quality of both the logical and physical security of data centres is assured using both international and British standards, and all suppliers to the national programme are contractually bound to auditing their adherence to these.</p>
	<p pid="b.1299W.2/4">Over and above these implemented safeguards, the NHS maintains an effective liaison with the United Kingdom's information security authorities and others for the sharing of relevant advice and guidance on known information security threats and vulnerabilities.</p>

First published in 2004, over 130,000 have so far been ordered, and they have recently been reprinted.

	<p pid="b.1306W.3/1">The Department does not specifically collect data on the number of patients injured and dying as a result of slipping and falling on shiny non-slip floors.</p>
	<p pid="b.1306W.3/2">The National Patient Safety Agency administers the national reporting and learning system (NRLS) which collects reports of patient safety incidents across all care settings. The current NRLS was developed during 2002 and by December 2004, all national health service organisations in England and Wales were able to report into the system.</p>
	<p pid="b.1306W.3/3">A search of NRLS data was conducted using the term slips on non-slip surfaces. No incidents involving slips on non-slip surfaces were identified prior to January 2004. During the period <phrase class="date" code="2004-01-01">1 January 2004</phrase> to <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-01">1 January 2006</phrase>, four such incidents were identified. The degree of harm reported was either low or no harm. No incidents of serious harm or deaths were reported. The figures do not include patient falls where matting or other surfaces were involved.</p>

	<p pid="b.1306W.6/1">Total Purchasing: &quot;A Profile of National Pilot Projects&quot;, was published in January 1997 and provided a preliminary assessment of how total purchasing was implemented in the 53 first wave projects in England and Scotland. Although the study was funded by the Department and the then Scottish Office, the views expressed in the report were those of the King's Fund who conducted the research and not necessarily those of the Department. A copy has been placed in the Library.</p>

	<p pid="b.1307W.2/1">The Government agreed to implement the European working time directive (WTD) as United Kingdom legislation to improve the health and safety and working lives of all employees in this country. The vast majority of staff groups have been covered by the 48-hour week since 1998. The Government negotiated an extension to the WTD for doctors in training to enable phased implementation from August 2004. There have been significant increases in staffing levels across all professional groups, grades and disciplines in recent years which has contributed to supporting implementation.</p>
	<p pid="b.1307W.2/2">While implementation of the WTD is the responsibility of local national health service trusts the Department of Health in England worked with the health professions and NHS employers to provide joint guidance and invested an extra &pound;46 million to support implementation, including 20 national pilots and the hospital at night project.</p>
