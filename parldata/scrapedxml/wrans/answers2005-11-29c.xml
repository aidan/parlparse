The Army Prosecuting Authority (APA) was established under the Armed Forces Act 1996 and acts independently of the military chain of command. As an additional measure of protection from interference, the APA is subject to the general superintendence of the Attorney-General but he is not responsible for taking decisions on individual prosecutions. There is nothing unusual about this practice which takes place with the other prosecutors superintended by the Attorney-General, for example, the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS), Serious Fraud Office, Revenue and Customs Prosecution Office, and the Public Prosecution Office Northern Ireland.</p>

Our policies on emissions are intended to contribute to an emission reduction of 60 per cent. by developed countries by 2050 leading to eventual stabilisation of atmospheric concentrations at below 550 parts per million, provided others take commensurate action.</p>

Individual plumbers are employed by firms operating in both the domestic and commercial markets. Depending on the nature of their work and skills level, some would be more appropriately referred to as heating engineers. Especially in the domestic market, many plumbers are self-employed and may operate at a very local, or neighbourhood level.</p>

	<p pid="c.298W.8/2">The Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA) ceased operating in Iraq at the end of June 2004, at which point control of the Development Fund for Iraq (DPI) was transferred to the sovereign Government of Iraq. We continue to encourage the transparent management of public funds by the Iraqi Government.</p>
	<p pid="c.298W.8/3">The UK is providing economic technical assistance to the Iraqi Government to improve the transparency and management of public expenditure through reforms to the budget cycle. A team of UK-funded advisers also works closely with the Iraqi Ministry of Finance on essential reforms to the subsidy system which will help to improve transparency in public funds. The UK is also helping to build up the capacity of the Prime Minister's Office, the Iraqi Cabinet Office, the Ministry of Interior, and the southern Provincial Councils. This work is supporting the development of an effective Iraqi civil service which is able to administer public funds in a more accountable way. Earlier this year the National Audit Office hosted a study tour for the Iraqi Supreme Board of Audit to compare current practices. In addition, the UK is encouraging Iraq to sign up to the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative and to the UN Convention for Anti-Corruption.</p>
	<p pid="c.298W.8/4">The role of the International Advisory and Monitoring Board (IAMB) is to act as an audit oversight body for DPI. Its purpose is to help ensure that the DPI is used in a transparent manner for the benefit of the people of Iraq and that export sales of petroleum, petroleum products, and natural gas from Iraq are consistent with prevailing international market best practices. IAMB membership includes representatives from the International Monetary Fund, World Bank, UN Secretary General's Office, Arab Fund for Economic and Social Development and Iraq's Ministry of Finance. External audits of the IAMB have been carried out by KPMG, The UK is not directly involved with the IAMB.</p>

Restrictions on access and freedom of worship there are one of the many negative consequences of the Israeli restrictions on movement in the West Bank and Jerusalem. Israel has a right to protect its citizens from terrorist attacks but it also has a duty to ensure the effect of its security measures on the Palestinian population are minimised. We will continue to raise this concern at all levels with the Israeli Government.

	<p pid="c.302W.5/1">We remain seriously concerned about the situation in Darfur. Although the African Union (AU) monitoring force has expanded and is increasingly effective, there are reports of tribal clashes as well as skirmishes within the Sudan Liberation army, and ongoing banditry. In his latest report on Darfur, the UN Secretary-General, Kofi Annan, notes that September and October recorded a rise in the number of people being killed. We continue to press the parties to rein in their fighters and to reach a political agreement within the UN Security Council's deadline of the end of the year. We have also made clear that those who are responsible for attacks must be held to account.</p>
	<p pid="c.302W.5/2">It is only through political negotiation that a sustainable solution to the conflict will be found. The AU led talks in Abuja provide a political process and are making steady progress, although there is still a long way to go, particularly given rebel divisions. We are firmly committed to the Abuja process and are pushing for the negotiations to be better structured so as to have maximum impact on the immediate security situation on the ground. We have a UK observer at the talks, to support both the mediation and the parties and to provide technical assistance if needed.</p>

There is strong liaison across the Departments both at ministerial and official level to ensure co-ordinated policy. Defra has responsibility for the role biomass and biofuels can play in sustainable development, climate change, air quality and rural issues. The Department of Trade and Industry is responsible for the overall renewable energy policy, new technology and industry development and sponsorship. The Department for Transport is responsible for transport policy and the promotion of low carbon fuels, including the Biofuels Directive and the Renewable Transport Fuels Obligation.

Section 193 of the Law of Property Act 1925 is one of the enactments listed in section 15.

	<p pid="c.307W.5/1">The Access Management Grant Scheme was introduced to support access authorities (outside National Parks) in meeting the start-up costs in managing the new right of public access under the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000.</p>
	<p pid="c.307W.5/2">The right of access has now been commenced across England, and the Grant Scheme is due to come to an end for access authorities in mapping areas one to five in March 2006, and for remaining authorities in March 2007.</p>
	<p pid="c.307W.5/3">On-going access management, and infrastructure maintenance costs, should be much lower than the initial start-up costs. However, I have asked the Countryside Agency to advise me as to whether there would be any benefit in extending the scheme for a further year. This would allow access authorities to benefit from three years worth of funding. The Agency is currently consulting access authorities and other stakeholders and I hope to make a decision in spring next year.</p>

Before making any regulations covering the review of conclusive maps we need to consider how the review process ought to work. Both Defra and the Countryside Agency are currently undertaking lessons learned exercises and the outcome of these will help inform our decisions on the review process. We aim to undertake consultation on our proposals for the review of conclusive maps during the course of next year.</p>

	<p pid="c.308W.2/1">Forests cover 30 to 40 per cent. of the earth's land area and provide several essential ecosystem services. For example, forests act as sinks for the world's terrestrial carbon stores, absorbing the carbon dioxide that is contributing to climate change. Forests are the repository of the great bulk of terrestrial biodiversity; regulate water cycles; maintain soil quality and reduce the risks of natural disasters such as floods.</p>
	<p pid="c.308W.2/2">There is a vast amount of existing research on the environmental impacts of deforestation which guides UK policy. The UK Government remains in regular discussions with a number of international organisations that undertake significant forestry research such as the UN's Food and Agricultural Organisation (FAO), as well as spending about &pound;20 million a year on forestry through country programmes and centrally funded research.</p>
	<p pid="c.308W.2/3">Defra is engaged in several areas. For example under Defra's contract with the Hadley Centre for Climate Prediction and Research, Defra has commissioned work on the consequences of deforestation for the climate at local, regional and global scales. Defra also funds a range of forestry projects under the Darwin Initiative which helps developing countries to monitor biodiversity impacts and build capacity for conservation.</p>

In the event of temporary tightness in the gas supply market there is no limit on fuel switching and the carbon market provides industry with the flexibility to source further allowances if energy intensive users exceed their emissions cap.</p>

	<p pid="c.312W.2/1">The table shows projected UK greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and percentage reductions during the commitment period obtained by assuming that the linear trend in emissions of the last <i>(a)</i> five years, <i>(b)</i> four years, <i>(c)</i> three years, <i>(d)</i> two years and <i>(e)</i> one year continue, based on the most recent published UK Greenhouse Gas Inventory data, which cover the period 1990 to 2003 and using the provisional 2004 estimate.</p>
	<p pid="c.312W.2/2">In the Government's view the provisional estimate for 2004 is very unsuitable for the analysis requested. This is because, under the calculation method proposed, the additional uncertainty (+/-1%) associated with the final provisional data point enters in to all the estimates and is magnified by the projection process to form an uncertainty of between +7&ndash;2 and of +/-6 percentage points over the Kyoto commitment period.</p>
	<p pid="c.312W.2/3">In addition, in comparison with the results already presented, the difference in projected percentage reduction due to shifting the base year of projection from 2003 inventory data to 2004 provisional estimates ranges between 1 and 12 percentage points.</p>

	<p pid="c.317W.3/1">Prior to the implementation of the latest round of CAP reform and the introduction of the Single Payment Scheme, my Department commissioned assessments on possible impacts of decoupling on a range of sectors, including suckler cows in the uplands. These suggest that suckler cow production is expected to decrease as a result of CAP reform.</p>
	<p pid="c.317W.3/2">Assessments have also been made on possible environmental impacts which reveal that grazing by cattle plays an important role in the maintenance of heather moor land, an important habitat for biodiversity. It is for this reason my officials have submitted to the European Commission for approval, the inclusion of payments within the Environmental Stewardship schemes to provide incentives for appropriate cattle grazing in the uplands.</p>
	<p pid="c.317W.3/3">All of these assessments are, understandably, speculative and the agricultural and environmental impacts of the Single Payment Scheme will depend on a range of factors&mdash;not least the response of suckler beef farmers in their individual businesses. It is therefore too soon to predict categorically what the impacts will be.</p>

	<p pid="c.317W.6/1">DEFRA recognises the problems which can be caused by an increasing urban gull population. It is for this reason that my Department issues a general licence under section 16 of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 to allow the control of certain species of gulls by local authorities and other authorised persons where they are a threat to public health and safety. These birds include the following species of gulls&mdash;lesser black-backed gull, greater black-backed gull and the herring gull. However, licences cannot be issued to control gulls where they are merely causing a nuisance and to do so would be in breach of the EU Birds Directive.</p>
	<p pid="c.317W.6/2">DEFRA is in regular contact with the Central Science Laboratory (CSL) and has recently been provided with a preliminary evaluation of the issues involved and current state of knowledge on the problems caused by gulls.

	<p pid="c.324W.5/1">Before giving the scheme provisional approval in 2002, the Department commissioned an audit of the project costs. No further audit has been undertaken since then.</p>
	<p pid="c.324W.5/2">The Department made it clear in December 2002 that our contribution was capped at &pound;170 million. Any contingency for funding above this level was for the promoters to assess and to fund.</p>
	<p pid="c.324W.5/3">Merseytravel submitted a final bid for Merseytram Line 1 in November 2004, and further advised on the costs in May 2005. In considering Merseytravel's bid, the Department considered whether the scheme offered value for money, taking into account the total costs of the scheme, including an allowance for risk. For this purpose, the Department took Merseytravel's estimate of the cost of the scheme, including Merseytravel's proposed contingency provision and 6 per cent. optimism bias uplift. The Department considered that the 6 per cent. optimism bias uplift would probably be reasonable at the point of contract signing, but also considered the impact of a 15 per cent. uplift on the benefit cost ratio.</p>
	<p pid="c.324W.5/4">Following that consideration, the Secretary of State announced on <phrase class="date" code="2005-06-13">13 June</phrase> that the Government would not increase its funding for the scheme, but that &pound;170 million remained available if the scheme could be delivered for that cost. It has been for the promoters to consider what contingency funding they need in the light of that statement.</p>

An independent report, funded by the Association of British Bookmakers, by European Economics and MORI was published in April 2005 and subjected to DCMS commissioned peer review. It found no evidence to suggest FOBTs led to an increase in problem gambling. A second study is due to be published by the end of the year and will again be subjected to the same level of scrutiny. The Gambling Commission will undertake prevalence studies into gambling every three years which will enable the Government to scrutinise trends in British gambling habits.

	<p pid="c.335W.8/2">Employment in the Regular armed forces is open to citizens of Commonwealth countries and Republic of Ireland nationals as well as British citizens; all applicants are given equal consideration and all have to meet the same basic entry standards. The armed forces do not actively recruit overseas with the exception of Gurkhas from Nepal. However, in recent years the Royal Navy and the Army have sent selection teams to some Commonwealth countries at the specific request of the Government concerned, and only then when evidence suggests that there is sufficient interest among the local population to merit a visit. The selection teams screen out those who are not thought capable of meeting the full entry standards, to save them the cost of an abortive trip to the UK to undergo the recruitment process. The costs incurred as a result of the selection team visits were as follows:</p>

	<p pid="c.336W.2/2">Changes have been made in the way RAF Harrier aircraft are supported. Primarily these changes relate to the concentration of aircraft maintenance, including Harrier GR7 to GR9 upgrade, at RAF Cottesmore, and the introduction of more effective and efficient processes. Together these will deliver savings of &pound;44 million over financial years 2005&ndash;06 to 2008&ndash;09. Similar changes in the way RAF Tornado GR4 aircraft are maintained and upgraded are in the process of being implemented at RAF Marham. This will significantly streamline the overall logistics footprint for the Tornado GR4 fleet which in turn will contribute to the &pound;2 billion of efficiency savings to be delivered as part of the MOD's logistic transformation programme.</p>

	<p pid="c.342W.11/1">We are unable to quantify this cost. The Government recognised that the increase in the rate applicable to trusts and the dividend trust rate from <phrase class="date" code="2004-04-06">6 April 2004</phrase> could have an impact on trusts with vulnerable beneficiaries, especially those set up for disabled and minor children who have suffered the death of a parent. We therefore introduced the special tax regime for such trusts in Finance Act 2005.</p>
	<p pid="c.342W.11/2">We consulted widely before introducing the regime and, in consultation, including with groups representing the disabled, the consensus was to use the existing, generous definition from within the Taxes Acts that already works well within the tax system and relies on qualification for Department for Work and Pensions benefits.</p>

The Government of Pakistan and international relief effort is focussed on providing shelter and other assistance to those who choose to remain above the snow line and also providing camps for those relocating to lower altitudes. The immediate priorities are to deliver shelter materials with warm rooms&quot; to remove the risks of exposure and provide water and sanitation interventions for the camps to prevent the spread of disease. The emergency shelter programme involves mobile outreach teams providing material and technical support for the construction of warm rooms&quot; for families above the snow line.

	<p pid="c.358W.3/1">There is a distinction between the World Health Organisation's Roll Back Malaria Department and Roll Back Malaria Partnership: The Roll Back Malaria Department of the World Health Organisation (WHO) is responsible for the co-ordination of the WHO'S global efforts on malaria. As part of the HIV/AIDS, TB and malaria cluster, the Roll Back Malaria Department reports progress using standard WHO results-based management systems, primarily against the organisation's programme budget. During 2004, DFID conducted an assessment of the WHO's effectiveness; the results concluded that the WHO was working towards better strategic planning, organisational efficiency and improved accountability for results.</p>
	<p pid="c.358W.3/2">At the World Health Assembly this year, member states commended the WHO for the progress it is making in implementing results-based management across the organisation, which now provides greater transparency and accountability.</p>
	<p pid="c.358W.3/3">The Roll Back Malaria Partnership (RBM) is a global initiative against malaria which provides a co-ordinated international approach for joint action to tackle the global burden of malaria. The WHO, the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the World Bank launched the RBM Partnership in 1998. The WHO is an important partner of RBM, which is housed within the WHO's Malaria Department.</p>
	<p pid="c.358W.3/4">The UK, as a board member of the partnership is working with partners to address a number of issues concerning the effectiveness of RBM Partnership which includes accountability and transparency. DFID has supported RBM Partnership to develop a five-year global strategic plan and a two-year work plan to assist with greater accountability and transparency by setting out clearly the goals and responsibilities of the partnership. We have also supported the Partnership Forum where the partnership is accountable to many additional stakeholders; the most recent forum was held in Cameroon in November. In addition, the UK has pushed for greater transparency on the way the partnership operates and, as a result, most RBM materials are now available on the website. We will continue to push for more transparency in development of technical guidance by the WHO.</p>
	<p pid="c.358W.3/5">The third and final High Level Forum for Health met in November in Paris. Participants encouraged RBM and other global health partnerships to adopt and implement a set of best practice principles. Four of the 21 principles deal with accountability and transparency. We will be looking to ensure that these principles are endorsed by the RBM Board.</p>

	<p pid="c.359W.2/1">There are no plans to redevelop St. Helena. Last March, however, I announced proposals to build an airport and establish air services for the island by or around 2010. The commitment was subject to satisfactory contract bids and a rigorous environmental impact assessment. The project budget has not been made public, as to do so might prejudice competition for the airport design, build and operate&quot; contract. The cost of the airport will be additional to DFID's regular support for St. Helena, currently running at some &pound;14 million per annum.</p>
	<p pid="c.359W.2/2">St. Helena is also eligible for support from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) Good Governance&quot; and Economic Diversification&quot; programmes, plus a Governor's Delegated Fund&quot; and a joint DFID/FCO Overseas Territories Environmental Programme. Disbursements from those sources are expected to total around &pound;250,000 this year. Funds currently available to St. Helena from the European Union total over &pound;9 million, all of which St. Helena hopes to utilise over the next few years for improvements to its wharf facilities.</p>
	<p pid="c.359W.2/3">No private sector funding is envisaged for the airport. All private sector interest in St. Helena, however, will be welcome and considered on an equal footing. We are currently helping St. Helena to review its tourism and inward investment policies, following the decision to build an airport. The aim is for agreed policy to guide investment, and not vice versa.</p>

	<p pid="c.360W.2/1">Calculating the number of diarrhoea! deaths attributable to inadequate sanitation is not an easy task. Most of them occur in the homes of the poor in remote villages and ramshackle shanty-towns, without the knowledge of health care workers. Most can be attributed to multiple contributory causes including malnutrition, malaria, the aftermath of measles and contaminated water, as well as poor sanitation.</p>
	<p pid="c.360W.2/2">Roughly the same number of people in sub-Saharan Africa lack access to water supply (266 million) as lack sanitation (242 million); indeed, many people lack both.</p>
	<p pid="c.360W.2/3">The best available calculation is by the World Health Organisation (WHO), which estimates that 747,500 deaths a year in sub-Saharan Africa could be attributed to deficient water, sanitation and hygiene. The vast majority (99 per cent.) of these are deaths from diarrhoea, and nearly 90 per cent. of those who die are children less than five-years-old. This gives a figure of some 650,000 child diarrhoeal deaths a year due to poor water, sanitation and hygiene.</p>
	<p pid="c.360W.2/4">Looking to the future, if progress towards the Millennium Development Goal (MDG) is not accelerated we can expect the number of deaths to decrease very slightly each year, but at this rate we estimate that in 2092 34 per cent. of the population would still lack access to basic sanitation.</p>

	<p pid="c.379W.2/1">No assessment has been made by the Government of the need for fully trained lifeguards on public beaches in Northern Ireland, nor of the funding for this activity.</p>
	<p pid="c.379W.2/2">While most of the beaches in Northern Ireland are the responsibility of district councils, there is no statutory requirement on them to provide lifeguards along publicly used beaches.</p>
	<p pid="c.379W.2/3">However, I am aware that both Down district council and Newry and Mourne district council now have trained beach lifeguards stationed at Tyrella and Cranfield beaches respectively. In addition, I welcome the work being undertaken by Limavady, Coleraine, and Moyle councils and the National Trust to improve safety on their public beaches along the North Coast, by working in conjunction with a range of agencies including the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents; the Royal National Lifeboat Association; the Coastguard; the Ambulance Service for Northern Ireland; and the Royal Life Saving Society.</p>

	<p pid="c.390W.8/1">The Environment and Heritage Service (EHS) promotes the recycling of household waste in two main ways: grant support to district councils and through education and awareness programmes. Its work has yielded encouraging results, with the overall household recycling rate in Northern Ireland growing from 10 per cent. in 2002 to 18.9 per cent. in 2004&ndash;05. All district councils in Northern Ireland have increased their household recycling rates. Two district councils have achieved a household recycling rate of almost 40 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="c.390W.8/2">Since 2001, EHS has provided councils with &pound;36 million via the Waste Management Grant Scheme to help procure infrastructure and assist with operating costs associated with meeting their Waste Management Plans. In 2004&ndash;05, &pound;10 million was distributed under the scheme which will finish in 2006&ndash;07. Future support for councils will be reviewed in light of the new Waste Management Strategy which is currently out for consultation and is scheduled for publication in March 2006.</p>
	<p pid="c.390W.8/3">The Wake up to Waste&quot; campaign succeeded in raising the profile of waste management among the general public. EHS continues to reinforce the Reduce, Reuse, Recycle&quot; messages and develop new initiatives aimed at achieving behavioural change through education and awareness.</p>

	<p pid="c.390W.11/3" class="indent">You recently asked the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland a Parliamentary Question regarding how much funding was received from the European Parliament for the Streetwise Project of the Roads Service of Northern Ireland. I have been asked to reply as this issue falls within my responsibility as Chief Executive of Roads Service.</p>
	<p pid="c.390W.11/4" class="indent">Streetwise is one of seven Euro-Regional projects concerned with the provision of traffic control facilities and travel information across the Trans European Road Network (TERN). The projects have been in existence since 2001 and the current programme of funding by the European Union is due to finish at the end of 2006. Representatives from the seven projects meet frequently and there is an annual conference at which developments within the projects are highlighted. I understand the project chairpersons are working closely to ensure that European Funding for this work will continue post 2006.</p>
	<p pid="c.390W.11/5" class="indent">Funding from the European Union for the current project is provided to offset the costs of studies (50% funding) and implementation of facilities (8% funding). The balance of the costs is met from the national budgets of the project partners.</p>

	<p pid="c.400W.9/1">All new drugs applications, including insulins such as Novorapid are evaluated by the commission on human medicines (CHM), formerly the committee on safety of medicines (CSM) which advises the Licensing Authority as to whether a marketing authorisation should be granted. The applicant includes, in their submission, results of clinical trials conducted in the proposed indication for which the licence is sought. The first marketing authorisation for the recombinant human insulin was granted to NovoNordisk on <phrase class="date" code="1982-06-09">9 June 1982</phrase>. This application was considered by the expert biologicals sub-committee of the CSM, in March 1982 and subsequently by the main committee. The application for a new drug substance such as recombinant human insulin would have been scientifically and medically reviewed to ensure it satisfied the criteria for safety, quality and efficacy. Medicinal products, including human or animal insulin, will not be granted a marketing authorisation unless supporting data have been provided to demonstrate that the quality, safety and efficacy are satisfactory for the intended use. The type of clinical development programme, clinical trial data, that should support the registration of new medicinal products for the indication treatment of diabetes mellitus is detailed in European guidance documents, for example, notes for guidance on clinical investigation of medicinal products in the treatment of diabetes mellitus. CPMP/EWP/1080/00. These are read in conjunction with other pertinent European and International (ICH) clinical guidelines. The marketing authorisation applications are evaluated by the CSM before they are granted.</p>
	<p pid="c.400W.9/2">Data from clinical trials submitted at the time of licensing examined the safety and efficacy of the human insulin analogues (insulin glargine, insulin aspart, insulin detemir, insulin lispro and insulin gluisine) in diabetic patients treated for up to 12 months. A summary of the available data submitted in support of the licence applications for many of the insulin analogues is made publicly available in the form of a European Public Assessment Report.</p>
	<p pid="c.400W.9/3">The longer term safety of the use of human insulin analogues in routine clinical practice is monitored by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). Any possible new safety issue to emerge is evaluated and, if necessary, product information for prescribers and patients is updated to reflect the new data.</p>
	<p pid="c.400W.9/4">As with all medicines, reports of suspected adverse drug reactions (ADRs) to insulin analogues are collected by MHRA and CHM through the spontaneous reporting scheme, the Yellow Card scheme. A summary of the ADRs that have been received in association with a medicine, including insulin analogues, is available on the MHRA's website.</p>

	<p pid="c.406W.2/1">There is a difference between positional plagiocephaly, where flattening of the skull is caused by pressure from the surface on which a baby is customarily laid and craniosynostosis, where the cranial sutures have closed prematurely. In the latter case, surgery may well be necessary to prevent future health problems. The national service framework for children, young people and maternity services sets out standards to ensure that primary care trusts (PCTs) base decisions about treatments on the best evidence available to them. Treatment for plagiocephaly is available should doctors and PCTs consider it necessary.</p>

	<p pid="c.408W.0/1">The European-wide review of isotretinoin was completed in October 2003. This review was led by the United Kingdom and resulted in the harmonisation of the product information for prescribers, summary of product characteristics, throughout Europe. The review also developed a set of important principles for nationally agreed pregnancy prevention programmes.</p>
	<p pid="c.408W.0/2">Warnings about depression and suicide have been present in the product information for isotretinoin since 1997. Since the completion of the European review, the issue of psychiatric reactions associated with isotretinoin has been considered by an expert working group of the Committee on Safety of Medicines on two occasions in 2003 and 2005. The reviews by the expert group led to the product information being expanded to include warnings about the possibility of further psychiatric adverse reactions. During their review the expert group conducted a thorough assessment of all reports of suicidal behaviour received in association with isotretinoin. The patient information leaflet for isotretinoin currently includes extensive warnings about the potential psychiatric side effects associated with isotretinoin treatment.</p>
	<p pid="c.408W.0/3">Following the European review, the marketing authorisation holders for isotretinoin are required to submit annual periodic safety update reports (PSURs), more frequently than the three-yearly PSURs required by legislation for a product of this age. These PSURs contain a summary of all information on safety from any data source in the period of the report.</p>
	<p pid="c.408W.0/4">The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) Department's strategy on medicines for children was implemented in July 2004. As part of the strategy, the MHRA has been assessing clinical data in children for those medicines where such data are known to exist with a view to modifying the product information for these medicines where appropriate.</p>
	<p pid="c.408W.0/5">For isotretinoin, clinical data concerning its use in children was known to exist, as isotretinoin was included in the United States of America Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) list of active ingredients for which paediatric exclusivity had been granted. This data was obtained, and the MHRA assessment report of them was considered by the paediatric medicines working group of the Committee on Safety of Medicines. The assessment report has been published on the MHRA website.</p>
	<p pid="c.408W.0/6">The working group recommended that no changes to the product information for isotretinoin were necessary as a consequence of the review of this data. The group also recommended that the marketing authorisation holder should provide information regarding the adverse event reports received in children aged 13 to 17 years in future PSUR. These recommendations have been adopted by the MHRA.</p>
	<p pid="c.408W.0/7">The MHRA continually monitors the safety of isotretinoin and any new data, including that generated by research will be carefully considered and independent expert advice sought from the Commission on Human Medicines, which has replaced the Committee on Safety of Medicines and the Medicines Commission as the Government's independent expert advisory committee. Similarly all reports of suicidal behaviour associated with isotretinoin are carefully reviewed as part of the ongoing review of psychiatric reactions associated with isotretinoin.</p>

	<p pid="c.409W.3/3" class="indent">In reply to your recent Parliamentary Question about the Child Support Agency the Secretary of State promised a substantive reply from the Chief Executive.</p>
	<p pid="c.409W.3/4" class="indent">You asked the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, how many payments by absent parents have been written off as irrecoverable in each year since 1997; what the <i>(a)</i> average and <i>(b)</i> upper decile value of such payments is; and how many payments are in the upper decile.</p>
	<p pid="c.409W.3/5" class="indent">The Agency has no legislative power to write off debt, and current debt is now the cumulative total of 12 years. However for accounting purposes the Agency recognises that in some cases some debt is probably un-collectable&quot; (for example, where the non-resident parent is long-term unemployed, has gone abroad, or has died). The accounts are therefore adjusted accordingly.</p>
	<p pid="c.409W.3/6" class="indent">The cumulative total of probably un-collectable&quot; debt from 1997, as reported in the Agency's Annual Reports and Accounts, is summarised in the following table:</p>

	<p pid="c.409W.3/23" class="indent">The amounts stated as probably un-collectable in the accounts are based on a statistically valid sample and do not relate to specific cases.

	<p pid="c.410W.2/2">Lung cancer deaths caused by asbestos are clinically indistinguishable from those caused by other agents such as tobacco smoke and so cannot be tabulated directly.

	<p pid="c.418W.5/51">Notes:</p>
	<p pid="c.418W.5/52">1. A case is defined as cleared if a maintenance calculation has been carried out and a payment arrangement between the parent with care and the non resident parent is in place; a case has been identified as claiming Good Cause or is subject to a Reduced Benefit Decision; or the application is identified as being a change of circumstances on an existing case; or the case has been closed.</p>
	<p pid="c.418W.5/53">2. Figures exclude new scheme cases which have been progressed and cleared clerically. This is because it is not possible to determine how many clerically progressed cases are still included in the Agency's work in progress, or were originally included in the intake figures.</p>
	<p pid="c.418W.5/54">3. New scheme uncleared figures include cases transferred from Jobcentre Plus which are awaiting processing and input to the main CS2 computer system (some 81,000 cases). These figures may be subject to revision in future issues of these tables.</p>
	<p pid="c.418W.5/55">4. Percentage cases for whom maintenance is due who have made one or more payments via collection service, or had an initial maintenance direct arrangement in place is arrived at by summing number of cases receiving payment via collection service or on maintenance direct and expressing as a percentage of sum of collection service cases, those on maintenance direct and those with a calculation and no charging schedule.</p>
	<p pid="c.418W.5/56">5. Volumes are rounded to the nearest thousand, and percentages to nearest whole per cent.</p>
	<p pid="c.418W.5/57">6. Robust data from the new IT system (CS2) covering the period March 2003-December 2004 is not currently available, and is under development.</p>

	<p pid="c.420W.2/5" class="indent">In September 2005, the case compliance rate for collection service cases in which non-resident parent was classified as self-employed was 63%. This compares to an overall Agency case compliance rate of 70%.</p>

	<p pid="c.426W.2/1">Dealing with antisocial behaviour is a priority for the Safer Rother Partnership; the partnership was the first Crime and Disorder Reduction Partnership (CDRP) in the area to recruit a dedicated worker to support young people who are at risk of an antisocial behavioural order (ASBO) or acceptable behaviour contract (ABC) and those who have an ASBO or ABC to reduce the incidence of breaches. This worker works with all the agencies through a specific Joint Information Sharing Group that meets on a monthly basis to identify young people at risk of or involved in antisocial behaviour and/or criminal activity. This group identifies and carries out multi-agency work and diversionary interventions. Six ABCs and six ASBOs have been issued in Bexhill to date.</p>

	<p pid="c.427W.2/1">We are not aware of any rule to this effect. Restrictions on the use of evidence obtained abroad are found in section 9 of the Crime (International Co-operation) Act 2003. Section 9(2) says that evidence can be used only for the purposes for which it was obtained. A request should normally ask for evidence to be used for investigation, trial and any subsequent judicial proceedings (including of course an appeal). If that is done then the evidence can be used for the appeal. It is conceivable that a deficient letter of request might mention only the initial trial, in which case it might be insufficient to allow for the evidence to be used at an appeal. If this occurred, it could be rectified by sending a second letter or request for the purposes of the appeal.</p>
	<p pid="c.427W.2/2">Section 9(3) requires that the evidence be returned once it is no longer required. If evidence has been returned, or if it consisted of live witnesses, then a further letter of request may again be necessary for the purposes of the appeal.</p>

	<p pid="c.431W.11/1">In 2002 the Government provided North West Leicestershire with over 200,000 for crime reduction measures. This was used to set up the 'Retail Radio' system in Coalville and Ashby to provide immediate intelligence on business crime such as shoplifting, crime in a neighbouring shop and violence against a shopkeeper. The funding was also used to set up the PubWatch scheme in the same areas.</p>
	<p pid="c.431W.11/2">More widely, in 2001 &pound;15 million was given to the Small Retailers in Deprived Areas initiative (SRDA). Over the next three years, the SRDA helped 12,500 small businesses in the most deprived areas to improve security and introduce other crime prevention measures.</p>
	<p pid="c.431W.11/3">In January 2004, the Home Office established a Small Business Forum with members from a wide range of organisations to hear at first hand the particular crime problems small and medium sized enterprises face, and to develop and implement practical and effective measures to reduce those crimes.</p>
	<p pid="c.431W.11/4">Earlier this year we also provided nearly &pound;1 million to the Action Against Business Crime Group to help set up local business crime partnerships in town and shopping centres across England and Wales.</p>

	<p pid="c.437W.9/1">Of all cases identified and flagged as domestic violence by the police and passed to the CPS in Staffordshire, 1,268 were prosecuted in 2004&ndash;05. In the first quarter of 2005&ndash;06, there were 407 prosecutions and in the second quarter there were 524 prosecutions.</p>
	<p pid="c.437W.9/2">In their guidelines on investigating domestic violence, issued in November 2004, the Association of Chief Police Officers advised all forces to identify and flag domestic violence incidents. In April this year, the CPS also begun a campaign to encourage police and prosecutors to identify and flag cases. Therefore, there is a likely increase in the number of prosecutions identified as domestic violence from 2004&ndash;05 to the first two quarters of 2005&ndash;06 has been due to the embedding of this activity. There are no centrally collected figures prior to 2004&ndash;05.</p>

	<p pid="c.447W.2/1">The Hunting Act 2004 makes the use of dogs to hunt wild mammals illegal, subject to some tightly drawn exemptions. It does not prevent hunts from meeting and carrying out legal equestrian or hunting activities, such as hound exercise, pest control or trail hunting. Current information suggests that hunts are seeking to adapt to the requirements of the Act.</p>

	<p pid="c.450W.2/3">The process became statutory under the Police Reform Act of 2002 paragraph 51 and the Independent Custody Visitors codes of practice place obligations on police authorities (paragraphs 60&ndash;64 of the codes of practice) to record, publish information relating to visits and review performance at a local level.</p>

	<p pid="c.460W.12/1">The decision to close the Leyhill arts and gardens centre was taken because of a significant fall in income. The centre is now a burden on Leyhill's budget and is affecting its ability to deliver core work. While income generation is not the sole purpose of the centre, the opportunities for prisoner employment and the development of community links are not significant enough to override the financial impact.</p>
	<p pid="c.460W.12/2">Most of the market garden glasshouses will be relocated to the prison estate on the closure of the site, removing the impact of closure on prisoner employment. Work opportunities should increase as a wider range of prisoners can be allocated to this work within the main prison. Opportunities for contact between prisoners and the public will be replicated through outside placements. It is anticipated that training will not be impeded by the closure of the centre. Some glasshouses will remain on the site which will be sold or leased. A new centre has not been built. However, essential refurbishment work was carried out on the existing centre to meet health and safety requirements and cost &pound;200,000.</p>

	<p pid="c.467W.2/1">Effective and responsive policing at neighbourhood level as well as robust partnership working are both essential parts of our strategy to tackle crime and to sustain the confidence and trust of the public in all parts of the country.</p>
	<p pid="c.467W.2/2">We introduced the Rural Policing Fund in 2000&ndash;01 specifically to enhance the visibility and accessibility of policing in rural areas. 31 police authorities with the most widespread populations benefit from this additional funding. The annual allocation is &pound;30 million. We are considering rolling-up a number of specific grants, including the Rural Policing Fund, into a single pot for each police authority to give authorities more control over how they may be used. We do not intend to abolish or reduce rural grant allocations. Each authority will receive the current levels of funding but would be expected to honour commitments.</p>
	<p pid="c.467W.2/3">A number of police forces have introduced community support officers (CSOs) in rural areas since their introduction in 2002. The Home Office is also involved in a Blue Light&quot; pilot which aims to create a community focused, multi-functional role for these officers in some rural villages.</p>
	<p pid="c.467W.2/4">We have made a commitment that by 2008, every area in England and Wales will benefit from dedicated neighbourhood policing teams which will be led by police officers and involve special constables, community support officers, volunteers and neighbourhood wardens among others.</p>
	<p pid="c.467W.2/5">The Government acknowledge the need to improve sanction detection rates across all police forces. For that reason, a major drive has been underway since last summer with the aim of achieving a significant increase in sanction detection rates. This includes a range of operational improvements intended to build the investigative capability of the police service, together with some targeted support for forces with performance concerns.</p>

	<p pid="c.473W.3/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2005-10-21">21 October</phrase>, we made an announcement setting out the Government's strategic direction for the learning and skills sector for the coming period. Our main purpose for doing so was to ensure the 2006/07 funding allocations process began with a clear and concise message on the principles that will underpin funding over the next two years. Our funding priorities do not affect the existing arrangements whereby my Department funds free tuition for learners who are eligible, however, a rebalancing of responsibilities between Government, employers and learners is central to delivering our skills strategy. My Department will continue to waive fees for all young people; those taking literacy and numeracy; and learners receiving income-based benefits, the pension (guarantee) credit and those on higher levels of the working tax credit.</p>
	<p pid="c.473W.3/2">My Department recently commissioned a public poll asking people about their attitudes towards fees in the learning and skills sector. We published a report of the findings on the Department's website on the <phrase class="date" code="2005-11-11">11 November</phrase>. Other research includes a study of learners (Study of Learners in Further Education (2003)) to ascertain the financial circumstances of learners in FE; and a Prior Qualifications of Adult Learners survey which includes questions about learner attitudes to contributing to the costs of their learning. We have also commissioned two surveys (Fees in Colleges&mdash;A Review Of The Use of Discretionary Fee Remission In Further Education (2003); and FE Colleges Fee Charging Policy and Practice (1999)) about fee policies and practices from the college's perspective. DfES published research findings are available on the Department's website at dfes.gov.uk/research/</p>

We are reviewing the guidance to make this even more explicit.</p>

It supports participants' accelerated leadership development by providing a programme of coaching support, mentoring and development activities, tailored to individual need. Fast Track teachers are assessed against a leadership impact scale which allows their progress to be benchmarked. The ultimate test of these teachers' leadership skills is to compete against other applicants for leadership roles. A number of Teach First participants and Fast Track teachers have achieved leadership positions in their schools. The first Fast Trackteacher to achieve a headship will take up her new post in January 2006.</p>

	<p pid="c.484W.6/2">In the four sectors a number of well-known companies have been involved in developing the proposals for National Skills Academies. This includes Bovis Lend Lease and Kier Homes (construction), Nationwide Building Society and Norwich Union (financial services) Northern Foods plc and Youngs Bluecrest Seafood Ltd (food and drink) Filtronics Components Ltd and Caterpillar (manufacturing). We expect that each of the sector skills councils will continue to work with these employers and to engage others across the sector as they develop their detailed business plans with the Learning and Skills Council. I will ask Mark Haysom, chief executive of the Learning and Skills Council to write to my hon. Friend with full details of the employers involved in the first National Skills Academies, once business plans have been agreed.</p>

	<p pid="c.485W.0/2">The second skills White Paper, Skills: Getting on in business, getting on in work&quot; published in March 2005, reaffirmed our commitment that all individuals&mdash;whether employed or not can get the skills and qualifications they need for sustained and rewarding work, and for personal growth in order for them to maximise their contribution to their communities and society.</p>
	<p pid="c.485W.0/3">The Learning and Skills Council heavily subsidises adults undertaking national vocational qualifications&mdash;currently at least 72.5 per cent. of the course fees are paid from public funds. In addition it provides free tuition to those adults who have not yet achieved a first full Level 2 qualification, equivalent to five good GCSEs or an NVQ2. Today, there are around 10 million adults in England who lack a full Level 2 qualification and it is vital for the nation's social and economic future that they receive the help and support they need to achieve a platform of skills for employability. The Government's target is to reduce the number of people in the workforce lacking a full Level 2 or equivalent qualification by 40 per cent. (3.6 million) by 2010.</p>
	<p pid="c.485W.0/4">There are a number of other assistance channels for adult learners, which, depending upon individual circumstances, could include an adult learning grant which pays up to &pound;30 a week for those on low incomes studying full-time (defined as at least 12 hours per week) for a first full Level 2 and for a first Level 3 for those between 19&ndash;30, access to an integrated information and advice service through learndirect and local nextstep services, additional help from Learner Support Funds for those who need extra help with child care, transport costs and other costs of learning, and skills coaching from April 2005 (in eight Jobcentre Plus areas) offering intensive personal guidance service for adults on inactive and active benefits to help them move into sustainable employment</p>

This recognises that information is often needed in order for authorities to make reasonable adjustments to cater for the transport requirements of a child with special needs. It explains that schools should seek the necessary consents before passing such information on. It is also clear that, should a request for confidentiality under the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 be made, information may not, from that point, be passed on for the purposes of making reasonable adjustments.</p>

	<p pid="c.490W.0/1">The number of initial teacher training places, including those for modern foreign languages, made available each year are agreed between the Department and the Training and Development Agency for Schools (TDA). Their decision is informed by the teacher supply models, which take into account recent and expected flows in and out of teaching, the age structure of the teaching profession, the latest pupil projections and expected changes in demand arising from new policy initiatives with an analysis by age, phase and (for secondary schools) subject. These also take account of expected wastage during training. Consideration is also given to:</p>
	<p pid="c.490W.0/2" class="indent">the latest evidence on vacancy rate by subject</p>
	<p pid="c.490W.0/3" class="indent">the evidence of the secondary schools curriculum and staffing survey e.g. on levels of out-of-subject teaching</p>
	<p pid="c.490W.0/4" class="indent">evidence from Ofsted on particular subjects, where available</p>
	<p pid="c.490W.0/5" class="indent">the desirability for a degree of stability in the training provider market.</p>
	<p pid="c.490W.0/6">Since 2000 we have provided &pound;6,000 bursaries to all PGCE trainee teachers. We have also provided those teaching priority subjects, which includes modern foreign languages, with a &pound;4,000 Golden Hello once they have successfully completed their induction. From September 2005 trainee science and maths teachers have received an enhanced bursary of &pound;7,000 bursary and a &pound;5,000 Golden Hello. The financial package remained the same for other subjects. For PGCE trainee teachers of secondary priority subjects the bursary will increase again from September 2006 to &pound;9,000. Those teachers who received the increased bursary will also be provided with a Golden Hello, of &pound;5,000 for those teaching maths and science and &pound;2,500 for other priority subjects, once they have successfully completed their induction.</p>

	<p pid="c.490W.3/1">In 2003, the Department, in collaboration with the General Teaching Council for England (GTCE) and the Training and Development Agency for Schools (TDA), commissioned a six year study of teachers' experiences of initial teacher training and early professional development in England entitled Becoming a Teacher&quot;. This has already explored what motivates people to enter the teaching profession.</p>
	<p pid="c.490W.3/2">This research has revealed that the three most influential sets of reasons which attracted the survey respondents to undertake an initial teacher training programme were related to: altruistic motives e.g. helping young people to learn; the perceived benefits of teaching and training e.g. long holidays; and being a teacher in today's society e.g. the challenging nature of the job.</p>
	<p pid="c.490W.3/3">The research has further revealed some differences across teaching phases, including: more primary trainees than secondary trainees were attracted by working with children and young people, and helping young people to learn; while at the same time, a higher proportion of secondary trainees than primary were attracted by staying involved with a subject specialism and opportunities for career development.</p>
	<p pid="c.490W.3/4">We have also looked at what motivates teachers in further education as part of a recent study entitled Recruitment and Retention in the Post-16 Learning and Skills Sector&quot;. Respondents cited a range of factors, including wanting to help people to develop and wanting to work with a wider range of people/learners. The two major personal reasons mentioned by respondents were for their own personal development and wanting to change their career path.</p>
	<p pid="c.490W.3/5">In relation to university level, we have also funded a study by the National Institute of Economic and Social Research called the 'Recruitment and Retention of Academic Staff in Higher Education'. This looked at what motivates existing staff, and what the motivating factors are attracting staff into higher education. The motivating factors included: teaching; ability to undertake personal research; flexibility of hours; autonomy; and stability of employment.</p>
	<p pid="c.490W.3/6">We do not have any specific research results on what motivates administrators in schools, the learning and skills sector, or at university level.</p>

	<p pid="c.492W.2/1">There are around 1,000 pupils on cohort 1 of the programme, which began in September 2004, and around 2,000 on cohort 2, which began in September 2005.</p>
	<p pid="c.492W.2/2">Funding for the delivery of the Young Apprenticeship (YA) Programme is routed to local partnerships via the Learning and Skills Council (LSC) on an individual pupil basis. A total of up to &pound;6,000 per pupil is available for the two years of the programme, &pound;3,500 in the first and &pound;2,500 in the second year.</p>
	<p pid="c.492W.2/3">In addition, the Department are providing funding to the Sector Skills Councils (SSCs) and sector bodies involved in the programme, to provide strategic input to policy development on behalf of their sectors and develop sector support for partnerships and teachers.</p>
	<p pid="c.492W.2/4">In 2004&ndash;05 the Young Apprenticeship Programme cost &pound;3,948,855.63, of which &pound;3,153,000 was allocated through the Learning and Skills Council to cover pupil costs and LSC support for partnerships, the remainder being allocated by the Department for central and sector specific support.</p>
	<p pid="c.492W.2/5">In 2005&ndash;06 the programme is expected to cost in the region of &pound;10,700,000. Costs in 2007&ndash;08 (and in 2006&ndash;07) will depend on the number of pupils on the programme, yet to be confirmed.</p>
	<p pid="c.492W.2/6">Confirmed figures for the number of pupils who dropped out of the scheme in 2004&ndash;05 will not be known until the analysis of baseline data has been completed. This is currently scheduled for the end of 2005.</p>
	<p pid="c.492W.2/7">No new qualifications have been developed for the YA programme. Pupils are studying existing qualifications, which are approved as appropriate for use pre-16, either GCSEs in vocational subjects, NVQs or vocationally-related qualifications. SSCs and sector bodies have provided advice on which qualifications are most appropriate to accredit achievement in particular sectors and have clear progression routes post-16. Pupils on the programme are expected to achieve Level 2 outcomes (equivalent to A* to C at GCSE). The qualifications all have an established equivalence to GCSEs in the Secondary Achievement and Attainment Tables. Qualification outcomes for pupils on the programme will be included in the table for their school.</p>
