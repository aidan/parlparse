	<p pid="a.2388W.2/1">The Bologna process is about responding to the challenge of globalisation and improving the competitiveness of European higher education. While it seeks to improve the compatibility and comparability of European higher education systems, it is not about harmonisation.</p>
	<p pid="a.2388W.2/2">Work on the feasibility of two year accelerated degrees in England is being taken forward through a series of pilot exercises in a number of individual higher education institutions (HEIs). Before we take any decision about enabling HEIs to offer accelerated degrees more widely, we will need to be satisfied that the learning outcomes from such courses are equivalent in terms of the knowledge, competences and skills acquired by students to those of a more traditional course.</p>
	<p pid="a.2388W.2/3">Medicine and dentistry courses prepare students not only in the theory of their subject but also give them a range of practical experience leading ultimately to a licence to practise. The arrangements in other European countries are similar. The implications of the Bologna process for medical and dental qualifications also need to be considered alongside EU directives on the mutual recognition of professional qualifications within EU countries. The higher education sector is currently considering, with expert stakeholders from both the medical and dental fields, whether any further action is needed to align these courses more closely to the Bologna principles.</p>

	<p pid="a.2391W.8/1">Following the launch of the Government's Teenage Pregnancy Strategy in 1999, each local authority was asked to put in place a strategy to reduce local under-18 conception rates by between 40&ndash;60 per cent. by 2010. These local targets underpin the national target to halve England's under-18 conception rate by 2010. Local strategies focus on: improving the effectiveness of sex and relationships education (SRE) in schools; improving young people's access to contraceptive and sexual health advice; and supporting parents so they are better able to talk to their children about relationships and sexual health. This is supported by a national media campaign on local radio and in teen magazines, with key messages on: the benefits of delaying early sex; resisting peer pressure; and promoting condom use among young people who are already sexually active.</p>
	<p pid="a.2391W.8/2">Data for 2004 (published in February 2006) shows that since the 1998 baseline year, the under-18 conception rate has fallen by 11.1 per cent. and the under-16 rate has fallen by 15.2 per cent. Both rates are now at their lowest levels since the mid-1980s. The decline in the under-18 conception rate in eastern region over the same period is 13.4 per cent. A full analysis of the causes of teenage pregnancy will be included in a strategy document setting out the next phase of the teenage pregnancy strategy, due to be published shortly.</p>

	<p pid="a.2395W.7/1">The Department does not issue predictions over these time periods. The UK Climate Impacts Programme (UKCIP) is funded by Defra and based at the university of Oxford. Their projections for sea level rise were last updated in November 2005 and are given in the form of ranges. For Eastern England these were from 17 cm (low emissions of &quot;greenhouse&quot; gases, lowest estimate) to 77 cm (high emissions, highest estimate), including isostatic subsidence of 0.8 mm per year, for the period from 1975 to 2085. (The years 1975 and 2085 are the mid-points of the periods to which these estimates relate&mdash;1961&ndash;90 and 2071&ndash;2100 respectively.)</p>
	<p pid="a.2395W.7/2">These ranges indicate the uncertainty inherent in such predictions which increases the further into the future one attempts to predict. There is significant inter-annual fluctuation in sea levels due to long-term tidal cycles and meteorological effects. It is not therefore helpful to look at relatively short-term changes over a single decade. The underlying rate of relative sea level rise in South and East England that takes account of both land level change and sea level rise has been of the order of 2 mm per year for recent decades.</p>
	<p pid="a.2395W.7/3">The Department used the range of estimates published in the UKCIP 2002 report (from 22 cm to 82 cm for Eastern England for the period 1975 to 2085, including isostatic subsidence of 1.2 mm per year) as the basis of recommended allowances for use in the design and appraisal of coastal defences over the next 50 years that aim to balance appropriate precaution with the need to avoid expenditure on unnecessary works. For Eastern England the recommended allowance is 6 mm per year or 48 cm for the period 1975 to 2055 compared to the UK CIP estimate under high emissions of 42 cm for the same period. We are in discussion with the Environment Agency regarding appropriate allowances for the latter part of the century and expect to issue further interim guidance later in the year.</p>
	<p pid="a.2395W.7/4">The changes between the UKCIP 2002 and 2005 estimates reflect changes in the isostatic (land movement) estimates. The main source on long term land movement in the UK, used as the basis for this recommendation and the UKCIP reports is the work of Ian Shennan at Durham university. The Defra recommended allowances have not been changed to reflect the 2005 change in estimate of land subsidence in Eastern England published by UKCIP. This and other evidence will be considered when the allowances are next reviewed but it is clear that they still represent a reasonably precautionary approach to the middle of the century. In view of the long term nature of coastal risk management investments and the time taken for project development, it is desirable that there should not be frequent fluctuations in the Defra recommended allowances.</p>

No specific extra priority is given in the scoring system to projects which would reduce flood risk to areas of outstanding natural beauty but such a benefit could be included in the scoring system insofar as it could be quantified.

	<p pid="a.2397W.5/1">The Government continue to work with the Association of British Insurers (ABI) with a mutual aim of continuing affordable domestic flood cover into the future. The ABI has agreed and published on their website a &quot;Statement of Principles&quot; which sets out the commitments made by the insurance industry to maintain flood insurance cover for the majority of domestic and small business properties at risk in association with commitments made by the Government on flood risk management.</p>
	<p pid="a.2397W.5/2">Decisions by insurers are risk-based and unfortunately the industry is not able to provide insurance cover to 100 per cent. of properties at risk. Representations have been received relating to cases where people have experienced problems in obtaining insurance cover. However, the number of such representations is in line with our understanding that cover has continued to be available at competitive cost to the vast majority of properties in areas at risk of flooding.</p>
	<p pid="a.2397W.5/3">Policy on insurance in general is a matter for Treasury. Officials from Treasury are included in our discussions with ABI but otherwise I have had no specific discussions on the matter with either the Chancellor or the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry.</p>

	<p pid="a.2398W.8/1">Nitrous oxide is a trace gas in the atmosphere. It is produced naturally mainly by the bacteriological breakdown of nitrogen in oceans and the soils of rainforests. Its common name is &quot;laughing gas&quot; and it is best known for its use as an anaesthetic in clinical dentistry. Approximately 65 per cent. of nitrous oxide emissions are accounted for by natural processes, the remainder is due to man's activities such as artificial fertilisers, manure fertilisers, fossil fuel combustion degradation (and nylon production. Other uses of nitrous oxide are as a propellant in aerosol cans, in place of CFCs and it is occasionally used in the fuel lines of racing cars to enhance acceleration.</p>
	<p pid="a.2398W.8/2">Drinking water supplies in England and Wales are tested for only those substances of relevance to public health. Tests are done routinely for nitrate and nitrite but not for nitrous oxide. The World Health Organisation has not found it necessary on health grounds to set a guideline value for nitrous oxide in drinking water. Likewise there is no standard set in the EU Drinking Water Directive and no requirement in the drinking water regulations for England and Wales for water companies to monitor drinking water supplies for nitrous oxide. Details of nitrate and nitrite standards and concentrations in drinking water are published on the website of the Drinking Water Inspectorate <a href="http://www.dwi.gov.uk">www.dwi.gov.uk</a>. Consumers in Bedfordshire can obtain the most up to date drinking water quality testing results for their homes and workplaces directly from their local water company.</p>
	<p pid="a.2398W.8/3">Because nitrous oxide is a greenhouse gas, environmental scientists have shown an interest in its concentration in the water environment. A correlation between the natural water concentrations of nitrate and nitrous oxide is recorded in the scientific literature pointing towards nitrification in soil as a main production mechanism of nitrous oxide in groundwater. However, nitrous oxide is not only produced as an intermediate step in the process of nitrification of ammonia in the presence of oxygen but it is also produced by denitrification of nitrate in the absence of oxygen. A NERC funded study of groundwater concentrations in the R. Bure catchment area of Norfolk was undertaken by University of East Anglia in 2001. The Environment Agency is responsible for determining the monitoring requirements for rivers and groundwater in England and Wales.</p>

	<p pid="a.2399W.3/1">Bio-energy has an important role in supporting the Government's objectives for improving sustainability, reducing the impact of climate change, farm diversification and supporting rural jobs and areas.</p>
	<p pid="a.2399W.3/2">Farmers growing certain crops for transport biofuels or the generation of heat and electricity can receive the single payment for crops on set-aside land or where the &euro;45/ha energy aid payment is claimed for crops on non set-aside land. Grants are available to farmers to establish energy crops for heat and power generation and to develop supply chains for energy crops and wood fuel, from harvest and processing through to delivery to end-users. Research has been commissioned to improve pest and disease resistance and crop yields.</p>
	<p pid="a.2399W.3/3">The production of transport biofuels is supported through the 20 pence per litre cut in the duty rate for biodiesel and bioethanol. This has brought forward sales amounting to around 0.25 per cent. of all road fuel sales. In order to further develop supply, the Government have announced that a renewable transport fuels obligation will be introduced. This will require 5 per cent. of road fuel to come from a renewable source by 2010. Other measures are being considered, such as duty incentives to encourage the mixing of biomass with hydrocarbons in the conventional refinery process, and an enhanced capital allowance scheme for the cleanest biofuels processing plants. The latter scheme would allow the cost of capital assets to be written off against taxable profits. Regional support grants for capital investment in production plants are already available. A number of companies are either building, or have plans to build, biofuel processing plants that will include UK-grown oilseed rape, wheat or sugar beet as a feedstock.</p>
	<p pid="a.2399W.3/4">&pound;66 million has been allocated to develop markets for biomass, including energy crops, in heat and electricity generation. Electricity suppliers are required to source 15 per cent. of their electricity from renewables, including energy crops, by 2015. Co-firing of energy crops with fossil fuels in conventional power stations is developing. A cross-departmental team is looking at the recommendations of the Biomass Task Force on ways to overcome the barriers to developing biomass heat and power. The Government will publish a full response by the end of April.</p>

	<p pid="a.2401W.0/1">The Hadley Centre has provided Defra with scenarios of global and UK temperature change, based on possible future greenhouse gas emissions generated by Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change marker emissions scenarios; and scaled from the UKCIP02 scenarios for the 21st century. The IPCC emissions scenarios range from a low population growth, clean technology, convergent world (B1), to a high population growth, energy intensive technology world (A1FI). Forecast temperature changes derived in this way are subject to uncertainties in future emissions and in climate modelling. However, they provide a range of plausible futures. It is important to note that no one scenario is considered any more likely than any other.</p>

These are based on one model from the Hadley Centre and show a smaller range of temperature change than in the IPCC Third Assessment Report. The temperature increases shown below are relative to 1961&ndash;90 mean temperatures (effectively relative to 1975 and hence the apparent large initial rise between then and the mid-2010s). The global temperature rise between 1900 and 1975 of approximately 0.2 oC needs to be added in order to estimate changes relative to pre-industrial temperature levels.</p>

This change is designed to improve the efficiency and performance of the railways, achieving savings through economies of scale and improving service to customers. This will also encourage better joint working between Network Rail and TOCs to deliver an improved service to customers. Also, work has started on four tracking the West Coast Main Line between Rugeley and Tamworth. This will greatly enhance route capacity and overall reliability.</p>

	<p pid="a.2407W.2/1">It is for station operators to meet the requirements of Part 3 of the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 with regard to access for disabled people. The Act requires them to take reasonable steps to ensure that disabled people do not find it impossible or unreasonably difficult to access their services by removing or altering physical features, by finding a way to avoid them, or by providing the service by a reasonable alternative means. It is therefore not simply a case of making physical alterations to stations, but rather taking such action as is reasonable for any particular station.</p>
