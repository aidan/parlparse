	<p pid=".359W.3/1">Each schools PFI project involves a separate contract between the relevant local authority and a private sector contractor, and, for a variety of reasons, timetables of work may change from that which was envisaged when the contract was signed. It is not possible therefore, for DfES to hold a record of the circumstances of each completion. However, where there have been difficulties, these have generally been brought to our attention by the LEA concerned. These cases have been a small proportion of the total number of completions.</p>

However, it has run advertising to inform those considering applying for a higher education course about the student support package available to them and how to apply. This is an annual campaign and was launched last month with radio, magazine and poster advertising costing &pound;240,000.</p>
	<p pid=".359W.9/3">There is information on the proposed changes to student finance in the campaign leaflet and website which are publicised in the advertising.</p>

	<p pid=".359W.9/5">In parallel, we are also running advertorials in women's magazines for parents of those considering applying for a higher education course. The cost of this is &pound;174,000, giving a total campaign cost of &pound;654,000.</p>

	<p pid=".367W.2/1">The National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) is appraising memantine (Ebixa) as part of the eighth wave of its work programme. The anticipated publication date of its guidance is May 2005.</p>
	<p pid=".367W.2/2">The Department has asked national health service bodies (in HSC 1999/176) to continue with local arrangements for the managed introduction of new technologies, including drugs such as memantine, where guidance from NICE is not published at the time the technology first became available. These arrangements should involve an assessment of all the available evidence. Information about which NHS bodies are currently allowing memantine to be prescribed is not collected centrally, but data collected about prescribing shows that memantine has been prescribed on the NHS in all strategic health authority areas.</p>
	<p pid=".367W.2/3">The National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery medical committee has considered the use of memantine and has agreed to prescribe it under certain protocols and shared care agreements.</p>

	<p pid=".369W.8/1">The Committee on Safety of Medicines (CSM) and its expert working group on hormone replacement therapy (HRT) have kept the safety of HRT under constant review and provided targeted advice to women and health professionals in response to important new evidence as it has emerged.</p>
	<p pid=".369W.8/2">In August 2003, the United Kingdom &quot;Million Women&quot; study provided important new information about the risks of breast cancer in long term HRT users. On the day of publication, the CSM informed women of the increase in risk that was observed in association with each different type of HRT preparation. The CSM further advised that these risks increase the longer that HRT is used, but return to normal within five years of stopping HRT. All women using HRT have been encouraged to attend regular breast screening and regularly check their breasts for any changes. Women have also been advised not to use HRT if they have breast cancer or if they have had it in the past.</p>
	<p pid=".369W.8/3">In addition, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) has placed a comprehensive review of the risks, including breast cancer, associated with HRT use for women on its website. Detailed information has also been published in the safety bulletins issued by the MHRA and the Chief Medical Officer, which are also available on their respective websites.</p>
	<p pid=".369W.8/4">The patient information leaflet that accompanies each pack of medicine has contained information about the risk of breast cancer in association with HRT use for some years. This information has been regularly updated to fully reflect all important new evidence as it has become available.</p>
	<p pid=".369W.8/5">Very recently, a Europe-wide review of the overall risks and benefits of HRT has been completed. UK experts participated in this review and the CSM has endorsed its recommendations, published on <phrase class="date" code="2003-12-03">3 December 2003</phrase>, that HRT should no longer be considered as the first choice treatment for the prevention of osteoporosis, for women over the age of 50 years. As with earlier advice, this information has been made available to health professionals and women through targeted communications and the MHRA website.</p>

The campaign is based on the successful &quot;SunSmart&quot; campaign in Australia. The campaign has received funding from the United Kingdom Health Departments this year. We will be providing further funding for the campaign for next summertime.</p>
	<p pid=".371W.11/2">The campaign's aim is to increase the profile of the issue of skin cancer and methods of effective sun protection.</p>
	<p pid=".371W.11/3">The key objectives are to increase knowledge of the causes of skin cancer, to increase awareness of actions that can be taken to prevent skin cancer and to influence positively attitudes to sun protection.</p>
	<p pid=".371W.11/4">Subject to further funding, longer-term aims are to reduce sunlight exposure through changes in behaviour and environment, to increase the proportion of people reporting with early stage disease and decrease the proportion of people presenting with late tumours.</p>
	<p pid=".371W.11/5">The campaign's key messages have been disseminated by way of an alert to the campaign and mailshot pack of posters and leaflets to all general practitioner surgeries and health promotion units nationally, an alert to the campaign and mailshot to secondary schools with 3,500 leaflets and posters; and a series of press events over summer 2003, with leaflets and posters targeted in cities and seaside resorts. The effectiveness of the campaign is being evaluated and the lessons learnt will be fed into future development of the campaign.</p>
	<p pid=".371W.11/6">The Department has separately developed the &quot;SunSafe&quot; web pages last year, designed with children in mind and these are available on the Department's website at <a href="http://www.doh.gov.uk/sunsafe">www.doh.gov.uk/sunsafe</a>.

The independent expert advisory Committee of Carcinogenicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and Environment that any potential risk of cancer from residency near to municipal solid waste incinerators was exceedingly low and probably not measurable by the most modern epidemiological methods. Therefore, no further research is planned on cancer incidence near municipal solid waste incinerators.</p>
	<p pid=".372W.2/2">The Committee on Medical Aspects of Radiation in the Environment (COMARE) recommended in its third report an investigation of the geographical distribution of childhood cancer and leukaemia in Great Britain and how the pattern of cases around nuclear installations compares with the national pattern. This study is nearing completion and the Department has asked COMARE to advise on which, if any, nuclear installations in Great Britain have incidences of childhood cancer and leukaemia in their vicinity which are statistically outside the distribution seen nationally. COMARE hopes to report on this aspect of the study to the Department early next year. When complete, the database will also allow investigation of other environmental factors and their potential relevance to the temporal and spatial distribution of childhood cancer.</p>

	<p pid=".375W.6/1">Defra has set up the Waste Implementation Programme (WIP) to help local authorities meet their targets for reducing the landfilling of biodegradable municipal waste under the Landfill Directive. One of WIP's programmes being taken forward by the Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP) is to promote kerbside recycling and composting best practice in local authorities.</p>
	<p pid=".375W.6/2">This sub-programme has two components:</p>
	<p pid=".375W.6/3" class="indent">1. A Recycling and Organics Technical Advisory Team (ROTATE) which will provide technical advice to local authorities needing to implement and improve kerbside recycling, with an emphasis on organics collections systems. This is supported by &pound;14.9 million over the next three years.</p>
	<p pid=".375W.6/4" class="indent">2. An Organics Materials Programme which provides material-specific support and investment to the growing composting sector. It aims to develop markets in compost, with headline targets of increasing the market share of compost in the landscaping and horticultural markets by 35 per cent. and 30 per cent. respectively, by end 2006. This is supported by &pound;12.2 million over the next three years.</p>
	<p pid=".375W.6/5">These targets will be achieved through a range of activities including:</p>
	<p pid=".375W.6/6" class="indent">development of compost standards;</p>
	<p pid=".375W.6/7" class="indent">business development initiative for emerging compost companies;</p>
	<p pid=".375W.6/8" class="indent">marketing and product development targeted at the landscaping and horticultural sectors.</p>
	<p pid=".375W.6/9">Defra also provides &pound;272,000 over three years to the Composting Association to raise awareness and increase the understanding of composting and uses of compost.</p>
	<p pid=".375W.6/10">In addition, Defra's Waste Minimisation and Recycling Fund has supported composting schemes run by local authorities. In 2003&ndash;04, 21 green waste-only kerbside schemes and five composting site developments received funding.</p>

	<p pid=".377W.3/1">The Port of Tyne Authority (PoT) applied for a licence in February 2003 to dispose of 315,123 cubic metres of sediment dredged from wharves within the port to the Souter Point disposal ground. Some sediments are contaminated with Tributyl-tin and heavy metals.</p>
	<p pid=".377W.3/2">Defra and its advisers from the Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquatic Science (CEFAS) have met the PoT on a number of occasions to discuss potential disposal options.

	<p pid=".377W.3/3">On the basis of the currently available information, the levels of contamination are such that we would not be prepared to licence simple disposal of the sediments at sea. I also appreciate that land based disposal or remediation would be prohibitively expensive.</p>
	<p pid=".377W.3/4">We have therefore suggested that:</p>
	<p pid=".377W.3/5" class="indent">(i) the PoT should carry out limited further sampling to (a) determine the characteristics of the sediment down to the proposed dredging depth and <i>(b)</i> more closely determine the extent of the most contaminated material. A sampling methodology is to be agreed.</p>
	<p pid=".377W.3/6" class="indent">(ii) with assistance from CEFAS, the PoT should prepare a methodology for confined disposal (capping of the contaminated material with clear material) at Souter Point including a strategy for monitoring the effectiveness of this approach.</p>

Friend the Secretary of State announced the conclusions of the flood and coastal defence funding review on <phrase class="date" code="2003-03-12">12 March 2003</phrase>. These include the transfer of responsibility for rivers creating the greatest flood risk to the Environment Agency; funding the Environment Agency through a single stream of Defra grand in aid; and introducing a single tier of flood defence committee by abolishing the local tier where it exists but creating additional regional committees where this is considered appropriate.</p>
	<p pid=".378W.2/2">These measures are not designed primarily to secure cost or manpower savings. Rather they are designed to help achieve a more assured, streamline, effective and accountable service of flood defence and flood protection, that achieves a better reduction in flood risk nationally for the investment made.</p>
	<p pid=".378W.2/3">Defra is however working with the Environment Agency on process improvement which will take account of the changes referred to above, further rationalise scheme appraisal and approval processes and reduce the proportion of overheads in scheme costs.</p>

	<p pid=".379W.2/2">The herbicide regime used by farmers growing GM maize in the farm-scale trials was proposed by the product manufacturer, AgrEvo (now Bayer Crop Science). The way farmers could then use the product was further specified under the terms of the draft product label in line with the experimental approval. The draft product label gave farmers the freedom to apply more than one application of the herbicide if they required, providing it was within the specified crop growth stage limits.</p>
	<p pid=".379W.2/3">The experimental approval assumed use of the herbicide under UK conditions. No research was conducted on the method of use of this or any other herbicides in other countries as this was not considered necessary.</p>
	<p pid=".379W.2/4">The Scientific Steering Committee overseeing the farm-scale evaluations (FSEs) were content from the outset that the proposals for the use of the pesticide provided by the manufacturers and specified in the draft product label were capable of delivering cost-effective weed control under UK conditions. A full audit of herbicide use was conducted as part of the FSEs and published as part of the results (Champion et al. 2003). This paper also gives details of the number of GM maize fields that received more than one application of herbicide. In the published results it was concluded that cost-effective weed control had been achieved. This conclusion was endorsed by the steering committee and was further validated by the publishing journal through their peer-review process.</p>

	<p pid=".380W.8/2">The European Commission approved the Hazardous Waste Directive in December 1991. Its requirements are currently transposed in England by the Special Waste Regulations 1996, but these are to be replaced by new regulations for hazardous waste in 2004. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) was established in June 2001 and all staff that had worked on hazardous waste policy issues in the Department for Environment, Transport and the Regions transferred to Defra to continue this work. The Hazardous Waste Branch of Waste Management Division takes the lad on these issues as well as policy work on the transfrontier shipment of waste and consists of eight staff.</p>

	<p pid=".384W.3/2">Local planning authorities are required, in formulating the policies in their development plans, to have regard to regional planning guidance as well as to current national policies. Planning Policy Guidance Note 10 (PPG10), &quot;Planning and Waste Management&quot;, sets out a number of matters that waste planning authorities should take into account in developing the waste planning strategy for their area including regional planning guidance on waste management. PPG10 also expects waste planning authorities to plan for a provision of waste management facilities that is consistent with forecasts of local and regional requirements, as well as other planning considerations.</p>
	<p pid=".384W.3/3">The weight attached to policies in a development plan depends upon the stage of plan preparation or review, increasing as successive stages are reached. Where an adopted or approved development plan contains relevant policies, section 54A of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 requires that an application for planning permission or an appeal shall be determined in accordance with the plan, unless material considerations indicate otherwise.</p>

	<p pid=".401W.2/1">Statistical data on numbers of offences recorded in different areas do not indicate which may have been committed due to drug taking. However, results from the NEW-ADAM research programme of interviewing and drug testing arrestees between 1999 and 2000 sheds some light on the links between drugs and crime in 16 sites throughout England and Wales. Summary data published in 2001 found that:</p>
	<p pid=".401W.2/2" class="indent"><i>(a)</i> 56 per cent. of arrestees tested positive for an illegal drug with up to 29 per cent. testing positive for opiates (including heroin) and/or cocaine (including crack);</p>
	<p pid=".401W.2/3" class="indent"><i>(b)</i> of those arrestees who reported using illegal drugs in the year prior to arrest, 40 per cent. acknowledged a link between their drug use and offending. Past year users of heroin and/or cocaine/crack were nearly twice as likely (78 per cent.) to acknowledge a link.</p>
	<p pid=".401W.2/4" class="indent"><i>(c)</i> Those not reporting any drug use in the last year reported an average of 46 acquisitive crimes (including theft, burglary, shoplifting, fraud, handling stolen goods, drugs supply and prostitution offences) over the same period. Drug use in general and especially use of heroin and/or cocaine/crack (hcc), was associated with much higher levels of offending. Among hcc users, respondents reported an average of 432 acquisitive crimes. This was nearly ten times higher than for non-drug users.</p>
	<p pid=".401W.2/5">However, it should be noted that because an arrestee tested positive for drugs it does not necessarily mean that the consumption of drugs caused the crime to be committed. As a result, while the NEW-ADAM study advanced our knowledge of the links between drugs and crime, it will always be difficult to calculate precisely what proportion of crime is drug-related.</p>
	<p pid=".401W.2/6">In September 2003, the Home Office Arrestee Survey commenced at 60 randomly selected custody suites in England and Wales. The survey is ongoing, and involves interviewing and drug testing a representative sample of around 9,000 arrestees per year about their offending and drug use. The survey will enable research into the links between drugs and offending and will also provide robust data at a national level to allow tracking of the Home Office Public Service Agreement target to reduce drug related crime.</p>
	<p pid=".401W.2/7">Numbers of crimes recorded by the police in St. Helens are collected and published at Basic Command Unit (BCU) level. At this level, data is available from 1999&ndash;2000 to 2002&ndash;2003, and the number of crimes recorded are published for six key offence groups, as given in the table.</p>

	<p pid=".404W.8/1">We are encouraging more people to report crimes in all areas by improving the way in which crimes reported to the police are recorded. The National Crime Recording Standard, formally introduced in all forces in England and Wales in April 2002, aims to bring greater consistency to the way in which crime is recorded by the police and to ensure a more victim centred approach to crime recording.</p>
	<p pid=".404W.8/2">There have also been crime specific initiatives aimed at increasing the numbers of such crimes reported to the police, particularly, domestic violence and sexual offences. For example, the British Crime Survey shows that there was a 5 per cent. Increase in the proportion of violent crimes being reported to the police in 2002&ndash;03 compared with the previous year.</p>
	<p pid=".404W.8/3">With a total sample size of 40,000 interviews a year, more emphasis is now being placed on the British Crime Survey as a way of measuring crime, as it covers unreported and unrecorded crime as well as offences which are reported to the police. As the survey is unaffected by changes in the level of public reporting to the police or police recording, it provides a more accurate picture of crime across England and Wales.</p>

	<p pid=".407W.3/1">The Police Negotiating Board (PNB) Agreement of May 2002 included outline provisions for flexible arrangements that would give managers in the police service scope to retain officers who are entitled to retire with maximum pension benefits where they wish to do so. The main points of the 30+ scheme subsequently agreed by the PNB are:</p>
	<p pid=".407W.3/2" class="indent">Retirement from the force with the option of commuting part of one's pension for a tax-free lump sum;</p>
	<p pid=".407W.3/3" class="indent">Re-engagement at former rank and pay level;</p>
	<p pid=".407W.3/4" class="indent">Pension abatement lifted to allow for any replacement allowances lost on retirement to be made good;</p>
	<p pid=".407W.3/5" class="indent">Eligibility for Special Priority Payments and Competency Related Threshold Payments on the same basis as other officers;</p>
	<p pid=".407W.3/6" class="indent">Officer ceases to be a member of the Police Pension Scheme but can accrue further pension benefits by taking out a personal pension.</p>
	<p pid=".407W.3/7">The 30+ scheme has been piloted in a selection of forces in England and Wales since December 2002. A total of 15 forces are currently participating and the initial response to the scheme has been generally positive, both from officers and forces. We are currently reviewing the progress of this scheme and will send a report to the PNB later this month about extending the scheme nationally.</p>

Broadly, the NCRS had the effect of increasing the number of crimes recorded by the police. Therefore, following the introduction of the Standard, numbers of recorded crimes are not comparable with previous years.</p>

	<p pid=".410W.5/1">The Home Office New Car Security Guidance published in 1998 encouraged car manufacturers to fit glazing that would resist attack by methods commonly used by criminals for a minimum of 30 seconds. This standard applies whether conventional laminated glazing or security film is fitted. Officials are considering the merits of using the recently issued German test standard to measure whether products meet this Home Office requirement. In addition, any glazing (laminated or when fitted with security film) has to meet the appropriate standards set out in the Road Vehicles (Construction and Use) Regulations 1986, Directive 92/22/EEC and UN/ECE Regulation 43 to ensure safety and durability. We will encourage the fitting of any laminated glazing or security film that meets statutory requirements and makes a significant contribution to vehicle crime reduction.</p>
	<p pid=".410W.5/2">We aim to raise motorists' awareness of the benefits of laminated glazing through Home Office publicity material, particularly the booklet &quot;Steer Clear of Car Crime&quot; and our website <a href="http://www.secureyourmotor.gov.uk">www.secureyourmotor.gov.uk</a>. We also provide links from our Department for Transport websites to the insurance industry website (<a href="http://www.ncsr.co.uk">www.ncsr.co.uk</a>) which provides motorists with information about their assessment of each car's ability to resist criminal attempts to gain entry.</p>

This year the Government plan to fund the provision of 213 new units in Northern Ireland, specifically for homeless families and single people, at a total cost of around &pound;13.5 million. It is also overseeing the implementation of new arrangements for providing housing support services which include provision to help sustain and improve the existing support services provided to homeless people. The Northern Ireland Housing Executive has published the Northern Ireland Homeless Strategy and is working in partnership with all of those who have a part to play in tackling the problem of homelessness. In addition, an inter-departmental, cross sectoral Promoting Social Inclusion Review Group has been set up to consider how to ensure, firstly, that the risk of homelessness is reduced and secondly, that the full range of appropriate services is available to homeless people.</p>

	<p pid=".414W.0/1">The Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety, together with the Health Boards and the Central Services Agency, has been making considerable efforts to reduce losses through patient exemption fraud.</p>
	<p pid=".414W.0/2">The key actions taken to date include:</p>
	<p pid=".414W.0/3" class="indent">The establishment of a dedicated Counter Fraud Unit to co-ordinate work to tackle prescription fraud;</p>
	<p pid=".414W.0/4" class="indent">The introduction for pharmacists of point of dispensing/treatment checks to confirm exemption from charges;</p>
	<p pid=".414W.0/5" class="indent">The introduction of a Fixed Penalty Charge Scheme for those who make false claims for free prescriptions. There have been some 500 charges imposed this year.</p>
	<p pid=".414W.0/6">In sustaining efforts to further reduce patient exemption fraud it is planned to take the following actions:</p>
	<p pid=".414W.0/7" class="indent">The implementation of the criminal charge element of the Fixed Penalty Charge regulations. This will provide for a fine, upon conviction, of up to &pound;2,500 for those who have been found to be persistently misclaiming exemption from health service charges; and</p>
	<p pid=".414W.0/8" class="indent">Renewed publicity early in the new year regarding the Fixed Penalty Charge Scheme and the various categories of exemption that apply across the Family Health Services.</p>
	<p pid=".414W.0/9">The indications are that the measures introduced over the last few years have contributed to reducing the losses by some &pound;6 million per annum. While this reflects significant progress, we will continue to work for further improvements to ensure that these funds are not denied to the health service.</p>

The table gives the numbers of pensioner households and individuals in West Derbyshire, the East Midlands and Great Britain receiving Pension Credit at <phrase class="date" code="2003-10-17">17 October 2003</phrase>.

	<p pid=".416W.6/2">The application process for Pension Credit has been designed to be straightforward for pensioners and their family and friends, who may apply on their behalf. The Pension Credit application line (0800 99 1234), which is the main method of applying, is working well and has taken over 1.3 million calls (to the end of October) since it became operational on <phrase class="date" code="2003-04-07">7 April</phrase>. The Pension Service is able to offer alternative ways of applying to suit individual circumstances, including a textphone number and a paper application form. We are working closely with partner organisations to ensure that they can obtain paper application forms, through the Pension Service's local service, for those who want them. The local service can also arrange to see pensioners face-to-face either in a local surgery or, where appropriate, in the pensioner's home.</p>

	<p pid=".420W.3/1">Although scattered elements of Al Qa'ida and the Taliban remain in Afghanistan and continue to mount attacks against international and Afghan targets, the perpetrators cannot be said to control the areas in which they operate. Many attacks are carried out by insurgents who cross between Pakistan and Afghanistan. Others are mounted on a hit-and-run basis by groups within Afghanistan. Extremists are undoubtedly attempting to establish bases from which to operate. But successful military operations conducted by the Coalition and units of the Afghan National Army are preventing them from doing so. Apparent isolated instances of low-level control generally amount to no more than evidence of Taliban intimidation of local communities.</p>

Instead, Saddam Hussein continued to abuse the Oil For Food Programme, ordering many non essential goods, such as equipment for a new Olympic sports stadium.</p>

But the resolution's sponsors would not accommodate UK amendments intended to achieve a better balance, and the UK therefore abstained.

	<p pid=".427W.6/1">Information on total National Lottery sales is not available by constituency. The available information about National Lottery sales by postcode area is set out in a table placed in the Library, in response to a question from <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/716" name="John Barrett">the hon. Member for Edinburgh, West (John Barrett)</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".427W.6/2">The information needs to be interpreted with care, since it is dependent on a number of factors, including the Post Office's updating of postcode information on a quarterly basis. The table shows total sales since the lottery started, including year to date sales up to the end of September 2003. The data has been extracted from Camelot's sales database and will not directly reconcile to Camelot's financial reporting.</p>
	<p pid=".427W.6/3">It is worth noting that the funds that the National Lottery generates for the good causes are shared between 15 distributing bodies&mdash;some of which are UK-wide, while others operate only in one of the four home counties&mdash;in fixed proportions. There is no necessary correlation between the way in which the proceeds are divided between the 15 distributing bodies, or the way in which grants are allocated by each of the distributors, and the level of ticket sales generated in particular areas. The address of a lottery grant recipient is not necessarily a reliable guide to the area or region which is benefiting from the expenditure (for example, London-based organisations often receive lottery grants but spend the money elsewhere).</p>
	<p pid=".427W.6/4">Information on the value of grants awarded is not available as a proportion of sales. The following table shows the amount of money awarded to good causes in Northern Ireland in each of the past five calendar years. This is derived from the Department's Awards Database, which is based on information supplied by the distributing bodies.</p>

An improvement to the route at this location is included in the Government's Targeted Programme of Improvements. A second accident occurred on the section of the road through Cricklade where, at the time of the accident, there was no safety fencing in place. However, the Agency has recently completed an improvement scheme which included the provision of safety fencing at this location.

	<p pid=".429W.9/1">I refer the hon. Member to my answer of <phrase class="date" code="2003-12-01">1 December 2003</phrase>, <phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2003-12-01.4"><i>Official Report</i>, column 4W</phrase>, on the plans to change the Blue Badge Scheme.</p>
	<p pid=".429W.9/2">With regard to powers of inspection, we are committed to introducing a specific power for the police, traffic wardens and local authority parking enforcement officers to inspect badges. We are also looking at the feasibility of establishing a national database of badge holders; the introduction of smartcard technology; increasing penalties for abuse and misuse of the Scheme.</p>
	<p pid=".429W.9/3">The power to inspect, and a number of other measures, will need to be introduced through primary legislation and we are looking for a suitable legislative opportunity to do so. Meanwhile, we are already working on the changes that require secondary legislation, taking forward a number of research projects and drafting new guidance for local authorities to accompany the changes. We aim to implement the changes at the earliest opportunity.</p>

There are now sufficient lengths of these different barrier types on the network to obtain data on their respective in-service performance levels.

	<p pid=".439W.7/2">However, with the increased emphasis on trade in differentially priced drugs&mdash;including anti-retroviral drugs&mdash;to developing countries, it is likely that there will be an increase in the number of attempts made by unscrupulous traders to divert differentially priced drugs from their intended markets in developing countries to markets in developed countries in order to take advantage of the higher prices (and therefore higher profit margins) which can be obtained in markets in developed countries.</p>
	<p pid=".439W.7/3">It is important that we address this issue, both in order to ensure that such drugs reach the people in developing countries who need them most and to ensure that diverted drugs do not undermine the market in developed countries which is necessary to allow for further research and development into new drugs.</p>
	<p pid=".439W.7/4">The Government have consistently supported suitable measures to combat the diversion of differentially priced drugs. We have supported the introduction of a new EU Regulation intended to combat the diversion of differentially priced drugs; worked with our G8 colleagues to secure commitments to action on this issue at the G8 summit in Evian; and ensured there were suitable provisions addressing the issue of diversion in the recent agreement in the WTO on how countries with insufficient manufacturing capacity in the pharmaceutical sector can make effective use of the compulsory licensing provisions in the WTO TRIPS Agreement.</p>

	<p pid=".440W.5/1">The Government estimate that raising the audit exemption threshold has the potential to save small companies around &pound;94 million a year. There are inevitably risks as well as benefits associated with raising the threshold. The Government concluded, following consultation, that these risks are small and are outweighed by the benefits in terms of costs savings and greater flexibility for small businesses. The Government's consultation document on the proposal contained a draft impact assessment discussing the risks and benefits. The consultation document &quot;Raising the Thresholds&quot;, which was published on <phrase class="date" code="2003-07-11">11 July 2003</phrase>, is available on the Department's website at <a href="http://www.dti.gov.uk/cld/published.htm">http://www.dti.gov.uk/cld/published.htm</a>. A final version of the impact assessment will also be available there in due course.</p>

	<p pid=".441W.5/1">The Government has taken a number of steps to improve the financial environment for the biotechnology industry. The R&amp;D Tax Credit system, has benefited many bioscience companies. UK-based companies can also take advantage of the DTI's business support products. Four products have been launched to date, all of which may be of use to biotechnology companies:</p>
	<p pid=".441W.5/2" class="indent">Small Firms Loan Guarantee</p>
	<p pid=".441W.5/3" class="indent">Grant for Investigating an Innovative Idea</p>
	<p pid=".441W.5/4" class="indent">Grant for Research and Development</p>
	<p pid=".441W.5/5" class="indent">Knowledge Transfer Partnerships</p>
	<p pid=".441W.5/6">The Higher Education Innovation Fund (&pound;187 million over 2004&ndash;05 and 2005&ndash;06) and Public Sector Research Exploitation Fund (&pound;15 million over 2004&ndash;05 and 2005&ndash;06) are examples of Government's support for commercialisation of research.</p>
	<p pid=".441W.5/7">Commercial funding of the industry through financial markets is essential, however, for its long-term success. Government will normally intervene only in financial markets where it can identify a clear market failure, but where such failures are identified, the track record of intervention is strong. For example the UK High Technology Fund (UKHTF), an element of the &pound;180 million Enterprise Fund was announced in 1998. Other initiatives include the Regional Venture Capital Funds launched on a national basis for England through the Small Business Service in 2002, and funds set up by the Regional Development Agencies and Devolved Administrations to tackle localised market failures.</p>
	<p pid=".441W.5/8">The UK has the most liquid capital markets in Europe and the most developed venture capital sector in the world after the USA. Optimism about the long-term prospects for bioscience is starting to return to public markets after a global downturn and good UK biotechnology companies are still receiving venture capital investment. The UK is also home to some of the world's largest pharmaceutical companies, providing long-term finance for biotechnology companies through deals to purchase or license technology.</p>
	<p pid=".441W.5/9">The Government is not complacent, however. The DTI and Department of Health prompted the establishment of the Bioscience Innovation and Growth Team, to identify and clarify the issues that are critical to the future competitiveness of the UK biosciences sector. The BIGT report was published in November 2003 and includes recommendations on the flow of seed capital, improvement of public sector technology transfer activity, and the provision of a favourable regulatory and fiscal environment. The Government will examine these recommendations carefully and respond to them all in due course.</p>

	<p pid=".444W.5/2">The Employment Rights Act 1996 confers the right to complain of unfair dismissal. When territorial limits in the Act were abolished in 1999, the Government's intention was that employees working overseas would be able to claim unfair dismissal only if there was a proper connection with Great Britain. The employment Appeal Tribunal has confirmed that this is the test which the employment tribunals must apply.</p>

	<p pid=".446W.2/2">In April this year, the Government introduced new laws for working parents which cover fathers as well as mothers, including the right for fathers of children aged under six or disabled children under 18 to request flexible working and the right to two weeks paid paternity leave. These new rights together with the existing rights to parental leave and time off for dependants recognise that men increasingly want to play a greater role in the family and provides them with more choices for doing so.</p>
	<p pid=".446W.2/3">To facilitate take-up, the Government are running an on-going awareness raising campaign which includes national newspaper adverts targeted specifically at fathers. In addition posters have been circulated to CAB's GP's surgeries and libraries. We are working in partnership with stakeholders to raise awareness. We provided support to the charity, Fathers Direct for their pilot magazine aimed at new fathers&mdash;'Dad', launched in five different maternity units in April 2003 and distributed to all new fathers coming into contact with those units.</p>

	<p pid=".449W.0/1">The overall impact of EU trade arrangements on developing countries is determined by a number of factors. The European Union offers preferential access to European markets to developing countries under the Cononou Agreement with African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries, the 'Everything But Arms' initiative for Least Developed Countries and the Generalised System of Preferences for Developing Countries. In addition to preferential arrangements, other instruments have a direct or indirect impact on developing countries, including anti-dumping measures, the common agricultural policy, sanitary and phytosanitary measures, and technical regulations. The impact of such factors differs from country to country, and there is little research on the aggregated net effect either on specific developing countries or on developing countries as a group.</p>
	<p pid=".449W.0/2">We continue to work closely with the European Commission and other member states to ensure the greatest benefit to developing countries of increased international trade through, for example, the WTO negotiations on the Doha Development Agenda, and Economic Partnership Agreement negotiations under the Cotonou Agreement.</p>

It has been substantially revised to take account of modern management practice and the experience gained in industry over the past 25 years. It is already the most widely recognised management standard in the world and I am sure that the advantages and benefits of the new version will encourage its use still further. The DTI welcomes tenders from suppliers that have certification to this standard for a relevant scope but it is not a mandatory requirement and it is acceptable for a potential supplier to use other means to demonstrate how it has implemented its quality policy.</p>

	<p pid=".453W.2/1">The Department's London headquarters estate (including SBS) operates an environmental management system certified to ISO14001. This environmental management system (EMS) sets out the policy and procedure to be followed in the procurement of timber products. The EMS requires timber to be FSC or equivalent certification. All other buildings within the DTI HQ estate but outside of London are subject to the same procurement criteria.</p>

	<p pid=".453W.2/3" class="indent">The Secretary of State for Trade and Industry has asked me to reply on behalf of the Radiocommunications Agency to your Parliamentary Question detailing by what means the policy for purchasing timber and timber products ensures that they are obtained from legal and sustainable sources.</p>
	<p pid=".453W.2/4" class="indent">I can confirm that, where the Agency has had the need to procure timber products, it has followed the Department's strict guidelines on purchasing from qualified and certified organisations. All of the Agency's timber products are purchased from suppliers who have satisfied the Department's and the OGC's strict monitoring and inspections regime on producing goods from legal and sustainable sources.</p>
	<p pid=".453W.2/5" class="letterfrom">Letter from Alison Brimelow to Mr. Barry Gardiner, dated <phrase class="date" code="2003-12-09">9 December 2003</phrase></p>
	<p pid=".453W.2/6" class="indent">I am replying to this parliamentary question, tabled on <phrase class="date" code="2003-11-28">28 November 2003</phrase>, regarding the policy of purchasing timber and timber products.</p>
	<p pid=".453W.2/7" class="indent">The Patent Office does not purchase timber direct from any suppliers. However, furniture is purchased through the Office of Government Commerce's (OGC) Buying Solutions Framework Agreement where it is a requirement that preferred suppliers hold the relevant Forestry Stewardship Council (FSC) certification. Where we engage the use of contractors for minor building work requirements, they must provide evidence that timber products are sourced from managed and sustainable sources.</p>
	<p pid=".453W.2/8" class="indent">In addition, the Patent Office is presently working towards an environmental management system certified to EN ISO 14001.</p>
	<p pid=".453W.2/9" class="letterfrom">Letter from Dr. J. W. Llewellyn to Mr. Barry Gardiner, dated <phrase class="date" code="2003-12-09">9 December 2003</phrase></p>
	<p pid=".453W.2/10" class="indent">The Secretary for Trade and Industry has asked me to reply on behalf of the National Weights and Measures Laboratory (NWML) to your question on what means the policy for purchasing timber and timber products of the National Weights and Measures Laboratory ensures that they are obtained from legal and sustainable sources.</p>
	<p pid=".453W.2/11" class="indent">The National Weights and Measures Laboratory (NWML) is part of the DTI HQ estate and thus is within the scope of the Department's environmental management system, which is certified to ISO 14001. This management system sets out the policy and procedure for procurement of timber products and requires FSC or equivalent certification. Furniture for NWML is purchased from Kinnarps who are an approved OGC supplier. Stationery is purchased mainly from Guilbert (UK) who hold the DTI stationery contract. Where possible products are obtained from their 'environmental benefit' range.</p>

	<p pid=".453W.2/13" class="indent">I refer to your question tabled on <phrase class="date" code="2003-11-28">28 November 2003</phrase> to Patricia Hewitt regarding the use of timber and timber products. I have been asked to reply to you in relation to The Insolvency Service.</p>
	<p pid=".453W.2/14" class="indent">Although we are not major consumers of timber products The Service's policy is always to specify to contractors and suppliers that these materials are provided from sustainable sources. We also require prospective suppliers to confirm this with their bids for our work. Timber is mainly used in office refurbishment projects whereas our office furniture these days is invariably made from melamine-faced chipbord (MFC), rather than virgin timber.</p>
	<p pid=".453W.2/15" class="letterfrom">Letter from Roger Heathcote to Mr. Barry Gardiner, dated <phrase class="date" code="2003-12-09">9 December 2003</phrase></p>
	<p pid=".453W.2/16" class="indent">You asked the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry by what means the Department's policy for purchasing timber and timber products ensures they are obtained from legal and sustainable sources. I have been asked to reply on behalf of the Employment Tribunals Service (ETS), which is an Agency of the DTI.</p>
	<p pid=".453W.2/17" class="indent">All furniture supplies are purchased through contracts let by the Office of Government Commerce in respect of which the suppliers have already established proof of conforming with the necessary legal and sustainable requirement in respect of timber. The same requirement is built into our standard terms of contract for works services.</p>
	<p pid=".453W.2/18" class="letterfrom">Letter from Claire Clancy to Mr. Barry Gardiner, dated <phrase class="date" code="2003-12-09">9 December 2003</phrase></p>
	<p pid=".453W.2/19" class="indent">I am responding to your recent Parliamentary Question to the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry on behalf of Companies House, which is an Executive Agency of the DTI.</p>
	<p pid=".453W.2/20" class="indent">Companies House operates an environmental management system certified to ISO14001. This sets out the policy and procedure to be followed in the procurement of timber products. Any purchases are therefore from Forestry Stewardship Council accredited sources.</p>
