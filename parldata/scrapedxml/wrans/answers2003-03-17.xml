	<p pid=".499W.6/1">Generally, executive non-departmental public bodies (NDPBs) operate under statutory provisions and are legally incorporated; their functions cover a national remit (including the devolved assemblies); appointments to the Board of the NDPB are made by Ministers, or by the Queen on ministerial advice; such appointments must be made in accordance with the Code of Practice of the Commissioner for Public Administration (OCPA); the chief executive is accountable to the Board; the NDPB has its own budget; staff are employed directly by the body itself (and are not civil servants); and Ministers are answerable to Parliament for the NDPB and have the powers to wind it up subject to, where appropriate, the approval of Parliament or, where a Royal Charter has previously been granted, of the Queen.</p>
	<p pid=".499W.6/2">Advisory NDPBs are usually set up administratively by Ministers, or by the Queen on ministerial advice, without the need for legislation; those appointed to the Board are independent of Government and drawn from outside the public sector; the NDPB should be a standing body existing for more than one year and meeting at least annually; the Board has a defined membership and clear terms of reference; as with executive NDPBs, appointments are subject to the OCPA Code of Practice and the remit tends to have a national focus; the Board is usually supported by staff from within the sponsoring department but is not part of a department or agency; generally the NDPB does not prepare its own accounts and instead is accounted for through the books of the sponsoring department; and Ministers are answerable to Parliament for the body and may wind it up.</p>
	<p pid=".499W.6/3">There is little to distinguish between task forces, ad hoc advisory groups and reviews. These bodies can be defined in various ways. However, the Government's response to the Sixth 'Report of the Committee on Standards in Public Life' gave 3 criteria as a definition:</p>
	<p pid=".499W.6/4" class="indent">Membership drawn from the wider public sector and/or voluntary organisations and/or the private sector</p>
	<p pid=".499W.6/5" class="indent">A lifetime normally of less than 2 years;</p>
	<p pid=".499W.6/6" class="indent">A remit focused on a single issue.</p>
	<p pid=".499W.6/7">Some of these bodies may go on to become classified as NDPBs where the need for the body's advice continues beyond its original life span e.g. the Better Regulation Task Force, Skills Task Force and the New Deal Task Force.</p>
	<p pid=".499W.6/8">Finally, as their name indicates executive NDPBs will be largely concerned with an operational or executive function while an advisory NDPB would be more likely to provide specific advice in a specialised field. Both executive and advisory NDPBs tend to be more formal and likely to run for longer than task forces, ad hoc advisory groups and reviews. The choice of the most appropriate body to be set up in a given situation will depend upon all of the criteria described here, and ministerial judgment about what would be most suitable for the intended purpose.</p>

	<p pid=".503W.8/1">As yet there is no reliable measure of the amount of methane escaping from disused coal mines. Current estimates vary from 0.3 per cent. to 2 per cent. of UK greenhouse gas emissions. My Department, in consultation with the industry, have commissioned an independent study to provide an accurate estimate of methane emissions from this source which will report in two years time.</p>
	<p pid=".503W.8/2">Defra supported the coal mine methane industry in its application for exemption from the climate change levy. This application was successful, and secured for the industry an 80 per cent. discount on the levy subject to state aid approval from the European Commission. This will improve the viability of the industry.</p>
	<p pid=".503W.8/3">Since the launch of the UK emissions trading scheme in April 2002 Defra has worked with the industry to overcome obstacles to their entry into the scheme. Defra is also engaging with the European Commission on their proposal for extending the EU emissions trading scheme to include a project mechanism in due course, which may allow credits to be claimed for coal mine methane projects.</p>
	<p pid=".503W.8/4">The Government consider that extending the renewables obligation to include coal mine methane would not be consistent with the objectives of the obligation, since coal mine methane is, self-evidently, not a renewable. However, we are very supportive of this industry and are keen to help it expand so that it can continue to reduce emissions throughout the UK.</p>

	<p pid=".505W.6/1">In 2001, BLIC (the liaison office of the European rubber industry) produced a life cycle analysis of car tyres. The report did not specify the environmental load of retreaded tyres, but did highlight the importance of rolling resistance as a factor in determining its benefits.</p>
	<p pid=".505W.6/2">Retreaded tyres, nevertheless, would seem to offer a number of advantages as an end-of-life recovery option because of the reduced requirement for raw materials in their manufacture, as compared with new tyres, and by providing the tyre with another life, thereby reducing the numbers of new tyres needed, and subsequently requiring disposal.</p>
	<p pid=".505W.6/3">The Department of Trade and Industry has recently commissioned a further study to examine the environmental credentials of tyre retreading.</p>

	<p pid=".506W.2/1">Waste Strategy 2000 (Cm4693&ndash;2) sets out our policies for sustainable waste management and the steps to achieving them. Minimising waste production and maximising re-use and recycling of waste are central to that policy.</p>
	<p pid=".506W.2/2">Our policy on municipal waste incinerators or other energy from waste facilities is that they should only be considered where it can be shown that they are appropriately sized so that they would not &quot;crowd out&quot; recycling. They should also include, wherever possible, combined heat and power systems which produce electricity and provide effective heating for homes and businesses.</p>
	<p pid=".506W.2/3">The Government have no plans for the number of incinerators or other energy from waste facilities that local authorities should provide, nor are there any targets for the production of energy from waste. The Regulatory Impact Assessment of Waste Strategy 2000 (published in Annex C of Part 2 of the strategy) assessed a variety of waste management scenarios and provided broad ranges for numbers of required facilities. Variables included different projections for waste growth, different mixes of waste management facilities, and differing levels of participation in recycling schemes. A similar exercise was carried out by the Strategy Unit and published in their report &quot;Waste not, Want not&quot; in November last year.</p>

	<p pid=".507W.5/1">Burning of wood from sustainably managed forests for energy production does not contribute to the UK's carbon dioxide emissions as the gas released through combustion will be absorbed by new tree growth. Wood combustion does contribute to the UK's emissions of methane and nitrousoxide. These gases have a global warming potential, but even when this is taken into account, the overall impact, in terms of greenhouse gas emissions per unit of energy input, is unlikely to exceed 15 per cent. of the impact of fossil fuel combustion for wood burnt domestically in open grates, or 5 per cent.of the impact of fossil fuel combustion for wood burnt in combustion plant.</p>
	<p pid=".507W.5/2">Emissions associated with the management, harvesting and transportation of wood are small relative to total energy content of the wood. Nevertheless minimising transportation distances and improving the efficiency of transportation should be included as factors in the evaluation of proposals for new wood fuel developments.</p>
	<p pid=".507W.5/3">The combustion of wood, as opposed to coal or oil, produces low emissions of sulphur dioxide as wood has a lower sulphur content. Wood also tends to be burnt at lower temperatures than coal or oil which, in general, results in lower emissions of oxides of nitrogen compared to those from other fuels. Burning wood can also produce small amounts of benzene, particles, lead and polycylic aromatic hydrocarbons. Estimates of emissions of the main air pollutants from domestic and industrial wood combustion, compared with the UK totals, are set out in the Appendix.</p>
	<p pid=".507W.5/4">Depending on the soil in which the biomass is grown, wood can contain heavy metals which on burning are retained in the ash. Inefficient burning can leave some carbon in the ash therefore polyaromatic hydrocarbons must also be considered. If concentration thresholds for either are exceeded, ash should be disposed of in a controlled manner. However a recent compilation of data on UK wood suggests that heavy metal concentration in ash will not constitute a hazard to human health or the environment. Since ash contains a range of important nutrients there is the possibility of returning it as a fertiliser to forests.</p>
	<p pid=".507W.5/5">An overall assessment of the emissions impact from an increase in the use of wood as fuel depends on the fuel it replaces, the efficiency of the combustion systems and the abatement technology used.</p>
	<p pid=".507W.5/6">Greater use of wood fuel can assist in limiting CO2 emissions, and other emissions can be minimised by maximising the efficiency of the combustion process, and by installing appropriate abatement control. Increases in the use of wood will be largely based on efficient and environmentally friendly systems developed to meet stringent emission standards. Grant schemes introduced recently to encourage greater use of biomass specify highly efficient combustion and abatement systems.</p>
	<p pid=".507W.5/7">Additional markets for wood will encourage more active management of forests which in turn will encourage their regeneration whilst improving structural diversity and biodiversity.</p>

	<p pid=".511W.2/1">The high cost of drugs is a key barrier to poor people's ability to access essential medicines. The pharmaceutical industry, in partnership with the international community and donor governments, provide some medicines at preferential prices to the developing world. The Government have been working with partners to make a major advance towards the widespread and sustainable access to medicines to the world's poor, including through pharmaceutical companies providing medicines for HIV/AIDS, TB and Malaria at close to the cost of manufacture. However there is a risk that such medicines can be diverted and sold by 'middle men' back to developed country markets where they can be sold at a higher price. The extent of this problem can vary. Last year one company reported that roughly 25 per cent. of its preferentially priced AIDS medicines were diverted back to the EU.</p>
	<p pid=".511W.2/2">Our High Level Working Group on increasing Access to Essential Medicines examined ways of minimising the problem. In the long-term, strengthening developing country health systems will better equip countries to minimise product leakage. DFID has committed over &pound;1.5 billion since 1997 to health systems strengthening in poorer countries. Other strategies to minimise diversion include, developing distinctive packaging and labelling of preferentially priced medicines, and implementing customs regulations in wealthier markets which prohibit re- importation. The European Union is currently discussing a regulation which would include such measures.</p>

	<p pid=".511W.5/1">US$196 million was awarded to the Malawi Global Fund Coordinating Committee in August 2002 for HIV/AIDS. This is currently the largest GFATM award in Africa. A further USD 40 million was approved in February 2003 for scaling up prevention and treatment of Malaria.</p>
	<p pid=".511W.5/2">A review of Global Fund proposals in five countries, including Malawi, was undertaken in August 2002. It highlights the challenge in Malawi to absorb the additional finance given the prevailing health service infrastructure. There are major shortages of appropriately trained staff. The public sector is experiencing high attrition both from dissatisfaction with terms and conditions of service and as a direct result of AIDS. The GFATM proposal also requires extensive laboratory facilities which are currently lacking and qualified technicians and are in short supply.</p>
	<p pid=".511W.5/3">Accordingly the Global Fund is phased so that initial stages concentrate on building capacity for service delivery. The Global Fund proposal is complemented by several other initiatives in the health sector, including work supported by my Department in strengthening essential medical laboratory services, medical supplies management, and improved mechanisms for coordinating donor support. The DFID mainstreaming strategy will help strengthen the institutional framework for a multi-sectoral HIV response by supporting posts in government and key institutions including WHO, UNAIDS and the World bank.</p>

	<p pid=".513W.2/1">It is difficult to find clear statistics on access to clean water in Iraq. The WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply and Sanitation Coverage, the official UN reference system for monitoring water coverage statistics, provides figures for most of the years in question. (Given the difficulties in routinely measuring safe water, their surveys measure the presence of water facilities of different technology types. Improved water supplies are defined as those inherently safer than other types of supplies. They include: household connection; public standpipe; bore hole; protected dug well; protected spring; or rainwater collection. Not improved water supplies include: unprotected well; unprotected spring; vendor-provided water; bottled water; tanker truck-provided water.) In their estimates for 1980&ndash;2000, the following figures for access to improved water supplies in Iraq are provided:</p>
	<table>
		<caption>Percentage</caption>
		<thead>
			<tr pid=".513W.2/5"> <th>Year</th> <th>Urban</th> <th>Rural</th> </tr>

		<tbody>
			<tr pid=".513W.2/8"> <td>1985</td> <td>100</td> <td>54</td> </tr>

	</table>
	<p pid=".513W.2/15">DFID cannot confirm the reliability of these figures. It should be noted that, while water is supplied to most urban households (and therefore classified as 'improved'), a high proportion of this water is not treated. There are also understood to be significant regional disparities in supply coverage within Iraq.</p>

	<p pid=".514W.5/1">Nearly two thirds of the world's population will be living in countries of significant water stress by the year 2025, with the increasing possibility of conflicts over water becoming more common. One in five people in the world lack access to safe drinking water and nearly half lack access to sanitation. Misuse of resources and poor management have resulted in depleted supplies, falling water tables, shrinking inland lakes and stream flows reduced to ecologically unsustainable levels. In addition water pollution, from mainly human activities, is decreasing the amount of water suitable for many uses. At the Johannesburg World Summit on Sustainable Development strong commitments were made for better management of water resources and improved access to drinking water and sanitation and these must now be implemented.</p>
	<p pid=".514W.5/2">In this context, initiatives that support the assessment of water resources and build capacity for the sustainable management of available resources are increasingly important. The UNESCO led World Water Assessment Programme (WWAP), has been supported by DFID, from its outset in mid-2000. It is an effective long-term Programme providing assessment, monitoring and reporting of the people-centred status of the world's water. The UN World Water Development Report (WWDR)&mdash;'Water for People Water for Life' which has just been released, is the first major output from the programme and will be presented at the 3rd world water forum in Kyoto, Japan, this week. The report represents the combined efforts of 23 UN agencies and convention secretariats and is now the most comprehensive and up-to-date information on the state of the world's freshwater resources. The availability of rigorous and authoritative water information at appropriate scales in the public domain will influence actions by others and allow critical issues to be identified.</p>

	<p pid=".515W.3/1" class="holdinganswer">pursuant to the Prime Minister's answer, <phrase class="date" code="2003-03-14">14 March 2003</phrase>, c. 482W</p>
	<p pid=".515W.3/2">The Attorney-General has given a written answer to a question from Baroness Ramsey in the House of Lords today in the following terms:</p>
	<p pid=".515W.3/3">Authority to use force against Iraq exists from the combined effect of resolutions 678, 687 and 1441. All of these resolutions were adopted under Chapter VII of the UN Charter which allows the use of force for the express purpose of restoring international peace and security:</p>
	<p pid=".515W.3/4" class="indent">1. In resolution 678 the Security Council authorised force against Iraq, to eject it from Kuwait and to restore peace and security in the area.</p>
	<p pid=".515W.3/5" class="indent">2. In resolution 687, which set out the ceasefire conditions after Operation Desert Storm, the Security Council imposed continuing obligations on Iraq to eliminate its weapons of mass destruction in order to restore international peace and security in the area. Resolution 687 suspended but did not terminate the authority to use force under resolution 678.</p>
	<p pid=".515W.3/6" class="indent">3. A material breach of resolution 687 revives the authority to use force under resolution 678.</p>
	<p pid=".515W.3/7" class="indent">4. In resolution 1441 the Security Council determined that Iraq has been and remains in material breach of resolution 687, because it has not fully complied with its obligations to disarm under that resolution.</p>
	<p pid=".515W.3/8" class="indent">5. The Security Council in resolution 1441 gave Iraq &quot;a final opportunity to comply with its disarmament obligations&quot; and warned Iraq of the &quot;serious consequences&quot; if it did not.</p>
	<p pid=".515W.3/9" class="indent">6. The Security Council also decided in resolution 1441 that, if Iraq failed at any time to comply with and co-operate fully in the implementation of resolution 1441, that would constitute a further material breach.</p>
	<p pid=".515W.3/10" class="indent">7. It is plain that Iraq has failed so to comply and therefore Iraq was at the time of resolution 1441 and continues to be in material breach.</p>
	<p pid=".515W.3/11" class="indent">8. Thus, the authority to use force under resolution 678 has revived and so continues today.</p>
	<p pid=".515W.3/12" class="indent">9. Resolution 1441 would in terms have provided that a further decision of the Security Council to sanction force was required if that had been intended. Thus, all that resolution 1441 requires is reporting to and discussion by the Security Council of Iraq's failures, but not an express further decision to authorise force.</p>
	<p pid=".515W.3/13">I have lodged a copy of this answer, together with resolutions 678, 687 and 1441 in the Library of both Houses.</p>

	<p pid=".516W.6/1">My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has a legal duty to compile and publish lists of buildings of special architectural or historic importance. These lists are in the public domain, and can be accessed through local authorities, records offices, libraries, English Heritage and DCMS. Many other groups will also hold information on listed buildings, including amenity societies and local interest groups.</p>
	<p pid=".516W.6/2">English Heritage undertook a security review in 2000 which looked into the implications of placing photographs of private buildings on the internet. The review consulted with the police, insurers and technical experts and concluded that no evidence could be found to support a link between the kind of information English Heritage is publishing on the internet and any physical threats to property security.</p>

	<p pid=".517W.10/27">The DTI supports the Queen's Awards for Enterprise. The Queens Awards is an interdepartmental scheme and the responsible minister is the Prime Minister, advised by an Advisory Committee chaired by the Head of the Home Civil Service. The Queen's Awards were instituted by Royal Warrant in 1965, as &quot;The Queen's Awards to Industry&quot;. All organisations&mdash;large, medium or small&mdash;which operate regularly as a 'business unit' of the UK economy, and which can meet the criteria, are eligible to apply; they do not need to be sponsored or nominated and usually apply on their own behalf.</p>
	<p pid=".517W.10/28">The Queen's Award has three separate categories: International Trade, which recognises and rewards not only export earnings but any return on overseas investment; Innovation, which covers marketing, sales and support associated with technological innovation; and Sustainable Development, which spans environmental, social, and economic sustainability. The common theme across all three categories is that successful applicants must be able to demonstrate commercial success.</p>

	<p pid=".517W.10/30">Following the announcement, in April, winners are usually invited to a celebratory reception, attended by a member of the Royal family, to mark their success. Later in the year, winners are invited to send three representatives to a reception given by HM The Queen at Buckingham Palace. There is also a formal presentation ceremony, usually during the summer, at the winners' premises by the Lord-Lieutenant of the County as The Queen's representative. All of these events help to generate national and regional coverage. The Awards consist of a Grant of Appointment and a presentational crystal bowl engraved with the Award Emblem.</p>

	<p pid=".522W.0/3">This contract was fully investigated in the 1996 report on the inquiry into the export of defence equipment and dual-use goods to Iraq and related prosecutions by the then Sir Richard Scott (now Lord Scott of Foscote) which concluded that &quot;a unilateral ban by the UK on the export of such plant or chemicals to Iraq would have achieved nothing useful&quot;.</p>

	<p pid=".522W.3/1">My noble Friend the Minister for Science, regularly meets representatives from various companies and institutions at his office in the Department of Trade and Industry and at other neutral venues, for example conference centres.

This could mean that the Minister met at least one representative from the host organisation as part of the visit even if the actual event was for a different purpose.</p>

	<p pid=".525W.8/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid=".525W.8/2">A risk assessment of perchloroethylene (tetrachloro-ethylene), conducted under the Existing Substances Regulation (European Community Council Regulation No. 793/93) is being led by the United Kingdom. The Health and Safety Executive acts jointly with my Department to form the United Kingdom Competent Authority for these activities. The risk assessment will critically evaluate the risks to the environment, workers, consumers and the general public from exposure to perchloroethylene. The risk assessment includes exposure as a result of dry cleaning operations.</p>
	<p pid=".525W.8/3">At present, the human health sections of the draft report are being updated to take account of new information. Once the risk assessment is finalised, the United Kingdom Competent Authority will consider whether further measures beyond those currently in place are required to control exposure to perchloroethylene. Proposals for marketing and use restrictions are one of a number of further measures that can be considered under the Existing Substances Regulation.</p>
	<p pid=".525W.8/4">The Solvents Emissions Directive (1999/13/EC) places limits on emissions of solvents used in a number of processes, including dry cleaning. It also sets timetables for the replacement by less harmful substances of those solvents used in these processes that have been assigned to a risk phrase of R45, R46, R49, R60, or R61. The Directive has already been partly transposed. I expect to begin consultations soon on how the remaining parts of this Directive will be transposed, including the provisions applying to the dry cleaning sector.</p>

	<p pid=".529W.2/2">As of July 2002, there were 6,489 regular personnel in the Defence Medical Services (DMS) excluding student nurses and other new entry trainees. Of these, at any one time some will be unavailable for operational duty within the United Kingdom as a result of medical downgrading. As of November 2002, the latest date for which figures are available, 131 were unavailable for such duty as a result of medical downgrading. In practice, the number of DMS personnel available for operational duty in the United Kingdom will depend on other commitments including deployment on overseas operations, training and exercises, and retained tasks.</p>

When ranges are temporarily in use by military personnel, the standards for security of personnel and their equipment, is the same as those which apply at permanent MOD establishments and sites. Some ranges, for example the one at West Freugh, are MOD owned but managed by QinetiQ, a commercial company. Security at these sites is the responsibility of the contractor, and is normally implemented by a civilian guard force, supported by the local constabulary. As a commercial company, QinetiQ complies with Government-wide security regulations issued by the Cabinet Office, rather than with MOD security procedures. MOD reserves the right, however, to take such additional measures as we consider necessary to protect our Service personnel and materiel when making use of these ranges.</p>

The Department has its own analytical capability situated in the Defence Analytical and Services Agency, where much of this groundwork is undertaken. Social trends are identified primarily through commissioned research. This provides access to a wide range of research information across Government Departments, for example labour trends, demography, and census statistics. Targeted research contracts are also placed, as necessary, to improve our understanding of the employment market in which we compete. Recruiting risks are identified from this research and from very close scrutiny of the emerging performance of the recruiting machine.</p>
	<p pid=".532W.9/2">As far as retention is concerned, a key part of the pay and workforce strategy for the armed forces is the identification of high level risks and the levers that can be used to ameliorate those risks. Within that strategy, underpinning policies are reviewed in the light of evidence obtained both from routine surveys (for example Continuous Attitude Surveys) and from discrete research on specific topics.</p>

	<p pid=".536W.5/2" class="letterfrom">Letter from Tim Matthews to Andrew Bennett, dated <phrase class="date" code="2003-03-17">17 March 2003</phrase></p>
	<p pid=".536W.5/3" class="indent">I have been asked by the Transport Minister, David Jamieson, to reply to your recent Parliamentary Question asking if all the compensation to householders resulting from the construction of the M60 had been paid; if there are any steps in place to reduce fees for agents and if claimants are being paid interest for late pay outs.</p>
	<p pid=".536W.5/4" class="indent">I believe that you are referring primarily to compensation under Part I of the Land Compensation Act 1973 (as amended). Such claims, for the depreciation in the value of property arising from the use of a new or altered highway, can be made for a period of 6 years from the first claim date which falls 12 months after the road is opened to traffic. In the case of the M60 Manchester Outer Ring Road construction was undertaken in four contracts, resulting in a variety of claim periods.</p>
	<p pid=".536W.5/5" class="indent">The main body of construction work (Contracts 1&amp; 3) led to the road being opened on <phrase class="date" code="2000-10-30">30 October 2000</phrase> and a first claim date of <phrase class="date" code="2001-10-30">30 October 2001</phrase>. We have received over 14,000 claims to date and continue to receive them at the rate of approximately 300 per month Around 1,000 claims have been settled so far. On Contract 4, for which the claim period closed last month, we have 22 cases awaiting settlement. Another 322 cases remain unsettled on Contract 2, for which the claim period remains open until December 2004. In all cases interest, calculated from the date the claim is received (or the first claim date, if later) until the date that compensation is paid, is added to the compensation.</p>
	<p pid=".536W.5/6" class="indent">In addition to Part I compensation, we have also compensated people for the acquisition of land and property in connection with the construction of the road. Around 200 such cases have yet to be finalised. In these types of cases interest, calculated from the date of entry on to the land until the date that compensation is paid, is added to the compensation.</p>
	<p pid=".536W.5/7" class="indent">Following the abolition of the non statutory Ryde's Scale, which fixed surveyors fees in proportion to the level of compensation paid, claimants' surveyors must now demonstrate that the fees proposed have been properly incurred, are reasonable and proportionate to both the compensation at stake and the complexity of the claim, and commensurate with the time, effort and expertise required to deal with the case.</p>

	<p pid=".540W.0/1">Charities benefit from special VAT zero rates and exemptions worth around &pound;200 million a year. However, long-standing formal agreements with our European partners mean there is no scope to extend the range of these reliefs or introduce any new ones.</p>
	<p pid=".540W.0/2">The Government recognise the valuable contribution that voluntary groups and charities make in delivering services, and realise that the question of irrecoverable VAT provides difficulties for some charities. The Review of Charity Taxation looked carefully at the problem of irrecoverable VAT and concluded, for reasons of principle and affordability that no changes should be made. In response to representations during the recent Cross-Cutting Review of the Role of the Voluntary and Community Sector in Service Delivery, the Government considered the issue afresh to determine once and for all whether the obstacles presented by irrecoverable VAT could be overcome. Having considered all the options available, including a targeted compensation fund, the Government concluded that no fundamental change should be made to the way the VAT system operates and the available resources would be better deployed through the new investment fund, 'futurebuilders'. This is a one-off &pound;125 million investment, over the three years of the 2002 Spending Review, specifically to assist voluntary and community sector service-providing organisations in their public service work. The Treasury is leading on the design of 'futurebuilders' in close co-operation with the voluntary and community sector, and the Government intend to conduct wide consultation between April and June this year.</p>

	<p pid=".545W.13/1">The Government are committed to tackling domestic violence. My Department's main responsibility as a member of the Inter-Ministerial Group on Domestic Violence is to develop co-ordination between the criminal, civil and family courts to make sure that victims of domestic violence and their families have a swift and effective route to protection, and perpetrators of violence are brought to justice. We intend to do this through improving training and raising awareness amongst the professional judiciary and magistrates.</p>
	<p pid=".545W.13/2">My Department recently launched a guide on civil remedies and criminal sanctions against abusers aimed to assist those who advise victims of their options.</p>
	<p pid=".545W.13/3">Where necessary we will improve court processes through legislation, as we did with the Adoption and Children Act 2002 (ACA 2002) and the Children Act 1989. As a consequence of the ACS 2002, the application form used to apply for contact or residence will be amended so that the applicant can indicate, and give details about, whether abuse has taken place. The respondent will then also have a chance to comment. This will mean that judges will be aware early in the proceedings; that domestic abuse is alleged and findings of fact can be made before contact or residence are considered.</p>
	<p pid=".545W.13/4">We have also published guidelines for the courts and other professionals which provide a structured and consistent approach for all court users in how to deal with contact cases where domestic violence is an issue. Their effectiveness is being monitored and evaluated.</p>
	<p pid=".545W.13/5">A safety stakeholder group was set up to advise on how to improve our handling of domestic violence in proceedings involving children, and promote safe contact. Representatives from the judiciary, academics, practitioners and parents' and children's organisations are involved.</p>
	<p pid=".545W.13/6">We have carried out a mapping exercise of the provision of child contact services, including centres where supervised contact is available, to help us to develop a national network of child contact centres that work to agreed standards. We are supporting child contact centres on their strategy for expanding and improving their services by putting in extra Government funding [over &pound;1.7 million over the past two years] and an additional &pound;2.5 million from Children's Fund announced in February 2003.</p>
	<p pid=".545W.13/7">We will be working closely wi;th colleagues in the Home Office and other Departments to take various issues forward through the forthcoming domestic violence consultation paper and proposed subsequent draft bill later in the year.</p>
	<p pid=".545W.13/8">With the help of our key stakeholder advisory groups we will continue to identify further action in every area of our responsibilities, and in those areas of responsibility that we share with other Government Departments, to make sure that tackling domestic violence and protecting its victims (adults and children) are given the priority they deserve.</p>

	<p pid=".555W.2/1">Learning disability partnership boards were set up as a key part of the arrangements for implementing the White Paper, &quot;Valuing People: A New Strategy for Learning Disability for the 21st Century&quot; (Cm 5086), published in March 2001. The role and functions of these boards were described in guidance issued in August 2001 (HSC 2001/016; LAC(2001)23).</p>
	<p pid=".555W.2/2">The role of partnership boards is broadly to create strong local partnerships between providers of services, learning disabled people and family carers. Their aim is to develop local strategies to improve the opportunities for learning disabled people to be included as fully as possible in society and have greater independence and choice in their lives.</p>
	<p pid=".555W.2/3">We hope that partnership boards will try to raise the profile of learning disability issues in their local areas, and to encourage their members, such as local authorities and primary care trusts, to do the same. This would support strongly the aim of greater inclusion of learning disabled people. We would therefore encourage boards to let local people know about their activities.</p>
	<p pid=".555W.2/4">It would not be appropriate to issue specific guidance on this matter, which is clearly a matter for local decision. However, the valuing people support team, which has been set up to promote good practice and share practical experience across the country, has given practical advice to boards in its newsletters of July 2002 and February 2003 on making meetings available to the public. We support these messages. The support team website is at <a href="http://www.doh.qov.uk/vpst">http://www.doh.qov.uk/vpst</a>.</p>

	<p pid=".555W.5/1">The mental health needs of current servicemen and women are met under the auspices of the Ministry of Defence, who are also responsible for ensuring that military and medical personnel receive appropriate training. The national health service provides services, by trained staff, to former service personnel alongside the general public according to their needs. Recent additional investment in mental health services and a comprehensive programme of modernisation will ensure that all those who have mental health needs are able to access appropriate treatment more quickly. Further information about this is available on the Department of Health web site at <a href="http://www.doh.gov.uk/mentalhealth">www.doh.gov.uk/mentalhealth</a>. Additional guidance for general practitioners first issued following the events in the USA on <phrase class="date" code="2001-09-11">11 September 2001</phrase> was re-issued last year; this specifically draws attention to the needs of service personnel.</p>

This change will protect an estimated 87,000 children in England who would otherwise lose their entitlement because of planned changes to the tax credit and welfare system from April 2003. We estimate that an additional 75,000 children will become entitled to free school meals as a result of this change.</p>

	<p pid=".565W.6/1">The Graduate Contribution Scheme described in the White Paper 'The future of higher education' (Cm 5735) will apply to full-time undergraduate students only. The Open University is the main higher education institution providing distance learning for students who are geographically remote from its campus. The majority of such students are part-time and will not, therefore, be affected by the Graduate Contribution Scheme. For part-time students, the Open University will continue to set its own fee levels as now. However from 2004&ndash;05 students will benefit from a new package of support for part-time students. For those on courses which are equivalent to 50 per cent. or more of a full-time course, there will be means-tested tuition fee support, applied for through LEAs. This replaces the current discretionary fee waiver scheme and doubles the number of part-time students eligible for help with their fees. Students who get fee support will also be able to apply for a &pound;250 grant from their LEA instead of a loan. And students entitled to fee support who have children will get help with their child care from the Access to Learning Fund. Also from 2004&ndash;05, we are extending discretionary fee waivers and hardship support for the first time to certain students on courses which are equivalent to at least 10 per cent. of a full-time course.</p>

	<p pid=".568W.0/1">We expect all higher education institutions to have a role in delivering the aims of the White Paper (Cm 5735). The Open University is particularly well placed to deliver the flexible teaching and learning which is vital to an inclusive higher education sector. Such flexible learning helps attract people with different demands and commitments. In addition, the Open University's modular approach to assessment and accreditation supports the aim of increasing credit based study.</p>
	<p pid=".568W.0/2">From 2004&ndash;05, students at the Open University will also benefit from a new package of support for new and existing part-time students. For those on courses which are equivalent to 50 per cent. or more of a full-time course, there will be means-tested tuition fee support, applied for through LEAs. This replaces the current discretionary fee waiver scheme and doubles the number of part-time students eligible for help with their fees. Students who get fee support will also be able to apply for a &pound;250 grant from their LEA instead of a loan. And students entitled to fee support who have children will get help with their child care from the Access to Learning Fund. Also from 2004&ndash;05, we are extending discretionary fee waivers and hardship support for the first time to certain students on courses which are equivalent to at least 10 per cent. of a full-time course.</p>

	<p pid=".575W.2/1">Crime and Disorder Reduction Partnerships (CDRPs) are required to conduct an audit of crime and disorder in their area and every three years, publish a strategy to tackle problems in their area. The CDRP is required to implement the strategy and keep it under review to monitor its effectiveness and make any necessary changes. Recorded crime figures at CDRP level are published in the Home Office Statistical Bulletin.</p>
	<p pid=".575W.2/2">Measures in the Police Reform Act 2002 maintain the requirement for CDRPs to monitor their own progress and introduce new reporting mechanisms for CDRPs to advise progress on the implementation of their strategy to the Secretary of State. The new reporting process will be introduced during 2003&ndash;04 and will look for CDRPs to monitor progress on reducing crime and disorder and the misuse of drugs and on the effectiveness of local partnership working arrangements.</p>

	<p pid=".583W.2/2">The YJB requires custodial establishments to provide access to substance misuse assessments, care plan development, withdrawal services and education/awareness programmes.</p>
	<p pid=".583W.2/3">Prison Service Drugs Strategy Directorate is responsible for drugs services in young offender institutions (YOIs). The Prison Service model for delivering druges services is CARATs (Counselling, Assessment, Referral, Advice and Throughcare services). CARATs services can be provided by both prison service staff and external agencies. All young peole should be screened by health staff as part of their general induction assessment. CARATs staff support this process and may provide specialist intervention as appropriate.</p>
	<p pid=".583W.2/4">STCs and LASUs generally provide in-house substance misuse services managed by each unit's health provision and education services. Some LASUs also commission additional specialist services from the community. Young people are screened on arrival to the units, and prevention education takes place as pat of personal social health education.</p>
	<p pid=".583W.2/5">Recognising that there is inconsistent provision across the secure estate, the YJB has commissioned Galahad consultants to identify the substance misuse needs of young people in custody, the level of current service provision and gaps. Their final report will be available in June 2003 and will inform future work in this area. The YJB has also commissioned Drugscope to develop effective practice guidance for youth justice staff on working with young people with substance misuse needs; this will be available in June 2003.</p>
	<p pid=".583W.2/6">The national drug strategy relaunched by the Home Office in December 2002 identifies as a priority vulnerable young people and those within the youth justice system. The YJB has been allocated &pound;300 million over three years from 2003 to improve substance misuse services across the juvenile secure estate.</p>

	<p pid=".585W.2/1">The Prison Service has in place a range of drug interventions to address the needs of low, moderate and severe drug-misusing prisoners who are either on remand or serving sentences of less than two years.

	<p pid=".585W.2/2">The Service recognises that many prisoners who serve two years or less are likely&mdash;due to their sentence length&mdash;to be excluded from participation in drug rehabilitation programmes. The Service has, as part of the recent Spending Review 2002 settlement, received significant funding to boost treatment provision. Part of this funding will be channelled into developing a low-intensity programme specifically targeted at those prisoners who will only be in custody for a short period.</p>

	<p pid=".585W.5/1">Drug detoxification is available in all local and remand prisons. Detoxification can be made available to reduce the effects of withdrawal symptoms from specific drugs or to provide maintenance prescribing. The Counselling, Assessment, Referral, Advice and Throughcare (CARAT) service is available in all prisons as is access to the voluntary drug programme.</p>
	<p pid=".585W.5/2">Prisoners who serve two years or less are likely, due to sentence length, to be unable to participate in a drug rehabilitation programme. The Prison Service received funding from the recent Spending Review 2002 to boost treatment provision. Part of this funding will be used to develop a programme specifically targeted at those prisoners who will be in custody for a short period.</p>

	<p pid=".588W.2/1">A performance bonus can be paid to Premier Prison Services Ltd if the contractor reduces recidivism in respect of the proportion of prisoners at the therapeutic community at Dovegate prison who have undertaken at least 15 months therapy in the community. They must also not have committed an offence within 12 months of release from custody; There has been insufficient time for a bonus to become payable because the therapeutic community only opened in November 2001.</p>

	<p pid=".592W.2/1">I understand that my hon. Friend means what we estimate the cost would be of establishing a funded pension scheme applying to new recruits only. As stated in the National Policing Plan we are considering options for modernising police pensions to make them more flexible and affordable for future entrants. As part of this reform, we will also seek to meet the needs of police authorities and chief officers for a scheme which brings greater certainty about the financial impact on individual police forces. Unlike in a pay-as-you go scheme, the employer pays contributions into a pension fund at the same time as the employee. The eventual pension is then paid out of the fund. In a pay-as-you go scheme the employer's costs are deferred until the pension comes into payment. The rate of employer's contributions in a funded police pension scheme for new entrants would depend mainly on the value of the pensions and other benefits provided, and the share borne by the officers. The immediate effect of introducing a funded scheme for new entrants, while keeping the existing scheme on a pay-as-you go basis, would be to increase costs. This is because the cost of paying employer contributions in respect of contributing members of a new funded scheme would be added to the continuing cost of paying the pension benefits of retired members of the current pay-as-you go scheme.</p>

	<p pid=".593W.5/1">A survey of mental ill health in the prison population of England and Wales, undertaken in 1997 by the Office for National Statistics, showed that some 10 per cent. of remanded men, 7 per cent. of sentenced men and 14 per cent. of all women prisoners had suffered from a functional psychosis in the past year. Some 59 per cent. of remanded men, 76 per cent. remanded women, 40 per cent. of sentenced men and 63 per cent. of sentenced women had a neurotic disorder in the week prior to being interviewed for the survey. These rates are considered to be still representative of the prison population. Applying them to the current population would indicate that, on any one day, there would be over 5,500 prisoners in England and Wales who would have suffered from symptoms of a functional psychosis in the previous 12 months and over 32,000 who would have suffered symptoms of a neurotic disorder in the previous week. Some prisoners will fall into both categories. All Prison Service establishments and their NHS partners are working to implement the improvements to mental health services set out in 'Changing the Outlook, a Strategy for Developing and Modernising Mental Health Services in Prisons' published in December 2001. Prisoners who need in-patient treatment for mental disorder may be transferred to psychiatric hospitals. The care and treatment of mentally disordered prisoners who do not need to be admitted to hospital is generally undertaken by prison healthcare staff under the supervision of NHS specialists and increasingly, in establishments with the greatest mental health need, by NHS-funded multi-disciplinary in-reach teams. The commitments made in the NHS Plan (2000), for an additional 300 staff to be employed by 2004 to provide such in-reach services to prisoners, are being implemented. Mental illness in the prison population of Scotland is a matter for the Scottish Executive. While the institutions in Northern Ireland are dissolved, responsibility for this subject rests with Ministers in the Northern Ireland Office.</p>

	<p pid=".595W.8/1">The Youth Inclusion Programme (YIP) is managed by the Youth Justice Board. Since 1999, 70 YIP schemes have run in the most deprived neighbourhoods in England and Wales, each targeting the 50 young people, aged 13 to 16 in the local area, at greatest risk of social .exclusion.</p>
	<p pid=".595W.8/2">We know that a total of 22,688 young people have been actively engaged in YIP schemes since the programme began, but a detailed breakdown of the number of 13 to 16-year-olds that have participated in each of the last four years in each of the 70 schemes is not available centrally. Nor do we hold data on arrests of all 13 to 16-year-olds, or overall levels of recorded crimes, broken down by the neighbourhoods in which each YIP scheme operates.</p>
	<p pid=".595W.8/3">We measure the success of the YIP schemes principally through arrest rates among the scheme's participants, which show that overall arrest rates have been reduced by 64 per cent. among those in the target group who have been actively engaged in the programme. In addition, independent evaluation of the YIP programme showed that between January and March 2002 around 70 per cent. of YIP areas showed reductions in overall crime, with reductions up to 40 per cent. We consider these to be more reliable measures of success than attempting to assess the extent to which the programme has reduced the risk that individual participants will subsequently offend.</p>
	<p pid=".595W.8/4">We announced on <phrase class="date" code="">21 October</phrase> last year that the existing YIP programme will continue for a further three years from April 2003, with Home Office funding of &pound;7 million per year. This is the minimum provision and does not prevent additional schemes being funded, for example by Children's Fund partnerships in meeting the requirement we are placing on them from April this year, to spend at least 25 per cent. of their allocations on specific youth crime reduction measures.</p>
	<p pid=".595W.8/5">We are looking more fundamentally at relevant services, programmes and interventions for young people at risk of crime and other negative outcomes in the Green Paper on children at risk that we will be publishing later in the spring.</p>

	<p pid=".596W.6/1">This Government will be spending an additional &pound;1 billion in 2003&ndash;04 as a result of the introduction of pension credit, rising to an additional &pound;2 billion in 2004&ndash;05. Total spending on pension credit in 2004&ndash;05 is projected to be around &pound;6 billion.</p>
	<p pid=".596W.6/2">From October 2003 pension credit will provide a guaranteed minimum income for those aged 60 and over. It will ensure pensioners with modest savings no longer lose a pound of pensions or other savings they have built up.</p>
	<p pid=".596W.6/3">It has been designed so that customers will find it easy to apply for, it will be simpler, fairer, less intrusive and bureaucratic. The weekly means test will be abolished so for those people over 65 they will need only to report major life events, with the majority of people not having to notify changes in their financial circumstances for a period of five years.</p>
	<p pid=".596W.6/4">This Government is committed to tackling pensioner poverty.</p>
	<p pid=".596W.6/5">From April 2003, no single pensioner will have to get by on an income of less than &pound;102.10 a week under the minimum income guarantee (&pound;155.80 for couples).</p>
	<p pid=".596W.6/6">Nearly two million people are benefiting from minimum income guarantee and the take up campaign has put an average &pound;20 a week extra in the pockets of 149,000 people who would not have received it otherwise. In the hon. Member's constituency around 1,500 people receive this entitlement.</p>
	<p pid=".596W.6/7">From April 2003, basic State Pension will be &pound;77.45 for singles (&pound;123.80 for couples). An increase of &pound;100 a year for single people and &pound;160 a year for couples. In future years the basic State Pension will increase by 2.5 per cent. or the level of the September RPI, whichever is higher.</p>
	<p pid=".596W.6/8">Last winter (2001&ndash;02) over eight million households benefited from the &pound;200 Winter Fuel Payment, worth around &pound;4 a week. It will continue at this rate for the rest of this Parliament. Some 18,305 people in the Huntingdon constituency received a Winter Fuel Payment for last winter.</p>
	<p pid=".596W.6/9">All in all, we will be spending around &pound;7.5 billion extra on pensioners in 2003&ndash;04 as a result of the measures introduced since 1997. This includes around &pound;3.5 billion that is being spent on the poorest third of pensioners.</p>

	<p pid=".597W.2/1">Our priority has always been to focus help on those who need it most, that is why we introduced the Minimum Income Guarantee. As a result, nearly two million people are benefiting from Minimum Income Guarantee and the take up campaign has put an average &pound;20 a week extra in the pockets of 149,000 people who would not have received it otherwise. In the hon. Member's constituency around 3,400 people are in receipt of the Minimum Income Guarantee.</p>
	<p pid=".597W.2/2">WE are now going a step further and introducing Pension Credit which will reward not penalise saving. The poorest third of pensioners will be at least &pound;1,500 a year better off than in 1997 due to this Government's tax and benefit changes.</p>
	<p pid=".597W.2/3">Around half of all pensioner households will be eligible for Pension Credit and, on average, stand to gain around &pound;400 a year. Pension Credit will be simple to apply for, and signals the end of the intrusive weekly means test that pensioners find so demeaning.</p>
	<p pid=".597W.2/4">Pension credit will provide a guaranteed minimum income for those aged 60 and over. No single pensioner will have to get by on an income of less than &pound;102.10 a week (&pound;155.80 for couples).</p>
	<p pid=".597W.2/5">It will also ensure pensioners, aged 65 and over with modest savings, no longer lose a pound of pensions or other savings they have built up. Pensioners will receive 60p for every pound of income they have between the level of the savings credit threshold and the guarantee level potentially giving them a maximum reward of &pound;14.79 (&pound;19.20 for couples). Above this level the savings credit will reduce progressively, with those on incomes over &pound;139 for single pensioners (&pound;203 for couples) ceasing to be entitled. (These limits will be higher for those with special needs or extra payments).</p>

	<p pid=".599W.6/1">We have made a pledge to tackle age discrimination and we are committed to introducing age legislation covering employment, vocational training and guidance by 2006.</p>
	<p pid=".599W.6/2">Our current Pensions Green Paper 'Simplicity, security and choice: Working and saving for retirement' reinforces our commitment to extend employment opportunities for people with a range of proposals including providing extra back to work help for over 50s, piloting local agents in the business community to help employers to realise the benefits of recruiting and retaining older workers, and a number of changes to tax and pension rules which will give individuals more choice and opportunity to stay in work longer. We have also made it clear that in the forthcoming age legislation compulsory retirement ages are likely to be unlawful, unless employers can show they are objectively justified. Employers will therefore need to adopt more flexible approaches to retirement.</p>
	<p pid=".599W.6/3">We are already encouraging employers to adopt non-ageist employment practices through our Age Positive Campaign. The campaign raises employers' awareness of the business benefits of an age diverse workforce and encourages a flexible approach to retirement to open up choice and opportunity for individuals to stay in work longer.</p>
	<p pid=".599W.6/4">In 1999, we published the Code of Practice on Age Diversity in Employment which sets out the standards for non-ageist approaches to recruitment, training, promotion, redundancy and retirement. The code was developed with leading organisations including the CBI, TUC, the Employers Forum on Age and Age Concern. Evaluation shows that from 1999 to 2001 the number of companies using age in recruitment had already fallen from 27 per cent. to 13 per cent. and the number of companies having a policy against employing older workers had dropped from 14 per cent to 7 per cent.</p>
	<p pid=".599W.6/5">Since then we have continued to promote the business case for recruiting, training and retaining older workers through the Age Positive campaign, workshops for smaller businesses, and publications including 'Good Practice in the Recruitment and Retention of Older Workers' (December 2001), 'Flexible Retirement: A Snapshot of Large Employers' Initiatives' (June 2002) and during Age Positive week, in December 2002 we published 'Age Diversity at Work: a practical guide for business'. The campaign has been attracting considerable media coverage and about 30,000 visits a month to the Age Positive website <a href="http://www.agepositive.gov.uk">www.agepositive.gov.uk</a>.</p>
	<p pid=".599W.6/6">From spring 1997 to spring 2002, our policies have helped increase the employment rate for people aged 50 to state pension age from over 64 per cent. to over 68 per cent. with nearly 900,000 more people aged 50 and over in work. This increase has been faster than the increase in the overall employment rate. Under New Deal 50 plus 92,000 people aged over 50 have moved off benefits and gone back to work from April 2000 to December 2002, claiming the programme's cash employment credit. We will build on this support to further increase the employment rate of older workers who have a wealth of skills and experience that can benefit individual businesses and the economy as a whole.</p>

	<p pid=".601W.8/2">The current system of National Insurance number prefixes was introduced through the departmental central index (DCI) in 1988.</p>
	<p pid=".601W.8/3">A National Insurance number (NINO) consists of a two letter prefix followed by six numbers between 0 and 9, and a one letter suffix.There is no particular reason for the format of a particular NINO, nor does it carry any particular meaning. Only the first two prefixes, provide an indication of when the number was created. The number itself bears no relation to the individual it is allocated to and contains no geographical or personal significance. Allocations are made on a last digit numerical sequence (e.g. AB000001A would be followed by AB000002A).</p>
	<p pid=".601W.8/4">Certain letters, such as D, F and I are not used as there is the potential for confusion with other letters if badly formed. Likewise, the letter O is not used as the second letter as it might be confused with the number 0 (zero).</p>

Where appropriate, it informs the customer of occasions where Home Responsibilities Protection has been applied. Further, in divorced and widowed cases, the forecast shows where a spouse's contributions have been used to calculate an individual's likely state pension.

	<p pid=".604W.5/1">The aim of both update 1 and the amendments to the regulations is to maintain fairness between those who transfer out of schemes and those who remain. Reports in the press imply that the measures would lock individuals into their pension schemes. That is not true.</p>
	<p pid=".604W.5/2">The Occupational Pensions Regulatory Authority (OPRA) will not be preventing members from transferring out of pension schemes, nor are they endorsing such an approach. OPRA have made it clear that it is up to trustees to decide whether to delay quotes of transfer values. In doing so trustees will want to take into account the funding position of the scheme and the effect of transfers on members who remain in the scheme. The measures are short term and will only apply until the amended regulations come into force.</p>
	<p pid=".604W.5/3">There is no central record of members who apply for a transfer value and it is therefore not possible to monitor those who may be affected by OPRA's guidance. It is important that the calculation of transfer values is fair to all, to those who leave and those who stay. If a scheme is underfunded and an unreduced transfer value is taken, it affects all members who remain in the scheme. On the whole, it is likely that more members will benefit from OPRA's measures than be adversely affected.</p>
	<p pid=".604W.5/4">The timing and process of the consultation on the regulations is not affected by OPRA's interim guidance; how respondents reply to the consultation is of course a matter for them.</p>

	<p pid=".607W.6/2" class="indent">The Beacon Council Scheme to identify excellence in local government and enable best practice to be shared with others. Ministers award beacon status annually on the basis of a rigorous assessment and recommendations from an independent Advisory Panel. Participating authorities are informed approximately one week before the results are made public. The Beacon authorities are generally announced in April each year and all local authorities in England, and a range of other interested parties, are notified of the results at this time.</p>
	<p pid=".607W.6/3" class="indent">The Green Flag Award Scheme recognises parks and green spaces that are managed and maintained to a high standard. The Green Pennant is awarded for good standards in green spaces that are managed by community and voluntary groups. Both awards are made annually. Participants are notified in confidence in the summer to allow for preparation of the announcements at the awards ceremonies in November.</p>
	<p pid=".607W.6/4" class="indent">The Award for Urban Renaissance for urban regeneration initiatives in England with a record of success was launched in 2002.

A press notice was issued, the outcome was reported by live webcast on the Urban Summit website and brochures were distributed. The award has been renamed the Deputy Prime Minister's Award for Sustainable Communities with the intention that it will be an annual award. The scope of the award has been extended to align with &quot;Sustainable Communities: Building for the Future&quot; and the broader aim of the Office.</p>
	<p pid=".607W.6/5" class="indent">The award for Outstanding Achievement in Social Housing at the Chartered Institute of Housing's National Housing Awards. The award celebrates excellence in the provision and delivery of social housing in the United Kingdom.

All award winners are announced at the awards ceremony in the autumn.</p>
	<p pid=".607W.6/6" class="indent">The award for Social Housing Provider of the Year.

	<p pid=".609W.2/1">The cost to local authorities of collecting the council tax in England is estimated to be &pound;319 million for the year 2002&ndash;03. The main cost to central Government is incurred by the Valuation Office Agency (VOA) which administers the council tax valuation list and is a party to appeals. The VOA budget for council tax work in 2002&ndash;03 is about &pound;14 million. Central Government also supports the costs of the independent Valuation Tribunals which hear appeals. The part of the Valuation Tribunals budget for 2002&ndash;03 relating to council tax work is approximately &pound;0.7 million. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister is responsible for the policy and legislation rather than the administration of council tax.</p>

	<p pid=".614W.11/1">The Right to Buy scheme allows tenants to purchase their homes at less than market value, but this does not involve any additional capital expenditure by the authority. The discount represents a reduction in the authority's capital receipt, 75 per cent. of which under current regulations has to be set aside for debt redemption or paying off credit arrangements. The accumulated balance of usable receipts may then, at the authority's discretion, be used to support their housing capital programme.</p>
