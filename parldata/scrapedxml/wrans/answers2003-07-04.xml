The permits will replace registered exemptions (unless a site is only carrying out recovery operations on de-polluted vehicles). Regulations to transpose this aspect of the Directive will be laid before Parliament shortly following a joint consultation with DTI which closed on <phrase class="date" code="2005-06-06">6 June</phrase> about implementing parts of the Directive.</p>

	<p pid=".510W.3/1">The UK Government are working to improve access to new and existing medicines, for poor people in developing countries, including for HIV/AIDS. The factors recognised by the World Health Organisation (WHO) that can improve poor peoples' access to medicines are: affordable pricing, sustainable financing, reliable health and supply systems and the rational selection and use of existing drugs.</p>
	<p pid=".510W.3/2">Clare Short chaired a High Level Working Group on Increasing Access to Essential Medicines in the Developing World, which examined these issues in detail. The Working Group made a series of recommendations for action which are being taken forward by a number of stakeholders.</p>
	<p pid=".510W.3/3">We need to work with others to tackle the issues affecting access, if we are to make progress. The recent G8 Summit at Evian also secured commitment to action on access to medicines. The G8 Health Action Plan is in line with the Working Group's recommendations and provides a good basis for future collaborative action with a range of stakeholders, including the pharmaceutical industry. We are devoting significant effort to taking this forward, particularly at country level.</p>
	<p pid=".510W.3/4">The Government have also supported efforts within the European Union to put in place an EU Regulation that will prevent the diversion or 'leakage' of cheaper products from developing countries back to the EU. This is to encourage companies to offer their medicines (including anti-retrovirals) at significantly lower prices to developing countries.</p>
	<p pid=".510W.3/5">With regard to generic production in particular, the UK is trying to find a solution to the outstanding issue from the Doha Declaration on Trade Related Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) and Public Health, i.e. how countries with insufficient or no manufacturing capacity in the pharmaceutical sector can make effective use of compulsory licensing procedures within the TRIPS Agreement.</p>

	<p pid=".511W.6/1">Our information on the health situation in Monrovia is provided by the UN, and international agencies maintaining a presence there, and the current assessment is that the situation is critical. In those areas that can be reached by humanitarian agencies, conditions are very poor. It is likely to be far worse in those areas of the country that cannot be reached. Only one hospital is functioning in Monrovia, currently run by ICRC, and a few additional clinics have been set up there following a lull in the fighting this week. Sanitation is virtually non-existent and water supplies are inadequate. A major cholera outbreak is likely in these conditions; health NGOs that remain operational are preparing to respond to this. Their activities have been hampered by looting of vehicles, fuel, drugs and medical supplies.</p>
	<p pid=".511W.6/2">We have committed a total of &pound;2.5 million for humanitarian activity in Liberia this year, including &pound;1.5 million in response to the recent upsurge in fighting. We have provided &pound;1,050,000 to support ICRC and &pound;450,000 to Medecins Sans Frontieres for secondary health care. These are the only two agencies maintaining expatriate medical teams in the country. We have also recently provided &pound;374,000 to support a MERLIN emergency health programme in Monrovia. We still have available a balance of &pound;626,000 for humanitarian interventions in Liberia which we intend to allocate to strengthen the geographical and sectoral coverage of the relief programme. We are in close touch with the UN and other agencies working in Liberia. We will meet with them on <phrase class="date" code="2003-07-08">8 July 2003</phrase> to review the position.</p>

	<p pid=".520W.2/1">As part of its role in supporting all 13 to 19-year-olds, the Connexions Service has a particular role to play in supporting young people with disabilities making the transition from compulsory education. Personal advisers will work with young people to help them identify their aspirations, including on careers, and how to work towards them. Government guidance to the Learning and Skills Council makes it clear that, in making its decisions on funding post-16 education and training provision, it should take account of any assessment made by the Connexions Service. We have made legal provision for Connexions support to continue up to the age of 25 for those young people with disabilities who are not in a position to receive appropriate support from adult guidance services. Given its importance, we are monitoring closely the impact Connexions is having in this area.</p>

	<p pid=".522W.5/1">All the information requested is not available. However, the National Housing Benefit Accuracy Review of 1997&ndash;98 estimated that between 0.7per cent. and 2.9 per cent. housing benefit claims in Scotland were fraudulent in 1997&ndash;98, with a further 1.2 per cent. to 3.7 per cent. strongly suspected of fraud and 0.2 per cent. to 0.8 per cent. mildly suspected of fraud. These figures cannot be broken down to individual local authority level.</p>
	<p pid=".522W.5/2">We have now begun, for the first time, an ongoing review of fraud and error in housing benefit. National estimates of fraud and error for 2002&ndash;03 are expected to be published in December 2003 with further, more detailed, analysis following in early 2004. However, the sample sizes used may allow estimates to be broken down to regional level but not local authority level. Due to improvements in methodology and definitions used in the Housing Benefit Review it is unlikely that meaningful comparisons will be able to be made with the 1997&ndash;98 Review.</p>
	<p pid=".522W.5/3">Information on the cost of fraud and error is not available separately for council tax benefit. The measurement of fraud and error is complex and expensive and therefore it is concentrated on benefits with the highest expenditure and risk of loss, such as housing benefit. However, the measures that we are taking to fight fraud and error in housing benefit will also serve to improve the accuracy of council tax benefit.</p>

	<p pid=".526W.9/38">The British Allergy Foundation's (BAF) report refers to the British Society for Allergy and Clinical Immunology (BSACI)'s 2001 handbook of national health service allergy clinics, which lists 86 NHS consultant led clinics in the United Kingdom as well as two nurse led services run by BSCAI members. There were an additional 15 clinics run by NHS consultants identified by BAF in the handbook. Six of these 101 clinics offered services led by a whole-time specialist allergist.</p>
	<p pid=".526W.9/39">Regarding plans to increase the number of speciality clinics, it is the role of strategic health authorities, in partnership with primary care trusts, to decide what services to provide for their populations including those with allergies. They are best placed to understand local health needs and commission services to meet them.</p>
	<p pid=".526W.9/40">A range of research projects on the epidemiology of allergies are completed or on-going. The International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood (ISAAC) was formed in 1991. Phase One measured the prevalence of childhood asthma, hayfever and atopic eczema for international comparisons. Phase Two began in 1998 and involves more intensive studies in a smaller number of countries. The Department of Health funded the UK contribution to Phase Two.</p>
	<p pid=".526W.9/41">The Food Standards Agency is currently funding a &pound;0.5 million project which aims to establish how common food allergy is among children between birth and 15 years of age. King's College London is leading a &pound;2.1 million EC-funded prospective study of the incidence and prognosis of allergy, allergic disease and low lung function in adults living in Europe. Also, The University of Manchester is leading a &pound;1.2 million EC-funded investigation of the prevalence, pathogenesis, treatment and prevention of sun allergy across Europe. Sun-provoked skin reactions are one of the commonest forms of allergy.</p>
	<p pid=".526W.9/42">Concerning training place availability, for 2003&ndash;04, trusts will have the opportunity to create up to five locally funded Specialist Registrars (SpR) training opportunities in allergy. Central funding will also be distributed to support the implementation of one additional SpR posts in immunology and trusts will also have the opportunity to create up to five locally funded SpR training opportunities.</p>

	<p pid=".528W.2/1">The majority of people who acquire aphasia have had a stroke. Our major vehicle for improving standards for stroke services is through the older people's national service framework (NSF) which sets specific milestones for improvement by 2004 of stroke services in primary care trusts (PCTs), specialist services and general hospitals that care for people suffering from a stroke. Our document, Improvement, Expansion and Reform, which sets for the national health service a Priorities and Planning Framework for 2003&ndash;6, makes clear that implementation of the older people's NSF is a top priority, and that the 2004 milestone around specialist stroke services is a key target.</p>
	<p pid=".528W.2/2">It is the role of strategic health authorities, in partnership with PCTs, to decide what services to provide for their populations including those with aphasia.. They are best placed to understand local health needs and commission services to meet them.</p>

It would be for CSCI itself to develop detailed protocols for how such complaints should be managed. If the complainant remained dissatisfied with the outcome of such an investigation, then their complaint could be referred to the Parliamentary Ombudsman. The Bill would not place a duty upon CSCI to make public complaints that have been made against it. However, in its annual report to Parliament CSCI would have a duty to report on the way it has exercised their functions over the course of the year. This report would be expected to give general details of the number and type of complaints that have been made.</p>

However the Government Actuary's forecast for the number of live births predicts a small increase in the birth rate over the next ten to fifteen years. This means that the overall incidence of congenital heart disease is set to rise slightly; that is, from 4,577 children in the year 2002 to an estimated 4,723 children to be born in 2014. The prevalence of congenital heart disease; that is, the total number of people living with the disease, will continue to rise, as treatments continue to become more successful.</p>

	<p pid=".543W.2/1">Figures for the numbers of children diagnosed as being clinically obese are not available. Obesity is normally measured in terms of body mass index (BMI). There are emerging international standards to define childhood obesity but they were developed among a population that was not representative of English children. An alternative method monitors the percentage of children who are above the 95th percentile of the 1990 BMI reference data. According to this method, five per cent. of children in 1990 had a BMI above this level and were thus classified as obese.</p>
	<p pid=".543W.2/2">Increases over 5 per cent. in the proportion of children who exceed the reference 95th percentile over time indicate an upward trend in the prevalence of obesity. When applied to Health Survey for England data, this method suggests that between 1996 and 2001 the percentage of children (aged 6&ndash;15) with a BMI above this threshold (representing the prevalence of obesity) increased by 3.5 percentage points, from 12.1 per cent. in 1996 to 15.6 per cent. in 2001.</p>
	<p pid=".543W.2/3">There is no data available by region, using this definition. Regional comparisons of the percentage of children in BMI quintiles were published in &quot;The Health Survey for England&mdash;The Health of Young People 95&ndash;97&quot;, table 3.17, a copy of which is available in the Library.

The Department of Health, together with the Food Standards Agency (FSA) and other Government departments, are working with the food industry&mdash;producers, manufacturers, retailers and caterers&mdash;to improve the overall balance of diet, including salt, fat and sugar in food.</p>
	<p pid=".544W.2/2">The Department of Health is leading the development of a cross-Government food and health action plan. Although the plan will be Government led, it will aim to include actions bya range of organisations including the food industry. The plan will address food production, manufacture and preparation, access to healthier food and provision of information for consumers about healthy eating and nutrition. The plan will address healthy eating at all stages of life and will build on existing work to improve diet and nutrition.</p>
	<p pid=".544W.2/3">The FSA has commissioned a review on the evidence available on the effect of promotional activities on the eating behaviour of children. This will critically appraise the available evidence and draw conclusions on their effect relative to other influences on eating behaviour.</p>

	<p pid=".544W.5/2">The Health Development Agency (HDA) is setting out the evidence base for effective interventions on the prevention and treatment of overweight and obesity, and the maintenance of weight loss.

In July 2002, NICE also issued guidance which confirmed that surgical intervention was an appropriate treatment in some cases for the treatment of morbid obesity, when other options have proved unsuccessful. There is also a national quality assurance framework for exercise referral systems to promote physical activity.</p>
	<p pid=".544W.5/4">The Department of Health has also supported the development of guidance for professionals in primary care on weight management in children and adolescents, and contributed through the Section 64 Grant Scheme to the funding of the charity Weight Concern to develop a &quot;toolkit&quot; on obesity, for professionals to use with patients in a group setting.</p>

This includes a section on providing good quality services for deaf and hard of hearing people. The NHS University (NHSU) is leading on the design and delivery of a disability equality training strategy for the NHS workforce as part of the wider Department of Health human resources directorate's equalities and diversity delivery plan. As part of this work, NHSU will consider a protocol for communicating with sensory impaired patients.

	<p pid=".549W.5/1">The Experience Corps is a national initiative with the aim of encouraging more people aged 50 and over to become or to remain active in their local communities.</p>
	<p pid=".549W.5/2">The latest figures supplied by the Experience Corps show that around 111,560 volunteers have been recruited since the initiative began and that they have placed over 70,000 volunteers. They report that the average age of the volunteers is just under 61. They have over 423,000 opportunities available in a wide range of roles, for example driving for the Red Cross, helping out at Dorset based cricket clubs, or acting as ground crew volunteers for the Great North Air Ambulance.</p>
	<p pid=".549W.5/3">The effectiveness of the Experience Corps will be determined by the extent to which they achieve targets set in respect of the recruitment and retention of volunteers. The main one is that by 2004 they should recruit 250,000 volunteers reflecting the diversity of people over 50.</p>
	<p pid=".549W.5/4">The Home Office has allocated the Experience Corps a total of &pound;19.9 million, broken down as &pound;5.5million/&pound;7.2million/&pound;7.2million for the three years to March 2004. A recent evaluation of the Experience Corps raised some concerns surrounding their figures on volunteer recruitment. In the light of this we are currently considering options for funding beyond that date.</p>
	<p pid=".549W.5/5">The Experience Corps report that they have just under 10,000 people actively involved in projects in the north-east. They work with a number of partner organisations in a variety of projects which demonstrate the intergenerational aspects of their work; they are a recruiter for HANE (Housing Action North East) launched by my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister last November with some 400 volunteers supporting homeless people throughout the region taking up tenancies for the first time; and they work with the Sikh and Hindu communities in Newcastle and Sunderland, for example holding a SEVA event at a Hindu temple.</p>

The country/regional strategies are: Afghanistan, Belize/Guatemala, Central and Eastern Europe, India/Pakistan, Indonesia/East Timor, Middle East and North Africa, Nepal, Russia/Former Soviet Union, Sri Lanka, the Balkans. Programmes in these areas cover conflict prevention and reduction, support to peace processes and post-conflict reconstruction.</p>

It will give an overview of the operation of the GCPP strategies and the projects which are being funded under them, but it will not include a comprehensive list of all projects, as they are too numerous.</p>
