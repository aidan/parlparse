	<p pid="b.359W.0/1">The time taken to process an application for an EFG backed loan is mainly determined by the internal processes of the lender concerned. There are relatively few additional administrative requirements for EFG compared with a normal loan. These primarily relate to ensuring EFG is used appropriately and that the relevant EU regulations on state aid are adhered to. Lenders have access to a web portal to determine EFG eligibility and approval of the loan guarantee. Overall, lenders confirm that an EFG loan application only takes two to three days longer than it might take to process a commercial loan.</p>
	<p pid="b.359W.0/2">Nonetheless, as speed and certainty is important for EFG lending decisions, this Department has worked with each of the main lenders, who account for over 97% of the SME lending market, to introduce a processing target of 20 working days for all major lenders participating in the EFG to provide certainty for businesses on how long their applications will take to process.</p>
	<p pid="b.359W.0/3">Seed capital in the form of equity is vital for start-up businesses where debt finance may not be the most appropriate form of finance and equity may be a more realistic proposition. Early stage venture capital is available for businesses with high growth potential and this Department provides a range of publicly supported funds to provide early stage finance, focused on the 'equity gap'.</p>
	<p pid="b.359W.0/4">The BIS Enterprise Capital Fund programme currently comprises nine venture capital funds with a Government commitment of more than &#163;156 million for these funds. The emergency Budget announced an additional Enterprise Capital Fund of up to &#163;37.5 million. Details can be found at the Capital for Enterprise Ltd website:</p>
	<p pid="b.359W.0/5" class="indent"><a href="http://www.capitalforenterprise.gov.uk">www.capitalforenterprise.gov.uk</a></p>
	<p pid="b.359W.0/6">These venture capital funds are suitable for high growth potential investments. These funds are complemented by a range of regionally commissioned funds including regional SME Venture Capital Loan Funds totalling around &#163;550 million of commitments up to 2013. There are around 25 to 30 regional equity and loan funds currently (or imminently) active supporting seed, early stage and growth capital for SMEs, all underpinned by objectives to enhance regional business and economic performance along with broader social and regeneration outputs attached to European Reconstruction and Development Fund funding.</p>

	<p pid="b.360W.5/1">Open general export licences (OGELs) have been a key part of the UK's export controls for many years. They permit the export of less sensitive items to less sensitive destinations and as such they allow the Government to maintain a robust licensing regime while minimising administrative burdens for legitimate and low risk exports. These risks are managed through careful definition of the goods and destinations; by the terms and conditions applied to each OGEL including, in some cases, prior approval of the export by the MOD; and by a comprehensive programme of on-site compliance audits. All OGELs are kept under review and they can be amended or withdrawn at any time.</p>

	<p pid="b.363W.5/1">Higher education institutions work with schools in many ways to help prepare young learners for higher education and many use their own funds to establish links with primary schools. The Department does not provide specific funds to promote engagement between universities and primary schools but many Aimhigher partnerships work with primary schools in disadvantaged areas to raise awareness about higher education.</p>
	<p pid="b.363W.5/2">In April this year, the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) concluded a project with 11 Aimhigher partnerships outlining their work in brokering links between primary schools and higher education institutions. In addition, HEFCE transferred &#163;30 million in 2009-10 from within the overall funding for teaching to help strengthen links between universities and schools.</p>

Equality issues will also be covered in the equalities impact assessment which will underpin our forthcoming skills strategy.</p>

	<p pid="b.374W.3/1">I discussed this issue with the cadet forces during the summer of 2010 and while I strongly encourage the attainment of qualifications, the Ministry of Defence does not provide financial assistance for cadets to undertake educational (and therefore also vocational) qualifications. In England, funding is made available through the Young People's Learning Agency (historically the Learning Skills Council); for Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, funding for vocational qualifications for cadets is a devolved matter.</p>
	<p pid="b.374W.3/2">Cadets have access to a Business and Technology Education Council (BTEC) Officer nominated for their unit, who liaises with the cadets and provides administrative support throughout the period of their qualification attainment.</p>

	<p pid="b.380W.2/1">Recruitment of teachers other than trainees is largely a matter for schools, who are best placed to make decisions about their particular requirements. The School Teachers' Pay and Conditions Document (STPCD), which contains the statutory pay and conditions of employment for teachers in maintained schools in England and Wales, includes a number of pay flexibilities to support recruitment and retention, which may be used to attract experienced staff where appropriate.</p>
	<p pid="b.380W.2/2">The Government are also committed to introducing a pupil premium for disadvantaged children. It will be for head teachers and school governors to decide how to use the premium to meet the needs of disadvantaged children in their schools, and this might include using flexibilities in the pay system to attract more experienced staff. Ministers are determined to make teaching a more attractive profession for teachers in all schools, by removing bureaucracy, trusting teachers to get on with their job and taking measures to tackle behaviour and discipline in schools. These include strengthening teachers' powers to maintain good behaviour in the classroom, removing the bureaucratic burden on schools when giving detentions, and giving teachers the strongest possible protection from false allegations. The Government will announce further measures to reduce bureaucracy during the autumn, as Ministers engage with teachers and frontline staff on their plans to give them more power and remove the form-filling and bureaucracy that takes them away from the classroom.</p>
	<p pid="b.380W.2/3">The Government have announced already their plan to fund a considerable expansion in the Teach First programme, which has been very successful in bringing hundreds of high quality teachers into schools in the most deprived areas. There will now be Teach First teachers working in one third of all challenging schools right across the country, including some of the most challenging primary schools.</p>

	<p pid="b.388W.5/2">DfID and our high commission in Abuja are also exploring further ways in which they can help the process of reconciliation between religious and ethnic communities, and continue to impress on state and federal authorities the importance of bringing those responsible for crimes to justice. We encourage the Nigerian Government to fully consider the implementation of recommendations made in the recent report of the Presidential Committee on the Jos Crisis.</p>

	<p pid="b.399W.2/1">The Government have made it clear that tackling health inequalities is a priority. Everyone should have the same opportunities to lead a healthy life, no matter where they live, or who they are. The national health service has a critical role to play in reducing the health inequalities that effect disadvantaged people, and the White Paper, &quot;Equity and Excellence: Liberating the NHS&quot;, published on <phrase class="date" code="2010-07-12">12 July 2010</phrase>, would create an explicit NHS duty on tackling inequalities in access to NHS healthcare and the outcomes for that care. Our aim is to create an NHS that is much more responsive to patients, putting them at the heart of everything it does, and that reduces inequalities in care.</p>
	<p pid="b.399W.2/2">The White Paper also sets out plans for the new public health service that would have an important role in reducing these inequalities. The public health budget would be ring-fenced and allocated to reflect relative population health outcomes, with a new &quot;health premium&quot; to promote action to reduce health inequalities. We would therefore create a service that both recognises the impact of deprivation and rewards improvement, providing further incentives to reduce inequalities in health. We expect to publish a White Paper on public health later this year, outlining the Government's plans for establishing the new public health service, and also mapping a cross-Government strategy on public health.</p>

	<p pid="b.400W.0/1">The Mental Health Act 1983 (which was amended by the Mental Health Act 2007) is primarily concerned with the legal framework for the compulsory care and treatment of people with mental disorders, rather than with the provision of services. There is nothing in the Act specifically to enable mental health services to provide early preventive treatment to individuals. Such services are, however, widely provided by the national health service, not least through dedicated early intervention teams for younger people experiencing a first episode of psychosis. Prevention is one of a number of key themes we are addressing in the preparation of the Government's new mental health strategy.</p>

While figures for Great Britain are published annually, the latest being on <phrase class="date" code="2010-07-27">27 July 2010</phrase>, it would take significant work to run the systems specifically to obtain data for Wales and then to check that none of the data was disclosive or breached any confidentiality guarantees given to respondents.

We discussed the Multilateral Aid Review, which will look at core funding provided by the Department for International Development (DFID) to multilateral agencies. The review will include an assessment of the relevance of the Global Fund to the UK's objectives on poverty reduction and its ability to deliver results on the ground. The results of the Multilateral Aid Review will be an important element in any future funding decisions in respect of the fund. I also spoke with Michel Kazatchkine in London on <phrase class="date" code="2010-09-27">27 September</phrase> at the viewing of the UN Foundation's documentary 'A New Picture of Health'.</p>

Interim decisions on funding for multilateral partners need to balance the requirements to minimise disruption to the work of our partners and ensure consistency with the results of the review. My Department is in contact with our partner institutions to discuss whether financing decisions can be delayed for a short period without adversely affecting their work on the ground. Where this is not possible, or where a delay in an announcement of UK funding may delay negotiations with other donors, I will make an earlier decision, informed by the evidence and analysis already gathered during the review.</p>

	<p pid="b.409W.2/1">It is local authorities that are best placed to ensure that rural communities are able to access jobs and essential services-by bus, by flexible services such as dial-a-ride, or by bringing services directly to the door. They have a statutory duty to produce local transport plans, which we believe remain the best way for authorities to plan transport strategy and delivery.</p>
	<p pid="b.409W.2/2">In areas where frequent public transport services are not commercially viable, the voluntary and community sector have a large role to play in delivering long-term sustainable alternatives. The Government are committed to supporting partnership working between local authorities, commercial providers and the voluntary sector that delivers tailor-made local services.</p>
	<p pid="b.409W.2/3">Rather than prescribing one method from Whitehall, we will therefore provide greater funding freedoms and flexibilities at a local level. As part of this approach, the Government recently announced a Local Sustainable Transport Fund which will support local transport and encourage more sustainable travel solutions based on local need.</p>
