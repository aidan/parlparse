	<p pid="a.1128W.0/2">Decisions on proposals for the commercial cultivation of GM crops are taken at European Union (EU) level. Consistent with the EU legislation, the UK voting position is based on what the scientific evidence indicates about the safety of each crop in question for human health and the environment. DEFRA consults the relevant authorities in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland before the UK position is finalised. There are no plans for the UK position to be determined on the basis of qualified majority voting.</p>

	<p pid="a.1136W.9/1">There are no plans to move the shooting event to an alternative venue.</p>
	<p pid="a.1136W.9/2">The Royal Artillery barracks at Woolwich was selected as the venue for Olympic and Paralympic shooting events in 2012 following feedback from the International Olympic Committee and consultation with the International Shooting Federation and British Shooting (the national governing body). Woolwich has the advantage of being close to the Olympic Park and Village which will improve the athlete and spectator experience. The decision to stage the event at Woolwich is now part of the Host City Contract with the IOC.</p>

	<p pid="a.1137W.0/1">In parallel with ongoing site clearance and preparation works, the ODA continues its comprehensive ecology programme to ensure the preservation and protection of wildlife in the Olympic Park. Where possible, habitats are being safeguarded and will remain in place but, where wildlife cannot be protected sufficiently on-site, the ODA is working with the nearby Waterworks Nature Reserve and Hackney council to create alternative habitats in the local area. The ODA is also preparing a small nature reserve at East Marsh to become home to a variety of wildlife including birds, frogs, spiders and beetles with planting scheduled to commence in the spring.</p>
	<p pid="a.1137W.0/2">To date, thousands of newts and hundreds of toads have been translocated to specially created ponds on the Waterworks Reserve and aquatics experts have moved fish away from the clearance and dredging works on the Pudding Mill river to the nearby river Lea. New nest areas suitable for the breeding and feeding patterns of kingfishers and sand martins have also been created at the Waterworks.</p>
	<p pid="a.1137W.0/3">The ODA is also working with the Celia Hammond Animal Trust (CHAT) to ensure the well-being and safe capture of any feral cats remaining on the site. To date, around 170 cats have been safely taken off site for re-homing by the trust. The ODA continues to work closely with the trust to allow access to those areas safe from construction activities.</p>

	<p pid="a.1144W.8/1">Both the Global Business Plan (GBP) on MDGs 4 and 5 and the International Health Partnership (IHP) aim to deliver more effective aid in support of national health plans and priorities. The European Commission (EC) is a signatory to the IHP and the UK continues to work closely with the Commission in ensuring the aid it provides is consistent with these principles. The EC does not have specific MDG 'programmes'. Our main interest with regard to their support for the MDGs is at the country level.</p>
	<p pid="a.1144W.8/2">In 2007, the EC published the majority of its country strategy papers (CSPs) for the period to 2013. Many of these were completed before donors agreed the GBP and the IHP. DFID considered these CSPs against a range of criteria, including their adherence to the legal and policy base and alignment with the priorities of the partner country as set out in their national plans&mdash;this is in line with the principles of the IHP. Our assessment is that those which have so far been presented have generally met these criteria.</p>

	<p pid="a.1152W.2/1">DWP has commissioned an independent case study evaluation to:</p>
	<p pid="a.1152W.2/2" class="indent">Explore the impact of the fund initiatives on individuals' knowledge and attitudes towards planning for retirement and on savings behaviour;</p>
	<p pid="a.1152W.2/3" class="indent">Provide evidence to help assess the potential role that a trusted third party can play in delivering pensions information; and</p>
	<p pid="a.1152W.2/4" class="indent">Explore providers' experiences of setting up and running the initiatives.</p>
	<p pid="a.1152W.2/5">Research has been conducted with 14 Pension Education Fund schemes selected to ensure coverage of a range of different types of initiatives. In depth interviews were the main research tool in this study, through which the research organisation have collected detailed information on providers' experiences of setting up and running particular initiatives, on employers' experience of participating, and on the influence that funded activities have had on individuals' attitudes to retirement planning and saving for retirement.</p>
	<p pid="a.1152W.2/6">In addition, all 26 schemes are being monitored through contract management processes and PEF funded organisations are conducting their own evaluations to understand their perspectives on delivery.</p>
	<p pid="a.1152W.2/7">A DWP research report on the evaluation will be published in spring 2008.</p>
	<p pid="a.1152W.2/8" class="indentitalic"> Notes:</p>
	<p pid="a.1152W.2/9" class="indent">1. The PEF offered funding to local and national not-for-profit organisations (such as trade unions, charities, trade associations and the voluntary sector) to use innovative ways to increase financial awareness and encourage working people to provide for their retirement, especially among those that might be at more risk of undersaving.</p>
	<p pid="a.1152W.2/10" class="indent">2. The principle is to provide impartial and accurate information on pensions and retirement planning via trusted third parties to individuals (employees and self-employed people) in the workplace, where practicable.</p>
	<p pid="a.1152W.2/11" class="indent">3. The projects are running between January 2006 and March 2008.</p>
	<p pid="a.1152W.2/12" class="indent">4. Closing date for applications was <phrase class="date" code="2005-09-02">2 September 2005</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.1152W.2/13" class="indent">5. 55 applications were received and examined against financial and quality criteria and the process overseen by an Independent Decision Panel.</p>
	<p pid="a.1152W.2/14" class="indent">6. 26 were accepted, covering all Government Office regions and Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, and a range of organisational types including charities, trade unions, employer groups and the voluntary sector.</p>
	<p pid="a.1152W.2/15" class="indent">7. Information is being delivered by the projects using a variety of methods including group events, one to ones, websites, CDs, information booklets/packs and by training intermediaries and union members who return to the workplace and cascade information.</p>

This is something that falls within the responsibilities delegated to me as chief executive of Jobcentre Plus.</p>
	<p pid="a.1154W.3/4" class="indent">Everyone returning to work, and who is claiming jobseeker's allowance, will discuss and agree the steps that will offer the best chance of finding work. This information is recorded in the jobseeker's agreement, which is reviewed at regular intervals. Customers are given information and advice about the range of Jobcentre Plus services, including our telephony based job-matching service (Jobseeker Direct) and our internet job bank, and how to make best use of these and other vacancy sources.</p>
	<p pid="a.1154W.3/5" class="indent">People are usually required to attend their nearest Jobcentre Plus office on a fortnightly basis to discuss what they have been doing to find work and to see what further support, if required, can be offered in terms of jobsearch or training/re-training.</p>
	<p pid="a.1154W.3/6" class="indent">To continue to receive jobseeker's allowance, people must usually be available for work for a minimum of 40 hours per week. However, restrictions on hours/days are allowed for customers who have caring responsibilities, which can be restricted to a minimum of 16 hours a week.</p>
	<p pid="a.1154W.3/7" class="indent">People who are particularly disadvantaged in the labour market can access additional help through early entry to the new deal, providing more intensive help through the support of a personal adviser and a range of opportunities to help overcome more significant barriers to employment. Similarly, early access is available to Programme Centre provision, which can provide additional help for those people who need to improve motivation and confidence, and their basic jobsearch skills.</p>
	<p pid="a.1154W.3/8" class="indent">With regard to staff training, Jobcentre Plus has a diverse customer base and a comprehensive programme of learning designed to equip advisers with the full range of knowledge and skills required to support all our customers. A new Adviser Skills Learning Routeway was introduced in September 2005, which is supported by an efficient learning routeway providing advisers with key knowledge and skills.</p>
	<p pid="a.1154W.3/9" class="indent">We work closely with external partners in the development of learning products and in the up-skilling of our advisers, ensuring that additional modules are designed and delivered when required to deal with specific customer needs. These partners are professionals and are recognised as experts in their field and are able to provide the specialised knowledge and understanding of specific customer groups.</p>
	<p pid="a.1154W.3/10" class="indent">I hope this information is helpful and assures you of our intent to provide people with the best possible service, aimed at helping them into work as soon as possible.</p>

The rules, which were the subject of consultation with the Association of British Civilian Internees&mdash;Far East Region, allow periods employed outside the UK&mdash;whether with the British Government or otherwise&mdash;to count towards the 20 years providing there is reasonable evidence of an intention to return to this country; this will most likely be the case with postings from the UK. There is, however, no requirement that the individual should have been in the UK when recruited; if a person's employment was contracted on the basis that they would otherwise have been resident in the UK and that they would travel to the UK at its termination, that would qualify.</p>

	<p pid="a.1156W.2/1">There are currently a hydrotherapy pool and five separate gyms (four in current use) at the Defence Medical Rehabilitation Centre, Headley Court. One of the gyms needs to be refurbished. The unit also makes regular use of a local authority swimming pool at Leatherhead. These facilities are publicly funded.</p>
	<p pid="a.1156W.2/2">A new charity, Help for Heroes, has offered to raise funds to build a swimming pool and gym, as part of a new rehabilitation complex at Headley Court. We warmly welcome this generous offer to enhance the unit's existing facilities. The rehabilitation of military patients on the site, which is itself owned by a charitable trust, has for many years benefited from charitable donations and it is entirely appropriate that such funding should be blended with public funding in this way. We shall work closely with the charity as its proposals are developed.</p>
	<p pid="a.1156W.2/3">We would expect Headley Court to take charge of the management of the new rehabilitation complex, including the provision of military or civilian staff to man it.</p>
	<p pid="a.1156W.2/4">We are also continuing to invest significantly from public funds in new buildings. We opened a new 30-bed ward annex last year (costing &pound;1.7 million). Work is now starting on a 58-bed accommodation block for patients and staff (costing about &pound;4 million). We are also considering a longer term development plan to improve accommodation and clinical facilities across the site, and thus maintain the first-class capability that Headley Court currently offers.</p>

In my capacity as Minister for Culture I have met regularly with MLA's chief executive. During the course of these meetings we have discussed funding issues for the MLA as a whole. The Portable Antiquities Scheme (PAS) is funded by the MLA, so the impact of funding levels on the Scheme is a matter for them. The MLA is committed to the continued success of the PAS and is working together with other stakeholders to ensure that this is achieved.</p>

	<p pid="a.1182W.2/2">The present DCMS strategic target for tourism growth is total UK turnover of &pound;100 billion by 2010. This was agreed with the industry, the Regional Development Agencies, and the Local Government Association in 2004, and announced in the policy document Tomorrow's Tourism Today.

The most common of these are: an outstanding contribution in a particularly demanding situation, job loading becoming temporarily very heavy, a high level of commitment and resolution to get a job done, special efforts to produce results, cover for a high level of absence, and a contribution over and above what would normally be expected for the job and of the person or team concerned. Special bonuses can be paid either to individuals or to a group or team of staff at any point in the year, and only for additional duties undertaken which will not be recognised through annual pay awards.</p>

	<p pid="a.1198W.8/25">A combination of the analyses highlights that there has been a significant recovery in the supply of 10 mg and 30 mg strengths against historic demand.</p>
	<p pid="a.1198W.8/26">However prescribing of these two strengths has not returned to original levels and there has been an excess in the supply of these strengths against current demand as a result.</p>
	<p pid="a.1198W.8/27">In the case of the 5 mg and l00 mg strengths the supply position has not recovered. There is an ongoing shortage of these strengths and it is not possible to estimate true current demand as a result.</p>
	<p pid="a.1198W.8/28">When the shortage of diamorphine first arose in December 2004, the remaining supplier immediately increased its production, and the Department took steps to ensure that adequate supplies of alternative painkillers were available. In addition, the Department issued an alert to the national health service via the chief medical officers cascade system, warning health care professionals about the shortage and advising them to avoid wastage, and to consider alternative painkillers wherever possible and reserve diamorphine supplies for those patients whose need was greatest. Both suppliers are now fully in production. The supply situation improved during 2007, and is expected to continue doing so during 2008.</p>

	<p pid="a.1199W.2/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="a.1199W.2/2">The Department has not collected separate statistics on how much funding it provides to specific groups to assist them with learning to use computers since 2001. The information requested can be provided only at disproportionate cost.</p>
	<p pid="a.1199W.2/3">As part of the overall funding of the Government's e-learning strategy funding was used to create infrastructure and was aimed at sectors such as further education and institutions such as colleges. The main thrust was to put technology in place, to develop the content of e-learning materials, including adaptations to enable ease of access by disabled people, and to develop staff to use technology with different groups. This has led to projects designed to support the effective use of computers by vulnerable groups such as disabled people.</p>
	<p pid="a.1199W.2/4">For example between 2004 and 2006 the Learning and Skills Council and the Joint Information Systems Committee provided &pound;250,000 supporting 27 projects in specialist colleges designed to increase confidence and motivation among disabled learners and create innovative technical solutions to meet individual needs, including learners with complex disabilities.</p>
	<p pid="a.1199W.2/5">Until 2005 the then Department for Education and Skills partly funded two national Aids to Communication in Education centres supporting learners with learning disabilities with grants of approximately &pound;400,000 per year. These centres still exist and are self financing.</p>
	<p pid="a.1199W.2/6">My Department does recognise how important it is for disabled people to use computers effectively and a number of projects have been established to improve usage and give disabled people the confidence and skills to use all forms of information and computer technology (ICT) effectively. As part of its responsibilities under the Disability Discrimination Act 1996 my Department ensures that its delivery partners are working to eliminate discrimination and this includes ensuring access to technology.</p>

	<p pid="a.1201W.11/1">In each of the last two years, primary care trusts (PCTs) have invested &pound;158 million, equating to an average &pound;19,000 per practice, to fund the Access and Choice Directed Enhanced Services. It was always intended that these schemes would end on <phrase class="date" code="">31 March 2008</phrase>. This money will be available to support PCTs and practices in agreeing improvement in patient access to their general practitioner (GP) practice.</p>
	<p pid="a.1201W.11/2">Under proposals put to the General Practitioner Committee this money would be used by PCTs to pay GP practices for providing extended opening of 30 minutes per week for every 1,000 patients on their list size. There would be no compulsion placed on practices to do this, however, should an average GP practice of 6,000 patients take up this and provide the expected minimum three extended hours per week, they could expect to receive &pound;19,000 per year. Where they choose not to provide such services to their patients, this money will not be available to them.</p>

	<p pid="a.1203W.5/1">The &quot;National Service Framework for Coronary Heart Disease&quot;, published in March 2000, set out a 10 year framework for action to prevent disease, tackle inequalities, save more lives, and improve the quality of life for people with heart disease. An estimated 178,000 lives have been saved since 1996.</p>
	<p pid="a.1203W.5/2">The target set out in &quot;Our Healthier Nation&quot; (OHN) to reduce deaths from cardiovascular disease (coronary heart disease and stroke and related diseases) by 40 per cent., in people under 75 by 2010 has been met five years early. The mortality rate has fallen 40.3 per cent., between 2004-06 over the 1995-97 baseline.</p>
	<p pid="a.1203W.5/3">Inequalities in the death rate from heart disease, stroke and related diseases among the under-75s have been narrowing for the past eight years, and we are on track to meet a 40 per cent., reduction target in the gap by 2010. The death rate has reduced by 32 per cent., since 1995-97.</p>
	<p pid="a.1203W.5/4">In 1997 the number of deaths from cardiovascular disease was 69,133 but by 2005 this figure fell to 42,886, a reduction of over 26,000 deaths per year.</p>
	<p pid="a.1203W.5/5">The initiatives outlined above such as the National Service Framework and the targets in OHN will have had an impact across both Cheshire and Warrington, as well as nationally.</p>
	<p pid="a.1203W.5/6">In addition, a &pound;600 million programme of hospital building is continuing to provide new or expanded cardiac facilities in the places where they are most needed. There has been a &pound;125 million investment in improved diagnostic and treatment facilities (combined departmental and national lottery fund money) which has supported the building and equipping of 90 new or replacement catheterisation laboratories in England, increasing the capacity previously available by more than 50 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="a.1203W.5/7">More locally, a new cardiac catheter laboratory was opened at the Warrington general hospital in January 2006. The hospital also has a dedicated eight-bed coronary care unit providing monitoring and urgent treatment for patients with acute coronary conditions.</p>

The ambulance response time target for calls to people with potentially life-threatening illnesses and conditions (which includes cardiac arrest) is for 75 per cent. of cases to be responded to within eight minutes irrespective of location.</p>
	<p pid="a.1204W.2/3">For heart attack (blockage of a coronary artery by a blood clot which may lead to a cardiac arrest if not treated quickly), the Department has not commissioned research but research results have been taken into account in formulating policy on heart attack treatment. There is accumulating evidence that angioplasty leads to better longer-term outcomes than clot busting drugs even if it takes longer to deliver.</p>

	<p pid="a.1205W.5/1">This reply only covers methicillin-resistant <i> Staphylococcus aureus</i> (MRSA) and <i> Clostridium</i><i> </i><i> difficile</i> (<i> C.</i><i> </i><i> difficile</i>).</p>
	<p pid="a.1205W.5/2">The available evidence for MRSA and <i> C. difficile</i> is that the main route of transmission is via inadequately cleaned hands, hence the Department's focus on good hand hygiene and cleaning (especially of frequently touched areas). There is little evidence to suggest that airborne exposure is a significant transmission route. The Department continues to monitor any new evidence and is aware of some evaluations of air decontamination systems that are ongoing in national health service settings, the results of which will be reviewed when they are available.</p>

	<p pid="a.1210W.3/1">The rationale for arrangements to strengthen the voice of local people is to widen and broaden peoples influence over their services, rather than it being a reflection on the amount or quality of the work undertaken by Community Health Councils (CHCs) and patient and public involvement (PPI) forums.</p>
	<p pid="a.1210W.3/2">We know from listening to people during the review of patient and public involvement that more people want to have a greater say about their local services. It is no longer appropriate to have a PPI system which is based around scrutiny of individual services. The new local involvement networks will be able to consider both health and social care, so that PPI can be joined up across the entire patient journey. Crucially, we want more people involved having influence in different ways according to their lifestyle, experience and skills. We will build on the existing experience and knowledge from patients' forums.</p>

	<p pid="a.1212W.0/1">Research carried out by UK Transplant in 2003 showed that 90 per cent. of people state their support for organ donation, but only 25 per cent. of people register on the Organ Donor Register. In its first report, the Organ Donation Taskforce placed great emphasis on understanding the reasons for this, along with the relatively high levels of family refusal to donation and this will be reflected during the implementation phase. The Secretary of State (Alan Johnson) has asked the Taskforce to continue its work in order to look at the potential impact of a system of presumed consent for organ donation.</p>

	<p pid="a.1215W.2/1">The Department does not publish statistics on the stages at which prostate cancer is diagnosed. The &quot;Cancer Reform Strategy&quot;, published last December, highlights the need to collect and use high quality data on clinical outcomes with adjustments for stage of disease. Part of the new National Cancer Intelligence Network's work will be, in due course, to co-ordinate the collection and analysis of this data.</p>

	<p pid="a.1217W.2/1">The National Stroke Strategy published last December sets out the vision for modernising services and delivering the newest treatments for stroke. The strategy makes clear that people who have had strokes should be able to access high-quality rehabilitation and receive support from stroke-skilled services as soon as possible after they have had a stroke, available in hospital, immediately after transfer from hospital and for as long as they need it. Stroke care networks are being developed to provide support to service providers and commissioners locally to improve the services they offer.</p>
	<p pid="a.1217W.2/2">The national health service has the resources to fund these changes to stroke services, having seen record levels of investment and a period of significant expansion in the workforce. There has been a 36 per cent. increase in the number of speech and language therapists (SLTs) working in the NHS, bringing the total to 6,623 (NHS staff census September 2006 headcount). The number of SLTs entering training has increased by 65 per cent. since 1998-99. We acknowledge the significant value of SLTs in the management of swallowing, speech and communication disorders following a stroke. In addition we have announced spending proposals totalling &pound;105 million to provide national support for implementation of the National Stroke Strategy.</p>

	<p pid="a.1217W.5/1">In the United Kingdom, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) run the Yellow Card Scheme. This scheme allows health professionals and patients to report suspected adverse drug reactions, which includes suicides, on a voluntary basis. Over the last five years a total of 15 suspected adverse drug reactions of suicide have been reported in association with isotretinoin (Roaccutane) through this scheme. It is important to note that a report of an adverse drug reaction does not necessarily mean that it was caused by the drug. Other factors such as an underlying illness or other medicines may have contributed. Severe acne itself is known to be associated with an increased risk of depressive illness.</p>
	<p pid="a.1217W.5/2">The safety of isotretinoin has been closely monitored by the MHRA since it was approved in 1983. The benefits of isotretinoin in the treatment of acne are considered to outweigh the risk of adverse effects by regulatory authorities throughout Europe and worldwide.</p>
	<p pid="a.1217W.5/3">Warnings about the risk of depression and suicidal behaviour were added to the product information for prescribers and patients in 1998. These warnings have been strengthened following a European review of the isotretinoin product information and most recently the 'Roaccutane Patient Information Leaflet' has been subject to user testing to ensure that the information, including that about risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviour, is clear, comprehensive and understandable.</p>

For example in its work with partners to monitor tensions and provide support for local areas experiencing particular challenges. More recently 'The Government's Response to the Commission on Integration and Cohesion' (published in February 2008) provides a new clarity on, and commitment to, delivering cohesive and integrated communities.

The total assumed housing debt in 2007-08 is &pound;17.3 billion. The interest on debt is governed by each council's Consolidated Rate of Interest (CRI). The CRI is different for each authority and depends upon the number, value and period of the various loans they have negotiated individually. The average CRI for 2007-08 is 6.17 per cent.</p>

Overhanging debt payments to the Public Works Loans Board under these debt transfer arrangements since 2000 are shown in the following table:</p>

	<p pid="a.1232W.3/1">The information requested falls within the responsibility of the National Statistician, who has been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="a.1232W.3/2" class="italic"> Letter from Colin Mowl, dated <phrase class="date" code="2008-02-25">25 February 2008</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="a.1232W.3/3" class="indent">The National Statistician has been asked to reply to your two Parliamentary Questions. The first is about the number of (a) UK nationals and (b) the UK 60 million population who were (i) unskilled, (ii) semi-skilled and (iii) skilled workers was in each year since 2001; and what research has been (A) commissioned and (B) evaluated on changes in these employment rates. The second is about the number of non UK citizens in (a) unskilled and (b) semi-skilled employment in the UK in each year since 1997. I am replying in her absence. (177468, 177469)</p>
	<p pid="a.1232W.3/4" class="indent">The data for analysing migrant workers comes from the Labour Force Survey. The National Statistics method for estimating the number of migrant workers employed in the UK is based on the number of people at a given time who were born abroad, are of working age (16 - 64 for men, 16-59 for women), and in employment. However, you have requested data analysed by nationality and this is the basis on which this PQ has been answered.</p>
	<p pid="a.1232W.3/5" class="indent">The attached table gives the number and proportion of UK nationals, foreign nationals and all people in employment, for the three month period ending June each year, from 2001 to 2007. Comparable estimates are not available before 2001. The National Statistics Socio-economic Classification has been used to categorise the population and provide the employment status of each working age adult.</p>
	<p pid="a.1232W.3/6" class="indent">I am advised that the Government has not commissioned research on the changes in the employment rate of skilled and non-skilled workers since 2001. As part of the Leitch Review of Skills, published in 2006, projections of employment demand by skill level and occupation was commissioned from Cambridge Econometrics and the Warwick Institute of Employment Studies. Further information can be found at:</p>

	<p pid="a.1232W.3/8" class="indent">It is important to bear in mind that the Labour Force Survey (LFS) is not designed to cover everyone who is present in the UK. The survey may undercount the numbers of people who were born overseas.</p>
	<p pid="a.1232W.3/9" class="indent">As with any sample survey, estimates from the LFS are subject to a margin of uncertainty.</p>

	<p pid="a.1236W.2/4" class="indent">The Office for National Statistics (ONS) compiles statistics of employment for local areas from the Annual Population Survey (APS) following International Labour Organisation definitions.</p>
	<p pid="a.1236W.2/5" class="indent">The National Statistics method for estimating the number of migrant workers employed in the UK is based on the number of people at a given time who were born abroad, are of working age (16 - 64 for men, 16 - 59 for women), and in employment. However, you have requested data analysed by nationality and this is the basis on which this PQ has been answered.</p>
	<p pid="a.1236W.2/6" class="indent">It is important to bear in mind that the APS is not designed to cover everyone who is present in the UK. The survey may undercount the numbers of people who are foreign nationals. The reasons are set out in the table footnote.</p>
	<p pid="a.1236W.2/7" class="indent">The APS estimates at this detailed level are only available consistent with population estimates published in February and March 2003 and are not comparable with the estimates published in the Labour Market Statistics First Release on <phrase class="date" code="2007-11-14">14 November 2007</phrase>, which are based on latest population estimates.</p>
	<p pid="a.1236W.2/8" class="indent">Tables 1 and 2, attached, shows estimates for the 12 month periods ending in March 2005 and June 2007 from the APS. Table 1 shows the number of working age employed persons in each Government Office region by nationality. Table 2 shows the number of working age employed persons in each local authority by nationality. Copies of the tables have been placed in the House of Commons Library.</p>
	<p pid="a.1236W.2/9" class="indent">These estimates, as with any from sample surveys, are subject to a margin of uncertainty. Changes in the estimates over time should be treated with particular caution.</p>

	<p pid="a.1237W.6/7" class="indent">These data are from the international passenger survey (IPS), the main source for producing estimates of long-term international migration. Total international migration (TIM) estimates are the most comprehensive estimates of international migration and combine the IPS with other migration flows not captured by the IPS. However, the nature of these other data sources and the methods used to produce TIM mean that some queries can only be answered using the IPS. As a sample survey, data from the IPS are subject to margins of error.</p>

	<p pid="a.1239W.2/1">In the great majority of cases where minimum wage arrears are identified the employer pays any minimum wage arrears without the need for any formal enforcement action. Where arrears are not paid, an Enforcement Notice will be issued setting out the arrears that are considered to be due. An employer will then have 28 days to lodge an appeal and subsequently have his case heard before an Employment Tribunal. If the appeal is not upheld or the Enforcement Notice is not appealed against, the arrears become due.</p>
	<p pid="a.1239W.2/2">Details of the number of employers found not to be paying their staff the minimum wage in each of the last five years can be found in the table.</p>

	<p pid="a.1239W.2/13">In line with the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform (BERR) requirements, each complaint about possible non-payment of NMW is recorded as a case. In a small number of instances, where exceptionally the same employer is the subject of more than one complaint, the same employer will feature in more than one case. The number of cases does not therefore equate exactly with the number of employers for whom arrears have been identified.</p>

	<p pid="a.1246W.5/1">Since its inception in 2003 the Assets Recovery Agency has used its exclusive powers under the Proceeds of Crime Act in relation to civil recovery and tax as well as providing support to outside agencies in securing criminal confiscation orders. The Agency's Centre of Excellence has consistently delivered against its targets for the delivery of financial investigation courses. Key results are provided in the following table.</p>
	<p pid="a.1246W.5/2">The agency has also established important case law with regards to civil recovery legislation and spent considerable time working with the Home Office, Department of Constitutional Affairs and the Attorney General's Office to identify ways in which to speed up case progression and reduce costs.</p>
	<p pid="a.1246W.5/3">The agency was pleased to announce in its 2006-07 Annual Report that it had, for the first time, been successful in meeting its cost recovery target, having recovered more money than the agency is granted by the Treasury. Furthermore, during the lifetime of the agency it has had success in concluding cases to the value of &pound;97.2 million and gained enforcement receipts of &pound;28.2 million. A notable recent success was a joint investigation between the Assets Recovery Agency, Thames Valley police and the Serious Fraud Office, which led to a confiscation order worth nearly &pound;41 million&mdash;the largest believed to have been secured under criminal proceedings to date.</p>

	<p pid="a.1249W.0/15">The Department does not hold a central record of individual contracts with Capita Group and its subsidiaries, and to assemble all the requested details from all individual contract records would incur disproportionate cost. The majority of the spend derives from the disclosure service contract between the Criminal Records Bureau and Capita Business Services based upon a public private partnership agreement. The Department is able to provide the information in relation to this contract as set out in the following table.</p>
	<p pid="a.1249W.0/16">The contract was awarded in 2000 and runs for 10 years from CRB go-live which occurred in March 2002. The contract cost is estimated at &pound;400 million over 10 years. Contract schedules set out service levels and the service credits that apply should Capita fail to meet the agreed service levels. Liquidated damages are charged in the event of late delivery to agreed changes in the service.

	<p pid="a.1251W.2/1">Nationally, the Government are committed to improving the life chances of children and young people, by having fewer young people affected by crime and reduce youth victimisation.</p>
	<p pid="a.1251W.2/2">The main initiative to tackle crime on and around school premises has been the Safer School Partnerships (SSPs) originally launched in 2002.</p>
	<p pid="a.1251W.2/3">SSPs are a successful mechanism for ensuring structured joint working between schools and police, to identify and support children and young people regarded as being at high risk of victimisation, offending and social exclusion. There are now about 500 SSPs of one form or another across the country. Evaluations have shown that they are proving effective in improving behaviour and attendance, developing strong and positive relationships between the police and young people, and to help young people develop a sense of being part of the local community.</p>
	<p pid="a.1251W.2/4">Because of the proven success of SSPs, the Department for Children, Schools and Families (DCSF) has been working closely with the Home Office, the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) and the Youth Justice Board (YJB) to encourage more schools and police to engage in this type of early intervention and preventative work which is so vital to achieving the outcomes we are all committed to.</p>
	<p pid="a.1251W.2/5">There is already a great deal of work going on across Government to tackle offenders and help vulnerable young people achieve the Every Child Matters outcome to 'Stay Safe'. Initiatives include Youth Inclusion Support Panels and the Youth Inclusion Programme. And since 2004, we have invested over &pound;45 million in Youth Offending Teams which have pioneered antisocial behaviour prevention activities for young people at most risk. Their work includes:</p>
	<p pid="a.1251W.2/6" class="indent">Youth Inclusion Support Panels and;</p>
	<p pid="a.1251W.2/7" class="indent">Youth Inclusion Programmes.</p>
	<p pid="a.1251W.2/8">The Home Office has invested in other prevention programmes such as Positive Futures. Around 22,000 young people are currently involved in Positive Futures projects nationwide.</p>
	<p pid="a.1251W.2/9">In Enfield there are numerous schemes available to support and divert young people from crime and disorder which contribute to reducing crime in and around schools.</p>
	<p pid="a.1251W.2/10">Enfield has the largest secondary school population in London, including 11 per cent. of pupils who travel into the borough to attend school and as a result, it has one of the largest Safer Schools teams in the Met. This ensures that every secondary school in the borough has a dedicated officer. This team also runs activities in the half term and holidays for youth diversion purposes.</p>
	<p pid="a.1251W.2/11">Through the Enfield Strategic Partnership, the borough secured the funding for a dedicated Police Youth Inspector and Sergeant to co-ordinate Youth Activity across the borough. It also has Safer Neighbourhood Teams who run youth clubs, boxing clubs and football clubs.</p>
	<p pid="a.1251W.2/12">The Youth Offending Service (YOS) runs the YISP scheme that all bodies can refer into for eight to 17-year-olds. There is also the Kickz project run jointly by the Football Foundation (Spurs) and Metropolitan Police in one part of the borough and very soon there will be a second site. On top of this, Enfield uses LAA funding (previously) Safer and Stronger Communities Funding to provide various youth diversion and enforcement activities (e.g. knife arch purchases, youth diversion work, funding for boxing, judo, clubs, street pastors and so on).</p>

	<p pid="a.1258W.5/2">The contract to deliver the e-Borders system was awarded to the Trusted Borders Consortium in November 2007. The programme will begin counting foreign nationals in and out of the country from October 2008, building upon the carrier data already captured in the Semaphore pilot. There will be a ramping up of existing capability in 2008 to handle data for 100 million (annualised) passenger movements by April 2009. The e-Borders operations centre (e-BOC) will be established by mid-2009 at the earliest, providing capture and watch list assessment of passenger data for an initially limited number of high priority passenger routes. The three stages of capability delivery are bound by the following milestones:</p>
	<p pid="a.1258W.5/3" class="indent">December 2009: Initial Operating Capability&mdash;which will deliver the capability to process 60 per cent. of passenger movements into and out of the UK;</p>
	<p pid="a.1258W.5/4" class="indent">December 2010: Major Operating Capability&mdash;which will deliver the capability to process 95 per cent. of passenger movements into and out of the UK and</p>

	<p pid="a.1259W.0/1">Police forces or other organisations that will benefit from the provision of identity information from the National Identity Register would bear the cost of any equipment or training that they may require. No estimate of any such costs is available. However, as identity cards will be introduced incrementally, it is unlikely that any large investment would be needed at the beginning of the scheme and any costs associated with the provision of information would be phased in gradually as the national identity scheme itself grows.</p>

When looking at the impact on actual recipients, the report estimates this equates to an impact on attainment (at Levels 2 and 3) of 7 ppts for female, and 5 ppts for male, EMA recipients.

	<p pid="a.1275W.6/2">We have published a prospectus for the 'Find Your Talent' programme seeking applications from partnerships to pilot an offer of five hours of quality arts and culture a week for children and young people. We have set out a core range of activities we believe young people should be able to engage with, including the chance to play music or sing in ensembles, and take part in dance performances. But we want local communities, schools and young people themselves to be involved in designing the offer. Organisations wishing to express an interest in piloting the offer locally should contact the relevant local authority and other major cultural sector partners in their area to discuss forming a partnership. National organisations should contact the Creative Partnerships team at:</p>

	<p pid="a.1275W.6/4">10 pilots will trial different ways of delivering a cultural offer. They will build on cultural activity already taking place. Children and young people already experience folk song and dance through the National Curriculum and through activities outside the curriculum.</p>

An inflationary rise of 2.7 per cent. per year for all non-pay pressures, including energy costs, was included in the calculation of the minimum funding guarantee. We chose not to identify a specific factor for increases in energy costs in the calculation of cost pressures feeding into the minimum funding guarantee.

	<p pid="a.1281W.8/1">The Department has a range of guidance and tools already available, or currently in development, which assist schools in managing their energy resources and budgeting effectively against rising costs:</p>
	<p pid="a.1281W.8/2" class="indent">In April 2008 the Department will publish a planning guide to enable schools to better adapt to changes in their budgets and to ensure they have the appropriate tools to deliver school improvement alongside existing running costs.</p>
	<p pid="a.1281W.8/3" class="indent">Although energy costs represent only a very small proportion of the total expenditure of a school the Department has also previously published good practice guidance for schools on energy and water management<sup>(1)</sup>. This provides practical suggestions and simple ideas which can be easily implemented and achieve major savings.</p>
	<p pid="a.1281W.8/4" class="indent">In addition to this specific guidance the Department also enables schools to benchmark their energy expenditure with other schools through the Schools Financial Benchmarking website<sup>(2)</sup>.</p>
	<p pid="a.1281W.8/5" class="indent">Furthermore the Department is working with DEFRA to implement the European Energy Services Directive article 5 which requires the public sector to procure energy efficient products and goods. Guidance will be made available via Department websites.</p>

	<p pid="a.1291W.2/13">In addition, the Office for Fair Access forecasts that around &pound;300 million annually will be spent by higher education providers on bursaries and scholarships benefiting students from low-income and other underrepresented groups by the academic year 2008-09. Following passage of the Higher Education Act 2004, the Government decided to reduce the budget for Aimhigher to take account of the additional funding which was made available to support widening participation through alternative routes such as the large increases in student support.</p>
	<p pid="a.1291W.2/14">We have reformed student finance, reintroducing grants and raising the income threshold at which repayments start. No-one is required to pay a contribution to their higher education up-front. These reforms, together with Aimhigher, have been instrumental in bringing about progress towards widening participation. The proportion of UK domiciled, young, full time, first degree entrants to English higher education institutions who were from lower socio economic groups rose from 27.9 per cent. in 2002-03 to 29.1 per cent. in 2005-06.</p>

	<p pid="a.1304W.2/1">No students currently studying equivalent or lower qualifications (ELQs) will be affected by these changes. In future, our policy of redistributing grant will widen participation and mean that more of the million people of working age who do not have a first higher-level qualification, especially those from non-traditional backgrounds, will be able to benefit from participating in higher education. There can be no exemptions for particular institutions and Doncaster college will remain responsible for decisions on how it allocates its overall budget for higher education. However, in finalising our proposals in the light of consultation we have decided to make a number of adjustments:</p>
	<p pid="a.1304W.2/2" class="indent">(a) We have asked HEFCE to increase the part-time teaching premium from the &pound;20 million originally put forward in the consultation to &pound;30 million. This is a response to concerns about overall impact on part-time provision and the sustainability of subjects that are of particular interest to those who might study on a part-time basis, perhaps after a career break;</p>
	<p pid="a.1304W.2/3" class="indent">(b) There will be a review mechanism each year starting in December 2008 to look at individual subjects of particular economic or social importance. We are sure it would be wrong for us to rush into making special arrangements for any subjects, other than those which had already been identified, before any changes to ELQs, as requiring support in the public interest (such as medicine, initial teacher training teaching, science, technology, engineering and maths subjects, area-based studies, and modern foreign languages). But we are asking the Funding Council each year to look at levels of demand both for exempt or protected subjects and at any other subjects which might in future be regarded as key because of their economic or social significance, and in cases where there is evidence of a fall in demand advise us on the best way forward:</p>
	<p pid="a.1304W.2/4" class="indent">(c) The text of the HEFCE Grant Letter says &quot;I hope you will also carefully consider the position of institutions most affected by this change to the funding rules, in allocating the new funded places that are being created&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1304W.2/5" class="indent">(d) We want to set on record what the position will be in three years time. All we have asked HEFCE to do is to find savings of about &pound;100 million a year by 2010-11. Anything beyond that has to be speculation, but no-one is going to fall off the edge of a funding cliff either now or in three years' time. Indeed, the reality is that no strategic decision has been taken about whether to reallocate further ELQ funding after 2010-11.</p>

	<p pid="a.1305W.0/1">The data are not held centrally to answer this question in precisely the way it has been asked. However, in 2006-07, there were some 32,000 students aged between 30 and 39 and some 45,000 students aged 40 and over studying equivalent or lower level students. All existing students studying for such qualifications will continue to attract institutional funding until they complete their courses. The redistribution of about &pound;100 million by 2010 away from those entering higher education to study for such qualifications will increase and widen participation and enable the Government to support over 20,000 new students (on a full-time equivalent basis) more than would otherwise have been the case either entering higher education for the first time or progressing to higher degrees.</p>

	<p pid="a.1306W.5/1">The latest available information shows that the number of Vietnamese domiciled students in UK higher education institutions for the 2006-07 academic year was 1,685. Figures for 2007-08 will be available in January 2009. Numbers have increased by 16 per cent. from the previous year. This is good news. International students such as those from Vietnam bring an international perspective to our campuses, they help maintain the UK's world class research base, and they provide a valuable source of income for our universities and indeed for the economy more widely. The &quot;Global Value&quot; report published by the British Council in September estimated that the total value of international HE students to the UK economy was in the region of &pound;5 billion per year.</p>

	<p pid="a.1310W.2/34">International students bring an international perspective to our campuses, they help maintain the UK's world class research base, and they provide a valuable source of income for our universities and indeed for the economy more widely. The &quot;Global Value&quot; report published by the British Council in September estimated that the total value of international HE students to the UK economy was in the region of &pound;5 billion per year.</p>
	<p pid="a.1310W.2/35">The growth in international students is not at the expense of home and EU students. Student numbers from those domiciled in the UK and the EU have also grown. There is no question of UK students being squeezed out of the market by international students. International students are recruited in addition to the home (UK and other EU) students, whose places are subsidised by the Higher Education Funding Councils.

Most people will and do obey the rules, but there will need to be a random checking process to corroborate that particular students do not have a first HE qualification. That will need to be done in a way that gets the balance right between protection and not an overly bureaucratic system. In all cases HEFCE will work with institutions to audit feasible student numbers and final HEFCE funding will be determined on a basis of audited returns through a robust audit process.</p>

But the Government believe that short custodial sentences often lack utility and that, while serious and dangerous offenders must go to custody, less serious offenders are usually better punished in the community. We will always ensure that there are prison places for those serious and dangerous offenders who ought to be in prison and that courts have tough community sentences at their disposal to deal with less serious offenders. A working party is currently looking at the advantages, disadvantages and feasibility of establishing a Sentencing Commission that might among other things consider prison capacity.</p>

Guidance on this matter is contained in Directions to the Parole Board on the Release and Recall of Life Sentence Prisoners, a copy of which is available in the House of Commons Library.</p>
	<p pid="a.1329W.3/2">When determining whether or not such offenders should be released, the Parole Board will look at the relevant risk factors in the individual cases, the various ways in which these have been addressed during sentence, and the outcomes manifested. The ways might include formal accredited offending behaviour courses, one to one work on identified risk factors, educational or vocational interventions and achievements. The risk assessment and risk reduction processes are, of necessity, holistic ones, considering all relevant factors.</p>
