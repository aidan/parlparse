	<p pid=".581W.5/2">It is for developing countries to make their own assessment of the potential benefits of GM crops. The Government want to help ensure that if developing countries do use GM products they do so safely, appropriately and effectively to bring real benefits to their people. To assist developing countries make their own informed decisions on the possible use of GM technology the UK supports and has ratified the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety, a multilateral agreement which provides a common global basis for risk assessment, decision-making and information exchange on GM crops and other products. Of course, GM technology is only one possible tool, not a panacea.</p>
	<p pid=".581W.5/3">A recently published report by the Nuffield Council on Bioethics contains a number of case studies detailing the actual and potential benefits of GM crops for developing countries. These are not necessarily related to yield increases but may, for example, involve reduced farmer inputs.</p>

My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs announced on 16 July 2003 that Katharine Bryan had been appointed as Chair of CoRWM. Katharine subsequently left the Committee on 11 December 2003 to take up a post as Chief Executive of the Water Service, Department for Regional Development (Northern Ireland). She was succeeded as Chair of CoRWM by Gordon MacKerron, an existing member of the Committee. CoRWM continues to work with the aim of delivering its recommendations by around the end of 2005, building on the foundations laid by Katharine Bryan. The 16 July 2003 announcement also said that Government would be looking at the best way of making Nirex independent of industry and under greater Government control. Despite initial hope that we could resolve this matter during the course of 2003, our considerations are still ongoing and we shall make a statement as soon as we are able.</p>

	<p pid=".583W.9/1">In line with all employers in the public and private sector, the Government believe that the Civil Service should be allowed to determine retirement age policy with regard to its business needs while giving staff as much choice as possible about when they retire. Departments and agencies are free to set the normal retirement age for their own staff subject only to the requirement that the minimum age at which civil servants can retire with full superannuation benefits is 60.</p>
	<p pid=".583W.9/2">The normal retirement age for the Senior Civil Service is 60. However, Heads of Departments and Agency Chief Executives have the flexibility to retain members of the Senior Civil Service beyond 60 if they judge it to be in the public interest and are satisfied about the fitness and efficiency of the individual to carry out his or her duties.</p>
	<p pid=".583W.9/3">Against this background, 80 per cent. of the Civil Service now has the option to remain in work until 65, and a further 11 per cent. has the option to remain in work on short service concessions. Those Departments and agencies which have decided that there is a strong case for retaining a retirement age of 60 in the current circumstances, will be expected to continue to re-examine the issue and look positively at offering more flexibilities to older staff.</p>

	<p pid=".588W.3/1">The White Paper, &quot;21st Century Skills: Realising Our Potential&quot;, published in July last year, set out a number of measures to raise the skills levels of adults including the introduction of a new entitlement to free tuition for those studying for their first full level 2 qualification.</p>
	<p pid=".588W.3/2">We intend that the level 2 entitlement will apply to those in the workforce of working age who do not already have a full level 2 qualification and who commit to trying to achieve one. To complement this, the Adult Learning Grant (ALG) will offer an allowance of up to &pound;30 a week to help adults with the costs of learning. Lancashire is one of the 10 pilot areas for the ALG scheme. We have also put in place a strategy to ensure that low-skilled adults receive high quality information, advice and guidance to help them choose the most appropriate course.</p>
	<p pid=".588W.3/3">The Skills for Life Strategy aims to transform people's attitude to literacy and numeracy, and significantly to improve the country's skills levels. In the North West, the target for the combined local LSCs is to improve the skills of 106,000 people by the end of 2004. At July 2003, we estimate that we were on track and 73,000 people in the region had improved their skills. In addition, there has been Skills for Life work carried out by Jobcentre Plus and the Prison Service in the North West.</p>
	<p pid=".588W.3/4">To help raise the skills levels of those already in employment, we are running 12 Employer Training Pilots, including one in Greater Manchester, to encourage employers to invest in skills and qualifications, particularly for low skilled trainees. The Pilots are testing out a package of financial support measures to improve access to training and enable employees to develop basic skills and NVQ level 2 qualifications.</p>
	<p pid=".588W.3/5">We are also working to engage employers in activity to address the basic skills needs of their employees. This includes working with Business in the Community (BITC) who have an adviser in each region, including the North West, who is able to meet and discuss basic skills with employers. BITC are also working with a number of major companies in the North West on developing programmes to address basic skills. In addition, a group of Employer Champions has been established, who will act as advocates for basic skills with other employers. Champions are represented in the North West by the North West Regional Development Agency, Liverpool City Council, and Airbags International.</p>
	<p pid=".588W.3/6">We recognise that there is a strong regional dimension to the skills problem. Regional Skills Partnerships (RSPs) will be set up in each region to help ensure that the work of different agencies involved in delivering the aims of the Skills Strategy are better co-ordinated and delivered in a way that connects with the needs of employers at regional, local and sectoral levels. Key Partners in the RSPs include the Learning and Skills Council, Jobcentre Plus, the Skills for Business Network, and the Small Business Service. We will be talking to the North West Development Agency and their partners about their plans to set up the Partnership in the North West over the next few months.</p>

	<p pid=".589W.2/1">Union Learning Representatives are a key component of the Government's new Skills Strategy. In developing the Strategy, we consulted widely and met with trade union representatives on a number of occasions to discuss the vital role that unions and their learning representatives have to play. The TUC is, of course, a key member of the Skills Alliance which will bring together Government, employers and trade unions to oversee the future development and delivery of the Skills Strategy.</p>
	<p pid=".589W.2/2">Earlier evaluations of the Union Learning Fund and Union Learning Representatives have provided evidence that they have been very effective in helping to encourage workers to improve their skills, particularly workers with low skills and those with literacy and numeracy problems&mdash;the very people who so often miss out on learning opportunities.</p>
	<p pid=".589W.2/3">Analysis of the profile of learners engaged by Union Learning Representatives suggests that they have been very successful in engaging non-traditional learners including older males, people in minority ethnic groups and shift workers. Data for performance management information for 2002&ndash;03 confirm that some 19 per cent. of learners from current ULF projects come from ethnic minority backgrounds and 19 per cent. of learners are aged 51 and over (almost 60 per cent. are aged 41 and over).</p>
	<p pid=".589W.2/4">There are currently around 6,500 Union Learning Representatives. Their new statutory rights, which came into force at the end of April 2003, will help their numbers to grow and we look forward to seeing a national network of over 22,000 trained Union Learning Representatives in place by 2010, helping over 250,000 workers a year into learning.</p>
	<p pid=".589W.2/5">Regular evaluation of the Union Learning Fund, which includes data on Union Learning Representatives, has taken place up to 2002 and copies of the reports are available in the House of Commons Library. Further longitudinal evaluation, with the aim of measuring the impact of both ULF and ULRs in improving skills levels in the workplace, is commencing from April 2004.</p>

	<p pid=".591W.3/1">There has been a specialised taxation scheme for the construction industry since the 1970s to regulate an industry with a long history of poor compliance on taxation matters. The original scheme required a deduction to be made from payments unless the subcontractor could meet certain standards, which allowed him to be paid gross. However, this system failed to limit the numbers receiving gross payment.</p>
	<p pid=".591W.3/2">The Construction Industry Scheme (CIS) was introduced in Finance Act 1995 and implemented from August 1999. It tightened up the criteria for gaining a gross payment certificate by requiring all subcontractors applying for gross payment status to demonstrate a minimum level of turnover. This approach proved successful and safeguarded monies that were previously at risk to the Exchequer under its predecessor.</p>
	<p pid=".591W.3/3">The current review of CIS followed industry complaints about its cumbersome processes. The Chancellor announced, in Budget 2003 that the CIS would be replaced by a new system that will relieve some of the industry's administrative burden.</p>
	<p pid=".591W.3/4">The Inland Revenue has consulted extensively with industry representatives on the detail of the new scheme, including the criteria for gross payment status. Alternatives to the turnover test were suggested by the industry but none was as effective in restricting the number of subcontractors obtaining gross payment required to preserve the effectiveness of the scheme.</p>
	<p pid=".591W.3/5">Successive Governments have accepted that it is not appropriate to disclose the advice given to Ministers by civil servants.</p>

	<p pid=".606W.5/1">Pensions legislation is a devolved matter to Northern Ireland. The provisions of the Pensions Bill therefore generally extend only to Great Britain. The exceptions to this are set out in clause 246, which specifies the provisions that also extend to Northern Ireland. These include those establishing the two new Non-Departmental Public Bodies, The Pensions Regulator and the Board of the Pension Protection Fund, which&mdash;as currently with the Occupational Pensions Regulatory Authority and the Pensions Compensation Board&mdash;will operate throughout the United Kingdom, but with functions relating to Northern Ireland conferred by Northern Ireland legislation.</p>
	<p pid=".606W.5/2">Clause 247 allows provision corresponding to the Pensions Bill to be made for Northern Ireland by Order in Council subject to negative resolution.</p>
	<p pid=".606W.5/3">The Government remains sympathetic to all those people who will not receive the pension they worked so hard to build up for their future retirement. Ministers have been meeting those affected by pension losses in order to understand their plight and to listen to suggestions regarding assistance ahead of the Pension Protection Fund's introduction.</p>
	<p pid=".606W.5/4">We are exploring all the suggestions that have been put to us and are considering them in depth. But there are complex arguments on both sides so we need to consider very carefully what the appropriate course of action should be.</p>
	<p pid=".606W.5/5">It would be very cruel to raise expectations for these people who have suffered such a dramatic blow to their security in retirement, if we cannot then provide assistance.</p>

These discussions were usually held through the Broadband Stakeholder Group, which was established to advise the Government on the development and implementation of a strategy to achieve this target and provide a focal point for stakeholders to address both short and long-term issues related to the deployment and take-up of broadband services. The Government values the work of the Broadband Stakeholder Group and the contribution it has made to the successful deployment of broadband in the UK.</p>

	<p pid=".607W.9/1">The primary focus of the Government's strategy is to meet the needs of end-users through the promotion of competition at all levels in the value chain in terms of quality, choice of broadband services and value for money. This means the effective and sustainable competition in the provision of broadband networks and services and a regulatory framework that is conducive to further investment and rollout to all areas of the United Kingdom. The third generation mobile phone sector offers not only increased competition and greater consumer choice; it will also provide a true mobile broadband service for individuals and businesses alike.</p>
	<p pid=".607W.9/2">The Government's policy in licensing spectrum early for the third generation mobile phone sector has enabled the UK along with Italy to launch the first services in Europe. The auction of third generation licences enabled a new entrant, Hutchinson 3G, to enter the market and provide increased competition. The licence condition for third generation mobile phone operators will ensure that at least 80 per cent. of the UK population will be covered by third generation services by 2007.</p>

	<p pid=".614W.6/1">There are no plans to form UK-French battle groups. There is, however, a UK/French/German proposal to develop European capabilities in support of the EU's ability to undertake rapid crisis response operations. This advances the UK-French Summit declaration made on 24 November, and the UN's demand for more rapid reaction peacekeeping forces. As part of the Helsinki Headline Goal, EU member states agreed to develop rapid response elements available and deployable at very high readiness.</p>
	<p pid=".614W.6/2">The proposal being discussed by EU member states is to create battle group-sized forces (approximately 1,500 strong including Combat Support and Combat Service Support), deployable within 15 days, and sustainable for 30 days (but extendable up to 120 days). The target date for such forces to be available is 2007, and they will be designed for compatibility with typical UN Chapter VII mandates (to restore international peace and security). EU member states would be able to offer such formations individually&mdash;as is likely to be the case for the UK&mdash;or on a multinational basis, from existing forces. The concept will be developed coherently and transparently with the NATO Response Force. This initiative is compatible with current UK force structures and the UK's Joint Rapid Reaction Force, which already includes a number of very high readiness battlegroup formations. It is not envisaged that any additional military or civilian personnel will be required.</p>

	<p pid=".614W.9/1">We have no plans to raise the normal retirement age for members of the armed forces from the current age of 55. This reflects the continuing fitness requirements for most of those who serve a full career in the armed forces. For the future, the age at which the preserved pension is paid to those leaving before age 55 will be deferred from the current age of 60 to age 65. This will affect both the current and the new schemes. We have not decided when to make the change to the existing scheme. The saving from the change to the preserved pension age in the new scheme is some &pound;50 million a year and has been used to fund unmarried partners benefits and improved death-in-service benefits, as well as contributing to the costs of increased longevity. The right under the current scheme to take an Immediate Pension from age 38 with 16 years service (Officers) or age 40 with 22 years service (Other Ranks) is not affected.</p>

	<p pid=".615W.8/1">As at 24 February, 78 members of 3 Commando Brigade Royal Marines had been evacuated to the UK owing to cold weather illness/injury. This is not unusual during a Winter Deployment compared against previous historical data. Changes to Health and Safety regulations however, have reduced the threshold at which those suffering cold weather injuries are sent home. Previously many would have been treated in theatre and returned to training.</p>
	<p pid=".615W.8/2">A full analysis of the precise nature of these injuries will not be completed for some time. This is because, to provide a useful assessment of the injury, examination has to take place three months after the initial injury. The earliest date medical assessments can begin is May. It is anticipated that all casualties will have been examined by the end of June 2004.</p>
	<p pid=".615W.8/3">Initial feedback from theatre does, however, indicate that the cause of these cold injuries is varied. There is no evidence of one particular cause of cold weather injuries or of any specific equipment deficiencies.</p>
	<p pid=".615W.8/4">None is directly attributable to sleeping bags, contrary to recent press speculation.</p>

	<p pid=".617W.3/1">Initially, coalition forces were committed to securing and protecting a wide variety of key cultural and public assets and sites across Iraq. However, as Iraqi authorities have steadily regained capability, they have taken on increasing responsibility for securing and protecting their own assets and sites (administrative, economic and cultural). While coalition forces remain on hand to assist and support those elements of the Iraqi Security Forces involved in this work, the day-to-day security of these assets and sites is now, as it should be, in the hands of Iraqis.</p>

Services are working towards establishing the full complement of early intervention teams by the end of the year. The &quot;Mental Health Policy Implementation Guide&quot; (2001) sets out detailed guidance to help them, and support is also provided through the development centres of the National Institute for Mental Health in England.

These have included, most recently, talks at the Husaini Cultural Centre in Peterborough in September 2003 and also at Haringey Mosque and the Islamic Cultural Centre in London in November 2003.</p>

	<p pid=".627W.2/1" class="holdinganswer">holding answer 23 February 2004</p>
	<p pid=".627W.2/2">The Stewart Report, in 2000, provided a thorough and comprehensive consideration of the public health concerns associated with mobile phone systems and is available on the website of the independent expert group on mobile phones at: <a href="http://www.iegmp.org.uk">www.iegmp.org.uk</a> The report dealt principally with signals from the widely used mobile phone (GSM) technologies, but it did note some contradictory results when examining the biological effects of pulsed radio signals similar to those associated with TETRA (terrestrial trunked radio). While no obvious health effect was suggested, it did recommend a precautionary approach.</p>
	<p pid=".627W.2/3">The main conclusion about base stations from the Stewart Report was that:</p>
	<p pid=".627W.2/4" class="indent">&quot;the balance of evidence indicates that there is no general risk to the health of people living near to base stations on the basis that exposures are expected to be small fractions of guidelines&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".627W.2/5">A substantial number of measurements of potential exposures of the public from base station emissions have now been made by a number of bodies, including the National Radiological Protection Board (NRPB) at: <a href="http://www.nrpb.org">www.nrpb.org</a> and the Radiocommunications Agency (now part of Ofcom) at: <a href="http://www.ofcom.org.uk">www.ofcom.org.uk</a> These measurements include emissions from TETRA base stations. In all cases exposures have been very much lower than the guidelines published by the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP).</p>
	<p pid=".627W.2/6">The latest report from NRPB's advisory group on non-ionising radiation (AGNIR), entitled &quot;Health Effects from Radiofrequency Electromagnetic Fields&quot;, was published on 14 January 2004. It addressed the base station issue and concluded that:</p>
	<p pid=".627W.2/7" class="indent">&quot;Exposure levels from living near to mobile phone base stations are extremely low, and the overall evidence indicates that they are unlikely to pose a risk to health.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".627W.2/8">Following a request by the Home Office to the NRPB, the issue of possible health effects caused by signals from TETRA base stations was comprehensively addressed by AGNIR. They published their report, &quot;Possible Health Effects from Terrestrial Trunked Radio (TETRA)&quot;, in 2001, which is available as Documents of NRPB, Volume 12, No. 2, 2001, or on the NRPB website: <a href="http://www.nrpb.org">www.nrpb.org</a> They noted that whereas the signals from the TETRA handsets are pulsed, those from TETRA base stations are not pulsed. They concluded, therefore, that there is no reason to believe that signals from TETRA base stations should be treated differently from other base stations. The AGNIR report also found that exposures of the public to signals from TETRA base stations are small fractions of international guidelines.</p>
	<p pid=".627W.2/9">TETRA technologies are included within the Mobile Telecommunications and Health Research (MTHR) programme, set by the Government in 2001 and available at: <a href="http://www.mthr.org.uk">www.mthr.org.uk</a> An associated programme, specifically on TETRA, is being funded by the Home Office (<a href="http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk">www.homeoffice.gov.uk</a>). A number of projects are already under way, but it will be some time before the results are available.</p>

	<p pid=".628W.2/2">Approximately one third of the NHS Wales estate is over 50-years-old. It is generally accepted that the technological developments which are driving forward medical and clinical advances, and the demands for better patient environments are best accommodated by modern, purpose built facilities. In order to achieve this, NHS Wales has disposed of 30 healthcare properties (i.e. those with overnight beds) over the period from April 1997 to March 2003. Receipts from these disposals are reinvested in the modernisation process and have contributed to a total spend of &pound;667million over the same period.</p>

	<p pid=".634W.8/1">Planning application SUN/2963/11 was first referred to my right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister for consideration on 13 December 2000. The application was called in for my right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister's own determination on 19 February 2001 and, following a public inquiry, was refused on 13 November 2001, against the Inspector's recommendation. The decision was successfully challenged in the High Court but the application was again refused on 12 March 2003. That decision has again been successfully challenged and the application now falls to be re-determined a second time. My right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister attaches great importance to preserving the openness of the Green Belt, and has asked for any further representations the parties may wish to make by the closing date of 27 February 2004. A decision will be made as soon as possible.</p>
