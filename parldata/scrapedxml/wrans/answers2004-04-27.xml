Additionally, in certain cases, errors may be rectified by the High Court. The Common Land Policy Statement, published in July 2002, contains an outline proposal to make further provision in new legislation for the correction of errors. It is also intended that the scope of this provision will be wider than before.

	<p pid=".862W.0/1">The disposal of catering waste to landfill is a longstanding practice and only 1.4 per cent. of the national pig herd was swill fed. The increase in the amount of catering waste going to landfill following the ban on 93 swill users for about 82,000 pigs was therefore very small compared to the total amount of catering waste generated from the 260,000 restaurants and other catering outlets across the UK, which as a matter of course, currently goes to landfill.</p>
	<p pid=".862W.0/2">It is not possible to give a definitive picture of the disposal methods for the relatively small amount of catering waste that was formerly fed to pigs but it is not considered to be ending up down sewers as has been   suggested. There are day-to-day problems with blockages to drains and sewers which are dealt with by the various authorities, but the main stream of catering waste is collectable and is not in a form that can be easily disposed of down the sewer.</p>
	<p pid=".862W.0/3">In common with all methods of disposing of animal by-products disposal to landfill does carry some risks to animal health. Among the measures in place to minimise such risks landfill operators work to specific conditions of their licence or permit including covering waste with inert material and maintaining a strict pest control programme.</p>
	<p pid=".862W.0/4">No comparative risk assessment has been made of the risks of swill feeding and landfill when exotic diseases are absent from the national herd. However, when a disease such as foot and mouth is present, the level of virus circulating increases the risk from swill feeding.</p>

	<p pid=".864W.8/1">The Countryside Agency established the Vital Villages Programme in 2001 in response to the Rural White Paper. It was a time-limited programme designed to demonstrate what communities could achieve. The Countryside Agency has met its three-year target to help rural communities to help themselves and demonstrate good practice.</p>
	<p pid=".864W.8/2">In 2004&ndash;05 the Countryside Agency is targeting its resources on meeting all existing grant commitments under the Vital Villages programme and helping communities benefit from the funds already committed to them. It will also work to share the lessons learnt with regional and local delivery bodies.</p>

	<p pid=".869W.8/1">We remain committed to the UN target and will continue to make progress towards 0.7 per cent. as the fiscal climate permits. The 2004 Spending Review is an opportunity to consider plans for development spending beyond 2005&ndash;06, alongside other priorities and pressures, but at this time it is not possible to predict the outcome of the Spending Review. In his Budget 2004 speech, the Chancellor announced that this Government will not freeze or cut the international development aid budget, but rather increase it. This is part of the Government's continuing commitment to increasing development aid. By 2005&ndash;06 the UK's aid budget will have grown by 93 per cent. in real term to 0.4 per cent. the largest ever increase in UK development funding. This will be double the current (2002) G7 average of 0.2 per cent. and well above the current (2002) average of 0.23 per cent. for countries on the OECD Development Assistance Committee. As our record shows, we are serious about making progress towards 0.7 per cent.</p>
	<p pid=".869W.8/2">However, there is an urgent need for additional funds now if we are to make progress on meeting the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). The reality is that we will not raise the $50 billion needed every year to meet the MDGs unless every bilateral donor reaches 0.7 per cent. immediately. If even just two or three of the biggest bilateral donors fail to reach 0.7 per cent. now, we will fail to raise the funds required. That is why the Government has proposed an International Finance Facility (IFF) in order to deliver these resources. The IFF provides a realistic and feasible way of front-loading aid to meet the immediate need.</p>

It is no longer the practice of the MOD's Disposal Services Agency (DSA) to undertake the export of surplus goods it has sold in this manner. The purchasing customer will take ownership of the goods in the UK and arrange their export under licence.</p>

The labour market continues to perform robustly with employment close to a historic high and unemployment around its lowest level since the 1970s. Growth figures have recently been revised upwards to better reflect real changes in the economy. Interest rates and inflation are historically low. Business surveys are pointing to a continued strengthening of business activity in Scotland in both services and manufacturing and independent forecasters predict that growth will be above-trend in 2004 and 2005.</p>

At March 2004 there were 18,000 claimants compared to 29,000 in 1997, a fall of 38 per cent. However, the Government are aware that the challenge remains to further increase employment in Glasgow.

	<p pid=".881W.2/1">I refer the hon. Member to the answer given to him on 23 April 2004. For electronic searches of land registers to be possible, local authorities must first have set up electronic Local Land and Property Gazetteers (LLPGs). Such gazetteers form an integral part of local e-government, and the benefits arising from them have not been separately estimated or assessed. The overall savings from local e-government, and in particular achieving the Prime Minister's target of all priority services being electronically enabled by 2005, were estimated by local authorities themselves in 2003 as being about &pound;80 million per annum by 2005&ndash;06. As well as efficiency savings, there will be significant benefits to authorities' customers, through improvement of service delivery including quicker land charge searches.</p>
	<p pid=".881W.2/2">Electronic processing of local land search inquiries offers the prospect of securing search information in minutes and hours rather than days and weeks. To maximise the benefits for housing transactions, local search and other information that is important to home buying and selling decisions needs to be available at the start of the transaction process. Home information packs will secure this. They will enable buyers and sellers to negotiate from an informed position and help them commit more quickly to the transaction. This will increase certainty, reduce failure and wasted costs, and help shorten the overall transaction timescale.</p>

This is because planning permission to carry out demolition is granted by the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 1995. However, where access to land has been opened up by the demolition of buildings, a planning application is likely to be required to develop that land; for example, for housing. Planning applications must be determined on their merits in accordance with relevant policies in the development plan, unless material considerations indicate otherwise.

All development listed in Schedule 1 to The Town and Country Planning (Environmental Impact Assessment) Regulations 1999 is assumed to have such effects, and EIA is mandatory for such development. For development listed in Schedule 2 to the Regulations, local planning authorities have to determine whether EIA will be required. In doing so they must take account of prescribed selection criteria relating to the characteristics, location and potential impact of the development. As an aid to determining whether Schedule 2 development is likely to have significant environmental effects, indicative thresholds and criteria are included in DETR Circular 02/99 which gives guidance on the operation of the 1999 Regulations.</p>

	<p pid=".886W.3/1">Between September 2001 and 31 March 2004, the Starter Home Initiative (SHI) helped key workers into home ownership in areas where the high cost of housing serves to undermine recruitment and retention of skilled staff in our key public services. The SHI was available in London and the South East region and in some housing hotspots in the East, South West and West Midlands regions. It was not available to key workers in the North West region.</p>
	<p pid=".886W.3/2">The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister is not aware of an Abandoned Homes Initiative. However, our Market Renewal Pathfinders are a comprehensive programme to tackle low demand and abandonment in nine English areas. The Oldham and Rochdale pathfinder, which includes Middleton but not Heywood, received &pound;53.5 million to April 2006, which will fund a large-scale programme of capital works to revive the housing market and improve the environment. The boundaries of this scheme were drawn up following an analysis of local housing markets to identify those areas most acutely affected by low demand and abandonment.</p>

	<p pid=".888W.3/1">The investigation carried out by the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) into cabin air quality focused only on substances found in air conditioning ducts of a certain type of aircraft. The study was commissioned to investigate the safety implications arising from potential incapacitation in flight crew as a result of contaminated cabin air. As such the CAA did not consider the presence of other substances and effects on low-level exposure. This was a specific piece of scientific research; therefore it was not appropriate for the CAA to seek views, either from medical experts or other stakeholders. The Aviation Health Unit is currently considering the extent to which further research should be commissioned into the presence in the cabin air of organophosphates and their effect on passengers and crew.</p>

	<p pid=".889W.2/2">The Department for Transport is one of 15 Government Departments which owns or leases alternatively fuelled vehicles. In 2003, 9 per cent. of all Government fleet vehicles (excluding those from the Ministry of Defence) were alternatively fuelled.</p>
	<p pid=".889W.2/3">The Department for Transport Headquarters has very few departmental vehicles. The Government Car Service (GCS) provides our ministerial cars, one of which is a petrol-electric hybrid vehicle and one of which runs on liquefied petroleum gas (LPG). Of the GCS's total ministerial car fleet, 13 per cent. are alternatively fuelled, the majority of which are LPG vehicles.</p>
	<p pid=".889W.2/4">Over 1,000 vehicles are currently used by the Department for Transport's various agencies, including a number of specialist vehicles. Precise information is not readily available on the fuels used by all these vehicles, but in 2003, approximately 11 per cent. of the vehicles for which this information was available were LPG vehicles.</p>

	<p pid=".891W.14/2">Rolling stock building and leasing costs vary widely. A two car Pacer, for example, will have cost about &pound;500,000 to build at present prices and is likely to cost an operator in the region of &pound;50,000 per year to lease. A more modern two car train, such as a Class 170, would command an annual rent of around &pound;170,000 per year, reflecting substantially higher build costs.</p>

	<p pid=".892W.2/3">TRANSEC have carried out port facility security assessments at facilities which fall within the scope of the Code and have categorised them by traffic type. Both TRANSEC and MCA have issued security instructions and standards for different categories of port and ship facilities, and have provided port and ship security plan   templates to assist industry with the preparation of their security plans. Liaison with the port and shipping industries has played a fundamental part in developing effective and proportionate policies and this communication is on-going.</p>
	<p pid=".892W.2/4">It is not our policy to comment in detail on security measures. Therefore, I cannot set out in detail the number of ships or port facilities that already have approved Security Plans. However, all of the major UK ports including the passenger operations have been assessed and Port Facility Security Plans are currently being submitted for approval. Passenger and non-passenger ship security plans are currently being submitted to TRANSEC and MCA for approval and verification visits are being undertaken by inspectors to    ensure that the plans developed are operating effectively.</p>

Adequacy of protection is determined on a case by case basis having regard to all the circumstances. The US Department of Commerce have established a set of data protection rules (generally known as the &quot;safe harbour&quot;) to which certain organisations receiving personal data from the EU may subscribe. The European Commission have made a formal finding that the &quot;safe harbour&quot; provides adequate data protection for the purposes of the EC Data Protection Directive (95/46/EC) to which the Data   Protection Act 1998 gives effect. About 450 organisations currently subscribe to the &quot;safe harbour&quot;.</p>

	<p pid=".895W.6/20">The Commission's Special Investigations Unit (SIU) deals with means assessments for individual applicants for legal aid which are difficult or contentious including cases of misrepresentation by applicants for publicly funded legal services. Figures on the number of cases in each year where investigation resulted in the refusal or withdrawal of funding or an increase in the contributions payable are set out as follows:</p>
	<p pid=".895W.6/21" class="indent">2000&ndash;01&mdash;319</p>
	<p pid=".895W.6/22" class="indent">2001&ndash;02&mdash;128</p>
	<p pid=".895W.6/23" class="indent">2002&ndash;03&mdash;152</p>
	<p pid=".895W.6/24">For criminal legal aid, means assessment was used prior to 2001&ndash;02. The Court Service referred cases to the Commission's SIU where applicants had complex financial affairs. In 2000&ndash;01 98 investigation into criminal cases were concluded, following 181 referrals from the Court Service. 95 per cent. of investigations in criminal cases led to the refusal or withdrawal of funding. 47 investigations were concluded in 2001&ndash;02 relating to applications for criminal legal aid made prior   to April 2001. In 85 per cent. of these cases, investigations resulted in a change to the decision regarding funding.</p>

	<p pid=".896W.2/1">The Legal Services Commission (LSC) has reported regularly to my Department on measures they have taken to improve quality in publicly funded legal services since it replaced the Legal Aid Board in April 2000.</p>
	<p pid=".896W.2/2">The Specialist Quality Mark replaced franchise arrangements in April 2002 and became a requirement for all organisations wanting to provide specialist legal services within the Criminal Legal Service (CLS) and Criminal Defence Service (CDS). The Quality Mark is a set of quality assurance standards for legal information, general advice and specialist legal services.</p>
	<p pid=".896W.2/3">The LSC is aware that some of the requirements of the Quality Mark are viewed by suppliers as overly bureaucratic. In response, a revised audit process was introduced in April 2003 that will mean that the Commission can undertake less exhaustive, less frequent audits for the best performing solicitors' firms and advice agencies. The LSC is consulting on further measures to ease the burden on firms and will continue to work with the profession to improve the position.</p>

	<p pid=".904W.2/2">My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State agreed with industry leaders that a new framework document for tourism should be produced, at the third Hartwell seminar in February 2003. This was to follow the Government's major reforms of April 2003, which created VisitBritain and passed strategic responsibility for tourism in the English regions to the Regional Development Agencies. I outlined the likely timescale for publication to the All Party Parliamentary Group on   Tourism on 5 November 2003. At that time, I anticipated the publication of the Prospectus in early 2004.</p>

	<p pid=".912W.5/1">Utility companies are subject to the range of consumer legislation governing the sale of goods and services. The specific regulation of utility companies is a matter for the individual sectoral regulators. The Government have no plans to prohibit cold-calling or door-to-door sales. In respect of gas and electricity, during 2002, the industry agreed both the EnergySure scheme, to improve the training and oversight of sales staff, and a Code of Practice on doorstep selling. In that year, we also provided OFGEM with the power to levy financial penalties on companies that breached their operating licences. OFGEM subsequently used that power to fine London Electricity &pound;2 million for mis-selling under its own brand and that of Virgin Energy. Complaints about energy mis-selling have significantly declined since 2002.</p>

	<p pid=".912W.8/1">The Government will not introduce legislation to prevent the disconnection of utility supplies because of non-payment of bills. Gas and electricity suppliers have, as a matter of last resort and subject to a range of safeguards, the right to disconnect customers who have not paid their bills and have ignored repeated requests to do so. The Office of Gas and Electricity Markets (OFGEM), has been in discussion with the energy industry about measures to improve arrangements surrounding disconnections, particularly as they affect vulnerable customers, and will shortly issue an industry consultation paper on the revised arrangements. In electronic communications, disconnection is a matter for the regulator, the Office of   Communications (OFCOM). All communications providers must have disconnection procedures that are proportionate and not unduly discriminatory. In water, companies cannot disconnect a domestic customer's supply for debt.</p>

There has therefore been no specific recent assessment of the implications of charging for use of the car park, but the Greater London Authority Act 1999 contains provisions which would allow the authority or Westminster city council to introduce a licensing scheme for parking in the Palace of Westminster, under which they may levy a charge on the two Houses.

	<p pid=".917W.8/1">No overall assessment has been made of the TEACCH educational programme for young people with autistic spectrum disorders. This is because during the course of school inspections the Education and Training Inspectorate (ETI) inspect the quality of the teaching and learning as it meets the individual needs of the child in the school setting. This may involve a range of programmes but the specific interventions are not inspected in isolation. Between 1998 and 2000 the ETI undertook &quot;A Survey of Provision for Pupils with Severe and Profound Learning Difficulties in NI&quot;. This included a section on provision for pupils with autism, which commented favourably on the use of TEACCH in the classroom by the teachers surveyed.</p>
	<p pid=".917W.8/2">For the Education and Library Boards, the ongoing assessment of TEACCH, as with other programmes, is a natural element of the work of school-based staff who are experienced and/or trained in this approach.</p>

Consequently the ETI has designed a strategic pathway to enable it to evaluate and identify effective practice in home-based programmes for children with Autism.</p>

The views expressed in response to the consultation reflect the diversity of opinion in our society. All responses have been examined carefully and the points made, both points of principle and detailed comments, have been properly taken into account. Having considered the responses and reflected upon the issues raised, it was concluded that the reasons why we put forward these proposals in the first place still held good. That decision was confirmed publicly in the Press Release issued on 31 March 2004 and the Civil Partnership Bill published on that date included Northern Ireland provisions.</p>

Children's nurses working in the hospital setting have been attracted to community practice and to undertake further training required in community children's nursing.

	<p pid=".921W.2/1">In line with departmental policy, the Eastern Board is responsible for the equitable distribution among its local populations of the resources provided to it by the Department. In doing so, the Board has developed a locality equity strategy which has, and will continue to, skew additional resources towards those local populations assessed as being underfunded in relation to their target share of resources determined by an evidence based formula. Resources skewed towards the North Down and Ards locality in 2004&ndash;05 have resulted in a reduction of the relative under investment position by &pound;0.329 million. In addition, a further &pound;0.6 million has been provided to support Family and Child Care services in North Down and Ards. The locality equity assessment will be revised next year as the latest research into needs-based allocations becomes available.</p>

	<p pid=".926W.3/78">In March 2003 the Government published a Community Safety Strategy&mdash;Creating a Safer Northern Ireland through Partnership. One of the nine key issues specified in the strategy related to car crime. The Strategy has an aim of reducing car crime by 10 per cent. by 2007, using 2001&ndash;02 as a baseline year. A number of activities were defined in the Strategy document and many of these have commenced.</p>
	<p pid=".926W.3/79">During the period March to May 2002 the PSNI implemented Operation Clean Up in the Greater Belfast area, an operation that removed unlicensed vehicles from public roads. In that period 940 vehicles were removed with 83 per cent. of them being destroyed. This operation had a major impact on crime with the reported crimes of domestic burglary, theft of vehicles and &quot;drive offs&quot; from petrol stations significantly reduced; road traffic accidents were also down by 13 per cent., vehicle arsons were down by 23 per cent. and the number of vehicles removed by Councils down by 32 per cent.</p>
	<p pid=".926W.3/80">Since then further similar exercises have been completed in Londonderry, Tyrone, Ballymena and Larne.</p>
	<p pid=".926W.3/81">Funds have now been secured to deliver an extended car crime project, based upon Operation Clean Up, and discussions are currently on going with the PSNI, DVLNI and Belfast city council.</p>
	<p pid=".926W.3/82">In a partnership of organisations led by the Probation Board and funded by the NIO the IMPACT project was established in West Belfast. The aim of the project is to reduce the level of car crime related incidents by targeting those involved and those who are vulnerable to involvement to such activity, through the provision of structured preventative, diversionary and interventionist programmes. This project has recently been given funding for the period up to March 2006.</p>
	<p pid=".926W.3/83">The PSNI have undertaken a number of specific initiatives to tackle offenders. A special Auto Crime Team has been established which operates mainly in the West Belfast area, to tackle the problems associated with &quot;joy riding&quot;. This has proved to be very successful with a significant number of arrests being made and individuals prosecuted.</p>
	<p pid=".926W.3/84">In addition a number of local initiatives have been undertaken throughout Northern Ireland which are supported by advice and leaflets from local crime prevention officers.</p>
	<p pid=".926W.3/85">Since 2003 the Government have introduced legislation which brought in some new offences and tougher penalties for offences such as aggravated vehicle taking, dangerous driving, causing death by dangerous driving, causing death by careless driving while under the influence of alcohol or drugs and causing death or grievous bodily injury by aggravated vehicle taking. The PSNI will have powers of arrest for drivers who drive while disqualified. Many of these legislative proposals are currently published for consultations. It is anticipated that any new offences and changes to the maximum sentences available will be in place and operational by autumn 2004.</p>

	<p pid=".929W.2/1">The responsibility to ensure regular attendance at school rests primarily with parents. Where a school has concerns about a pupil's attendance, a referral can be made to the Education Welfare Service. An officer will normally visit the home to assess the situation and then determine appropriate follow up action based on the underlying reasons for poor attendance.</p>
	<p pid=".929W.2/2">The Department of Education has recently made funds available to the Education and Library Boards for a computerised database for the Education Welfare Service aimed, among other things, at tracking and monitoring pupils whose attendance is a cause for concern. In addition a pilot project aimed at promoting the habit of regular attendance at an early age is currently under way in a number of primary schools. Following a full evaluation of this project the Department will consider if it could usefully be extended to other schools.</p>

	<p pid=".930W.3/1">The Home Office has not itself conducted a general cost/benefit analysis regarding animal experimentation. Various competent bodies have considered whether animal experimentation is valid and justified, including the Animal Procedures Committee and the House of Lords Select Committee on Animals in Scientific Procedures. They have concluded, in line with the consensus within the scientific community, that there is a continuing need for animal research and testing.</p>
	<p pid=".930W.3/2">A form of cost benefit assessment of individual programmes of work has to be undertaken before the Home Office grants licences under the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 to authorise the use of animals. Such licences can accordingly only be granted where, among other considerations, the likely benefits of the work are expected to outweigh the welfare costs to the animals involved. No animal procedures are therefore lawfully carried out which have not been fully justified.</p>

	<p pid=".930W.6/1">Heterotopic transplants of organs are those in which the transplanted organ is not located at the same anatomical position as the animal's own organ, for example, where a third kidney is implanted into the abdomen. We are not aware of any research carried out in the United Kingdom, or elsewhere, exclusively to study the effects of such transplants on the welfare of the animals concerned.</p>
	<p pid=".930W.6/2">Such transplants have been carried out under the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 to investigate aspects of the performance of the transplanted organs, and causes of transplant rejection and methods of overcoming this problem. Significant scientific findings have been published in peer-reviewed scientific journals. The effects on the welfare of the animals would be reported in records maintained by the researchers.</p>

	<p pid=".931W.0/1">For some time now the Government has taken the view that greater openness and transparency regarding the regulation and use of animals in scientific procedures is desirable, providing it does not jeopardise the safety of individual scientists and their establishments, or their legitimate commercial and intellectual interests.</p>
	<p pid=".931W.0/2">We have undertaken to review all statutory bars to the disclosure of information as part of our commitment to freedom of information, including section 24 of the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986, the so-called 'confidentiality clause'. Section 24 makes the unauthorised disclosure of confidential information relating to the use of animals in scientific procedures by Home Office Ministers and officials, members of the Animal Procedures Committee, and others appointed for specific purposes under the Act, a criminal offence. I hope to announce the outcome of the review of section 24 shortly.</p>
	<p pid=".931W.0/3">Separately, in our response to the report of the House of Lords Select Committee on Animals in Scientific Procedures, published in January 2003 (Cm 5729), we announced plans to publish summary information relating to project licences issued under the 1986 Act as part of the Home Office publication scheme under the Freedom of Information Act 2000. Home Office officials are working out the practical arrangements with licensees now and we plan to publish the first summaries in the autumn 2004.</p>
	<p pid=".931W.0/4">At the same time, we have concluded that there would be value in the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Inspectorate publishing an annual report on its work. The Inspectorate's first annual report will also be published in the autumn of 2004. In addition, the Inspectorate has an active outreach and education programme to inform stakeholders about the regulatory system and the Home Office web-site includes a range of material relating to the implementation of the 1986 Act.</p>

	<p pid=".932W.0/1">The Imutran Limited research licensed by the Home Office under the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 involving pig to non-human primate xenotransplantation studies was carried out between 1994 and 2000 under three project licences all of which were allocated an overall severity band of 'moderate'. In addition, of the 28 separate protocols of regulated procedures authorised under these licences, two were allocated substantial severity limits, 16 were classified as moderate, seven were classified as mild, and three were unclassified.</p>
	<p pid=".932W.0/2">The administrative system under the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 distinguishes between the 'severity limit' of a protocol and the 'severity band' of a project. The severity limit of a protocol is determined by the upper limit of the expected adverse effects that may be encountered by the animal involved, taking into account the measures specified in the licence for avoiding and controlling adverse effects. It represents the worse potential outcome for any animal subjected to the series of regulated procedures in the protocol, even if it may only be experienced by a small number of the animals to be used. Severity limits are categorised as unclassified, mild, moderate and substantial. Definitions of these categories are provided in paragraph 5.42 of the published Guidance on the Operation of the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 (HC321).</p>
	<p pid=".932W.0/3">The allocation of a severity band to a project reflects the number of animals used on each protocol and the actual suffering likely to be caused as a result. It is based on the overall level of cumulative suffering to be experienced by each animal, not just the worst possible case. It takes into account the proportion of animals expected to reach the severity limit of the protocol and the duration of the exposure to that severity limit, the nature and intensity of the adverse effects, and the actions to be taken to relieve the suffering.</p>

	<p pid=".938W.2/1">Figures on the number of prisoners assessed on entry as having a drug-related problem are not recorded centrally, but epidemiological studies show around 54 per cent. of new receptions to be problematic drug misusers and that around 80 per cent. of prisoners had used drugs at some point before coming into custody. All prisoners receive a healthcare assessment on reception. This resulted in detoxification being provided to 50,701 prisoners in 2002&ndash;03, 4,085 of whom were in the contracted estate.</p>
	<p pid=".938W.2/2">All prisons employ drug counselling, assessment, referral and throughcare (CARATs) teams, who, among other tasks, are responsible for putting problematic drug using prisoners in touch with community support on leaving prison. CARATs teams dealt with 52,000 prisoners in 2002&ndash;03 at all stages in their sentence.</p>
	<p pid=".938W.2/3">No separate assessment of drug-related problems is made at the point offenders leave prisons. There will always be a heightened risk of relapse on return to the community and a key aim of the Criminal Justice Interventions Programme is to strengthen continuity of treatment and reduce that risk.</p>

The programme is implementing research studies to investigate the effectiveness of promising microbicide products, involving research centres in five African countries. DFID also provides support to the International Partnership for Microbicides (IPM) to accelerate the discovery, development and accessibility of microbicides, and International Family Health (IFH) and the Population Council to develop policy dialogue, advocacy and networking around microbicides development and access.</p>
	<p pid=".940W.3/2">DFID supported and jointly chaired the international Microbicides 2004 conference, which was held in London, 28 March to 1 April 2004. It was an important opportunity for scientists and advocates to share information on the progress of microbicide development. We will launch our new HIV/AIDS Strategy later this year. In it we will set how we will work together with partners in developed and developing countries to drive forward research into new   technologies to prevent HIV/AIDS, including microbicides and vaccines.</p>

	<p pid=".942W.0/1">Many assessments of world population only stretch as far as 2050, and DFID's development assistance policy is largely geared towards 2015, the target for the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). However, the UN's Population Division has carried out a series of long-range population projections at regional level with a time horizon of 2150. These projections include assessments of   possible future fertility, mortality and migration scenarios.</p>
	<p pid=".942W.0/2">It is difficult to state the implications of these projections on global development assistance because the high, medium and low scenarios result in projections of very different sizes. According to the medium scenario, the world population will have stabilised at 9.7 billion by 2050. The low scenario indicates that population will drop to 3.2 billion by 2150 and the high scenario indicates a rise to 24.8 billion by the same year.</p>
	<p pid=".942W.0/3">The substantial differences in these scenarios make it very difficult to base any firm development assistance plans on long-range population projections. In the meantime DFID will focus our efforts on achieving the MDGs by 2015 and will then continue to consider the scale of poverty and population projections before setting targets for future milestones.</p>

	<p pid=".942W.3/1">DFID Ethiopia's country assistance plan is based on the Government of Ethiopia's Sustainable Development and Poverty Reduction Programme (SDPRP). On the basis of current population growth rates, Ethiopia's population will reach 73 million by 2005.</p>
	<p pid=".942W.3/2">The SDPRP recognizes that population plays a decisive role in national development. Through the National Population Policy (1993), the Government seeks to maintain a balance between population size and the resource base through, in part, heightened availability and use of contraceptives. A key focus to achieve this is through increasing girls' access to education.</p>
	<p pid=".942W.3/3">While DFID does not provide specific sector support to the population programme, in 2003&ndash;04 we provided &pound;3 million to the education sector specifically and &pound;30 million for the implementation of the SDPRP.</p>

	<p pid=".944W.2/1">Mauritania is a low-income food deficit   country which is vulnerable to drought and desertification. A large proportion of the population relies on agricultural production to satisfy its food and income needs. During drought periods, people have severe difficulties in meeting their food requirements, either through direct production or through recourse to alternative sources of income.</p>
	<p pid=".944W.2/2">DFID has provided significant humanitarian assistance to Mauritania in recent years in response to the severe drought and resultant food shortages. In 2002&ndash;03 DFID contributed &pound;1 million to the World Food Programme's regional appeal, which covered five countries in the region, but was mainly focused on Mauritania where the   drought situation was most severe. DFID also contributed &pound;0.5 million to an Oxfam appeal focused on the most badly affected areas in the South of the country.</p>
	<p pid=".944W.2/3">According to the latest FAO reports the overall food security situation in the country remains satisfactory. However there is a desert locust outbreak currently under way in northern Mauritania which may mean that crop production figures will have to be revised downwards to take account of the impact of possible pest damage.</p>

	<p pid=".945W.2/2">Details of DFID staff, by each location, broken down by <i>(a)</i> non-locally employed (those staff who are not locally employed are not solely UK nationals) and <i>(b)</i> locally employed, are listed in the following table. These figures include secondments to other organisations or projects. Data are not available centrally by country for DFID representation only.</p>
	<p pid=".945W.2/3">The table also includes cost figures by country; these are limited to the cost of representation and hence exclude costs associated with external secondments and projects. Where we have been unable to provide an individual country breakdown of expenditure we have included information for the region. These figures represent planned expenditure for 2003&ndash;04 and are subject to final outturn revisions.</p>
	<p pid=".945W.2/4">Comparable expenditure figures for 2001 and 2002 are not available because in 2003&ndash;04 DFID introduced a new definition of administration costs to include costs for staff, travel and allowances that were previously paid from the   programme budget. The change in definition will increase transparency and enable DFID to manage its administrative costs more effectively, but it precludes providing comparable figures for earlier years.</p>

	<p pid=".948W.2/1">UN Crop and Food Supply Assessment teams arrive in Mozambique, Malawi, Swaziland and Zimbabwe this week to analyse the food supply situation with a view to establishing future food aid requirements in these countries in the coming year. A team will arrive in Lesotho in mid-May to undertake similar work. Final reports are expected in early June.</p>
	<p pid=".948W.2/2">The Southern African Development Community's (SADC) Vulnerability Assessment Committees, supported by DFID, have already started fieldwork in these countries. Their results will also feed into the UN analyses. Linking these two assessments of food insecurity will provide a clearer picture of supply and demand for food in affected countries, and a more accurate assessment of household food shortages and the levels of food aid needed to respond to acute needs.</p>
	<p pid=".948W.2/3">DFID is also working at both country and regional levels to address the longer-term causes of regional food insecurity in Southern Africa. These programmes take a developmental approach to food insecurity, and aim to improve information on vulnerability and response, coupled with measures that enhance poor people's access to food in the longer-term.</p>

	<p pid=".948W.5/1">The Government's position on maintaining access for St. Helena was set out in my Written Statement to the House on 19 April 2004,<i> Official Report</i>, column 1WS. As part of planned feasibility and other investigatory work, the possibility of a private finance initiative will be included among options that will be considered.</p>
	<p pid=".948W.5/2">The position regarding docking facilities for ships in St. Helena is different. At present, as the hon. Member will know from his own visit to the island last year, visiting ships anchor in Jamestown Bay and all passengers and cargo are transferred in smaller craft to and from the wharf. In recognition of St. Helena's continuing concern over these arrangements, we have agreed to support further investigatory work to review the options for improving them. The St. Helena Government is preparing terms of reference. We cannot yet speculate on whether a private finance initiative might or might not have a role in any solution that eventually may prove to be technically and financially acceptable.</p>

	<p pid=".949W.2/1">A Humanitarian Ceasefire Agreement between the Government of Sudan, the Sudan Liberation Movement and the Justice and Equality Movement was signed on 8 April. Humanitarian and Security Assessments in Darfur are being carried out at present by our UN and non-governmental organisation (NGO) partners. However, access is still limited in Darfur due to general insecurity and travel restrictions. It is therefore still too early to be able to give precise humanitarian indicators, as agencies have not yet been able to access large parts of the population. However the situation is clearly extremely serious.</p>
	<p pid=".949W.2/2">In response to the crisis in Darfur DFID has committed about &pound;9.5 million, through United Nations (UN) agencies and international NGOs. DFID has also provided four humanitarian affairs officers to assist the UN response for three months. Three of these are based in Darfur and will, among other things, undertake assessments of humanitarian needs.</p>

	<p pid=".949W.5/1">Large numbers of Zimbabweans continue to be in humanitarian need. This is largely the result of the Government of Zimbabwe's misguided economic policies, including the poorly implemented fast track land programme, exacerbated by the HIV/AIDS epidemic and erratic rainfall. At least eight million Zimbabweans, over half the population, have been receiving donor-funded food aid in recent months, in advance of the imminent harvest, which should improve food security for the majority of Zimbabweans.</p>
	<p pid=".949W.5/2">The crop forecast is not yet finalised, but the harvest may cover less than half of the country's food needs over the next 12 months. The Government of Zimbabwe has stated its intention to import grain to meet the national food deficit. Given, the Government's economic difficulties, this may be unrealistic. In the meantime, the Government say that they will not decide for some months whether to ask for further international food aid after June. Households most likely to be in need of assistance, either food or other resources, will be those with no access to land or income that are also affected by HIV/AIDS or include orphans, disabled children and the elderly.</p>
	<p pid=".949W.5/3">DFID Zimbabwe provides financial support to the UN system for rigorous monitoring and evaluation of donor-funded humanitarian programmes, including both the effective targeting of those in the most need, and ensuring that there is no political interference in the process. Monitoring and evaluation reports are regularly provided to donors and discussed at meetings with the United Nations, non-governmental organisations, civil society and other donors. DFID remains confident that the humanitarian relief provided by the UK reaches those members of society who are most in need of assistance.</p>
	<p pid=".949W.5/4">According to the latest figures from the Ministry of Health, there have been 77 cases of cholera and 9,860 cases of dysentery since January. However, the number could be much higher due to the decline in surveillance. Many cases are not reported as people cannot afford to go to hospitals or hospitals are failing to report reasons for death.</p>
	<p pid=".949W.5/5">DFID has provided funds to Save the Children UK to respond to cholera outbreaks. The aim is to ensure that the disease does not spread further and that the communities at risk are assisted with soap and other hygiene items, as well as water purification tablets and oral dehydration supplies to treat diarrhoea.</p>

	<p pid=".955W.2/2">HSE's new building at Bootle, Merseyside is being procured under the Private Finance Initiative. Once it is available for occupation in 2005 HSE will pay an annual unitary charge for fully serviced office space of &pound;7 million (2003 prices). The purchase of the site from Sefton MBC cost &pound;1.3 million and removal plus IT transitional costs are likely to cost &pound;1 million. The total income from HSE priced publications was &pound;5.7 million in 2003&ndash;04.</p>

	<p pid=".963W.6/1">The Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA) issued in March 2004 a new law governing the Central Bank of Iraq (CBI). A copy of this law, and the Order to which it is attached, has been placed in the Library of the House. The new law provides for an independent central bank whose objectives are to achieve and maintain domestic price stability, foster and maintain a market-based financial system and promote sustainable growth, employment and prosperity. The CBI is required to maintain its independence from the Government of Iraq and, except for the provisions set out in the law, will not take instructions from any other persons or entity, including government entities.</p>

The CBI is required to report to the Appointing Authority, the Ministry of Finance and the legislature on its operations.</p>
	<p pid=".963W.6/3">The new CBI law has been reviewed by the Iraqi Governing Council, acting on the recommendation of its Economic and Finance Committee. The law has also been reviewed by the International Monetary Fund and was promulgated pursuant to United Nations Security Council Resolution 1483, which calls upon the CPA to promote economic reconstruction and the conditions for sustainable development in Iraq.</p>

	<p pid=".963W.9/1">The Kurdistan Regional Government Administered Areas (KRG Administered Areas) currently have a separate court system from the rest of Iraq. However, the Transitional Administrative Law (TAL), produced by the Iraqi Governing Council, establishes a Federal Supreme Court. The Court will consist of nine members, chosen from individuals nominated by the Higher Judicial Council which under the TAL will supervise the judiciary outside the KRG Administered Areas, in consultation with the regional Judicial Councils in the KRG Administered Areas. The Federal Supreme Court will have original and exclusive jurisdiction in legal proceedings between the Iraqi Transitional Government and the regional governments and governorate and municipal administrations. It will also have jurisdiction to review and declare as inconsistent with the TAL any law, regulation or directive issued by the federal or regional governments, the governorate or municipal administrations, or local administrations. This is of course an Iraqi led process although the UK is providing assistance for the training of judges, prosecutors and lawyers and will continue to consider requests for assistance in building the capacity of the Iraqi justice sector.</p>

	<p pid=".964W.2/1">The Coalition is holding around 9,000 detainees. (Precise figures vary as people are released and arrested daily). They include prisoners of war, security detainees and criminal detainees (held under Iraqi court order). Detainees are held at a number of locations throughout Iraq. The main US administered facility is at Abu Ghraib prison in Baghdad. The Coalition Provisional Authority is working to ensure a better flow of information to the relatives of detainees through recently established information centres. The Detainee Review and Appeal Board reviewed the cases of more than 3,000 detainees in February and March and released more than 2,000. This process is continuing. POWs and security detainees are visited regularly by the International Committee of the Red   Cross (ICRC) in accordance with the Geneva Conventions.</p>
	<p pid=".964W.2/2">As of 1 April the UK was responsible for 85 detainees at an internment facility near Basra. UK forces inform the families of interned persons within 24 hours of an arrest. The case of each security detainee is reviewed after 10, 28 and thereafter every 90 days to determine whether they continue to pose an imperative threat to security. The UK internment facility near Basra is subject to regular inspection by the ICRC who are given full and unrestricted access to the detainees.</p>

The structures and powers of the Interim Government are currently the focus of consultations by Lakhdar Brahimi (UN Secretary-General's Special Adviser on Iraq) with Iraqis. Mr. Brahimi has outlined his initial proposals to appoint, after thorough consultations with Iraqis and the CPA, a tripartite Presidency, a technocratic Cabinet of Ministers headed by a Prime Minister and after 30 June to hold a national conference to elect an advisory council. He is due to return to Iraq in coming weeks to continue his consultations and to develop his proposals. We welcome these proposals and look forward to working with the UN and the IGC to forge a consensus on the structures and powers of the Interim Government, which can then be enshrined in an annexe to the TAL.</p>

	<p pid=".971W.2/2">It is not possible to provide the cost of consultations undertaken since 1997 as the Department for Education and Skills (DfES) was established after the general election in 2001. Prior to this date the Department for   Education and Employment (DfEE) conducted consultations dating back to 1997. The DfEE operated under different accounting standards to the DfES, making it difficult to provide a consistent cost breakdown for the period in question. In 2001 and 2002 Cabinet Office's monitoring of compliance with the Code of Practice on Consultation included the cost of consultation exercises. The total cost of DfES consultation exercises identified was &pound;514,921.04 in 2001 and &pound;2,508,687.60 in 2002.</p>

	<p pid=".971W.8/2">The Government is investing more than &pound;1 billion in England to transform PE, school sport and club links. The funding will help deliver an ambitious Public Service Agreement target, shared with the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, to increase the percentage of 5 to16-year-olds who spend a minimum of two hours each week on high quality PE and school sport within and beyond the curriculum to 75 per cent. by 2006.</p>
	<p pid=".971W.8/3">The Department is providing just over &pound;400,000 to support the delivery of one School Sport Partnerships in the Tameside LEA area. The partnership includes six   secondary and 18 primary schools and provides enhanced sports opportunities for all young people to ensure that their pupils spend a minimum of two hours a week on high quality PE and School Sport. A key objective for all School Sport Partnerships is to ensure that the improvements and enhanced opportunities that they deliver are sustainable and embedded within schools to ensure a lasting legacy. The New Opportunities Fund has provided schools in the Tameside LEA area with over &pound;3 million specifically to enhance PE and school sport facilities.</p>
	<p pid=".971W.8/4">Latest research, published by the Departments on 4 March shows that 68 per cent. of pupils in schools that have been in a partnership for three years, are taking up the two hour entitlement, rising to 90 per cent. at Key Stage 3. Data has been collected from remaining partnerships and will be published in April.</p>

	<p pid=".973W.5/1">The Department does not provide a specific budget to the Learning and Skills Council (LSC) for rebuilding further education colleges. It is for the LSC to determine for itself the right level of capital investment in further education colleges from the funds allocated to it by the Department for capital investment in the post-16 learning and skills sector. In 2001&ndash;02 the LSC's total post-16 learning and skills sector capital funding allocation was &pound;136 million. This increased in 2002&ndash;03 to 231 million and to &pound;327.5 million in 2003&ndash;04. In 1998&ndash;99 earmarked capital expenditure allocated to the Further Education Funding Council was NIL. In 1999&ndash;2000 it was &pound;42 million and this increased to &pound;56 million in 2000&ndash;01.</p>

	<p pid=".988W.8/1">My Department does not issue guidelines about the disciplinary action that might be   appropriate to particular issues. The disciplinary sanctions that can be applied against staff in schools are governed by employment law in the same way as for any other employer, and each case must be considered on its merits.</p>
	<p pid=".988W.8/2">Guidance about procedures for dealing with allegations against teachers, and other staff, including guidance about conducting disciplinary investigations, is annexed to my Department's Circular 10/95: &quot;The protection of children from abuse: The role of the education service&quot;. However, the guidance also makes it clear that allegations involving a possible criminal offence, and allegations of possible child abuse must be investigated by the police and the social services respectively because those are the agencies with statutory responsibility for such matters.</p>
	<p pid=".988W.8/3">An inappropriate relationship between a teacher and a pupil has always been regarded as professionally wrong, and as misconduct that is grounds for disciplinary action, including dismissal, by an employer. That kind of behaviour is also grounds on which the Secretary of State will consider exercising his powers under section 142 of the Education Act 2002 to prohibit the person from future employment as a teacher and other work involving regular contact with children and young people in the education service.</p>
	<p pid=".988W.8/4">The Government also introduced a new criminal offence of abuse of trust in the Sexual Offences (Amendment) Act 2000 to protect young people under 18 years of age who are in full time education, or looked after by a local authority, or resident in NHS or other institutions, or in detention under an enactment. As well as teachers it applies to any adult working in one of those settings who is regularly involved in caring for, training, supervising, or being in sole charge of children under 18. As far as teachers it is an offence for a teacher to have relationship that involves sexual intercourse, or any other sexual activity, with a young person under 18 who is a pupil at the teacher's school. That offence is punishable by up to five years imprisonment, and it is repealed and re-enacted in the Sexual Offences Act 2003.</p>
	<p pid=".988W.8/5">In addition, cross departmental guidance &quot;Caring for Young People and the Vulnerable?&quot; about preventing abuse of trust was published jointly by the Home Office, my Department, and the Department of Health in 1999. The guidance aims to help organisations create their own codes of conduct to prevent abuse of trust, either as part of wider codes to prevent abuse, or separately.</p>

	<p pid=".989W.2/1">The Department does not collect all the information requested. However the Higher Education Statistics Agency, through the &quot;Individualised Staff Record&quot; (ISR), collects data that can be used to provide estimates of the earnings growth of academic staff employed by Higher Education Institutions. &quot;Academic staff&quot; are defined in the ISR as those whose primary employment function is teaching, research, or a combination of the two.</p>
	<p pid=".989W.2/2">The ISR does not allow us to provide earnings data on other groups, such as vice-chancellors and academic-related staff where their primary function is not as stated above. Further, this source can only provide earnings growth data from 1995/96, and is also best used in analysing full-time employees only.</p>
	<p pid=".989W.2/3">The following table shows the annual percentage change in the average salaries of full-time academic staff from 1995/96 to 2002/03, in real terms (adjusted by the Retail Price Index).</p>
