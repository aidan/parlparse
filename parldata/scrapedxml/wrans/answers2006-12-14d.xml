	<p pid="d.1233W.5/1">The Government intend to provide continued funding for nanotechnologies over the next five years. Funding will be directed towards a programme of research to address the potential risks posed by engineered nanoscale materials. Further funding will help industry to maximise the potential benefits of nanotechnologies by contributing to research, knowledge sharing and infrastructure development.</p>
	<p pid="d.1233W.5/2">Decisions on the amounts of funding have yet to be taken. However, the Government's first research report, published in November 2005, and a progress report in October 2006 set out current and proposed work and indicate what further research is needed to address the potential risks posed by engineered nanoscale materials. The new Technology Strategy Board will have responsibility for &quot;science to business&quot; collaborative research and development, and Knowledge Transfer Networks (one of which will build on the work of the Micro and Nano Technology Network). We will also be promoting the substantial funding opportunities within the EU framework programmes which we co-fund with other member states. We are working internationally to ensure that the UK funds research that complements, and does not duplicate, other research around the world.</p>
	<p pid="d.1233W.5/3">The outcomes of nanotechnology research to address the potential risks posed by engineered nanoscale materials are assessed by the relevant Departments and agencies, with coordination by the Nanotechnology Research Co-ordination Group.

	<p pid="d.1234W.8/2">British Energy have put in safety submissions for the restart of reactor 3 at Hunterston B. NII is currently assessing these. NII will not allow restart of reactor 3 until a satisfactory safety case for further operation has been made.</p>
	<p pid="d.1234W.8/3">British Energy will need to apply to NII for the restart of reactor 3 at Hinkley Point B following its current periodic outage. If NII is not satisfied with the safety case for return to service of reactor 4 at Hinkley Point B, or reactor 4 at Hunterston B, it would use its regulatory powers. NII will not allow restart of these reactors until a satisfactory safety case for further operation has been made.</p>

	<p pid="d.1237W.2/1">As in general consumer law, regulatory protection in relation to mis-selling does not extend to the business market for gas and electricity. The regulation of the fixed-line telecommunications market is the responsibility of Ofcom. All companies selling fixed-line telecoms services are required by Ofcom to draw up mandatory codes of practice consistent with published guidelines and then comply with these. If companies breach these obligations Ofcom's powers now include the ability to secure written undertakings from companies about their sales and marketing practices. Ofcom has taken enforcement action and four investigations are already complete, with fourteen enforcement notices issued to six of the worst offenders. These have secured significant changes to behaviour to ensure consumers' rights are protected, including action to require repayment of monies to affected consumers. Ofcom has also already fined one company the maximum possible 10 per cent. of its turnover.</p>

	<p pid="d.1238W.11/1">Ministers have not had any discussions with local authorities on the effect of the Licensing Act 2003 on carols or Christmas songs. However, officials have shared previous advice they have given on this issue with the local authorities coordinators of regulatory services (LACORS) and this has been disseminated by LACORS and is available on the DCMS website. Most singing of carols and Christmas songs is either spontaneous, incidental to other activities or part of a religious service and therefore not usually licensable.</p>
	<p pid="d.1238W.11/2">Licensing requirements depend on the type of event at which songs are being performed and not whether the songs themselves are religious or secular. For example, secular songs being performed as part of a religious service would not make that service licensable. Conversely, a rock band choosing to play a religious carol as part of its set would not make a rock concert an exempt religious service. It is not possible to describe every scenario, which is why it is ultimately for licensing authorities to determine what requires a licence and what does not.</p>

	<p pid="d.1243W.9/1">The Government continue to make considerable investment in research on climate change and agriculture to help both policy makers and industry plan for the uncertainties ahead. A recent review, summarising all the recent research on impacts and adaptation in agriculture is available on the DEFRA website:</p>
	<p pid="d.1243W.9/2" class="indent"><a href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/science/documents/publications/Defra_CC03_review_030705_JPGamended_jrp%20FINAL.pdf">http://www.defra.gov.uk/science/documents/publications/Defra_CC03_review_030705_JPGamended_jrp%20FINAL.pdf</a>.</p>
	<p pid="d.1243W.9/3">Overall, the research suggests that climate change impacts do not appear to threaten the viability of the agriculture industry as a whole in the UK due to the adaptability of UK systems. However, individual agricultural businesses and land managers will need to be alive to the need for adaptation. There may also be opportunities to grow new crops. We do not have a single assessment of the overall effects on UK food production, as this is influenced not only by the regionalised impacts of climate change, but the reaction of individual businesses to climate change, and their reaction to market changes and other policy levers.</p>

	<p pid="d.1246W.0/1">We already have in place a series of measures designed to reduce the geographic spread of bovine tuberculosis (bTB) in England and to achieve a sustained reduction in high incidence areas, including Shropshire. Our plan is to continue to work in partnership with interested parties to embed and monitor these measures, some of which have only been in operation for a matter of months. Examples of this include pre-movement testing phase one and the more extensive use of the gamma interferon blood test.</p>
	<p pid="d.1246W.0/2">We are committed to introducing the second phase of pre-movement testing in March 2007. This will extend the policy to younger animals, and continue to fund a wide-ranging bTB research programme, using the emerging evidence to inform our policies. We will also work with our industry partners to further raise awareness of the crucial role farmers have to play in controlling bTB by complying with statutory policies, applying disease prevention measures and good husbandry practices. We are also considering the evidence and practicalities of adding badger culling to these tools for preventing bTB in cattle.</p>

	<p pid="d.1246W.3/1">DEFRA has not made an estimate of the number of Christmas trees which were recycled in the last three years. I am aware that some local authorities (LAs) have in the past reported the number of Christmas trees they recycle to the environmental charity EnCams. Figures for 2002 show that nearly 2 million trees were recycled by the LAs which provided returns in England and Wales.</p>
	<p pid="d.1246W.3/2">While DEFRA does not provide specific support to LAs for the recycling of Christmas trees, we have provided significant additional funding to increase the proportion of waste that they recycle through the Environmental, Protective and Cultural Services (EPCS) spending block. This includes waste management services, Private Finance Initiative funding for waste, the Waste Minimisation and Recycling Fund and the Waste Performance and Efficiency Grant.</p>
	<p pid="d.1246W.3/3">Waste Watch recently estimated that up to 1 billion Christmas cards could end up in rubbish bins across the UK rather than being recycled. We would expect those authorities which carry out collection and recycling of waste paper to recycle Christmas cards with the rest of the waste paper they collect.</p>
	<p pid="d.1246W.3/4">In addition, the Woodland Trust runs an annual Christmas card recycling scheme with Recycle Now. Their 2005 scheme recycled more than 58 million cards, collecting the equivalent of at least one card for every person in Britain. The trust has set a 2007 target to recycle 90 million Christmas and new year cards. More information on this year's scheme can be found on the Woodland Trust's website at:</p>

Food and feed does not need to be labelled as 'GM' providing that the GM presence is below 0.9 per cent. and is accidental. The capability of the food and feed supply chain in being able to work to this threshold was taken into account in agreeing this level, in addition to the ability of laboratories to accurately analyse the presence of GM material.</p>

	<p pid="d.1250W.8/1">We have not made any formal assessment of the contribution to waste streams of shelf-ready packaging. Potentially, it could help to reduce external in-transit packaging. But it could also affect the type or amount of materials used to package individual products.</p>
	<p pid="d.1250W.8/2">We are continuing to engage with retailers and the food industry to reduce the amount of food and packaging waste which is being generated&mdash;by the industry itself, as well as consumers. For example, DEFRA's Food Industry Sustainability Strategy (FISS), published in April this year, challenges the food manufacturing sector to reduce its own waste by 15-20 per cent. by 2010.</p>
	<p pid="d.1250W.8/3">13 major grocery retailers (representing 92 per cent. of the UK grocery sector) are also supporting the &quot;Courtauld Commitment&quot;. This means that they have agreed to work with the Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP) in order to: design out packaging waste growth by 2008; deliver absolute reductions in packaging waste by March 2010; and identify ways to tackle the problem of food waste.</p>
	<p pid="d.1250W.8/4">WRAP works closely with the major supermarket chains to achieve the necessary behavioural changes. Three roundtable meetings have taken place to discuss food waste, putting recycling information on package labelling, and the issues and opportunities associated with biodegradable packaging. Through an Innovation Fund, WRAP also provides technical and financial support to retailers and suppliers. This is helping to identify ways of reducing the weight of primary packaging and the cost of production and transportation&mdash;mainly through research and development and innovative packaging design.</p>

	<p pid="d.1258W.8/1">The number of medical discharges from the UK armed forces due to psychological illness is low. Of the over 200,000 regular service personnel less than 0.1 per cent. are discharged annually for mental health reasons, whatever the cause. Of these, only 20-25 meet the criteria to be diagnosed with PTSD.</p>
	<p pid="d.1258W.8/2">The Ministry of Defence (MOD) employs specialist mental health social workers (MHSW), who assist personnel who are medically discharged from the service on the basis of a mental illness. The aim of this service is to liaise with the relevant external agencies (Government and non-governmental), and (along with resettlement agencies) provide the patient with a seamless transfer into civilian life. The MOD's MHSW routinely liaise with health and social services; housing agencies; the Department of Work and Pensions; Combat Stress; Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen and Families Association (SSAFA); The Royal British Legion; the Service Benevolent Funds; Regimental Associations; and other relevant charitable organisations.</p>
	<p pid="d.1258W.8/3">For veterans, healthcare is primarily the responsibility of the NHS. The Veterans Agency Welfare Service also provides practical assistance to veterans in need of support, focussed on those with mental or physical illness or injury suffered as a result of military service for which a compensatory pension is in payment. Following recommendations on mental health services for veterans in 2005 by the independent Health and Social Care Advisory Service, officials from the MOD, the UK Health departments and Combat Stress have been working together to develop and implement a new community-based model for mental health services for veterans. It is hoped that, beginning in the spring of 2007, the model will be piloted at sites across the UK. The pilots are likely to last two years and, if successful, will be rolled out nationally.</p>

International flights from the UK are not currently included in this figure as there is, as yet, no international agreement on ways of allocating such emissions. But we have made it clear aviation needs to take its share of responsibility for tackling climate change. A well-designed emissions trading scheme is an important way of ensuring that aviation contributes to climate stabilisation, and the European Commission is expected to publish a legislative proposal to include aviation in the EU emissions trading scheme by the end of the year.</p>

	<p pid="d.1272W.9/59">The Department recognises the need to assist all passengers when changing trains and acknowledges the challenges Birmingham New Street station can present to rail users. For many journeys where a change is necessary there will be alternatives such as Wolverhampton, which has seen recent investment in new waiting areas, lifts, a footbridge and customer information systems. Other alternatives include Banbury and Cheltenham Spa, where the operational layout of the station dictates that only same-platform changes are necessary. Derby is also an appropriate alternative where the need to change platforms is highly unlikely.</p>

The Reading-Waterloo line is currently served by a mix of Class 450 &quot;Desiros&quot;, of which 17 more 4-car units have recently been purchased, and Class 458 &quot;Juniper&quot; trains. Both are modern, air-conditioned stock and there is no plan to introduce older stock onto this route.

	<p pid="d.1279W.11/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="d.1279W.11/2">Currently, there are two key statutory mechanisms for protecting the public: Multi-Agency Public Protection Arrangements (MAPPA), and Local Safeguarding Children Boards (LSCBs). The former are concerned with managing offenders living in the community who pose a risk to public safety, while the latter focus on children who are in need of care or at risk.</p>
	<p pid="d.1279W.11/3">Recently, a new body has been developed: the MARAC (Multi-Agency Risk Assessment Conference). MARACs focus on the adult victims of domestic violence, and seek to intervene with victims at high risk of repeat victimisation, serious injury or homicide.</p>
	<p pid="d.1279W.11/4">While not statutory, MARACs are proving to be highly effective at preventing homicides, and in dramatically reducing repeat attacks. In Cardiff, for example, 42 per cent. of victims experienced no repeat incidents.</p>
	<p pid="d.1279W.11/5">We are rolling out MARACs to more Specialist Domestic Violence Court areas, and will be monitoring their effectiveness. Targets in reductions for repeat victimisation following the introduction of MARACs are also increasingly being included in local area agreements.</p>

	<p pid="d.1283W.2/1">No such assessment has been made. In 2004, the Housing Corporation issued a determination under schedule 1 of the Housing Act 1996 permitting payments to registered social landlord (RSL) board members of less than &pound;20,000. The annual regulatory and statistical return collected by the Housing Corporation includes a question on whether RSLs make any payments to board members. It does not collect information about the amounts paid. The number of RSLs that made payments to their board members in each year are as follows:</p>

Despite many UN human rights conventions, the human rights of disabled people have not been fully recognised around the world, and they continue to experience discrimination and disabling barriers. The UK therefore welcomed the decision of the UN General Assembly to set up an ad hoc committee to prepare the text of a new Convention on Disability Rights and played a full and positive role in the negotiations. We also led negotiations for the European Union during our Presidency in 2005 and hope to be among the first countries to sign and ratify it.</p>

	<p pid="d.1292W.5/1">The Union Solidarity and Development Association (USDA) is officially termed a 'social organisation' and is involved in some social and charitable activities. However, it is also used by the Burmese Government to promote their political aims. Membership is compulsory for most government employees. Others are threatened or induced to join. The USDA is widely believed to have been involved in the attacks on Daw Aung San Suu Kyi's convoy at Depayin in 2003 and in the intimidation they suffered on earlier trips. There are unconfirmed reports that the Burmese Government intend to transform the USDA into a pro-Government political party which would contest any forthcoming general election.</p>

My right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary therefore welcomed news of Chen's quashed sentence in a statement on <phrase class="date" code="">2 November</phrase> and urged the Chinese Government to guarantee due process at his retrial. Officials from our Embassy in Beijing applied for but were denied access to Chen's retrial on <phrase class="date" code="">27 November</phrase>. We are concerned by reports that one of Chen's lawyers was again denied access to the court, and that key witnesses were detained, raising further doubts about the fairness of proceedings against him. We hope that his forthcoming appeal will be dealt with fairly and transparently. Zhao Yan's trial was held in closed court on <phrase class="date" code="2007-08-25">25 August</phrase> and we remain concerned at serious procedural irregularities, as well as the lack of information on his conviction for &quot;financial fraud&quot;.

At the recent review conference for the Convention on Conventional Weapons (CCW), the UK secured an agreement by consensus which included all major producers and users of cluster munitions. This will set up a discussion mandate that should lead to negotiations on a legally-binding protocol that addresses the humanitarian impact of cluster munitions. This approach is consistent with Kofi Annan's call at the conference for action within the existing CCW framework. If the process agreed within the CCW falters or fails, we will review our policy.</p>

In the run-up to Germany taking over the presidency of the EU on <phrase class="date" code="2007-01-01">1 January</phrase>, the FCO has been very active in engaging with other Government Departments on UK policy. Testament to the effective work we have done on this agenda were two important outcomes from informal European Council in October at Lahti: to link European policy on energy security and climate change more closely together so that the EU pursues an integrated policy; and a greater coherence among EU member states than there has been in the past on external energy security issues, e.g. our approach towards dealing with third country suppliers. This work has been particularly timely in relation to the European Commission's Strategic Energy Review, which will be published shortly and will help set further direction on energy and climate change policy during the German presidency. The FCO has been working with the Commission and EU member states to ensure that UK priorities are reflected in the Strategic Energy Review and other Commission papers such as the Energy Efficiency Action Plan.</p>

	<p pid="d.1295W.8/1">The UK's objectives are to follow up on the agreement made by heads of the EU at Lahti to use EU external energy policy to deliver broader climate and energy security objectives. The strategic decisions we will take on energy in the next few months are an opportunity for the EU to deliver a future with a secure climate and secure energy. We aim to encourage EU leadership in tackling the linked issues of energy and climate security and to show EU citizens that we are on the front foot in shaping a low-carbon future. We must also speak with one voice on climate security, including with external partners&mdash;Russia, China and India and are confident that the German presidency will take this further. A milestone for achieving these objectives will be the spring European Council and we are pleased that Chancellor Merkel has said energy&mdash;and climate change&mdash;will be key element of this.</p>

Latin America has some of the highest rates of gun violence in the world. In many opinion polls, tackling violent crime, often linked to the illegal drugs trade, ranks with unemployment as the main concern of citizens in a number of countries. My noble Friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, Lord Triesman of Tottenham, raised security issues with the Colombian Government in his visit to the country in September, as did my hon. Friend the Minister of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs (Dr. Howells), in his visit to Colombia and Venezuela in October.</p>
	<p pid="d.1299W.0/2">We want to help tackle these problems, and are supporting a range of projects that directly address them. Some examples include support for police reform in Venezuela, one of the worst affected countries, to improve the effectiveness of the police in tackling crime, plus support to local non-governmental organisations (NGOs) addressing the threat of gun crime at community level; in Bolivia we are working with national and local authorities on projects to improve citizen security, community policing and crime prevention; and in Brazil we are working with NGOs and the police to improve security policy and tackle gun violence. We also encourage our partners to address the issue of small arms and light weapons, which contribute significantly to crime and violence in the region.</p>

This was done in the standard format as advised by HM Treasury solicitors. The indemnity came into force on <phrase class="date" code="1998-07-10">10 July 1998</phrase>, and was granted to assist the quick, effective and unhindered completion of the report.

	<p pid="d.1318W.2/3" class="indent">2. to reduce the prevalence of domestic violence, particularly in high incidence areas and/ or communities;</p>
	<p pid="d.1318W.2/4" class="indent">3. to increase the rate at which domestic violence is reported, particularly in high incidence areas and/ or communities;</p>
	<p pid="d.1318W.2/5" class="indent">4. to increase the rate of reported domestic violence offences that are brought to justice, particularly in high incidence areas and/ or communities, as well as in areas with high attrition rates; and</p>

	<p pid="d.1321W.9/1">The section 37 cost report, published in October, presented an estimate of benefits in a range of &pound;1 billion-1.7 billion per annum. This presentation which excluded optimism bias is consistent with Her Majesty's Treasury guidance for the current stage of the programme. If we had chosen to incorporate optimism bias, this would have reduced the figures by 10 per cent. The national identity scheme would still have a strong economic justification even if the quantified benefits were at the lower end of the range and the 10 per cent. reduction was applied.</p>

	<p pid="d.1327W.2/2">The data, which are obtained from the prison IT system, are not shown separately by nationality within individual prison establishment because the numbers are small and the accuracy at this level of detail cannot be guaranteed.</p>

Although care is taken when processing and analysing the returns, the detail collected is subject to the inaccuracies inherent in any large scale recording system, and although shown to the last individual the figure may not be accurate to that level.</p>

	<p pid="d.1327W.5/1">The National Probation Service has been set a total of 14 performance targets for 2006-07. The targets cover the key objectives of protecting the public and reducing re-offending while reflecting the priority given to work with offenders on matters such as accommodation; education, training and employment; health and drugs and alcohol, as well as addressing the needs of victims.</p>
	<p pid="d.1327W.5/2">Details of the performance of the 42 Probation Areas in England and Wales against the performance targets and measures set for the service are published on a quarterly basis in National Probation Service Performance Reports.

(Data on the regionally set employment targets for minority ethnic staff will not be available until the new year when the census returns are made. This target has been met in each of the previous years since monitoring began and it is envisaged that it will be met again this year).</p>

If the Jobcentre Plus Board agreed that there is a case for any office closure a submission is then made to the Minister to seek approval to start a consultation period. If after this exercise it is still felt that closure is warranted then a further submission is made to the Minister for his consideration.

	<p pid="d.1333W.3/1">The administration of Jobcentre Plus is a matter for the Chief Executive of Jobcentre Plus, Lesley Strathie. I have asked her to provide the hon. Member with the information requested.</p>
	<p pid="d.1333W.3/2" class="italic"> Letter from Lesley Strathie:</p>
	<p pid="d.1333W.3/3" class="indent">The Secretary of State has asked me to reply to your questions about the Christchurch Jobcentre Plus office. This is something which falls within the responsibilities delegated to me as Chief Executive of Jobcentre Plus.</p>
	<p pid="d.1333W.3/4" class="indent">Christchurch Jobcentre was refurbished as a Jobcentre Plus office, opening on <phrase class="date" code="2004-01-26">26 January 2004</phrase>. During October 2006, 176 interviews took place with advisers in the Christchurch Jobcentre Plus office.</p>
	<p pid="d.1333W.3/5" class="indent">Jobcentre Plus is not required to collect information on the number of people who visit their offices. However, the manager of the Christchurch office arranged for an exercise to be undertaken in October 2006 to establish how many people visited the office. This showed that there were over 1,200 visits by customers to the Christchurch office to use the jobpoints or the free telephones. We are not able to confirm how many of these visits were unique or repeat visits.</p>
	<p pid="d.1333W.3/6" class="indent">For the national roll out of Jobcentre Plus approximately &pound;320,000 was spent on the refurbishment of the Christchurch office. This is the only cost incurred in the last seven years. We pay an annual charge to Land Services Trillium to manage our estate, which includes the costs of replacing any premises equipment. Our IT equipment costs are charged at a national level through our contract with EDS, this figure is not broken down by site, therefore I am unable to provide site specific information about this.</p>
	<p pid="d.1333W.3/7" class="indent">The running costs for the Christchurch office, excluding staffing, are as follows:</p>
	<table>
		<tbody>
			<tr pid="d.1333W.3/10"> <td>2004-05</td> <td>&pound;180,439</td> </tr>
			<tr pid="d.1333W.3/11"> <td>2005-06</td> <td>&pound;192,336</td> </tr>
			<tr pid="d.1333W.3/12"> <td>2006-07</td> <td>Costs are expected to be approximately &pound;208,000</td> </tr>
		</tbody>
	</table>
	<p pid="d.1333W.3/15" class="indent">The Christchurch office is 574 square metres. For the operational year 2006-07 the rent for the building will be &pound;182,620 and the business rates will be &pound;19,620. Seven full-time staff and four part-time staff are currently based at the office. The leases on our buildings are the responsibility of our partner organisation Land Securities Trillium. If we wish to vacate the premises we are required to give notice to Land Securities Trillium. It is then for them to sublet the building if there is any remaining time left on the lease. In the case of the Christchurch office we are required to give 12 months notice if we wish to vacate the premises.</p>

The Government are currently reviewing whether sales of travel insurance sold alongside a holiday should be regulated by the Financial Services Authority. This will include looking at whether travellers are informed during the sales process of what is and what is not covered by their policy and whether they are also informed that they should disclose any pre-existing medical conditions to their insurer.</p>

Each strategic health authority was asked to demonstrate that its cancer network(s) had suitable action plans in place for the implementation of this guidance. Progress towards the implementation of these plans is assessed by both the Department and the Healthcare Commission. The Department has also made funds available to the national health service to pilot a national multidisciplinary team training programme in prostate cancer surgical techniques in 2006-07 with the aim of improving outcomes of surgical procedures in the treatment of prostate cancer.</p>

	<p pid="d.1350W.0/1">The formal evaluation of the prostate cancer risk management programme (PCRMP) was undertaken by the primary care education research group at the University of Oxford. As part of the evaluation, the researchers undertook an on-line questionnaire with 400 general practitioners (GPs), and a resulting paper has now been published in the journal BioMed Central (BMC) Family Practice (<i> BMC Family Practice</i> 2005; 6:24).</p>
	<p pid="d.1350W.0/2">58 per cent. of GPs questioned were aware of the PCRMP, and 67 per cent. said they supported the policy. 41 per cent. reported having received the PCRMP resource pack, of whom 80 per cent. felt the pack would be very or fairly useful. 83 per cent. favoured both the general practitioner and the man being involved in the decision making process.</p>
	<p pid="d.1350W.0/3">The PCRMP pack is currently being reviewed, and as part of this process, we will be looking at how to engage GPs better in the programme. The review will take into account the results of the evaluation, and involve a formal literature review of the most recent evidence on prostate cancer testing.</p>
	<p pid="d.1350W.0/4">The review will also involve discussions with key stakeholders in the voluntary sector, we are committed to involving key stakeholders in policy development. That is why the prostate cancer advisory group (PCAG), chaired by Professor Mike Richards, the national cancer director, has representation from signatories to the prostate cancer charter for action, including the Prostate Cancer Charity. We are also ensuring that revisions to the PCRMP are consistent with the development of the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence clinical guide on the diagnosis and management of prostate cancer.</p>

	<p pid="d.1351W.8/1">The 10 primary care trusts (PCTs) using CHIA do not currently have a validated accurate picture of the number of children that have not received their immunisations. There are a number of significant factors contributing to this, including the migration and merging of PCT records from the previous system to CHIA, data quality issues and delays in deploying key functionality in CHIA.</p>
	<p pid="d.1351W.8/2">To ensure children receive their immunisations at the right time, both regular and additional audit activities are being carried out by PCTs, GP practices, BT (the local service provider for the London cluster) and the Health Protection Agency. These activities will validate the immunisation returns to identify and ensure that any children that are overdue an immunisation are invited to have one at the appropriate time. PCT Chief Executives and the Director of Public Health for London are fully engaged and supportive of these activities.</p>
	<p pid="d.1351W.8/3">PCTs are working closely with general practices to ensure that children are immunised at the appropriate time. In addition to child health systems, due immunisations can also be identified in other ways such as general practice systems and the individual child's records (known as the 'Red Book') held by parents.</p>
	<p pid="d.1351W.8/4">As described, the catch-up exercise is on-going. BT, the local service provider (LSP) for the London cluster, has made resources available to PCTs, at its own cost, to assist with resolving issues relating to the migration to CHIA.</p>
	<p pid="d.1351W.8/5">The options appraisal report will be made publicly available after it has been considered and reviewed by PCT boards in January, as part of their business case to determine whether to move to another interim application or to the strategic solution proposed by the LSP. In addition new governance arrangements are being introduced to expedite an early resolution to the difficulties PCTs are experiencing. In parallel with this a new National Child Health Immunisation Board is being established, to ensure standards are more clearly applied in future child health systems.</p>
	<p pid="d.1351W.8/6">We shall continue to monitor progress on the resolution of these matters and I have requested an update at end of January.</p>

	<p pid="d.1352W.2/1">The Department is responsible for a range of public health campaigns, which will help people to manage their cardiovascular risks. High cholesterol levels are linked to obesity. Reducing obesity is one of the six overarching priorities of the &quot;Choosing Health&quot; White Paper published in November 2004. The White Paper sets out a comprehensive plan of action on physical activity, diet, personalised support, information and curbs on marketing that provides a strong foundation for tackling obesity. This plan will include a comprehensive communications strategy, focussing on behaviour change communication using a social marketing approach, aiming to provide clear, and simple messages on tackling and preventing obesity. Also included will be provision of support, guidance and advice to the delivery chain, including specific support to the health service in tackling obesity. New initiatives such as early years and adolescent life checks and the introduction of health trainers will support people to adopt healthier lifestyles.</p>
	<p pid="d.1352W.2/2">Many people will require drug therapy&mdash;usually statins&mdash;to manage their cholesterol levels. The General Medical Service contract includes quality indicators on control of cholesterol in patients with coronary heart disease. Since the launch of the national service framework for coronary heart disease in 2000, prescriptions for statins have risen by 30 per cent. every year. NHS spending on statins has increased to about &pound;0.6 billion a year. In January 2006 the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) published a health technology appraisal on statins which found that it was both clinically and cost-effective to prescribe them for patients with a 20 per cent. 10-year risk of developing cardiovascular disease. This updates the NSF's threshold for treatment, which stood at a 30 per cent. 10-year risk of coronary heart disease, and greatly extends the NHS's scope to use statins for the primary prevention of disease.</p>

Any practice which is participating in the DES will however need to take part in the patient survey if it is to receive the full payment to which it may be entitled under the DES.

	<p pid="d.1368W.0/1">Primary care trusts commission surgery services based on their assessment of the needs of their local population and available service capacity. The provision and availability of a particular surgical intervention should be dependent on the clinical need of the individual patient.</p>
	<p pid="d.1368W.0/2">An assessment of the benefits of stopping smoking ahead of planned surgery was published in May 2006 by the London Health Observatory, entitled &quot;Stop before the Op: the short-term benefits of preoperative smoking cessation in London&quot;. It estimated that, if London patients admitted for planned surgery were to stop smoking prior to operation, 2,500 to 5,300 fewer post-operative complications would be avoided each year. A copy is available in the Library.</p>
	<p pid="d.1368W.0/3">Since December 2005, the maximum waiting time standard for in-patient treatment has been six months. Most patients are admitted a lot quicker and the average (median) wait is now less than seven weeks.</p>
	<p pid="d.1368W.0/4">Very clear guidance to the national health service has been issued, stating that clinical need must be the main determinant when prioritising patients.</p>

	<p pid="d.1369W.3/1">Adverse drug reaction (ADR) data from the United Kingdom spontaneous reporting scheme, the Yellow Card Scheme, underpins the process of pharmacovigilance in the UK. Pharmacovigilance systems do not rely solely on ADR reporting via the Yellow Card Scheme. The other data sources regularly used in the monitoring of drug safety in the UK include formal safety studies, the published medical literature, information from pharmaceutical companies and other regulatory authorities throughout the world together with information on the level of drug prescribing. There is also an international database of around 1.5 million ADR reports operated by the World Health Organization to which the MHRA has on line access. In addition, as laid down in European Community legislation, the regulatory authorities of the European member states exchange information and work closely together on drug safety matters.</p>
	<p pid="d.1369W.3/2">The value of spontaneous reporting schemes like the Yellow Card Scheme is in the early detection of possible drug safety hazards, (signals). Once a hypothesis has been generated that a particular medicine is associated with an adverse effect other methods are used to confirm and quantify the risk before regulatory action is taken. The objective of regulatory action is to ensure that the benefits of the medicine continue to outweigh risks, by restricting indications for use, adding contraindications, warnings or precautions, or additional information about adverse effects. Only when risk minimisation measures are considered unlikely to be effective in maintaining a positive benefit risk balance is withdrawal from the market necessary. The table identifies for the last six years, the number of medicines that were withdrawn from the market in the UK, the number of letters sent to healthcare professionals in England to advise on drug safety issues and the number of changes (variations) to individual national marketing authorisations (MAs) requested by MHRA for safety reasons linked to pharmacovigilance activity.</p>

	<p pid="d.1374W.2/2">The Department is regularly approached by a range of individuals and organisations who express an interest in participating in the Academies programme. Some of these interested parties then go on to work with the Department in developing a formal expression of interest document. Expressions of interest outline early proposals for an Academy. Not all expressions of interest result in an Academy being established.</p>

	<p pid="d.1374W.8/2">Academies are independent schools and the statutory provisions that provided for their establishment were enacted by Parliament with the intention that the majority of requirements would be contained within a contract: the Funding Agreement. In many respects the model Funding Agreement includes provisions equivalent to those in maintained school legislation: Academies are required to act in accordance with admissions law and the DfES codes of practice, to follow the majority of the provisions of section 52 of the Education Act 2002 relating to exclusions and appeals, and to have regard to the SEN code of practice and statutory guidance on inclusion. It is not however the Government's intention that maintained school legislation should simply read across; we need to be clear about its applicability to the particular set of circumstances within which Academies operate.</p>

Given the contribution of Children's Fund in providing good quality preventative services for 5-13 year olds and their families, we would expect that local authorities will continue to commission this work.</p>
	<p pid="d.1380W.5/2">Decisions about funding beyond 2008 will be taken as part of the Government's Comprehensive Spending Review (CSR). We expect any funding identified in CSR to deliver the kind of services which Children's Fund currently provide will be pooled with funding to deliver other outcomes for children and young people. This funding will be routed through local authorities and it is unlikely that it will be ring-fenced.</p>

	<p pid="d.1380W.8/1">During the passage of the Further and Higher Education Act 1992 Parliament decided that Ministers should have no responsibility for funding individual higher education institutions. Against that background, the responsibility for the future of Dartington College of Arts must rest with the College itself. I understand the College has been looking at a number of options and I am sure that these will be fully explored. While I hope that the distinctive provision the College offers can be retained in the region, the final decision on the future of the College has to be taken locally.</p>

Of these, we expect that only a very small number, mostly from the mixed economy group of colleges which currently provide 14 per cent. of all Foundation Degree provision, will wish to apply for Foundation Degree Awarding Powers.</p>

	<p pid="d.1388W.2/1">Partnership development managers (PDMs) are employed as part of the School Sport Partnerships programme. There are now 449 School Sport Partnerships covering all maintained schools in England, Each partnership has its own PDM who is responsible for the strategic development of the partnership and liaison with other agencies to develop high quality physical education and school sport. A typical partnership consists of a PDM who manages up to eight school sport co-ordinators and 45 primary link teachers who are responsible for developing opportunities within their secondary and primary schools respectively. A typical partnership receives a ring-fenced grant of around &pound;270,000 per year, depending on the number of schools. Grant is paid directly to the School Sport Partnership host site and covers the salaries of the above posts and teacher release.</p>
	<p pid="d.1388W.2/2">The Department does not hold information on the salary range for all PDMs. A typical PDM salary is around &pound;33,500. As all schools are now within a School Sport Partnership we do not expect there to be any additional PDM appointments in the coming year.</p>
	<p pid="d.1388W.2/3">The budget for the School Sport Partnership programme is &pound;111,571,824 for the financial year 2006-07 and &pound;114,685,385 for the financial year 2007-08. Funding beyond that is dependent on the outcome of the current comprehensive spending review.</p>

	<p pid="d.1397W.2/1">Information on the pattern of admissions for September 2006 is available on local authority and school websites. From this data it is clear that, where a school admits more than 10 per cent. of its pupils by reference to aptitude or ability and also adopts the sibling oversubscription criterion, fewer children who live close to the school have priority for admission. Some of these schools currently admit more than 40 per cent. of their children based on a sibling connection rather than proximity.</p>
	<p pid="d.1397W.2/2">The school admissions code will ensure fairness in admission arrangements for all children. This includes families that want their first child or only child to attend a good local school.</p>
	<p pid="d.1397W.2/3">We do not consider that the proposed changes will affect schools in Herefordshire as we believe that no Herefordshire school selects more than 10 per cent. of its intake by reference to aptitude, and none admit based on ability.</p>
	<p pid="d.1397W.2/4">We do not routinely monitor information on how many schools have partially selective arrangements, or the type of arrangements such schools adopt; neither do we require schools which admit 10 per cent. of their intake by reference to aptitude under section 102 of the SSFA 1998 to notify the Government.</p>
	<p pid="d.1397W.2/5">We know there are 164 wholly selective (by ability) grammar schools. Of the 41 partially selective schools, of which we are aware, four select a proportion of their intake by aptitude, 28 by ability and nine by a combination of each.</p>
	<p pid="d.1397W.2/6">In 2001, 45 of the then 685 specialist schools reported that they selected 10 per cent. of their intake by reference to aptitude. This is the most up-to-date data available.</p>

	<p pid="d.1398W.3/1">The Department knows of 41 schools which have partially selective arrangements. The draft code proposed that these schools should not give priority to siblings. This is not an absolute prohibition: it would remain open to such schools to determine to give priority to siblings. Responses to the consultation are currently being considered.</p>
	<p pid="d.1398W.3/2">Data on admission arrangements for 2006/07 was available for 23 of the 41 partially selective schools on their local authority and school websites. The data do not provide the level of detail requested by the hon. Member. However, nine of those schools admitted over 40 per cent. of their intake based on sibling criteria and a further seven admitted between 20 per cent. and 39 per cent. based on sibling criteria. With the proportion of pupils admitted to selective places up to 40-50 per cent. in some schools, this can mean that fewer than 20 per cent. of a school's places may be allocated to local families.</p>
	<p pid="d.1398W.3/3">The Schools Adjudicator is independent of the Secretary of State and reaches his own decisions based on the facts of the case before him. However, section 84 of the School Standards and Framework Act 1998 as amended by section 40 of the Education and Inspections Act 2006 will require the adjudicator to 'act in accordance with the Code'. In reaching his decision on any objection, the adjudicator will take into account advice in the code.</p>

	<p pid="d.1402W.2/2">We commissioned separate consultants to develop a risk assessment tool, which promoters and designers of schools will be able to use as an aid to deciding when sprinklers are needed in school projects.

The studies should be completed early in January and the group will then make recommendations to me on how we will disseminate the findings. One route will be to include some of the work in our forthcoming guide on fire safety in schools&mdash;Building Bulletin 100, &quot;Designing and Managing Against the Risk of fire in Schools&quot;.

	<p pid="d.1403W.0/2">In July, we commissioned consultants to produce an analysis of the costs of installing sprinklers in schools. Their study covers 26 schools and will give us an average cost for installing sprinklers in new schools&mdash;both as a percentage addition to construction costs and as a rate per square metre of floor area. Their study will be concluded early in January 2007 and we will publish the findings.</p>
	<p pid="d.1403W.0/3">The Department does not provide funding specifically for the installation of sprinklers in schools. Local authorities decide what they do with the funding they are allocated. They may choose to install sprinklers when constructing new schools, but do not need to inform us or provide figures on costs. However, the study I refer to above is gathering information on maintenance costs as well as capital costs.</p>
	<p pid="d.1403W.0/4">We have received representations from the Chief Fire Officers Association, individual Fire and Rescue Authorities, the National Fire Sprinkler Network and insurance companies on the value of installing sprinklers in schools. Our public consultation on Building Bulletin 100, &quot;Designing and Managing Against the Risk of Fire in Schools&quot;, included questions on sprinklers. We take all of the views expressed very seriously and that is one of the reasons why we commissioned further studies on sprinklers.

This is supported by the Government's Aiming High strategy for raising the academic achievement of minority ethnic pupils includes a programme of targeted work supporting Bangladeshi, Pakistani, Somali and Turkish pupils. The attainment gap is now closing for both Pakistani and Bangladeshi pupils.</p>

	<p pid="d.1424W.9/1">The International Finance Facility for Immunisation (IFFIm) bonds are financial instruments aimed at converting long-term aid commitments from donors into frontloaded resources for immunisation. The first IFFIm bond sale was very successful, raising $1 billion and demonstrating not only the powerful moral case for immunisation now, but also the strong commercial attraction of these bonds.</p>
	<p pid="d.1424W.9/2">As financial instruments, the IFFIm bonds, like any other, will be repaid with interest. So they do not represent charitable contributions. However, the government strongly welcomes such support for immunisation. The funds raised by IFFIm bonds will be spent by the GAVI Alliance (formerly Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunisation) to help immunise an additional 500 million children and save 10 million lives.</p>

	<p pid="d.1424W.12/1">Under the agreements with our European partners that govern the VAT system, we are not able to extend our existing VAT zero rates or introduce any new ones. It is therefore not possible to remove VAT from energy saving light bulbs.</p>
	<p pid="d.1424W.12/2">Under the same European agreements, a reduced rate of VAT of not less than 5 per cent. is available for the construction, renovation and alteration of housing provided as part of a social policy. We have used this provision to introduce a reduced rate of VAT for the installation of a range of energy-saving and energy-efficient products and microgeneration technologies, but it cannot be used to apply a reduced rate for goods, such as light bulbs, which are sold for self-installation by the householder.</p>
	<p pid="d.1424W.12/3">Changes to the European agreements governing the availability of VAT reduced rates require the unanimous support of all EU member states. The Government have made the case at European level for changes to VAT agreements that would enable wider use of reduced rates for energy-saving and energy-efficient products. However there is significant resistance to the introduction of new reduced rates for goods from some member states because of the potential impact on the Single Market. We will consider our options and priorities for new reduced rates carefully when the issue next becomes due for discussion at EU level.</p>
	<p pid="d.1424W.12/4">The Government remain committed to meeting environmental challenges, and promotes household energy efficiency through a range of tax and other policy measures.</p>

	<p pid="d.1426W.8/1">The Treasury has, in partnership with other Government Departments, pursued a comprehensive strategy to tackle poverty and promote economic opportunity through:</p>
	<p pid="d.1426W.8/2" class="indent">Promoting macroeconomic stability</p>
	<p pid="d.1426W.8/3" class="indent">Supporting work for those who can and ensuring that work pays, through the new deals, a National Minimum Wage and the working tax credit</p>

	<p pid="d.1426W.8/5">Acting together, compared to 1996-97 and measured after housing costs, these measures have helped lift <i> (a)</i> 2.1 million pensioners out of absolute low income poverty, and 1 million pensioners out of relative low income poverty, and <i> (b)</i> 2.4 million children out of absolute low income poverty and 0.8 million children out of relative low income poverty.</p>
	<p pid="d.1426W.8/6">In addition, HMT has estimated the effect on child poverty of Government reforms to the personal tax credit and benefit system since 1997. This suggests that there are around 1.5 million fewer children in relative low income poverty, after housing costs, than if the 1997 personal tax credit and benefit system had simply been uprated in line with prices.</p>
