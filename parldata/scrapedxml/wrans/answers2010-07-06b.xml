The NHF will complement this funding with financial and in-kind support. One member of staff will be employed by the Network, which will provide high quality legal, financial and development advice to CLTs.

The programme also states that the Government will prevent unnecessary building in areas of high flood risk. We will publish and present to Parliament a simple and consolidated national planning policy framework covering all forms of development and setting out national economic, environmental and social priorities. We will make an announcement on how we propose to take forward the national planning framework and the implications for specific areas of planning policy shortly.</p>

	<p pid="b.146W.7/1">The Boiler Scrappage Scheme was designed to help up to 125,000 households at a cost of &#163;50 million. An initial assessment of the potential effectiveness of the boiler scrappage scheme indicated that the efficiency improvement from replacement of &quot;G-rated&quot; gas boilers with &quot;A-rated&quot; boilers was over 20%. Replacing a &quot;G-rated&quot; boiler with an &quot;A-rated&quot; boiler is calculated to save at least one tonne of CO2 per boiler per annum in an average home. When the scheme has completed its payments to householders, there will be a final evaluation of the scheme.</p>

	<p pid="b.147W.0/1">The Climate Change Act 2008 sets greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets of at least 34% by 2020 and at least 80% by 2050 (both from the 1990 baseline). The first three carbon budgets, running from 2008 to 2012, 2013 to 2017 and 2018 to 2022, are set in line with the 34% target. This is based on an EU-wide emissions reduction of 20% from 1990 levels by 2020. We are pushing to secure early EU agreement to move to a more ambitious emissions reduction target of 30% below 1990 levels by 2020. When this has been agreed, and the methodology for sharing the effort between EU member states has been decided, the UK will move to a more ambitious 2020 target, following advice from the Committee on Climate Change and taking into account the views of the Devolved Administrations.</p>

	<p pid="b.149W.5/1">The UK operates strict controls to protect the natural environment, and any planning application for a wind farm which is likely to have a significant effect on the environment by virtue of factors such as size, nature or location is subject to environmental impact assessment. Statutory nature conservation bodies are consulted upon the scope and outcomes of the environmental impact assessment.</p>
	<p pid="b.149W.5/2">Local and national planning authorities can and do refuse planning permission for proposed wind farms where there are likely to be significant impacts on local wildlife populations which cannot be acceptably mitigated. Where appropriate, conditions can be placed on a wind farm to ensure that any impacts on local wildlife populations are minimised, avoided or compensated. This may include post development monitoring of wildlife.</p>
	<p pid="b.149W.5/3">The wildlife impacts of offshore windfarms are also looked at strategically as part of DECC's offshore energy strategic environmental assessment process.

This reflects the priority that this Government places on both supporting our armed forces on operations and putting the military covenant on a proper footing. The contribution made from the defence budget also acknowledges that, although total Defence expenditure has been protected in 2010-11, it is vital that all departments prioritise resources to the front line, and assist in the key task of reducing the debt inherited by the new Government.</p>

This also acknowledges that, although total defence expenditure has been protected in 2010-11, it is vital that all Departments prioritise resources to the front line and assist in the key task of reducing Government debt inherited from the previous administration.</p>

	<p pid="b.167W.3/1">While the proposed closure of Tower Bridge magistrates court forms part of the current consultation exercise, it has been under consideration for several years as part of HMCS London Region's aspiration to improve magistrates court facilities and services across central and south London. The strategy that has been developed envisages the replacement of a number of old, inefficient courthouses with three larger, more modern and operationally efficient courthouses. The first of these, the new Westminster magistrates court in Marylebone, is due to open next year.</p>
	<p pid="b.167W.3/2">Within this overall strategy, the plan for Camberwell Green is to redevelop the site to construct five additional courtrooms. This plan has not been designed solely to facilitate the closure of Tower Bridge magistrates court, although expansion would allow closure and disposal of the freehold courthouse. The key driver is to enable HMCS to improve and modernise the facilities available to court users and generate greater listing flexibility. The operationally-preferred option also creates further capacity for international jurisdiction work in response to significant workload growth in this area of business.</p>
	<p pid="b.167W.3/3">Indicative costings only exist at present; depending on the expansion option chosen, total works costs range between &#163;9.3 million-&#163;11.5 million. Inevitably the scheme and any consequential closure would only progress once funding becomes available. This will be determined as part of Spending Review deliberations later this year.</p>

	<p pid="b.168W.0/1">The prison and probation services operate within the framework of the National Offender Management Service (NOMS) Agency. For historical reasons the two services have different employment structures. Prison service staff are civil servants and are directly employed by the NOMS Agency. Probation service staff are not civil servants and are employed by a probation trust.</p>
	<p pid="b.168W.0/2">Information on the career histories of senior managers within NOMS does not include National Probation Service experience. It is therefore not possible, without individually contacting all senior managers, to determine how many have worked in the Probation Service. Probation Service experience is provided by staff on secondment from probation trusts although the number of such staff across NOMS is not recorded.</p>
	<p pid="b.168W.0/3">Previous experience within Prison Service establishments is recorded. Of the 898 senior managers working in NOMS who are civil servants, 281 (31%) are currently based in prisons, 216 (24%) are currently based in headquarters but have previously served in prison establishments and 401 (45%) have no record of prison experience. Working in an establishment does not necessarily imply a prisoner facing role.</p>

Suppliers determined the list of prisons they preferred to supply during the tender process which was evaluated against predetermined criteria. Subsequently, contracts were awarded to suppliers on a regional and/or national basis dependant on their location and capability to fulfil our requirements to ensure the most cost effective and best value for money option achieved. All prisons had a minimum of two local suppliers to choose from on a weekly basis to purchase their requirements. The full list of suppliers is shown as follows.</p>

However, more needs to be done to help drug misusers to recover from their addiction and get into steady housing and employment. We believe the balance of treatment currently has tipped too far towards maintaining drug users' addictions.</p>
	<p pid="b.176W.2/2">A comprehensive framework of drug treatment is in place in prisons to address the drug needs of all offenders. This comprises clinical services, psychosocial interventions, case management and through care services.</p>

To achieve this objective work has been undertaken with the UK food industry, including caterers, to reduce levels of salt in food; a public awareness campaign has been run to inform consumers of why a high salt intake is bad for health and what they can do to reduce their intakes; and signpost labelling is provided to consumers on food labels to help them make informed choices.</p>

	<p pid="b.194W.7/2">There is still an arrest warrant outstanding for Andrey Lugovoi in the United Kingdom where he remains wanted for an allegation of murder. An initial extradition request made to the Russian authorities was refused on the basis that their constitution does not permit the extradition of their own nationals. In accordance with normal practice, we can neither confirm nor deny whether an arrest warrant for Andrey Lugovoi has been transmitted through Interpol.</p>

	<p pid="b.202W.2/1">The figures requested are as follows. They do not include expenditure incurred by the Department's agencies and non-departmental public bodies.</p>
	<p pid="b.202W.2/2"><i> (a)</i> In the last financial year, 2009-10, the Department spent &#163;8,578,052 on advertising. The advertising figures quoted are for net costs for advertising space on TV, radio, press, cinema, outdoor and online channels, and do not include costs for making the adverts or associated fees.</p>

	<p pid="b.202W.2/4"><i> (c)</i> In the last financial year, 2009-10, the Department spent &#163;73 million on consultancy.</p>
	<p pid="b.202W.2/5">The accounts for 2009-10 have not yet been closed and figures may be subject to amendment and to audit by the National Audit Office (NAO).</p>
	<p pid="b.202W.2/6">Consultancy services cover the provision to the Home Office of objective advice and assistance relating to strategy, structure, management, or operations in pursuit of its purposes and objectives. The use of external consultants provides the Department with specialist knowledge, skill, capacity and technical expertise that would not otherwise be available.</p>
	<p pid="b.202W.2/7">For the financial year 2010-11 the Home Office has introduced stringent new constraints on engaging consultants. We expect these constraints, in conjunction with new procedures and policies now being introduced, to produce a very substantial reduction in expenditure by the end of this financial year by comparison with the previous financial year.</p>
	<p pid="b.202W.2/8"><i> (d)</i> In the last 12 months (June 2009-May 2010), the Department spent &#163;437,761 on ministerial transport.</p>
	<p pid="b.202W.2/9"><i> (e)</i> Figures for hospitality are not held centrally and attempting to collate them would incur disproportionate cost.</p>
	<p pid="b.202W.2/10">Figures for 1997 are not held centrally and attempting to collate them would incur disproportionate cost. General and subsidiary ledgers produced for the purpose of preparing certified financial statements are not retained after a period of seven years, in line with National Audit Office (NAO) requirements. The Department does not hold the requested information for 1997.</p>

	<p pid="b.204W.6/1">The Identity and Passport Service (IPS) provides lost and stolen passport data to Interpol via the Serious and Organised Crime Agency (SOCA) on a daily basis, to assist with the international policing of borders. This arrangement has been in place and meeting the requirements of the organisations concerned since 2004. There have been no discussions with Interpol regarding the sharing of information on lost and stolen passports with private businesses. However, since 2006 IPS has provided a Passport Validation Service (PVS) to a number of United Kingdom based accredited financial and legal services. The service allows these accredited financial and legal services to check the validity of UK passports presented to them by customers directly against IPS records. The accredited private sector organisations using the PVS service do so via a call centre, providing the PVS with details of the passport in their possession and PVS will confirm the validity of the passport or otherwise. If the passport presented is shown on IPS records as lost or stolen the organisation is informed that the passport is invalid. Personal details or the reason for not being able to validate the details are not provided by PVS.</p>
	<p pid="b.204W.6/2">With regard to number of passports that have been reported to IPS as lost or stolen between 1997 and 2009, it is not possible to provide figures between 1997 and 2003, as the current system to record details of lost, stolen and recovered passports was only introduced in December 2003. Information relating to lost, stolen and recovered UK passports is therefore only available for the last six years (from 2004).</p>
	<p pid="b.204W.6/3">The following table sets out the number of UK passports that have been recorded by IPS as lost, stolen or recovered since 2004. The category &quot;Other&quot; is used by the IPS predominantly when a passport is declared damaged or destroyed.</p>

	<p pid="b.206W.5/1">The reduction in police funding of &#163;135 million in 2010-11 will be made by reducing core Government funding by &#163;125 million and counter terrorism specific grants by &#163;10 million.</p>
	<p pid="b.206W.5/2">The &#163;125 million reduction to core funding has been allocated fairly between forces, each of which will see a reduction equivalent to 1.46% of its core Government funding.</p>

The recent G8 summit has delivered a significant step change in efforts to improve maternal, newborn and child health.

	<p pid="b.212W.6/1">Work is the best and most sustainable route out of poverty. The aim of the new work programme is to support individuals to maximise employment opportunities. For those unable to work, the benefit system currently targets extra resources on those who are in greatest disadvantage. The system will continue to provide additional support for those in need, but in future the Government will work to ensure the benefit system also helps to tackle the root causes of poverty, reducing welfare dependency and promoting social justice.</p>
	<p pid="b.212W.6/2">The main elements of the employment and support allowance (ESA) are the personal allowances, the work-related activity or support components and flat rate premiums for groups recognised as having other special needs e.g. carers, severely disabled people and people aged over 60. This structure enables the Government to focus help most effectively on those groups who have the greatest needs. In particular, people who are placed in the support group qualify for the enhanced disability premium automatically.</p>
	<p pid="b.212W.6/3">The benefit rates do not directly reflect, nor are they made up of, specific items of household and other expenditure. Instead the rates are intended to cover overall household expenditure and normal day to day living expenses taken as a whole. Benefit rates are reviewed annually and a number of factors are taken into account during the review, the most important of which is the level of inflation. We have decided that in future ESA will be increased using the Consumer Price Index which we believe is the most suitable measure of inflation.</p>
	<p pid="b.212W.6/4">In many cases the basic rate of ESA is just one element of the total package of support that a person or household receives. Additional support may be available through (e.g.) housing benefit, council tax benefit, child benefit, child tax credit and disability living allowance.</p>

	<p pid="b.213W.2/1">The Department of Work and Pensions has made no assessment of the effectiveness of the methodology used by HSE for measuring the slip potential of floors and its micro surface roughness meter. HSE's approach to this topic has been developed by the UK Health and Safety Laboratory and is supported by the independent UK Slip Resistance Group consisting of manufacturers, suppliers and consultants. Independent peer reviewed research material also supports the approach taken by HSE and HSL.</p>
	<p pid="b.213W.2/2">HSE does not manufacture a micro surface roughness meter. It does use a commercially available micro surface roughness meter to assess the slipperiness of flooring in water contaminated conditions as part of its regulatory functions.</p>
	<p pid="b.213W.2/3">HSL have undertaken a variety of research into the causes of slips at work and how they can be managed and this research is published on the HSE website:</p>

The latest statistics cover the period October 2008 to September 2009 and estimated for that period a total of 3.3% (&#163;210 million) of Incapacity Benefit was paid out incorrectly. A full breakdown of the results can be found in the Department's publication 'Fraud and Error in the Benefit System: October 2008 to September 2009', copies of which are available in the Library.</p>

However, we believe the current system is broken and in need of radical reform. We will reassess everyone on incapacity benefits to see if they are fit for work. Those who are capable of work will be moved onto Jobseeker's Allowance. People who need more support while they prepare for work will get that help on Employment and Support Allowance and will be placed either in the Support Group or the Work Related Activity Group.</p>

	<p pid="b.224W.0/1">The Work Capability Assessment was developed in consultation with medical and other experts alongside specialist disability groups such as Mind. The scoring system is much fairer and simpler, removing a potential bias in the Personal Capability Assessment against people with mental health conditions, as opposed to limitation of physical function.</p>
	<p pid="b.224W.0/2">The Department undertook an internal review of the Work Capability Assessment which was published on <phrase class="date" code="2010-03-29">29 March 2010</phrase>. The review found that generally the assessment accurately identifies individuals for benefit. The review made a number of recommendations for improving the Work Capability Assessment. We announced on <phrase class="date" code="2010-06-29">29 June</phrase> that we will be implementing those recommendations. Additionally, the Government also have a statutory commitment to arrange an independent review of the main elements of the Work Capability Assessment every year for the first five years of operation. This review will look at the Work Capability Assessment in operation and is distinct from the department-led review which focussed on the technical accuracy of the assessment and whether it could better account for how individuals adapt to their condition. The review, announced on the <phrase class="date" code="2010-06-29">29 June</phrase>, will be conducted by Professor Malcolm Harrington, acting as lead reviewer.</p>
	<p pid="b.224W.0/3">Support for people who have a mental illness is currently available through Jobcentre Plus Personal Advisers as well as a variety of Government funded programmes, these will be superseded by the Work Programme by summer 2011 .We will continue to support and protect the most vulnerable and disabled people who are assessed as not capable of work. People in the Support Group of Employment and Support Allowance are not required to under take work focused activity and also receive a higher rate of benefit.</p>

Promoting the rule of law, including the independence of the judiciary, is a key element of the UK's and EU's engagement with Russia.</p>

The Attorney-General and Lord Chancellor discussed rule of law issues with the Russian Justice Minister during his recent visit to the UK. The annual UK/Russia bilateral human rights talks have enabled us to raise our concerns from a human rights perspective and we will do so again at the next talks planned for early 2011.

A transparent and independent Russian legal system is in all our interests.</p>

The latest report, dating from July 2009 prior to conclusion of negotiations, states that increased market access for processed timber products can be expected to add to existing deforestation trends, and illegal logging is a significant contributor to this problem. The Sustainable Development chapter of the agreement contains provisions to counter this, aiming to improve forest law enforcement and governance, and promote trade in legal and sustainable forest products.</p>

	<p pid="b.246W.0/1">The meeting with Jewish community and higher education stakeholders is in the process of being arranged and I anticipate that it will involve broad discussions on anti-Semitism and the implications for the higher education sector, including the future of the BIS Anti-Semitism and Higher Education Group. A formal agenda has not yet been agreed for this meeting but I would be happy to place a copy in the Library when it is available. I have held no discussions with ministerial colleagues about this group.</p>
	<p pid="b.246W.0/2">The former Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills provided updated and revised guidance to higher education institutions on 'Promoting Good Campus Relations, Fostering Shared Values and Preventing Violent Extremism in Universities and Higher Education Colleges', available here:</p>

	<p pid="b.246W.0/4">This provided detailed guidance to help institutions address issues concerning violent extremism, applicable to any form this might take on campus. The Department has not issued any guidance about the stereotyping of any community.</p>
	<p pid="b.246W.0/5">The sector itself has also produced guidance which offers institutions practical strategies to deal with instances of hate crimes and intolerance on campus, including anti-Semitism.</p>
	<p pid="b.246W.0/6">There is no place for racism of any form, including anti-Semitism, in higher education. Universities have the primary responsibility for ensuring that their students are not subject to threatening or abusive behaviour on campus and have access to a strong legislative framework and guidance to help them deal effectively with instances of intolerance, racism and harassment in their institutions. Government would expect them to vigorously tackle these issues when they arise and report criminal attacks to the police when they occur on campus, or support students to do so.</p>
