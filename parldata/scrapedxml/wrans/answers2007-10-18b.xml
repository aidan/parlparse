Following the recommendations of the M25 to Ipswich multi-modal study in 2002, the Secretary of State asked the Highways Agency to carry out further appraisal for upgrading the A12 between the M25 and Colchester.</p>
	<p pid="b.1183W.9/2">In July 2006 the Secretary of State accepted the advice of the East of England's Regional Assembly on regional transport investment priorities, not to prioritise the A12 for funding in the period up to 2015-16. It will be for the Region to reconsider in the review of the Regional Funding Allocations due in 2008.</p>

This included people with severe autism, mental health difficulties, learning and/or behavioural difficulties and people who are partially sighted. The findings were considered as part of the strategic review of the scheme, which reported to me in September and will contribute to the publication of a comprehensive Blue Badge reform strategy by April 2008.</p>

The revised local authority guidance, due for publication later this year, will also help to clarify the assessed eligibility process.</p>
	<p pid="b.1184W.2/5">The medical assessment practice varies between different local authorities. We are committed to actively promoting good practice guidance in this area and are engaging with the Department of Health on this issue.</p>

So far one substantive TIF bid for funding has been received.

It is unlikely that compensation to private business, including farmers, for losses arising from the floods would be eligible.

	<p pid="b.1189W.5/2">A regulatory impact assessment was produced in 2002 when Council Directive 99/74/EC was transposed into domestic legislation. This will be updated in the light of the Commission's report and will consider such aspects as the impact of the 2012 conventional cage ban on the industry and trading patterns. Currently, over half of UK egg production is from caged birds although, during the last few years, there has been a shift in production methods in the UK from conventional cages to enriched cages and alternative systems.</p>

	<p pid="b.1190W.5/1">As part of its pre-feasibility study into personal carbon trading, the Government will be looking at, among other things, carbon footprints of different groups to assess the equity impact of personal carbon trading.</p>
	<p pid="b.1190W.5/2">This will follow initial work conducted by the Centre for Sustainable Energy (CSE) in November 2006, entitled &quot;A Rough Guide to Individual Carbon Trading&quot;. One of the findings of this report was that, in general, those on lower incomes tend to emit less carbon dioxide than average, while those on higher incomes tend to emit more carbon dioxide than average. A personal carbon trading system might have the potential to achieve emissions savings in a fairer way than a carbon tax.</p>
	<p pid="b.1190W.5/3">A recent piece of work by the CSE, commissioned by DEFRA to help inform development of the post-2011 supplier obligation, further illustrates the correlation between income level and carbon emissions. This study also draws out important variations within income bands, showing that some low-income households have very high consumption levels and some high-income households have very low consumption levels.</p>

	<p pid="b.1191W.5/1">Peatlands are a significant store of carbon in the UK and require protection. A substantial proportion of these are found in Scotland. However, in terms of absorbing carbon dioxide, the potential is limited, due to their slow growth.</p>
	<p pid="b.1191W.5/2">DEFRA is currently seeking to develop its understanding of the risks to this carbon store and to investigate the best means of protecting peatlands and the biodiversity they support. The Department is in the process of setting up a cross-governmental project that is intended to form part of DEFRA's new soil strategy for England. This will ensure that DEFRA and its agencies co-ordinate their activity on peat soils and liaise effectively with the devolved Administrations as well as identifying best practice for protecting peatlands and putting in place the appropriate measures.</p>
	<p pid="b.1191W.5/3">However, to a large extent, land managers are already protecting peatlands for their biodiversity value under agri-environment schemes and Sites of Special Scientific Interest. Around 230,000 hectares of peatlands are currently managed under agri-environment agreements in England.</p>

	<p pid="b.1192W.0/1">A large number of foot and mouth vaccines for a range of different strains are already held in the UK vaccine bank at the Merial production facility in Pirbright This is the only facility licensed to produce foot and mouth disease vaccines in the UK. As soon as we identified the precise strain of the circulating virus we ordered 300,000 doses to be made ready for use. This vaccine is licensed for use in cattle and other species and the production was cleared by the Health and Safety Executive and the Veterinary Medicines Directorate.</p>
	<p pid="b.1192W.0/2">However, DEFRA has decided not to vaccinate at this time as the epidemiological evidence concludes that the risk of the infection spreading out of Surrey is very low. Therefore, the slaughter of animals on infected premises and dangerous contacts remains the most effective way of eradicating the disease.</p>
	<p pid="b.1192W.0/3">There is currently no suitable vaccine for the bluetongue serotype 8 available; as this serotype only emerged in Europe last year. However, we are aware of several companies who are developing such a vaccine for use in cattle and sheep and we are in urgent discussions with them to do what we can to encourage this work. We are also developing a plan with the industry as to how a vaccination campaign would work once a vaccine becomes available, is licensed, safe and effective for use; we hope this will be next year.</p>
	<p pid="b.1192W.0/4">While progress is being made on the development of a TB vaccine for cattle, vaccination as a practical TB control measure is still some way off. DEFRA-funded research has successfully identified lead candidate vaccines and we are now starting to look at delivery protocols. Research is also continuing on tests to differentiate infected from vaccinated animals (DIVA tests). It is important to note that development of a successful TB vaccine cannot be guaranteed, and that if a vaccine can be developed it will only form one part of a balanced package of measures to control the disease.</p>

Local authorities without local facilities may either use facilities in other areas, or send recyclables for reprocessing outside the UK.</p>
	<p pid="b.1194W.2/3">When reporting data to WasteDataFlow, local authorities should specify the amount of waste collected for recycling that is subsequently rejected at the point of collection, at a Materials Recycling Facility (MRF), or at the gate of the reprocessor. The data reported to WasteDataFlow are used by the Environment Agency and DEFRA to monitor the Landfill Allowance Trading Scheme.</p>

	<p pid="b.1195W.9/1">The Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP) offers advice to local authorities on arrangements for food waste collection. This advice has been developed on the basis of published literature, a number of projects commissioned by WRAP and current local authority experience of providing food waste collection services. The general advice is that if local authorities are considering collecting food waste they should consider collecting it separately and on a weekly basis. Where food waste is collected separately, WRAP advises that local authorities provide appropriate containers to householders (typically a kitchen caddy and a rigid external container) to make the separation of food waste easier for residents and to encourage them to take part in the service.</p>
	<p pid="b.1195W.9/2">The types of food waste suitable for collection will depend on the treatment facilities available to a local authority. All food waste collected separately must be treated at enclosed facilities (for example, in-vessel composting or anaerobic digestion plants) that meet the requirements of the Animal By-Products Regulations and are approved by the State Veterinary Service. Typically this will include cooked and uncooked food, dairy products, meat, fish and fruit/vegetables.</p>

In addition to the eight infected premises there have been two premises on which animals were culled as part of the policy of slaughter on suspicion, and a further seven premises where animals were culled as dangerous contacts. There are no premises where animals have been culled solely on the basis that they were contiguous to an infected premises.</p>

	<p pid="b.1200W.5/2">Under the Animal Health Act 1981, compensation is paid for animals that are compulsorily slaughtered to prevent the spread of disease. For foot and mouth disease (FMD), the Act requires that compensation is paid at the full market value before the animal became infected. This is determined by an approved valuer at the time of slaughter. Compensation is also paid for other items, such as farm equipment and feed, where these are seized because they are considered to be contaminated; this includes such things as milk. However, it is a long established principle that the Government do not meet the costs of consequential losses, which must be borne by the industry. Government seek to minimise the risk of market impacts, particularly by encouraging public understanding of the issues.</p>

	<p pid="b.1204W.2/2">The landfill tax escalator gives greater financial incentives to reduce, reuse and recycle waste. This was increased in the 2007 Budget so that the standard rate of tax will increase by &pound;8 per year from 2008 until at least 2010-11. If private waste collectors that collect commercial waste fail to offer alternatives to landfill (such as recycling) they will find that the waste treatment services they offer will no longer be cost effective. This is an incentive for waste contractors to consider developing waste management partnerships with local authorities to provide services to local businesses.</p>
	<p pid="b.1204W.2/3">In addition, the Business Resource Efficiency and Waste Programme (BREW) has been developed to give money raised through the landfill tax back to business through funding resource efficiency and waste projects that will benefit business. The BREW Centre for Local Authorities was set up to help local authorities undertake a leadership role in supporting the business community to become more profitable through business resource efficiency and waste reduction.</p>

This is in response to recommendation 4 of the Biomass Task Force Report to the Government, published in October 2005. DEFRA's general conclusion is that it is more cost effective to treat contaminated waste wood as a waste and to dispose of it in a Waste Incineration Directive (WID)-compliant facility than to attempt to decontaminate and burn it in commercial wood-burning furnaces or power plants as a non-waste. Such WID-compliant facilities can recover energy as electricity, or electricity and heat in the form of combined heat and power for industrial purposes.</p>

The criteria are limits of contaminants permitted in waste, together with testing standards and procedures that must be used. Hazardous wastes are also required to be pre-treated before landfill.

People with mental health problems are one of the most excluded social groups in society, with fewer than a quarter in employment. They can find themselves excluded from education, health care and community participation. People with mental illness who disclose their condition can find themselves shunned by neighbours and colleagues while some do not disclose their illness to family and friends. For many people with mental illness, a diagnosis of mental illness can have a worse impact upon their lives than their symptoms.</p>

	<p pid="b.1212W.2/2">Over the last three years we have invested &pound;12 million in an end of life care programme to promote roll-out of these tried and tested tools, and thus promote greater choice for patients about where they are able to be cared for and die.</p>

The Department is currently developing the first ever end of life care strategy for adults, which will deliver increased choice to all adult patients regardless of their condition about where they live and die, and provide them with support to make this possible.</p>
	<p pid="b.1212W.2/4">We have deferred publication of the strategy to allow us to take account of the important work being undertaken on end of life care at strategic health authority (SHA) level for the next stage review which will be completed in the new year.

	<p pid="b.1215W.5/2">UK Sport is aware of legal action taken earlier this year by the BBSKA against the Federation Internationale de Bobsleigh et de Tobogganing (FIBT). This was in the form of an appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport against the FIBT's decision to change the rules over race licensing arrangements for skeleton athletes, without prior consultation. BBSKA used &pound;17,000 of funding received from UK Sport to meet the costs of this successful action.</p>
	<p pid="b.1215W.5/3">UK Sport agreed to meet this proportion of the costs because of the direct impact the decision was having on the athletes' ability to train and compete, and therefore the BBSKA's ability to deliver its performance programme. UK Sport did, however, make clear to the BBSKA that further costs associated with this legal action would need to be met from other sources of income. UK Sport is not aware of the total cost to the BBSKA of undertaking this legal action.</p>

A key part of this programme aims to improve the way cases proceed in the magistrates courts. Following successful tests (with evidence of more offenders pleading guilty at an early stage, fewer hearings and the majority of trials for contested cases being set within 6-10 weeks), national implementation is firmly under way throughout England and Wales. CJSSS is now running in at least one site in each of the 36 local criminal justice areas and fully implemented in all magistrates courts in 11 of those areas. Implementation is expected to be completed in all but a handful of magistrates courts by December 2007. Once fully implemented these changes should deliver a step change in the public's experience of the justice system, improving the speed and effectiveness of magistrates courts.</p>

Results are based on proceedings in one sample week in March and September. The Time Intervals Survey (TIS) is a sample survey that produces estimates of the average time taken between stages of proceedings for defendants in completed criminal cases in magistrates courts. More information on TIS is available on the Ministry of Justice website.<br/> 2. The margin of error is a measure of the precision of a result based on a sample survey. Timeliness in magistrates courts is measured using data from a sample of the total number of defendants. The sample provides one estimate of the average time taken and different samples would produce different average times. The true value is likely to fall within the range of the sample result +/- the margin of error.<br/> 3. &quot;First listing&quot; refers to the first listed hearing of the case in the magistrates court.<br/> 4. It is not totally clear which &quot;assault&quot; cases are being referred to in the question. Information on broad offence group is collected in TIS although not at a level that would make it possible to provide estimates for defendants proceeded against for assault crimes separately. The offence classifications are as follows: burglary, criminal damage, drunken driving, drug offences, driving without due care, fraud and forgery, failing to stop, indictable motoring offences, other summary motoring offences, robbery, sexual offences, summary non-motoring offences, theft and handling stolen goods, violence against the person, other indictable offences (excluding motoring offences). Information is not available in TIS at individual offence level. Assault offences are classified in several different offence groups.<br/> In addition to timeliness of all criminal cases, timeliness figures have been provided for one of the offence groups ('summary non-motoring offences') as it was thought this might be helpful. The 'summary non-motoring offences' group includes the offences common assault, and assault on a constable, which were thought to be the most relevant offences to answer this question. Please note that in addition to the assault offences, the summary non-motoring offence group also includes a wide variety of other offences such as offences against Public Order and Education Act offences. In addition, certain other forms of assault (e.g. sexual assaults and assault with intent to rob) are counted in other offence groups and will not be included in the table.<br/> 5. Results have been provided for all years since 2001. It is not possible to provide consistent data for earlier years owing to methodological changes.<br/> <i> Source</i>:<br/> Time Intervals Survey, Ministry of Justice</td> </tr>

	<p pid="b.1222W.5/1">The current recorded crime offence classification series does differentiate between robbery of personal property and robbery of business property, and also between domestic burglary and that of burglary in a building other than a dwelling. However, these categories will only represent some of the crimes against business which are recorded by the police. Offences of theft by an employee and fraud by company director are also included within the series.</p>
	<p pid="b.1222W.5/2">The feasibility of police forces flagging commercial burglary offences is being examined as part of the regular annual data requirement review process by the Home Office and ACPO. These data are to be provided under a pilot scheme using a new crime recording system which is currently being developed in the Home Office. It will enable a richer range of data to be collected from police forces. The feasibility of measuring crime against business will be examined during 2008-09.</p>

	<p pid="b.1233W.3/1">Work on developing a Defence related price index commenced in 2004-05 and has continued since. Unfortunately, despite commitment by both the Office for National Statistics and Defence Analytical Services Agency (DASA), work has as yet failed to produce a defence specific inflation index.</p>
	<p pid="b.1233W.3/2">Matching the companies, to which MOD has made payments, with Office for National Statistics data has been difficult due to changes in names, ownership, recording of information and ONS data on prices being from a sample survey. Less than 20 per cent. of companies paid more than &pound;1 million by MOD in 2002-03 could be matched to price data, which accounted for less than 30 per cent. of MOD spend. Confining analysis to the subset of Defence problems further decreases this already poor coverage causing any estimates of defence inflation to be unreliable and biased.</p>
	<p pid="b.1233W.3/3">Using published indices for MOD purchases of goods and services, and indeed the underlying data for these indices also presents a variety of problems. Price changes collected by ONS represent off the shelf products whereas the large value goods that MOD buys tend to be bespoke systems. Quality adjustment of price indices is appropriate for determining change in value, but not for the replacement costs that MOD faces. It is difficult to incorporate overseas expenditure. Indices used in placing contracts frequently do not reflect the expenditure patterns of the MOD.</p>

	<p pid="b.1250W.9/1">Yes, the simple inquiry carried out by the Deputy Governor of Wormwood Scrubs is the inquiry to which the previous answer refers. The inquiry took seven and a half months to complete; two members of staff were interviewed, and the final report ran to 25 pages. The area manager for London was the commissioning authority for this inquiry, and the only grade requirement for an investigating officer is that they are at least of principal officer or executive officer grade, and that the commissioning authority must be satisfied with the competence and impartiality of the investigating officer.</p>

At any given time an individual may be in receipt of injury benefit, income support, disability living allowance, social fund payment(s). It should be noted that each social fund claim generates a new file. It is also feasible that CSA, debt management and fraud hold files on the individual as well as dormant records for jobseekers allowance and the labour market unit. Other benefits for which individual records are kept include retirement pension, attendance allowance and industrial injuries disablement benefit.</p>

	<p pid="b.1263W.9/1">Cyclically-adjusted net borrowing in the UK has averaged 1.0 per cent. of GDP over the current economic cycle. Over the same period, the structural balance has averaged 1.9 per cent. in the euro area, 2.1 per cent. in France, 2.3 per cent. in Germany and 2.8 per cent. in Italy.</p>
	<p pid="b.1263W.9/2">With output close to or at trend throughout the projection period, the profile of cyclically-adjusted borrowing is very similar to that of headline PSNB. Cyclically-adjusted borrowing is slightly higher than the main aggregate in 2007-08 because the economy appears to be slightly above trend in this year.</p>

The Household Reference Person is the person who owns the accommodation or is legally responsible for the rent.

	<p pid="b.1281W.2/1">HM Revenue and Customs have written to around 175,000 households to advise them that they will be reviewing their tax credits awards from 2003-04 and 2004-05, and to around 75,000 recipients about their 2005-06 awards.</p>

	<p pid="b.1281W.2/3">The planned programme of work to review these awards has now started and will be completed in three years. The time span reflects the need to put these cases on a sound footing as soon as practicable while ensuring HM Revenue and Customs continues to improve the service it provides to tax credits claimants. The plans include ensuring that those where the overpayment is greatest will be reviewed first, and priority will also be given to those where there is an outstanding query about the overpayment.</p>

	<p pid="b.1284W.2/1">The Government are entirely sympathetic to the plight of those who lost money in the Farepak collapse. They were strongly supportive of the commendable efforts of the Farepak response fund appeal which raised &pound;8 million from business and members of the public to help those affected.</p>
	<p pid="b.1284W.2/2">It is the central duty of the liquidators to realise as much as possible for the benefit of all of the creditors of the collapsed company. The timing and level of any dividend payment to unsecured creditors (including the agents and customers) is as yet uncertain. On present information, however, the dividend will be approximately five pence in the pound.</p>
	<p pid="b.1284W.2/3">For the future, the Government have taken steps to provide better protection and information for consumers. They have worked with the other hamper companies to put in place greater protection for customers' prepayments, and are pleased to note the initiative of the companies in improving security for consumers' money, which is now held in trust accounts under the control of independent trustees. The arrangements within the individual companies will be monitored by a new trade body, the Christmas Prepayments Association, with a new code of practice to ensure that customer protection measures are established and operated effectively.</p>
	<p pid="b.1284W.2/4">The Government have also given the OFT funding for a consumer education campaign so that consumers are better aware of their options for Christmas savings and empowered to make decisions that are right for their own circumstances.</p>

	<p pid="b.1286W.2/1">There has been substantial progress in implementing the recommendations of the Pomeroy Review of Christmas savings schemes since its publication in March 2007.</p>
	<p pid="b.1286W.2/2">Firstly, the Government have taken steps to provide better protection and information for consumers. They have worked with the other hamper companies to put in place effective protection for customers' prepayments, and are pleased to note the initiative of the companies in improving security for consumers' money, which is now held in trust accounts under the control of independent trustees. The arrangements within the individual companies will be monitored by a new trade body, the Christmas Prepayments Association, with a new code of practice to ensure that customer protection measures are established and operated effectively.</p>
	<p pid="b.1286W.2/3">In response to the recommendation on mounting an awareness campaign, the Government have given the Office of Fair Trading ( OFT) funding for a consumer education campaign so that consumers are better aware of their options for Christmas savings and empowered to make decisions that are right for their own circumstances. The OFT education programme is delivering face-to-face sessions for consumers across the UK. The sessions, run by community groups, explain the options for people and help them to choose the best way to save for them as individuals, pointing out the features of the alternatives. This work is being well received and will continue to be delivered into 2008.</p>
	<p pid="b.1286W.2/4">The OFT were also asked to consider whether there were any competition issues in the hamper scheme market. The OFT examined the merger of Park Group and Home Farm Hampers and found that alternative sources of saving operated as a constraint on the merging parties. This is because the majority of customers are prepared to consider switching between a wide range of savings products. No competition concerns were raised either by competitors or customers.</p>
	<p pid="b.1286W.2/5">As detailed in the review, a number of credit unions across the country have historically also offered Christmas saving accounts, and this number increased significantly after the collapse of Farepak. There are now more than 100 such accounts. The OFT's &quot;Save Xmas&quot; campaign has provided consumers with information on all Christmas saving options, including credit union Christmas and regular saving accounts. This will ensure consumers have the necessary information to choose the right product for their needs. The Financial Inclusion Taskforce has reported that Post Office Limited's plans to launch a Christmas saving product is progressing.</p>
	<p pid="b.1286W.2/6">The Government's work on financial inclusion and capability has responded to the recommendation that informal saving schemes be given greater emphasis. In addition to the OFT &quot;Save Xmas&quot; campaign, the Department for Work and Pension's &quot;now let's talk money&quot; campaign, which provides people with information and support in accessing financial services, is providing guidance on the different ways in which people can save. The Thoresen review on generic financial advice, which will shortly be publishing an interim report, with a final report to follow early next year, is considering the provision of guidance on informal savings. And the FSA's &quot;money made clear&quot; website also has information on Christmas saving schemes.</p>
	<p pid="b.1286W.2/7">Finally, on the recommendation relating to Government awareness of all methods of savings, the new wealth and assets survey is collecting information on informal saving. Interim findings from the first wave of data collection will be published by the end of the year.</p>

The LSC do not analyse attainment of EMA recipients by subject area or grade as the costs of extracting the data would be disproportionate to the benefits. However, an analysis of the impact of EMA on participation and attainment has been commissioned by the LSC. The results of this analysis have been delayed due to data availability issues and are now due to be published in November 2007.

	<p pid="b.1297W.2/1">The Department has provided &pound;1.57 million to fund the National Foundation for Education Research's nine year longitudinal study into citizenship education due to be completed in November 2009. The findings from this study and the Ofsted Citizenship report &quot;Towards Consensus? Citizenship in secondary schools&quot; (2006) have helped to shape policy in this area. Both reports found that whilst remaining patchy in some areas, progress has been made in citizenship provision and it is adequate or better in 75 per cent. of schools. The Department has funded a self evaluation tool for schools to enable them to strengthen their citizenship provision.</p>
	<p pid="b.1297W.2/2">Both reports point to teacher training continuing to be needed. We are addressing this issue both through providing places for initial teacher training (200 per year) and through the citizenship continuing professional development certificate (1200 teachers over the next two years).</p>

	<p pid="b.1298W.5/2">The National Curriculum for Modern Foreign Languages does not prescribe which languages schools should offer, However, from September 2008, the requirement that pupils at Key Stage 3 (ages 11-14) must first study a working language of the European Union will be lifted so that schools will be able to teach any major European or world language. Examples given in the new programme of study include Mandarin, although the choice of language is for schools to determine.</p>
	<p pid="b.1298W.5/3">The national languages strategy set out an entitlement for all Key Stage 2 (7-11 year old) pupils to learn a language in class time by 2010. Schools can choose which languages they teach; including Mandarin and Cantonese. Research carried out by the National Foundation for Educational Research (NFER) into language teaching in primary schools found that 1 per cent. of responding schools in London were teaching Chinese.</p>

	<p pid="b.1299W.0/1">The Department receives representations from stakeholders, in particular pupils and parents, about the numbers of tests and examinations which pupils are required to take. There are statutory assessments of each pupil's progress and attainment at the end of key stages 1, 2 and 3, In key stage 1, pupils are set at least one task in each of reading, writing and mathematics. Tasks can be taken at any time and enable teachers to be secure in their judgment of which level the child has reached. Assessment at key stages 2 and 3 involves tests in English, mathematics and science, and teacher assessments. Although there are no statutory requirements for assessment at the end of key stage 4, approximately 96 per cent. of 15-year-olds are entered for one or more full GCSE courses each year. The tests and examinations taken at the end of each key stage do not amount to an excessive burden on pupils or schools. For example, the key stage 2 tests amount to less than six hours, accounting for around 0.15 per cent. of available teaching time in the key stage, and the key stage 3 tests amount to less than eight hours, accounting for less than 0.2 per cent. of available teaching time in the key stage.</p>
	<p pid="b.1299W.0/2">These tests and examinations provide objective and reliable measures of the standards secured by pupils at crucial stages in their development, and equip us with the best data possible to support our education system. In addition to assessment at the end of each key stage, schools monitor pupils' performance during each key stage and it is for each school to decide whether to use tests as part of their monitoring arrangements.</p>

DCSF has also funded a programme of MP mentoring, where MPs work directly with trainee citizenship teachers to help them with their knowledge of Parliament so that they can teach the political literacy element of citizenship with confidence. In addition, DCSF set up and funded the Association for Citizenship Teaching (ACT) to work with teachers and local authorities to provide training and help to spread good practice.</p>

	<p pid="b.1301W.8/1">The Department is planning two separate, but related one-to-one tuition programmes, which are designed to raise standards in mathematics:</p>
	<p pid="b.1301W.8/2" class="indent">one-to-one tuition to help 300,000 children who have fallen behind in mathematics by 2010-11. We are currently planning how this should be delivered and will use lessons learned from the tuition element of the Making Good Progress pilot, and from other existing individual intervention programmes, to inform this.</p>
	<p pid="b.1301W.8/3" class="indent">'Every Child Counts' (ECC), a more intensive initiative specifically designed for intervention in mathematics during Key Stage 1, which will be a counterpart to 'Every Child a Reader' (ECAR).</p>
	<p pid="b.1301W.8/4">Under the Making Good Progress pilot we are offering up to 10 hours of one to one tuition in mathematics for pupils who are behind, or at risk of falling behind, national expectations. Tuition will be delivered outside school hours by fully qualified teachers working in partnership with the class teacher.</p>
	<p pid="b.1301W.8/5">ECC, set to start in 2010, will be aimed at children whose attainment as six-year-olds shows they are failing to make expected progress for their age. In Year 2, they will get intensive support in half hour sessions each day from teachers, mostly provided one-to-one, but also through group work.</p>
	<p pid="b.1301W.8/6">We are investing &pound;144 million over the next three years into rolling out nationally ECAR and ECC and by 2011 30,000 seven-year-olds who need help with mathematics will benefit from the programme each year. We are working with the charitable KPMG Foundation on this programme.</p>
	<p pid="b.1301W.8/7">Mathematics is a compulsory subject at Key Stage 4. It is not compulsory for students to be entered for the GCSE, though achievement in GCSE mathematics is an important gateway to opportunities for further study and employment and we therefore expect the vast majority of young people to be entered for it. As part of our 14-19 reform programme we have developed new functional skills standards at entry level and levels 1 and 2 in mathematics which will be incorporated into all qualification routes (GCSE, Diplomas and Apprenticeships) and will also form the basis of freestanding qualifications. The freestanding qualifications will provide opportunities for achievement and progression in mathematics for those young people for whom a GCSE might not be the most appropriate option at the end of Key Stage 4.</p>

The 2006/07 School Sport Survey collected data from all maintained schools in England about the percentage of pupils who take part in at least two hours high quality PE and school sport each week. The results of the survey are being published today. They show that 92 per cent. of pupils in year 7 are taking part in at least two hours high quality PE and sport each week. For year 8 pupils, the figure is 91 per cent., and for year 9 pupils, the figure is 86 per cent.</p>

	<p pid="b.1305W.5/1">BSF funding is allocated formulaically, based on pupil numbers and DCSF area guidelines for secondary schools ('BB98'). Within BB98 swimming pools are not considered to be part of the core school facilities which DCSF fund.</p>
	<p pid="b.1305W.5/2">It is for each local authority to decide how to make the best use of its overall BSF funding allocation across the schools in a particular project and the scope of works at each school. An authority can choose to use some of its BSF allocation to refurbish an existing pool where it considers this to be the best use of the available funding. There is also the option of exploring other sources of funding (e.g. DCMS/Sport England) to supplement that from BSF.</p>
	<p pid="b.1305W.5/3">Lambeth council took the view that using funding to replace the pool at Stockwell Park would not represent good value for money. Other, better, facilities are available locally and swimming pools require significant investment, not just of capital funding but also of revenue to support the considerable ongoing running costs&mdash;costs which were unlikely to be recouped in this case through community use.</p>
