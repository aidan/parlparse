	<p pid="f.7W.0/2">Casinos other than 2005 Act casinos are licensed under the Gaming Act 1968. The 1968 Act established the principle of permitted areas in order to prevent a proliferation in the number of small casinos.</p>
	<p pid="f.7W.0/3">This remains a key objective of the Government's casino policy: we believe that limiting casinos licensed under the 1968 Act to the 53 permitted areas will continue to act as a deterrent to proliferation, as it is unlikely that operators will want to open more casinos in these limited geographical areas than the market there can naturally sustain.</p>

	<p pid="f.11W.0/1">A pilot mystery shopping exercise was undertaken in the summer of 2007 on remote sites operated by prospective licensees and others. The Commission also conducts an ongoing programme of mystery shopping visits to remote gambling websites as part of its wider compliance effort for licensed remote gambling operators. The Commission expects to conduct further testing of operators licensed in other jurisdictions but to date all of those tested since <phrase class="date" code="2007-09-01">1 September 2007</phrase> under the provisions of the Gambling Act 2005 are operators licensed in Great Britain.</p>

	<p pid="f.20W.8/1">The purpose of pilots is to investigate the issues surrounding the use of various potential innovations in electoral administration and gain learning that will inform development of policy and possible future e-counting solutions. One of the aims of the e-counting pilots that took place in May 2007, for example, was to investigate whether commercially available scanning machines could successfully be used in an e-counting solution. The pilots demonstrated that it is possible to use commercially available scanning machines, and this should lead to lower costs.</p>
	<p pid="f.20W.8/2">All electoral pilots are evaluated by the Electoral Commission, which makes recommendations regarding the future operation of particular innovations. These evaluations usually encapsulate the key lessons and recommendations from each pilot. The Government take these into account alongside lessons learned during development and implementation of the pilots themselves and, where relevant, the experience of e-counting elsewhere in the UK and overseas.</p>

	<p pid="f.22W.14/1">The numbers of suicides and self-harm incidents since 1998 are contained in the following table.</p>
	<p pid="f.22W.14/2">The National Offender Management Service has a broad, integrated and evidence-based prisoner suicide prevention strategy that seeks to reduce the distress of all those in prison. This encompasses a wide spectrum of Prison and Department of Health work around such issues as mental health, substance misuse and resettlement. Any prisoner identified as at risk of suicide or self-harm is cared for using the Assessment, Care in Custody and Teamwork (ACCT) procedures. ACCT is the prisoner-centred flexible care-planning system introduced across the prisons estate in partnership with the Department of Health during 2005-07 to replace the old F2052SH system.</p>
	<p pid="f.22W.14/3">Any death in custody is a tragic event. The Government are committed to learning from such events and reducing the number of self-inflicted deaths in state custody. We are implementing many of the recommendations of Robert Fulton's Review of the Forum for Preventing Deaths in Custody. From April 2009, a new three tier Ministerial Council on Deaths in Custody will replace the existing forum and the Ministerial Roundtable on Suicide.</p>

	<p pid="f.26W.2/3">For secure children's homes (SCHs) the requirement is that they meet the Youth Justice Board's National Specification for Learning and Skills. This requires that young people are given the opportunity to receive 30 hours of timetabled activities based around a curriculum encompassing taught education, vocational work or offending behaviour work. In addition there is an expectation that young people engage in an hour a day of private study and 12 hours a week of activities such as hobbies or clubs.</p>

	<p pid="f.28W.12/1">The Department for Transport is not responsible for issuing passes and so does not maintain records of how many passes individual authorities have issued.</p>
	<p pid="f.28W.12/2">Crosby is part of Merseyside Passenger Transport Executive, Merseytravel. The latest figures held by the Department is that as of June 2008 Merseytravel had issued approximately 272,000 concessionary passes to both elderly and eligible disabled people.</p>
	<p pid="f.28W.12/3">As of October 2008, approximately 7.2 million ITSO concessionary smartcard passes have been issued in England and approximately 900,000 London Freedom Passes have been re-stickered for national use.</p>
