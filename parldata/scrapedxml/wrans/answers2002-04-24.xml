	<p pid=".259W.2/1">Bids were assessed against the criteria of best value for money, having regard to price, delivery and quality. Tenderers were required to produce financial evidence of guarantees or other financing arrangements that underwrote their ability to sign a contract in a timely manner. Government Departments and regional and industrial bodies with a legitimate interest in the strategic sealift service competition were consulted at all stages. The complexity of the transaction has extended the negotiations but all major questions have been resolved and we foresee no significant obstacle to early signature.</p>

	<p pid=".262W.8/1">The down declaration of 5 Squadron in October 2004 was assumed in the 1999 Eurofighter Force Planning Assumptions and was part of a series of measures related to the introduction of Eurofighter. The Squadron's down declaration was designed to release manpower and other resources to allow the build up of Eurofighter squadrons to begin. As such, 'savings' arising from the down declaration of 5 Squadron will be offset elsewhere in the Defence programme. The decision to down declare 5 Squadron early, by January 2003, was taken to produce a more effective and efficient Tornado F3 capability pending the arrival into RAF service of the Eurofighter. Its aircraft and most of the Squadron's personnel are being redistributed among the other Tornado F3 squadrons. However, savings of approximately &pound;2 million over two years are expected.</p>

	<p pid=".264W.3/2">The capability to attack surface targets at intermediate range (35 to 100 nautical miles from the delivery platform) from RAF strike aircraft has been given the title SPEAR (Selective Precision Effects At Range). Studies into how the SPEAR capability might be best achieved are still ongoing. However, work to date has indicated that one single system may not be the most cost-effective solution, as the required effects of SPEAR will vary according to the various scenarios and target types against which it is used. The capability may, therefore, need to be realised through improvements to weapons to enter service in the short to medium term, as well as the introduction of a new system (or systems). Time scales for the delivery of the capability will depend upon which solution is chosen.</p>

	<p pid=".266W.3/1">The Royal Society reports on &quot;The Health Hazards of Depleted Uranium Munitions&quot; consider three levels of exposure to depleted uranium (DU):</p>
	<p pid=".266W.3/2">Level I&mdash;exposures to personnel in a vehicle that is struck by a DU penetrator, or to personnel entering a struck vehicle immediately, typically to assist injured comrades.</p>
	<p pid=".266W.3/3">Level II&mdash;exposures following combat, typically to personnel working in or on contaminated vehicles to carry out repairs.</p>
	<p pid=".266W.3/4">Level III&mdash;all other exposures, for example, being downwind of an impact or fire involving DU, or brief entry into contaminated vehicle.</p>
	<p pid=".266W.3/5">No British troops who served in the Gulf or Balkans would have featured in the Level I scenario, or the worst case estimate for the Level II scenario, that is, personnel exposed to DU for about 100 hours.</p>
	<p pid=".266W.3/6">Some duties undertaken by British troops in the Gulf could potentially have put them in scenarios representative of the Royal Society's Level II average estimate of 10 hours exposure to DU. However, the Royal Society's prediction of excess deaths from lung cancer and leukaemia, resulting from such Level II exposures, is very low (0.25 and 0.0007 per 10,000 respectively by the age of 75). This would not be detectable above the general risk of dying from cancer over a normal lifetime.</p>
	<p pid=".266W.3/7">It is possible that some veterans might have experienced Level III exposures during the Gulf and Balkans conflicts and aftermaths.</p>

	<p pid=".273W.8/1">The Government have welcomed the publication of the energy review by the performance and innovation unit, which draws attention to the key role of renewable energy sources, including energy crops, in moving to a low carbon economy. The Government plan a public consultation on the key recommendations of the report leading to a White Paper in the autumn. This Department has allocated support of &pound;29 million to solid biomass crops through the energy crops scheme, part of the England Rural Development Programme. The Renewables Obligation permits the co-firing of energy crops with fossil fuels. Working with other Departments we are putting in place further schemes with funding of &pound;70 million which will develop markets for biomass, including purpose grown energy crops and material from forests, in heat, combined heat and power and electricity generation. We are also working closely with the Countryside Agency which has launched the Community Renewables Initiative to help local communities develop renewable energy projects. In the Budget my right hon. Friend the Chancellor confirmed the new duty rate for biodiesel set at 20p per litre below the rate for ultra low sulphur diesel. The Government are considering carefully the recommendation of the Policy Commission on the Future of Farming and Food that duty on biofuels should be reduced to the rates applied to other clean fuels.</p>

	<p pid=".278W.0/2">There have been no prosecutions for illegal meat imports under the hygiene regulations. There have so far been two bushmeat prosecutions in the UK. The first of these, in early 2001, found the defendant not guilty of CITES offences but guilty of failing to comply with the animal health controls on entry to the EU. The second prosecution in June 2001, found two defendants guilty of CITES offences and they both received four-month prison sentences.</p>

	<p pid=".283W.2/2">The trust have also introduced a new block grant scheme, under which the vehicle manufacturers can deduct the appropriate PowerShift grant from the list price or rental cost of the vehicle. This alternative means that the purchaser is not involved in applying for PowerShift grants.</p>

	<p pid=".285W.0/2">The Department informed Network Rail, during the week before Network Rail made its bid to Railtrack Group plc on <phrase class="date" code="2005-03-25">25 March</phrase>, that it was potentially willing to offer a &pound;300 million grant on the basis of Network Rail's proposal.</p>
	<p pid=".285W.0/3">The grant offer is conditional upon Network Rail securing an earlier exit from administration than would otherwise have been the case and reflects the benefits available from this earlier exit.</p>
	<p pid=".285W.0/4">Financial support of a type similar to that negotiated by Network Rail could be available to other bidders. The Government and the SRA are willing to discuss proposals advanced by any serious bidder for Railtrack plc. The guidelines issued by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State on <phrase class="date" code="2001-10-31">31 October 2001</phrase>, <phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2001-10-31.669W"><i>Official Report</i>, columns 669&ndash;71W</phrase>, make clear that any proposal should address the basis, extent and nature of support that will be required from Government. Any support would be subject to negotiation and agreement. No other detailed proposals have been received.</p>
	<p pid=".285W.0/5">The grant offer reflects the potential savings that can be delivered through an earlier exit from administration. This includes an earlier delivery of efficiency improvements; earlier improvements in network performance; avoiding any delay to the major projects identified in the SRA's Strategic Plan and an earlier end to the Government advisory costs associated with the administration.</p>
	<p pid=".285W.0/6">In addition, the Network Rail bid itself offers an early implementation of a company limited by guarantee structure. This structure offers a greater alignment of the operation of the network with the wider public interest, a potentially more efficient financing structure through debt finance company and a company that re-invests surpluses back into the railway network rather than distributing them as shareholder dividends.</p>

However, HSE is pursuing a number of initiatives aimed at reducing railway staff injuries, including initiatives aimed at reducing the exposure of trackside workers to the risk of being struck by a train. The Health and Safety Commission will shortly publish a strategy for improving health and safety on the railways. This identifies a number of key areas for improvement on which the HSE will focus in its contacts with employers, including trackside worker safety. HSE encourages the setting of health and safety targets in the railway industry.

	<p pid=".291W.2/1">In relation to <i>(a)</i> London Underground is currently a nationalised industry, in the public sector. When it transfers to the control of Transport for London it will remain in the public sector. The Secretary of State's current powers in relation to London Underground are largely set out in the London Regional Transport Act 1984. These include a power (section 32) to give directions of a general nature, but not to require particular services to be run.</p>
	<p pid=".291W.2/2">In relation to <i>(b)</i>, the Mayor has a general duty (section 141 of the Greater London Authority Act 2000) to promote and encourage safe, integrated, efficient and economic transport facilities and services to, from and within Greater London, and is required to publish a transport strategy setting out his proposals. The Secretary of State has powers (section 143) to issue directions to revise that transport strategy if it is inconsistent with national transport policy and that inconsistency is detrimental to any area outside Greater London.</p>
	<p pid=".291W.2/3">Currently the Secretary of State's consent is needed under the Railways Act 1993's Alternative Closure Procedure for the withdrawal of all underground services from a station. After the underground has come under the control of Transport for London the Mayor's consent will replace the Secretary of State's, but, in respect of services outside Greater London, will be subject to appeal to the Secretary of State (section 203&ndash;204 of the GLA Act and Schedule 5 of the Railways Act 1993).</p>

	<p pid=".294W.3/1">The United Kingdom's policy has been determined by the overriding need to ensure the long-term viability and effectiveness of the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC). It was clear that the Director-General of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) had lost the confidence of a significant number of the organisation's executive council. For this reason we concluded that the interests of the OPCW and the CWC would be best served if the Director-General were to be replaced by someone who could enjoy the full confidence of all states parties to the convention. The United Kingdom delegation to the Special Conference of States Parties, which convened on <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-21">21 April</phrase>, was guided by this position. The matter came to a vote at the Special Conference on <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-22">22 April</phrase>. The outcome was 48 votes in support of the termination of the Director-General's appointment, with seven votes against and 43 abstentions. The Director-General's appointment was therefore terminated with immediate effect.</p>

	<p pid=".294W.6/1">My right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary and I represented the UK at the fifth Ministerial Conference of the Euro-Mediterranean partnership process in Valencia. The meeting took place against a backdrop of high tension in the region. In these circumstances the presence of representatives of Israel, the Palestinian Authority and most neighbouring states was in itself a significant achievement. Ministers discussed the middle east peace process, noting their deep concern at the current situation, the serious threat it posed to regional security and the risk of a grave humanitarian crisis. My right hon. Friend held bilateral discussions with the Foreign Ministers of Israel and Egypt and with Nabil Sha'ath of the Palestinian Authority.</p>

Negotiations continue. Our aim remains, if possible, to reach agreement by the summer.</p>

	<p pid=".300W.6/2">Anyone aged 19 or over was able to open an individual learning account. Within the universal offer ILAs were targeted toward four key groups&mdash;young people aged 19&ndash;30 with few or no skills or qualifications, women returning to the labour market, the self-employed and non-teaching school staff. An advertising campaign between October and December 2000 concentrated on two of these groups&mdash;young people aged 19&ndash;30 with few or no qualifications and women returning to the labour market. The campaign used local and commercial radio and was supported by national and regional newspapers.</p>
	<p pid=".300W.6/3">In addition, further steps were taken to ensure the programme reached those in the target groups. The Department targeted self-employed/owner mangers through the small firm learning account (SFLA) pilot project. Over 200 small businesses actively participated in the pilot and 1,242 employees opened an ILA. From January 2001, the Department funded five ILA community projects in Liverpool, Sheffield, Kent and London and 3,279 accounts were opened. These projects placed particular emphasis on targeting hard to reach groups and the pilots were successful in engaging black and ethnic minority groups and people with no existing qualifications. The Department also worked with the TUC to engage groups of learners that were traditionally hard to reach through the Union Learning Fund and Learning Representatives. 79 per cent. of TUC ILA users were from priority groups, least likely to participate in learning.</p>

	<p pid=".301W.2/1">Funding for broadband connections to schools is administered through the Standards Fund. For 2001&ndash;02, this was set at &pound;42 million and for 2002&ndash;03 it will be &pound;70 million.</p>
	<p pid=".301W.2/2">Money from the fund is allocated to LEAs based on a formula. This formula takes account of the number of schools in the LEA and includes a sparsity weighting to recognise increased costs for rural areas. The funding is then pooled for spending by the Regional Broadband Consortia&mdash;the bodies tasked with planning and implementing broadband connections across England.</p>
	<p pid=".301W.2/3">The target for August 2002 is to have 20 per cent. of schools in England connected to broadband, including all secondary schools, at a minimum of 2 megabits per second. Targets for August 2003 are being agreed and we hope to announce these soon. The types of school to be connected include: primary, secondary, nursery, and special schools.</p>

	<p pid=".303W.6/1">There are two principal sources of support for young people taking vocational qualifications in schools or colleges, both administered by DfES. Further Education Learner Support Funds help students aged 16&ndash;19 who are from low income families or who face a particular financial difficulty. Payments are made to eligible students in school 6th forms and FE colleges for course related costs, including transport, child care, residential and hardship funding. In 2002&ndash;03, the Department increased overall discretionary support funding for young people in FE to &pound;54 million, an increase of &pound;10 million since 2000&ndash;01. It is not possible to say how much of this funding was received by young people studying for vocational qualifications.</p>
	<p pid=".303W.6/2">In addition to the Learner Support Fund, the Education Maintenance Allowance (EMA) is also available to young people in full-time further education in 56 pilot areas in England. In 2001&ndash;02, around &pound;100 million will have been spent in the 56 pilot areas, with anticipated spend for 2002&ndash;03 of &pound;156 million. Again, it is not possible to say how much of this funding was received by young people taking vocational courses.</p>
	<p pid=".303W.6/3">For young people in work-based training, which does not attract a wage, we provide support through the Minimum Training Allowance (MTA). The MTA is currently worth at least &pound;40 per week, although the local Learning and Skills Councils (LSCs) who administer MTA are able to pay higher local rates. In addition to weekly payments, local LSCs are also able to assist young people on MTA in difficult financial circumstances by giving additional help towards costs such as transport and the purchase of learning equipment etc.</p>
	<p pid=".303W.6/4">In all these cases, payment is made directly to the young person, with the exception of some of the EMA pilots where the option of payment to a parent or guardian is being trialed.</p>
	<p pid=".303W.6/5">Support for families is administered by the Department for Work and Pensions and the Inland Revenue. Child benefit and any child allowances paid with other benefits and tax credits are paid to families with children under 16, or to families with children over 16 but under 19 who are continuing in full-time non-advanced further education. The new child tax credit, to be introduced in April 2003, continues that practice.</p>

Matters such as anti-bullying and the discipline of the children attending the education provision in the accommodation centres may be provided in the agreement between the Home Secretary and the contractor. However, the education that will be provided for these children will mirror what they would get in schools.</p>

	<p pid=".306W.8/1">Following a public consultation, in March this year the Secretary of State announced plans to extend the availability of Parenting Orders to cover cases of non-criminal misbehaviour by pupils resulting in exclusions from school. We understand that the Home Office will issue a Criminal Justice White Paper in the late spring 2002 which will refer to the plans to extend Parenting Orders, probably by means of a Criminal Justice Bill in due course. Parenting Orders normally require parents to attend counselling or guidance sessions to help them cope better with their child's challenging behaviour and take more responsibility for that behaviour.</p>
	<p pid=".306W.8/2">The Department has already made clear that when necessary Headteachers can permanently exclude pupils responsible for serious disruption, violence or a threat of violence. We recently consulted on a revision to part of Circular 10&ndash;99 'Social Inclusion: Pupil Support'. This stated that the Secretary of State would not normally expect to see pupils excluded permanently for persistent defiant behaviour&mdash;which includes bullying, violence or sexual misconduct&mdash;reinstated at appeal.</p>

	<p pid=".307W.2/1">It is important that teachers are properly prepared for the range of special educational needs (SEN) they will encounter in schools. As part of their initial training, all student teachers must show that they understand their responsibilities under the SEN Code of Practice, and know how to seek advice. These skills are reinforced and developed during induction, when teachers have to demonstrate that they can plan effectively to meet the needs of pupils with SEN.</p>
	<p pid=".307W.2/2">Opportunities for continuing professional development for teachers in post are supported under the training component of the SEN category of the Department's Standards Fund, which provides grant aid to local education authorities and schools. &pound;91 million of supported expenditure is available for SEN in 2002&ndash;03. Training in dyslexia is specifically mentioned in the guidance for the category and this can range from awareness raising sessions to more in-depth specialist training. Grant support has also been made available to voluntary organisations and higher education training providers to create new training opportunities.</p>
	<p pid=".307W.2/3">Responsibility for ensuring that appropriate provision exists for children with SEN rests with the school and LEA. More than &pound;23 billion is available annually for the education of pupils, including children with SEN. Over &pound;1 billion of this is used by LEAs to provide additional support for children with SEN, including transport. When allocating budgets to schools in 2001&ndash;02, LEAs also identified over &pound;1.9 billion as allocated to SEN. However, it is for individual schools to decide how they spend this funding taking account of their statutory duties towards children with SEN.</p>

Also, many schools would have retained toilets adjacent to playing fields, and in some cases to serve temporary classrooms.</p>

I should clarify that the contractor could, depending on the terms of the contract with an LEA, determine to move from a three term year to a different arrangement, where such decisions lie with the LEA. In the case of foundation, foundation special and voluntary-aided schools, responsibility lies with the governing body. We believe that LEAs will want to ensure that clear arrangements about such decisions are contained in any relevant contract. We would expect there to be wide consultation and, if any change is to be made, that ample notice would be given so that parents, teachers and others can plan accordingly.</p>

	<p pid=".308W.5/1">The Government has contributed substantial financial support for Modern Apprenticeships (MAs), which provide craft, technological and business skills. Between 1997 and 2002 over &pound;3.7 billion has been allocated to Government-supported work-based learning, of which it is estimated that in excess of &pound;1 billion has been used to support MAs since 1997. As a result of this investment, the number of young people on MAs has risen from 75,000 in 1997 to over 220,000 today. We are investing an additional &pound;180 million over three years 2001&ndash;04 to support and further develop MAs, a clear sign of the importance we attach to their role in raising skills levels in the workplace, and in offering young people high quality vocational and work-related options for post-16 learning. The Government and the Learning and Skills Council (LSC) recently agreed a target of over a quarter of young people between the age of 16 and 21 entering MAs by 2004.</p>
	<p pid=".308W.5/2">In addition to direct funding of MAs, we assist businesses in other ways. For example, the LSC has a major role in raising skills levels and is active in improving employers' awareness of MAs. National Training Organisations (NTOs) have played an important role in developing apprenticeship frameworks to meet employer needs in their sector and promoting entry by young people; new Sector Skills Councils, supported by the Sector Skills Development Agency (SSDA) and the LSC, will provide an even stronger focus for employers to lead the development of apprenticeships linked to skills and productivity priorities and sector needs. Careers services and Connexions Partnerships work with young people to raise awareness of the apprenticeship route. The DTI small business service is also looking at ways to assist small businesses who want to employ MAs.</p>

	<p pid=".309W.8/1">The decision about how to provide for a child who has special educational needs (SEN) must be taken locally in the light of all the circumstances. Under the Education Act 1996, each local education authority (LEA) is under a duty to identify and make suitable provision for children's SEN and where necessary to make a statement. A statutory assessment can also be requested by parents who have the right to be involved with all the relevant professionals in decisions about meeting their child's needs.</p>
	<p pid=".309W.8/2">In 2000 (latest figures available) the overall level of children with statements in St. Helens LEA was 4.6 per cent. compared to the national rate of 3 per cent. The authority has set targets to reduce the number of statements it maintains and figures for January 2002 will be available later this year.</p>

	<p pid=".311W.2/2">The national curriculum for history clearly states that &quot;pupils should be taught to use dates and vocabulary relating to the passing of time, including ancient, modern, BC, AD, century and decade&quot;, and I would expect all local education authorities to be familiar with this statutory requirement. The terms CE (Common Era) and BCE (Before Common Era) are not used in the national curriculum, but schools are free to use them in addition to, but not as a replacement for, the traditional Christian dating system of BC and AD. There are no plans to change the existing statutory requirements.</p>

	<p pid=".312W.11/1">Chapter 2 of Treasury's Guidance &quot;Non-Departmental Public Bodies: Annual Reports and Accounts Guidance&quot; requires executive NDPBs to provide, as part of their annual reports, information about the performance and efficiency targets agreed with their sponsor Departments and performance against those targets. The information is to be given for the current year and the four previous years. All of the Department for Education and Skills executive NDPBs, which are: Adult Learning Inspectorate; British Educational Communications and Technology Agency; Construction Industry Training Board; Engineering Construction Industry Training Board; Higher Education Funding Council for England; Investors in People UK; Learning and Skills Council; National College for School Leadership; Qualifications and Curriculum Authority; Student Loans Company; and Teacher Training Agency, annual reports are available in the House Library. As the Construction Industry Training Board and Engineering Construction Industry Training Board are self funding we do not set them efficiency targets, however, the boards set themselves efficiency targets, the details and progress towards which are available in their annual reports. Our tribunal NDPBs are also self funding, so we set neither Special Educational Needs Tribunal nor Registered Inspectors Appeals Tribunal efficiency targets. The SENT annual reports are available in the House Library and RIAT has no permanent staff and has only met once since it was registered in 1992 so setting efficiency targets and producing annual reports seems inappropriate.</p>

	<p pid=".315W.5/3" class="indent">100 retailers in the city centre area have direct radio links to the police and there are plans to introduce similar systems in other parts of the city.

	<p pid=".315W.5/8">Local police continue to provide crime prevention surveys and advice. A recent prevention campaign targeted computer theft through leaflet distribution and press releases. Vehicle theft is being addressed through targeted campaigns such as the 'Look, Lock and Leave' initiative where advice signs will be erected in every car park in the city centre.</p>

Assistance is concentrated on rural livelihoods, health, education and governance. There has been a substantial shortfall in the country's 2002 maize harvest due to unusually heavy rains and flooding last year. Since January, DFID has provided &pound;4.6 million in food relief for distribution through local non- governmental organisations. We are helping Government with preparation of a medium term food security strategy and stand ready to provide more direct food aid when April/May harvest figures are clarified.</p>

	<p pid=".318W.0/1">Despite three years of drought and 23 years of conflict, basic health facilities, including hospitals and clinics, continue to operate in Afghanistan with the support of the humanitarian community. The improving security in recent months has facilitated the delivery of increasing quantities of medical relief items into Afghanistan and their distribution to areas of the greatest need. This has included the recent vaccination of around 6 million Afghan children against polio, and the rehabilitation of health facilities through quick impact projects funded by my Department.</p>
	<p pid=".318W.0/2">While immediate humanitarian needs remain a priority, the Afghan Interim Authority (AIA) has laid the foundations for a stronger health care system through the drafting of a National Development Framework, including a policy for reconstruction of the health sector, in partnership with the United Nations and assistance community. This focuses on equitable access to health care and will involve the construction of around 1,000 new health facilities around the country in coming months and years.</p>

The CPS has recently undergone a period of significant organizational change and, in the light of this change, is currently evaluating its future approach to the Better Quality Services Initiative.</p>
	<p pid=".321W.5/3">The legal services provided by the Treasury Solicitor's Department Agency have not been subject to review under the Better Quality Services Initiative. They were, however, subject to an executive agency Quinquennial Review during 2001 which looked at how those services could be better delivered. The main recommendations of the Review were accepted by the Attorney General and are now being implemented.</p>
	<p pid=".321W.5/4">The Serious Fraud Office does not provide services to the public within the terms of the Better Quality Services Initiative. However, it does actively manage its business processes and continually seeks to deliver efficiency gains across all its outputs. As an example, last year the office undertook a fundamental review of pay and reward structures and introduced pay progression and fluid grading.</p>

	<p pid=".322W.8/1">The Government are particularly concerned that the young and more vulnerable members of society should be protected from potentially harmful material.</p>
	<p pid=".322W.8/2">The general law underpins this approach. The Obscene Publications Act 1959 is the principal control on broadcast and published works, including material published via the internet, and makes it a criminal offence to publish any article which, in the view of the court, tends to &quot;deprave and corrupt&quot; those who are likely to read, see or hear it. In addition, under the Indecent Displays (Controls) Act 1981 it is an offence to display any indecent material in a public place or where it can be seen from a public place. In addition, where a publication does not fall under these controls, most newsagents abide by a voluntary code of practice, placing pornographic magazines on the top shelves and refusing to sell them to young people under 18.</p>
	<p pid=".322W.8/3">The internet, while offering many positive opportunities to children, presents a particular challenge in this area and the Government established a Task Force on Child Protection on the Internet in March 2001 with representatives from the internet industry, child welfare organisations, the police, the Government, the main opposition parties and others. The objectives of the task force include:</p>
	<p pid=".322W.8/4" class="indent">scoping new legislative measures specifically to tackle &quot;grooming&quot; of children by paedophiles online (and offline);</p>
	<p pid=".322W.8/5" class="indent">developing effective safeguards for children using the Internet and improved mechanisms for reporting online crimes and concerns about activity online; and</p>
	<p pid=".322W.8/6" class="indent">raising awareness of adults and children of how to surf the net and use chat rooms safely.</p>
	<p pid=".322W.8/7">The Government also support the development of robust and effective rating and filtering tools which can help parents to control their children's access to material on the net. We recently welcomed the launch of the Internet Content Rating Association (ICRA)'s free filtering software as a significant step forward in this area.</p>

	<p pid=".323W.5/1">There are no statistics available relating to the number of victims of vaginal rape who were transsexuals.</p>
	<p pid=".323W.5/2">Under existing sex offences legislation, rape is an offence perpetrated by a man against a man or a woman. It consists of non-consensual penetration of the vagina or anus. There has been at least one case where a court has held that penile penetration of a surgically reconstructed vagina does constitute rape, but the current law on rape is not clear on this point. Alternative charge could be indecent assault. The Government are currently considering a proposal made within the context of the Sex Offences Review, that the offence of rape should include surgically reconstructed male or female genitalia. This would make clear in statute what is currently a matter for judicial interpretation.</p>

	<p pid=".324W.0/1">Information is not available in the form requested. A study of 203 male prisoners aged 60 and over in 15 prisons in England and Wales (about one-fifth of that total population) conducted in 1999&ndash;2000, reported that one per cent. had a clinical diagnosis of dementia. All prisons and their local national health service (NHS) partners were asked jointly to complete prison health needs assessments by March 2001, with the implementation of improvements to health care provision, based on individual prison health plans, following from April 2002.</p>
	<p pid=".324W.0/2">Copies of the Department of Health's &quot;National Service Framework for Older People&quot; were issued to all Prison Service establishments in England in April 2001. The NSF proposes a move towards a single assessment process for older people's often wide range of health and social care needs. The accompanying Prison Service instruction advised governors that assessment of older prisoners should be comprehensive to ensure that they receive properly integrated, needs-based services both in prison and on release into the wider community. It required governors to develop their working relationships with local health services, social services and housing agencies in order to ensure that prisoners with continuing health and social needs get full access to all the services they need.</p>

	<p pid=".325W.3/1">The Government are committed to ensuring the effective resettlement of prisoners so as to reduce re-offending and protect the public. We know that prisoners are less likely to re-offend if they have stable accommodation to go to on release.</p>
	<p pid=".325W.3/2">Juveniles sentenced to a detention and training order are supervised on release by multi-agency youth offending teams, which can include housing specialists as well as social workers, probation officers and others. The teams work with local authority social services departments, which have accommodation responsibilities for juveniles under the Children Act 1989, and voluntary organisations to help secure accommodation for those unable to return to the family home.</p>
	<p pid=".325W.3/3">18 to 20-year-olds sentenced to custody are supervised on release by the National Probation Service. The service liaises with local authorities, housing associations, landlords and voluntary organisations to try to ensure the housing needs of released prisoners are met. Approved hostels can provide accommodation for those at higher risk of re-offending.</p>
	<p pid=".325W.3/4">The Homelessness Act 2002 contains provision to prevent the blanket exclusion by local authorities of released prisoners from social housing. A draft order has been published under the Housing Act 1996 which would extend homelessness priority needs groups to include those vulnerable as a result of a period within an institution, including prison. Further impetus to improve housing arrangements for young people leaving custody is likely to be given by the Social Exclusion Unit's current study on reducing re-offending by released prisoners, which will report later this year.</p>

	<p pid=".325W.6/1">Individually tailored programmes are run in all juvenile establishments according to the requirements of the young people held there. This means that a range of programmes are used by establishments to ensure that all individuals have the opportunity to address their offending behaviour. Programmes will be drawn from those accredited by the Joint Accreditation Panel, those being developed with a view to accreditation, those being developed in conjunction with the Youth Justice Board and those which are developed locally by the establishment to address specific needs.</p>
	<p pid=".325W.6/2">The Motivate Offenders to Rethink Everything (MORE) programme is an accredited programme that has been piloted with juveniles at Castington, Lancaster Farms and Wetherby young offender institutions. Staff in the majority of the other establishments that hold juveniles have been trained in the delivery of this programme and it is in the process of being rolled out to the rest of the juvenile estate. MORE is a motivational enhancement programme, which encourages young people to rethink the motivations behind their thoughts and actions.</p>
	<p pid=".325W.6/3">Enhanced Thinking Skills (ETS) is a 21 session cognitive-skills programme. This is an accredited programme which was developed on the basis that offenders may have poor thinking skills, which can adversely affect their ability to solve inter-personal problems and lead to an increased likelihood of offending. The programme aims to develop an individuals thinking skills. This programme is currently being delivered to juveniles in Brinsford, Lancaster Farms, Onley, Stoke Heath, Thorn Cross and Werrington young offender institutions.</p>
	<p pid=".325W.6/4">The Reasoning and Reacting programme (R and Ra) is a cognitive-skills programme specifically designed to meet the needs of juvenile offenders by encouraging them to consider the consequences of their behaviour and to think about the impact such behaviour may have on other people. This programme has recently been piloted at Huntercombe young offender institution although it is not being offered there at present.</p>
	<p pid=".325W.6/5">The Reasoning and Rehabilitation (R and R) programme is a 38 session cognitive skills programme. This is an accredited programme which is similar to ETS and the R and Ra. It is currently being delivered with juveniles at Wetherby young offender institution.</p>
	<p pid=".325W.6/6">The programme Stop-Think-Act-Reflect (STAR) is currently being piloted at Feltham young offender institution and is being funded by the Youth Justice Board. This is a cognitive behaviour programme designed to address specific criminogenic factors which modelling has shown to produce delinquent outcomes.</p>
	<p pid=".325W.6/7">Each establishment that holds juveniles also has a range of locally developed programmes that complement the programmes listed above and ensure that all areas of offending behaviour can be addressed. There are an extremely large number of these programmes, specifically designed by each establishment to address identified needs of the young people in their care. These include specific programmes to address alcohol education, anger control, drug use and illegal driving. The available programmes at any particular establishment are dependent on current need, which may change.</p>
	<p pid=".325W.6/8">Some of the establishments which hold juveniles also, on a different part of the site, hold young offenders. Because of this there are some offending behaviour programmes available in these establishments that are not delivered to juveniles.</p>

	<p pid=".328W.12/1">The Government are currently looking at the scope for a new set of sentencing guidelines under the auspices of a statutory body. The aim would be to build up a set of guidelines that would eventually embrace all types of offending, including wildlife offences, which would be easily accessible and command the respect of the judiciary, practitioners and the wider public. They will also help the courts in achieving greater consistency in sentencing thereby increasing public confidence in the criminal justice system.</p>

The assessment of the prisoner's current level of risk is the pre-eminent factor in determining whether he/she may be granted parole. Although denial makes it harder to conduct a risk assessment, it should still be possible to make one, taking into account, among other things, the prisoner's attitudes and behaviour during sentence. The Prison Service has to assume that the prisoner was rightly convicted. Prisoners who maintain their innocence are advised to contact the independent Criminal Cases Review Commission who are responsible for investigating alleged miscarriages of justice.</p>

	<p pid=".330W.6/4" class="indent">2. on examination of prisoners' files it may have been found that they were statutorily excluded from HDC because they were prisoners who have been previously returned to prison under section 40/116 of the Criminal Justice Act/Powers of Criminal Courts (sentencing) Act 2000;</p>
	<p pid=".330W.6/5" class="indent">3. they may not have had suitable accommodation arranged on their release. This includes accommodation where it is not possible to install the monitoring equipment due to insurmountable technical difficulties;</p>
	<p pid=".330W.6/6" class="indent">4. a small number of prisoners serving very short sentences may not have been released due to the lack of time to process their case; and</p>

	<p pid=".344W.3/2">The Disability Rights Commission (DRC) has responsibility for enforcement action by means of a formal investigation where it has reason to believe that a person has committed or is committing an unlawful act under the terms of the Disability Discrimination Act DDA, and any regulations made under it. It can also help individual disabled people secure their rights by, in some circumstances, providing legal assistance. The DRC also has responsibilities to provide information and advice to service providers, including pubs, about their obligations under the DDA and guidance on good practice. It prepares statutory codes of practice, runs a Helpline and undertakes general awareness raising initiatives. These activities complement the media campaigns run by the Government to raise awareness of the DDA.</p>

This scheme is administered by the Jobcentre Plus Disability Service, which maintains a database of employers using the symbol, who currently number around 5,000. The Disability Service updates the database with information from Disability Employment Advisers and compiles the National List of Disability Symbol Users, which gives details of all symbol users and the town or city in which they are located. All symbol users have signed a declaration agreeing that this information can be included on the list. Copies of the list are available to members of the public from their local Disability Employment Adviser.</p>

	<p pid=".347W.2/1">The provisions of S.I. 2002 No. 648 (The Social Security (Disability Living Allowance) (Amendment) Regulations 2002) now form part of the qualifying conditions for the lower rate mobility component of disability living allowance. They potentially affect any claims for the component which are based on fear or anxiety experienced when walking out of doors without guidance or supervision from another person on unfamiliar routes. About 200 people who are known to have qualified for the component as a result of the Tribunal of Social Security Commissioners decision R(D)4/2001, which gave rise to the need for the regulations, may well be affected, but this will depend on the individual circumstances of each claim. As explained in Command Paper 5469 published at the same time as the Regulations, longer-term estimates of people affected can only be made in very general terms.</p>

	<p pid=".350W.5/1">Health professionals and mental health services managers are expected to ensure that electro- convulsive therapy (ECT) is administered to patients in accordance with the guidance issued by the Royal College of Psychiatrists.</p>
	<p pid=".350W.5/2">In September 1998, the Chief Medical Officer and the President of the Royal College of Psychiatrists wrote to the chief executives of national health service trusts, consultant psychiatrists indicating the need to consider and improve standards of ECT administration in relation to ongoing developments in clinical governance.</p>
	<p pid=".350W.5/3">The college has a special committee on ECT and in 1995 it published detailed guidance entitled, &quot;The ECT Handbook&mdash;The Second Report of the Royal College of Psychiatrists' Special Committee on ECT&quot;. This is an important source of practical guidance for health professionals, mental health services managers and patients and includes sections on clinical guidelines; the use and administration of ECT; anaesthesia in ECT; the staffing and layout of ECT suites; matters relating to the law and consent. The appendices include, for example, nursing guidelines in relation to ECT and check lists for good practice in the provision of ECT services. The college is aware of the need to update this guidance and hopes to publish a revised handbook by the end of this year.</p>
	<p pid=".350W.5/4">The college has established plans to set up an ECT accreditation service and is initially planning to conduct some pilot visits. Currently the college undertakes regular accreditation visits for senior house officer (SHO) training schemes and ECT services are examined to some extent (because some SHOs seeking accreditation may administer ECT). The college's visiting accreditation teams reserve the right not to accredit that part of a particular training scheme if, for example, there is inadequate training and supervision of SHOs.</p>
	<p pid=".350W.5/5">The Mental Health Act Commission (MHAC) was set up to help safeguard the interests of all people detained under the Mental Health Act 1983. As part of its work in visiting detained patients MHAC commissioners routinely check on standards of ECT administration.</p>
	<p pid=".350W.5/6">As part of its ongoing programme of clinical governance reviews the Commission for Health Improvement carries out observations on services provided in hospitals of which ECT is a key area.</p>

	<p pid=".351W.2/2">The promotion of children's mental health and the prevention of mental ill-health in childhood are central to many Government programmes.</p>
	<p pid=".351W.2/3">The mental health national service framework has set mental health promotion as its first standard. The Department's mental health project team has recently published an &quot;update&quot; on this standard in which examples of good practice in the promotion of mental health of children and young people at school are described.</p>
	<p pid=".351W.2/4">The team is also involved in work to promote children's mental health within early years and school settings, including collaboration with the Department for Education and Skills on further initiatives to help schools promote mental health.</p>
	<p pid=".351W.2/5">To assist future policy development the Department commissioned a research project on the provision of children's mental health care within primary care. A report of the project has been received and arrangements for publication are being made by the research team.</p>

	<p pid=".358W.0/1">The most recent estimates currently available of the number of carers, including young carers, are contained in the report on Informal Carers by the Office for National Statistics published in 1995. A copy of the report is available in the Library. Further data were collected in the 2000 General Household Survey whose results are currently being collated by ONS. I understand that their report is likely to be available shortly. A question to aid the identification of carers was included in the 2001 census.</p>
	<p pid=".358W.0/2">Under section 17 of the Children Act social services departments can provide support and advice to young carers. We have prioritised services for young carers through the &pound;885 million Quality Protects programme and the National Strategy for Carers.</p>
	<p pid=".358W.0/3">The carers grant is &pound;85 million this year and it will increase to &pound;100 million in 2003&ndash;04 to ensure that more carers are able to receive breaks. We are consulting with external stakeholders on the Carers and Disabled Children (Vouchers) Regulations to be implemented this year. This will give local authorities power to issue vouchers for short term breaks. We are also revising the Hospital Discharge Workbook which gives guidance to the national health service, social services and other agencies on hospital discharge procedures. Improvements in GP computer systems completed at the end of March 2002 means that all GPs are able to record as part of patient record details whether a person is a carer. They are encouraged to do so in order to facilitate the process of sign-posting carers to relevant services. My hon.

Any potential future analysis would be carried out by the National Treatment Agency (NTA). This would most likely be made in consultation with the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE). Naltrexone (as described in the British National Formulary) is given as an 'adjunct' to prevent relapse so that cost-effectiveness would need to address the context of use. In general terms there is little evidence on how long naltrexone should be used to remain effective in rehabilitation so adequate data on cost-effectiveness for this indication is unlikely to be available at present.</p>

	<p pid=".366W.2/2">The Department is not funding any specific research of this nature.</p>
	<p pid=".366W.2/3">The Department has awarded a total of nearly &pound;1 million over the three years 2001&ndash;02 to 2003&ndash;04 to Age Concern (England), Help the Aged, and the British Red Cross Society. This is being used to develop local intermediate care projects, which provide practical help through volunteers to ensure that older people's own homes are safe and comfortable, in order to prevent hospital admission or to facilitate discharge from hospital. The Home Office Active Community Unit has matched this funding.</p>
	<p pid=".366W.2/4">A number of Health Action Zones have funded systems to enable health professionals to refer patients suffering from the effects of cold housing, including patients to be discharged from hospital, for help with heating and insulation. In August 2001, the Department of Health funded publication by National Energy Action of &quot;Affordable Warmth and Health Action Zones, a Good Practice Guide&quot;, which describes these projects.</p>
	<p pid=".366W.2/5">The Department funds the 'Keep Warm, Keep Well' campaign each winter. In the winter of 2001&ndash;02, this involved distribution of over 2.3 million leaflets, information packs for healthcare professionals, and a national telephone advice line to enable eligible older people and other groups to claim grants for insulation and heating and benefits.</p>

Analysis suggested this would probably cost at least &pound;700 million and would be unlikely to work in practice. The Government therefore proposed that for an initial period, perhaps seven years, all newly appointed consultants would be restricted from undertaking similar work outside the NHS. After this initial period the right to undertake private practice would depend on fulfilling job plans and NHS service requirements. The concept of a maximum part-time contract would be abolished.

	<p pid=".373W.2/3">Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) provide information on in-patient care delivered by national health service hospitals in England and are compiled from data sent by over 300 NHS trusts. The HES database includes information about the treatment of private patients in NHS hospitals. Information from HES may be downloaded free of charge from <a href="http://www.doh.gov.uk/hes">www.doh.gov.uk/hes</a>.</p>
	<p pid=".373W.2/4">The Service and Financial Framework Return (SaFFR) is the mechanism for monitoring the delivery of all NHS targets in the NHS Plan and the NHS Plan Implementation Programme. Data are collected quarterly from primary care trusts and include data on all NHS-funded activity, whether or not it takes place in NHS hospitals.</p>
	<p pid=".373W.2/5">Some elements within the SaFFR ask for information that distinguishes activity carried out within the NHS from activity commissioned from non-NHS organisations. However, no information is collected solely in relation to activity in private hospitals (as distinct from other independent provider organisations). The Department has also carried out a survey of NHS health authorities and trusts on the acute elective activity they commissioned from the independent sector last year, and will make available key results shortly.</p>

With the shift in the balance of power to the frontline, PCTs (subject to legislation) will lead the development of a local health improvement and modernisation plan that will inform the development of local services. PCTs have a legal duty and freedom to secure the provision of locally relevant, high quality services for the populations they serve. By engaging front-line clinicians in decision making, PCTs will be in a position to ensure better informed commissioning agreements are reached with acute providers.</p>

The diabetes NSF delivery strategy is due to be published in 2002 and work is in hand on NSFs for renal services, childrens' services and long term conditions. These frameworks amount to a significant programme of quality improvement across the national health service. We have no plans to amend the programme at present.</p>
