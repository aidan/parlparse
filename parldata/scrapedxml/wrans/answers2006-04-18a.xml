	<p pid="a.1W.3/1">Normally the findings of a Board of Inquiry are not open to appeal and there is no statutory appeal mechanism within the Air Force Act 1955. However a person subject to air force law who thinks himself wronged in relation to any matter relating to his Service may, by virtue of section 180 Air Force Act 1955, submit a Redress of Complaint through the chain of command to the Air Force Board acting as the Defence Council. Any airman so affected, by the findings of a Board, could lodge such a Redress but the complaint must normally have been lodged within three months of the commission of the wrong complained of. A decision of the Air Force Board is susceptible to judicial review proceedings in the High Court.</p>
	<p pid="a.1W.3/2">Secondly, and extra-regulationally, if new and significant evidence became available, in relation to an accident, which might have a bearing on issues of causation, and at the sole discretion of the Convening Authority, it would be open to the Convening Authority to re-open the BOI for the Board to reconsider its findings in the light of any new and compelling evidence.</p>

By the end of 2006, we expect most of the 10 divisions of the Iraqi Army to be taking the lead in areas of their responsibility, albeit with coalition support such as planning and logistics.

Government Ministers attended the NATO Heads of State and Government Summit in June 2004 which directed that work on theatre ballistic missile defence should be taken forward by NATO. Subsequent meetings of NATO Defence Ministers have noted progress reports on theatre and territorial missile defence without substantive discussion.</p>

	<p pid="a.10W.5/2">Pakistan is critical to achieving many of HMG's international objectives, including counter-terrorism, counter-narcotics, counter-proliferation, regional stability, managed migration, human rights and engagement with the Islamic world. Allied to this is the United Kingdom's commitment to the international security assistance force in Afghanistan, which is dependent on Pakistani support for the provision of a logistical line of communication from Karachi, as well as permission for RAF overflights.</p>
	<p pid="a.10W.5/3">Traditionally, the UK has enjoyed a warm defence relationship with Pakistan and this has deepened in recent years. In 2005&ndash;06 we provided in the region of &pound;750,000 of defence assistance by way of training and liaison opportunities as part of the Defence Relations Activity Programme. Much of this activity, which includes meetings in Pakistan between senior Ministry of Defence and Pakistani officials, is facilitated by the defence adviser in our high commission in Islamabad.</p>
	<p pid="a.10W.5/4">Finally, the Ministry of Defence provided substantial assistance to the Government of Pakistan following the disastrous earthquake in Northern Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir in October 2005. Included in a package of assistance was three Chinook heavy lift helicopters deployed for one month to deliver much needed humanitarian aid to remote areas, and a Royal Marines commando engineer squadron deployed from November 2005 to February 2006 to build shelters for those whose homes had been destroyed. Both missions received much praise and recognition from the Pakistani Government and those affected by the earthquake.</p>

Aside from mobilised service, volunteer reserve service does not attract entitlement to an armed forces pension because the terms and conditions of service are entirely different from those of the regulars. It attracts payment of an annual bounty in recognition of the different nature of the commitment.

The Ministry of Defence has conducted environmental impact assessments of marine habitats in which Sonar 2087 might operate. These assessments indicated that the use of Sonar 2087, as with underwater sound generally, has the potential to impact on the marine environment. A range of rigorous mitigation measures have been developed to minimise this and they are integral to Royal Navy operating procedures. There have been no recorded incidents of harm being caused to marine life by Sonar 2087. We continue to support a sustained programme of research into the effects of active sonar.</p>

	<p pid="a.17W.6/1">Officials at the Veterinary Medicines Directorate (VMD) are well aware of the concerns expressed by beekeepers and horticulturists. The VMD recently invited the Chairman of the British Beekeepers Association to speak to a meeting of regulatory scientists and Commission officials organised as part of the UK Presidency to ensure they were aware of the UK's concerns.</p>
	<p pid="a.17W.6/2">The European Commission consulted on a proposed Commission Decision on the prescription only medicine (POM) exemption criteria from <phrase class="date" code="2006-02-09">9 February</phrase> until <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-17">17 March 2006</phrase>. The draft is available on the Commission website at <a href="http://pharmacos.eudra.org/F2/pharmacos/new.htm.TheproposalexemptsproductsthathavearecognisedlevelofsafetyincludingthosecontainingsubstancesthathavebeenenteredintoAnnexIIofCouncilRegulationEEC/2377/90">http://pharmacos.eudra.org/F2/pharmacos/new.htm. The proposal exempts products that have a recognised level of safety including those containing substances that have been entered into Annex II of Council Regulation EEC/2377/90</a>. Although the proposal does not mention any species specifically, most medicines authorised to treat bees in the UK would be included under them and therefore be exempt from the POM requirements. The proposal and the comments received were discussed during a meeting of the Commission's Veterinary Pharmaceutical Committee on <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-27">27 March</phrase>. However, the Commission has not given any indication of how they will revise their proposal.</p>
	<p pid="a.17W.6/3">UK officials at the meeting pressed the Commission to bring forward the Decision in good time before the <phrase class="date" code="">31 December</phrase> deadline.</p>
	<p pid="a.17W.6/4">Officials at the VMD have also continued discussions with the beekeepers on alternative arrangements should the U K not succeed in being able to exempt all bee medicines under the criteria. New distribution categories for the UK have been introduced that include tiered categories of prescription only medicines. The new distribution categories are contained in the Veterinary Medicines Regulations 2005. The Regulations comply with the Directive's provisions while allowing veterinary medicines for food-producing animals that were previously available in the UK without prescription to be supplied by pharmacists or suitably qualified persons working in pet shops, agricultural merchants or saddlers without the need to involve a veterinary surgeon.</p>

	<p pid="a.18W.2/1">Under EU legislation, routine TB testing is carried out annually or biennially in parishes with a historically higher number of bovine TB incidents in cattle. This is reduced to testing every four years in parishes with historically low or no TB incidents. TB reactors are removed for slaughter and the owner is compensated using a new table-based valuation system, which was introduced on <phrase class="date" code="2006-02-01">1 February</phrase>. The rest of the herd are placed under movement restrictions.</p>
	<p pid="a.18W.2/2">In addition, we introduced compulsory pre-movement testing of cattle in England on <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-27">27 March</phrase>, which will help to reduce the risk of spreading TB through cattle movements. The legislation applies to cattle over 15 months of age moving from one and two-year tested herds. It will be extended to movements of cattle over 42-days-old on <phrase class="date" code="">1 March 2007</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.18W.2/3">Improved diagnosis of TB in cattle is a major objective of Defra's wide-ranging research programme. The laboratory-based gamma-interferon test is not sufficiently specific to replace the TB test but use of the two tests in parallel has the potential to significantly increase the detection of infected cattle in herds where TB has been confirmed. Preparations are being made for wider use of the gamma interferon test in prescribed circumstances.</p>
	<p pid="a.18W.2/4">In this country, the main wildlife reservoir of bovine TB is in badgers. A public consultation on both the principle and method of a badger culling policy in areas of high TB incidence in cattle was launched on <phrase class="date" code="2005-12-15">15 December 2005</phrase>. This has now closed and we received more than 35,000 responses. These responses will be analysed carefully over the coming weeks to inform decisions alongside other available evidence.</p>

	<p pid="a.27W.5/1">There are currently no plans to integrate the Forestry Commission England with Natural England, and no formal research has, therefore, been commissioned into these aspects. However, Defra is working with the Forestry Commission in England and the Natural England Partnership to identify opportunities for greater collaborative working between those two bodies by aligning their activities and services, including management of the public forest estate, in order to provide a better service for their customers and the environment.</p>
	<p pid="a.27W.5/2">On the delivery of grants, we are working to bring together into a single 'Environmental Land Management Fund' all the funding streams for the protection and enhancement of our countryside, woods and forests, including the Forestry Commission's grants for private woodlands and those grants that are currently delivered by the Natural England confederate partners. The fund will provide a clearer and simpler framework for applicants that will be better targeted to maximise outcomes. As part of this project, we are reviewing all current schemes, run by the two bodies, to ensure a good fit with the new funding framework.</p>

	<p pid="a.29W.5/2">Defra is concerned about the potential threat that the non-native top mouth gudgeon may pose to native species. Under Section 30 of the Salmon and Freshwater Fisheries Act 1975, persons wishing to introduce fish into inland unenclosed waters in England and Wales require the consent of the Environment Agency; such consent is never given in respect of top mouth gudgeon. In addition, persons wishing to keep these fish in enclosed waters require a licence to do so, issued under the terms of the Prohibition of Keeping or Release of Live Fish (Specified Species) Orders made under the Import of Live Fish Act 1980. The licences are issued by the Fish Health Inspectorate at Cefas, Weymouth and enforced by them and by the Environment Agency. We recognise that tighter controls are necessary but their introduction would require primary legislation on which work is currently in hand.</p>
	<p pid="a.29W.5/3">The Environment Agency, through its fisheries monitoring programmes, surveys some 1,400 freshwater sites annually and enlist the help of anglers to establish the presence of non-native species including the top mouth gudgeon. They also operate eradication programmes to remove non-native species where this is practical and the fish concerned pose a threat to native populations.</p>
	<p pid="a.29W.5/4">Defra is funding research at Cefas into the infectious disease known as the &quot;rosette-like agent&quot; under an emerging aquatic diseases risk and awareness project. We have commissioned a further three year research project at the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology on the prevalence and impact of the rosette-like agent.</p>

	<p pid="a.31W.5/1">Mobile phones are a good example of widely used products where much has already been done&mdash;by producers and consumers&mdash;to reduce waste. However, more can and should be done to reduce the impacts of waste disposal at each stage of the product cycle. This is consistent with the direction we are proposing in our recent consultation document on a revised waste strategy for England.</p>
	<p pid="a.31W.5/2">Defra is working closely with the DTI on the implementation of the EU Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) Directive, which will make producers financially responsible for the treatment and recycling of electronic equipment, including mobile phones, when it becomes waste. In particular, Defra are taking forward the development of Regulations transposing the treatment and permitting requirements of the Directive, which are intended to improve the environmental performance of operators directly involved in the treatment of WEEE.</p>
	<p pid="a.31W.5/3">In addition, Defra are also working with DTI on the implementation of the EU RoHS (Restriction of the use of certain Hazardous Substances in electrical and electronic equipment) Directive. From <phrase class="date" code="">1 July 2006</phrase>, the RoHS Regulations will restrict the use of six substances in the manufacture of mobile phones and other electrical and electronic equipment, meaning that they will be easier to treat and recycle when they become waste.</p>

	<p pid="a.32W.2/1">While the Government have not given any grants to businesses directly, the Government funded Waste Resources Action Programme (WRAP), set up an &pound;8 million Waste Minimisation Innovation Fund in November 2004 to support research and development projects that focus on reducing the impact of packaging on the environment, for example, by reducing the amount of packaging that goes to landfill.</p>
	<p pid="a.32W.2/2">To date 28 projects have been approved for funding and &pound;4.1 million has been distributed. Funding has been awarded to companies such as Tesco, Sainsbury's, Argos, Coca-Cola, Proctor and Gamble, Marks and Spencer, Britvic and Heinz to run.</p>
	<p pid="a.32W.2/3">Trials to research new and existing opportunities for biodegradable packaging and investigate the use of re-usable packaging are currently underway. Other trials aim to minimise the amount of plastic used in containers, glass in bottles and metals in cans and to look at ways of incorporating recycled plastic into drinks containers. It has been estimated that over 500,000 tonnes of packaging could be prevented each year if the research proves successful and the initiatives are taken up across the retail sector.</p>
	<p pid="a.32W.2/4">The projects are set-up in such a way to ensure that WRAP maintains all intellectual property rights on the findings, ensuring no competitive advantage is gained by participants in the scheme and that any innovations that are developed can be made available to all.</p>
	<p pid="a.32W.2/5">Additionally WRAP are currently conducting a technical advice programme, looking at opportunities for so called &quot;pack-less packaging&quot; which, among other things, will explore the potential for refill and self-dispensing systems in the retail sector. Such initiatives could offer significant benefits in terms of packaging reduction as well as financial savings for both customers and retailers.</p>

	<p pid="a.35W.2/1">The definition of waste in force in the UK is that in Article 1(a) of the Waste Framework Directive (as amended). When the definition was brought into force in May 1994 guidance on its interpellation was provided in DOE Circular 11/94 (Annex 2).

It will be necessary for the Department also to publish guidance on the 2006 regulations and as soon as this has been done resources will be allocated to the completion of the revised guidance on the interpretation of the definition of waste. Our aim, therefore, is to engage with external stakeholders on the revised guidance on the definition of waste later in the spring.</p>

Ofwat has carried out three reviews of price limits and at each review has set a price limit for each company for each of the following five years. Ofwat set price limits in 1994 and 2004 that allowed increases in the two five-year periods that followed, but it set price limits at the 1999 review that required companies to reduce prices in 2000. Ofwat last set price limits in December 2004, allowing price rises for the five years 2005 to 2010.</p>

Its purpose is to bring together key water industry stakeholders to promote the efficient use of water in households as part of the wider effort to ensure the long term sustainability of the water supply. It is not a response to the shorter term problems of drought in the South East, but seeks to contribute to demand management in the long term.</p>

Between meetings, work is co-ordinated and assessed by a working group of representatives of all the Group members. The working group is led by the Director, Water in Defra and has met twice since last October.</p>

This is chiefly because the Department inherited a large number of contracts at the time that HMCS was created in April 2005. The Capita Group plc has many subsidiaries, some of which have no obvious connection to the holding company and it is possible that a relevant contact may not have been identified as such. Confirming the complete list of contracts with Capita Group plc and its subsidiaries could be achieved only at disproportionate cost.</p>

	<p pid="a.41W.2/4">DCA is committed to making the best use of available technology to support the work of the criminal justice system. We are nearing completion of a programme to install a modern IT infrastructure in the Crown court which will provide the platform to deliver new IT systems as part of the HMCS modernisation programme. The first IT system to run on the new infrastructure is XHIBIT (exchanging hearing information by internet technology), which sends hearing information from the courtroom to victims, witnesses, and other criminal justice organisations within minutes. This system is on target to be rolled out to all Crown court centres by March this year. A new audio-visual system is now under trial in Liverpool. This is able to present audio and visual evidence in court from any source, analogue or digital. The system can also handle several tasks at once, allowing it to videoconference between courtroom and a witness while simultaneously displaying evidence to both.</p>

	<p pid="a.55W.0/1">In the period since our response to the west midlands to north west conurbations multi-modal study in December 2002, approximately &pound;4.5 million has been spent on preliminary design work, stakeholder engagement and other planning activities on improving capacity on the M6 between Birmingham and Manchester. It is not possible to provide a detailed breakdown of the total at the present time.</p>
	<p pid="a.55W.0/2">The total cost of the west midlands to north west conurbations multi-modal study was &pound;2 million. This figure includes costs relating to public consultation exercises that were undertaken as part of the study.</p>

	<p pid="a.55W.3/1">In the summer and autumn of 2004 the Department undertook a consultation, 'M6: Giving motorists a choice', on the concept of building a new tolled expressway to run parallel with the M6, as an alternative to widening the existing M6 between Birmingham and Manchester (junction 11A to junction 19).</p>
	<p pid="a.55W.3/2">The consultation sought views on whether the Government should ask the Highways Agency to carry out more detailed development work and a feasibility study on the option of an expressway. Approximately 9,500 responses were received from a range of stakeholders. The responses were carefully analysed and a breakdown was placed in the Library of the House on <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-19">19 July 2005</phrase>, when I announced the outcome of the initial consultation and the Secretary of State's decision to ask the Highways Agency to undertake further work in parallel on both the expressway and widening options.</p>
	<p pid="a.55W.3/3">As part of the option evaluation work currently in progress, the Highways Agency has been engaging with a wide range of representative stakeholder bodies, including the statutory environmental agencies. The Agency has organised eight meetings with stakeholders since the beginning of the year, including three well attended seminars, and two further meetings are currently planned for April. The discussions and written feedback will form part of the data to be used to inform a ministerial decision on the option to be taken forward. Formal public consultation would form part of the next stage of scheme development.</p>
	<p pid="a.55W.3/4">In addition to comments made during discussions, a total of 141 representations in the form of feedback sheets, letters and e-mails have been received from stakeholders to date.</p>

	<p pid="a.67W.3/1">The Department has not made any precise estimates of the total value of corporate sponsorship at elite and grassroots level. However, commercial sponsorship is expected to contribute in the region of &pound;100 million between now and 2012 in supporting British elite athletes. Further discussions are taking place about how much of this will need to be raised each year to supplement the &pound;200 million allocated to elite sport by the Exchequer, as announced in the Budget.</p>
	<p pid="a.67W.3/2">The Chancellor of the Exchequer also announced that the Government have allocated &pound;34.5 million over the next two years to the National Sports Foundation (NSF) in England. This will play an important role in raising commercial sponsorship for grassroots sport. The NSF has been challenged to match the Government's allocation with private investment.</p>
	<p pid="a.67W.3/3">Sportsmatch, established in 1992 and Exchequer funded through Sport England, will continue to raise commercial sponsorship for grassroots projects, across Olympic and non-Olympic sports, to a maximum award of &pound;50,000.</p>

In ensuring that we meet the challenge, it is essential that we provide a climate in which the potential weight of private sector investment can be brought to bear, including through public private partnerships (PPP). In 2005, a total of &pound;66.5 million was awarded in Private Finance Initiative (PFI) credits by DCMS for community facilities. To date a total of &pound;182.17 million of PFI credits have been awarded to 14 local authorities for sport and leisure facilities. The 4ps are currently undertaking a project to evaluate the success of sport and leisure PFI projects. This is due to be published in May 2006. In addition, the Audit Commission has undertaken a study into local authority sports facilities management which, among other things, looks at the effectiveness of PPP in delivering local authority leisure services.</p>

	<p pid="a.69W.9/1">There is already significant community access to privately owned sports facilities and the Government are keen to promote this further. Through the National School Sport Strategy, we are encouraging links between independent schools and the network of School Sport Partnerships. This includes, where appropriate, the sharing of facilities. Both Sport England and local authorities are looking at ways of building community access into their plans for sports facilities at the local level. Access to good quality sports facilities is essential if we are to encourage people to lead healthier, more active lives. This is why we have a commitment that people should be no more than 20 minutes away (walking distance in urban areas and driving distance in rural areas) from a range of good quality facilities. The Active Places database lists publicly available sports facilities across the whole of England covering both public and private sector facilities.</p>

Of these: 288 were sentenced to 10 days administrative arrest; 112 sentenced to 15 days administrative arrest; 53 were minors released without charge: and 21 were foreign nationals, 14 of whom were sentenced from 3&ndash;14 days administrative arrest. Unofficial sources suggest however that the number of arrests may be significantly higher, with estimates for the total number of arrests ranging from 700&ndash;1200, possibly including foreign nationals. It is not clear how many of these remain in detention. This number includes Aleksander Kozulin (now released), an opposition leader and presidential candidate, political activists, members of non governmental organisations, journalists and members of the public who were protesting about the results of an election which was not free and fair. It is not clear how many of those recently arrested remain in detention.</p>

	<p pid="a.72W.11/1">I apologise to the hon. Member for the delay in replying. Resources at embassies, high commissions and other Foreign and Commonwealth Office posts overseas are regularly shifted in response to changing priorities. Changes may be made in response to local factors, but the overall approach is guided by the UK's International Priorities. This has led to increases in resources for visa and consular work and also a move of staff to key posts outside Europe, including China, India and Pakistan, while also meeting new demands in Iraq and Afghanistan. We have deployed new region-wide advisers on issues such as conflict and energy.</p>

Other posts may also have had changes in staffing (i.e. increases in one area offset by reductions elsewhere) but these could not be picked up. I am sending the hon. Member a copy of the details available from this exercise and placing a copy in the Library. It should be emphasised that this data is provisional.</p>

	<p pid="a.74W.8/1">We have regular discussions with the Government of Colombia, both bilaterally and as part of the EU and other groupings, about these issues. We have consistently urged the Colombians to adopt a comprehensive legal framework for the process of disarmament, demobilisation and re-integration (DDK) of the illegal armed groups. In October 2005, the EU General Affairs Council concluded that the adoption by the Colombian Congress of the Justice and Peace Law was a significant development, since it provides an overall legal framework for DDK in Colombia. The Council noted that it had many concerns over the law, but it believed that if the law was effectively and transparently implemented it would make a positive contribution to the search for peace in Colombia. We will continue to work with our partners to help the Government of Colombia to address the challenges these issues present. For example, EU Missions in Bogota are currently examining their project assistance to Colombia to ensure that it complements the aim of effective and transparent implementation of the Justice and Peace Law and is consistent with UN human rights recommendations.</p>

	<p pid="a.75W.5/1">As President of the EU, the UK was instrumental in drawing up the EU Ministerial Council Conclusions of October 2005 that encouraged the Government of Colombia to consider a mid-year review of progress in implementing the UN human rights recommendations with its partners. During our Presidency, our Embassy in Bogota organised meetings for EU Member States with the Colombia office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to review progress on all of its human rights recommendations arising from its annual reports. More recently, we and other partners have continued to meet with Government representatives to look at how efforts to implement these recommendations are being taken forward. We will continue to take this work forward with like-minded partners.</p>

The EU is actively involved in a working group that has been established in Bogota for this purpose. The EU Council Conclusions set out EU policy and support to the Government of Colombia, and included reference to the implementation of the recommendations.

	<p pid="a.79W.0/18">It is a condition of employment that members of the Diplomatic Service must be prepared to serve anywhere in the world at any time during their career, sometimes at very short notice. Those with children also have the legal obligation as parents to ensure that their children receive a full-time education from the age of 5 years. The FCO's provisions for children's education are intended to help staff meet these potentially conflicting obligations.</p>
	<p pid="a.79W.0/19">Children who accompany their parents on postings overseas are expected to use free state schooling if it is available locally and is of a suitable standard. But at posts where no suitable schooling is available free-of-charge locally, education fees can be refunded to enable children to receive the education they would be entitled to in the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.79W.0/20">With staff moving every 12&ndash;48 months and education facilities at Posts' locations overseas varying, continuity of education can be problematic particularly during the important exam years. The FCO's provisions address this problem by enabling children to board at school in the UK while their parents remain subject to the worldwide mobility obligation.</p>

	<p pid="a.79W.3/1">The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) does not categorise expenditure down to this level of detail in its accounts. In addition, the FCO delegates budgets for such equipment to individual internal departments and does not therefore hold a centralised record of such purchases. The information requested for the whole of the Department, including our posts abroad, could therefore be provided only at disproportionate cost.</p>
	<p pid="a.79W.3/2">For Private Offices, a total of 15 televisions are held, including seven in my suite of offices, including those of the special advisers and security attachment. There are two in each of the other Private Offices.</p>
	<p pid="a.79W.3/3">The Television Licensing Agency have advised my officials that, where a Government Department uses televisions for business purposes, they are exempt from the need for a television licence. Where televisions are used for recreational purposes, they need a single licence for each site at which they are located. The FCO therefore holds two television licences, one for the site at Hanslope Park and one for the main building site in King Charles Street.</p>

In the previous 12 months, the Queen has visited Canada (May 2005) and Malta (November 2005).</p>

This is consistent with Russia's desire to diversify gas exports and customers. President Putin stressed at the time of the announcement that Russia would continue to meet all its delivery requirements to European customers. More generally, the agreement reflects strengthening trade, economic and energy co-operation and bilateral links between China and Russia. Diversification of China's energy portfolio towards greater use of gas as a cleaner energy source and as a substitute for coal is good for climate change reasons.</p>

	<p pid="a.90W.5/1">The overall security situation in Sierra Leone is generally calm, but fragile. The situation had sufficiently improved to allow the full departure of the UN peacekeeping force, the United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone, at the end of 2005. There has been progress on improving the training, leadership and professionalism of the Sierra Leone Army and Police forces. A UK-led International Military Assistance and Training Team has aided much of this reform by close co-operation with the Army and will remain in Sierra Leone until at least 2010. They currently have approximately 100 personnel in country. We have also provided support to the police in a training and reform programme, which has left them better able to deal with internal security.</p>

	<p pid="a.92W.2/1">During the recent election campaign, President Museveni stated that it was his opinion that the international community should share the responsibility for some of the problems currently facing Uganda. We disagree.</p>
	<p pid="a.92W.2/2">The long-running conflict in northern Uganda is the result of a vicious insurgency by the Lord's Resistance Army. The Government of Uganda has primary responsibility for addressing the conflict and protecting and providing for those displaced by it.

	<p pid="a.92W.2/3">The current extended three year period of drought in the region, coupled with reports of over-abstraction of water from Lake Victoria to generate power, have dramatically reduced the availability of power supply in Uganda leading to massive load shedding.</p>

The major export crop is coffee, with some revival of tea, tobacco and cotton production. There is a modest manufacturing and tourism sector and relatively new development of horticulture.

	<p pid="a.95W.8/1">Representations were made to the Government of Zimbabwe in 2001, when BBC World Service reporters were first removed. Our embassy in Harare lobbied the Government of Zimbabwe in 2004, demanding the BBC's accreditation during the English cricket tour of Zimbabwe, while in parallel, my right hon. Friend the then Minister for Europe (Denis MacShane) summoned the Zimbabwean ambassador on the same issue. My hon. Friend the then Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs (Chris Mullin) also protested directly to the Zimbabwean ambassador about the pre-election crackdown on the media, including a removal of a BBC journalist, in February 2005.</p>
	<p pid="a.95W.8/2">Most recently on <phrase class="date" code="2006-02-01">1 February</phrase>, our embassy raised our concerns about the increasing restrictions and pressure on independent and foreign journalists with the Government of Zimbabwe. We also take every opportunity to raise our concerns about the lack of press freedom and respect for human rights in Zimbabwe with African leaders.</p>

	<p pid="a.96W.2/1">This Government take every opportunity to raise its concerns about the continued abuse of fundamental human rights by the government in Zimbabwe. We are working with the EU and other international partners to build pressure on the Zimbabwean government to respect its obligations, including upholding all the Articles enshrined in the UN Declaration on Human Rights.</p>
	<p pid="a.96W.2/2">We have succeeded in placing Zimbabwe on the UN Security Council agenda, and the EU recently rolled over sanctions for a further year, from February 2006, in response to the continued abuse of human rights in Zimbabwe.</p>
