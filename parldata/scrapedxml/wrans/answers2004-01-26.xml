	<p pid=".1W.3/1">English Nature advises that there are likely to be in the region of 300,000 to 400,000 badgers in Great Britain. This figure is derived from a National Badger Survey which took place in the mid-1990s.</p>
	<p pid=".1W.3/2">The survey also reported that there had been a 77 per cent. increase in badger numbers between the mid-1980s and mid-1990s. The increasing number of applications received by Defra for licences under the Protection of Badgers Act 1992 (up 50 per cent. since 1999) suggest that this trend is continuing.</p>
	<p pid=".1W.3/3">Badgers densities are highest in the south-west of England, with high densities present throughout southern counties, the west midlands and Wales.</p>
	<p pid=".1W.3/4">The Department has been funding the Winter Mammal Monitoring Project which is being carried out by the Mammal Society and the British Trust for Ornithology. This is a pilot study intended to develop a multi-species terrestrial mammal monitoring system. The project is still at the pilot stage&mdash;but is intended in the future to provide valuable data on the abundance of mammal species, including badgers. Early findings confirm the pattern of distribution report in the National Badger Survey.</p>
	<p pid=".1W.3/5">Full details of the badger survey findings are published in: &quot;Changes in the British badger population, 1988 to 1997&quot; by G. Wilson, S. Harris and G. McLaren (1997), published by the People's Trust for Endangered Species (ISBN 1 85580 018 7).</p>

	<p pid=".1W.6/1">A Raptor Working Group was set up in 1995, jointly chaired by the DETR and the Joint Nature Conservation Committee, following increasing</p>
	<p pid=".1W.6/2">concerns from grouse moor owners and racing pigeon fanciers over the impact of rising raptor populations on bird numbers. The recommendations from the Raptor Working Group's final report, published in 2000, provides the basis for and inform efforts to find an effective and acceptable solution to the problems caused by birds of prey.</p>
	<p pid=".1W.6/3">Work is now being taken forward by the country conservation agencies, and other organisations. In addition, English Nature has signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the Moorland Association on addressing the issue of raptor predation in the uplands.</p>
	<p pid=".1W.6/4">Implementation of the Working Group's report's recommendations in Scotland and Wales is a matter for the devolved Administrations. A paper on progress in implementing the recommendations of the Raptor Working Group Report was presented to the Joint Nature Conservation Committee, and noted by them, in September 2003. The paper is now publicly available on their website at: <a href="http://www.jncc.gov.uk/management/committee/papers03-09/jncc03N06.pdf">http://www.jncc.gov.uk/management/committee/papers03&ndash;09/jncc03N06.pdf</a></p>
	<p pid=".1W.6/5">Copies of the Raptor Working Group report are available from the Library of the House.</p>
	<p pid=".1W.6/6">Birds of prey are usually the top predators in their food chains. As with other predatory species, populations of birds of prey are normally heavily influenced by their prey populations rather than the other way around. The available evidence suggests that recovering populations of birds of prey are not responsible for recent declines in some songbirds and that other factors related to habitat change and the intensification of farming are mainly to blame. Although there is little specific information on the impact of birds of prey on mammal or other prey populations in the UK, the same general principle applies and population declines driven solely by predation are highly unlikely. Healthy bird of prey populations can exist only where their main prey species are sufficiently abundant.</p>

	<p pid=".2W.2/1">In Great Britain, there is very limited evidence that deer have been responsible for transmitting tuberculosis to cattle. Wild deer in GB have generally been considered a sentinel or 'spill-over' host of infection in cattle and other wildlife, rather than the cause of it. Whether any wild deer populations (of any species) may constitute a reservoir of TB will depend upon the prevalence of TB, density and ecology of the hosts and the pathology that TB shows in those species.</p>
	<p pid=".2W.2/2">Defra has funded a survey of wildlife in the Southwest of England by the Central Science Laboratory. The first phase established whether <i>Mycobacterium bovis</i> (<i>M. bovis&mdash;</i>the causative organism for bovine tuberculosis) was present in a number of wild mammal species, including deer. <i>M. bovis</i> has been confirmed in five of the six established wild and feral species of deer in GB. The second phase of the survey (due to end March 2004) is to estimate prevalence of <i>M. bovis</i> in those species where it is found, by carrying out a more targeted and extensive sampling.</p>

	<p pid=".3W.2/1">Our latest assessment shows that bovine TB restrictions affected 5 per cent. of cattle herds (5,181 herds) in Great Britain at some point between January and November 2003. At any one point in time there are about 3 per cent. of herds under restriction.</p>
	<p pid=".3W.2/2">The average annual increase in the number of animals slaughtered as a result of TB control measures between 1990 and 2001 was 20 per cent. It is too early to say whether this long-term trend has been altered by the interruption of the testing programme due to Foot and Mouth disease in 2001, and the priority testing of high-risk herds once the programme resumed.</p>
	<p pid=".3W.2/3">In 2002/03 we paid out &pound;31.1 million in TB compensation. With no new changes in policy, or disease dynamics, we could theoretically expect a 20 per cent. year on year increase in the compensation bill.</p>
	<p pid=".3W.2/4">However, the TB programme will not remain static over the next four years. We recently consulted on proposals to rationalise compensation arrangements for all notifiable diseases including bovine TB and we will shortly be consulting on proposals for a new TB strategy and options for controlling the geographical spread of the disease in the short term. The key challenge for Government and the farming industry will be to work together to reduce the overall economic impact of bovine TB.</p>

	<p pid=".6W.2/1">The Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 protects all wild birds and certain animals from killing and taking. Under Section 11 of the 1981 Act free running snares are permissible provided that the snare is not placed in such a way to allow injury to any animal listed on Schedule 6 of the 1981 Act, which includes badgers. Section 11(3) makes it an offence to set in position, or knowingly cause or permit to set in position, any snare which is of such a nature and so placed as to be calculated to cause bodily injury to any wild animal. The snare must also be inspected at least once every 24 hours, so as to avoid any animal held in the snare suffering unnecessarily through starvation or dehydration. All non-target species must be released from the snare.</p>
	<p pid=".6W.2/2">Free-running snares are not considered an indiscriminate means of either capture or killing provided they are set correctly and are checked every 24 hours. They are designed to be a restraining device that is intended to slacken, not continually tighten, thus not causing bodily injury.</p>
	<p pid=".6W.2/3">The purpose of Section 11 is to expressly prohibit the use of indiscriminate means of capture and killing, in accordance with our international obligations, under the Bern Convention. Penalties for offences under Section 11, including not checking snares and not releasing non target species, include fines of up to &pound;5000 and/or a custodial sentence of up to six months for each offence. The Police are the main authority for enforcing this area of legislation.</p>
	<p pid=".6W.2/4">The Department does not issue advice to gamekeepers on how snares should be set. However, the British Association of Shooting and Conservation has published a Code of Good Practice and the Game Conservancy Trust includes detailed guidance on best practice with all snares that they sell.</p>
	<p pid=".6W.2/5">It is considered that a complete ban on the use of snares might encourage the use of more dangerous, indiscriminate and illegal alternatives, such as poisons. We have no current plans to alter the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 with regard to snares. It is important that until viable alternatives are available to land managers the humane use of traps and snares is improved. Officials have undertaken a stakeholder consultation to assess current practice; identify best practice and methods that cause concern; as well as request suggestions for the improvements of snare operation and any potential alternative methods. The consultation period ended on the <phrase class="date" code="">13 November</phrase>. Officials will be collating the comments over the next few months. A copy of the pre-consultation paper can be found on the Defra website at <a href="http://defra.gov.uk/corporate/consult/snares/letter.htm">http://defra.gov.uk/corporate/consult/snares/letter.htm</a></p>

	<p pid=".7W.2/1">The Government believe that the public should have as much information as possible about <i>Phytophthora ramorum</i>, the disease known as sudden oak death in the USA. Information about the disease and how to report it is available on the Defra website at <a href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/planth/oak.htm">http://www.defra.gov.uk/planth/oak.htm</a>. An explanatory leaflet and poster are also available and copies will be placed in the Library of the House. Officials are in regular contact with interested organisations, for example the Royal Horticultural Society and the Horticultural Trades Association, so that information about the disease, its symptoms and guidance on reporting any suspected cases of infection can be disseminated to their members. This information has also appeared in a number of recent press and magazine articles.</p>
	<p pid=".7W.2/2">Because the symptoms are difficult to distinguish from those caused by other pathogens, we are not relying on public awareness but are carrying out our own surveys of garden centres and nurseries in order to detect infected plants. Buyers of host species have been advised to check plants before purchase for symptoms of the disease and to contact their supplier if they subsequently develop.</p>

	<p pid=".8W.8/1">There is at present no evidence, from the UK or anywhere else, to indicate that any plants or trees infected by Phytophthora ramorum might recover. It is for this reason that the current measures require all infected material to be destroyed, either by burning or deep burial. Symptoms of &quot;Phytophthora ramorum&quot; can affect both leaves and stems. In some plants only leaves are affected and in these cases it is possible that plants could recover following the removal of affected leaves. Methods of eradicating infection from specimen plants and of protecting new growth from reinfection are being investigated as part of Defra and the Forestry Commission's programme of research into this disease.</p>

However, research at Defra's Central Science Laboratory, funded by the Horticulture Development Council, is looking at a range of substances to evaluate their effectiveness in eradicating infection and preventing reoccurrence.</p>

	<p pid=".12W.2/1">Defra's 75 Plant Health and Seeds Inspectors are already employed for around 20 per cent. of their time on inspection and surveillance duties related to Phytophthora ramorum, known in the USA as sudden oak death. Therefore, although there is no specific budget allocation, this amounts to an expenditure of approximately &pound;1.8 million in 2003&ndash;2004.</p>
	<p pid=".12W.2/2">In response to the growing number of findings of this pathogen in England and Wales, Defra is redeploying around 20 additional staff to assist the Inspectorate in undertaking extra inspections at production nurseries, wild planting areas and ports of entry. They will be supplemented by the recruitment of six additional full time Inspectors for 2004&ndash;05. This is part of a package of measures announced on <phrase class="date" code="">4 December</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".12W.2/3">The Forestry Commission has diverted existing resources into a survey of woodlands thought to be at the highest risk of infection. This will cost in the region of &pound;45,000.</p>

	<p pid=".12W.5/1">Although P. ramorum is a 'notifiable disease', it is difficult to identify visually, and symptoms are similar to those caused by other organisms. We do not rely on reports in order to locate outbreaks. Defra's Plant Health and Seeds Inspectors are carrying out inspections of all known nurseries and garden centres which trade in susceptible plants. They are also surveying other areas where susceptible plants are established (e.g. rhododendrons in historic gardens), and co-ordinating with the Forestry Commission inspectors who are surveying woodlands. Since the first finding was confirmed in April 2002, outbreaks at individual sites in England and Wales have now reached 302.</p>

	<p pid=".14W.8/1">Plant disease campaigns over many years have not incorporated compensation for the destruction of affected plants. The one exception was the campaign against beet rhizomania disease from 1987 to 2001 when compensation was paid from an industry funded scheme. Our judgment is that the limited resources of the plant health service are better deployed in detecting and identifying outbreaks, and in carrying out research on risks and risk management measures. We have recently received an approach from industry organisations wishing to discuss possible risk-sharing mechanisms to avoid disproportionate losses to individual enterprises when action has to be taken against plant pests or diseases. We welcome this opportunity to explore the available options.</p>

	<p pid=".18W.2/1">The United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) as yet have no specific figures for the number of Afghans in refugee camps belonging to women-headed households. The most detailed information they can currently offer is that approximately 50 to 60 per cent. of refugees in camps in Pakistan are women and that five to 10 per cent. of these are of adult age. In Iran, only five per cent. of refugees live in camps, and of these, only 38 per cent. are women.</p>
	<p pid=".18W.2/2">UNHCR, however, anticipate that more detailed information will become available over the next year. Elections in Afghanistan are planned for June 2004 and UNHCR is currently discussing ways to carry out voter registration for Afghan refugees with the Government of Pakistan and the UN Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA). This should start to shed more light on the make-up of the refugee population. UNHCR also has plans for a separate census, which the Government of Pakistan have asked them to carry out in order to get a better picture of the remaining refugee caseload in Pakistan. It is expected that this will be carried out after voter registration of refugees to avoid confusion. UNHCR believes this will provide an insight, among other things, into the number of women-headed households and their dependents.</p>

	<p pid=".18W.8/2">We discuss regularly with the Government of Rwanda the situation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). Since the withdrawal of the Rwandan Defence Force (RDF) from the DRC in October 2002 we have received several unconfirmed reports from a variety of sources about the continued presence of RDF personnel in eastern DRC. The UN Mission in the DRC (MONUC) has investigated these reports but has found no evidence to substantiate them. The Rwandan government, with whom we have raised these allegations, have denied they have forces in the DRC.</p>

	<p pid=".21W.2/1">Meeting the needs of the growing number of orphans and vulnerable children in Africa is a challenge that the Department for International Development is determined to address effectively. DFID is continuing its work and discussions with the United Nations Joint Programme for HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) and the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) who are co-ordinating other development agencies and NGOs to develop: treatment programmes to prolong the lives of parents; free access to education and enhanced support to the families and communities caring for orphans and vulnerable children.</p>
	<p pid=".21W.2/2">DFID is working with NGOs in a number of countries. In Zimbabwe, DFID is providing support for orphans and vulnerable children and child headed households through its NGO feeding programme. In addition, a bilateral programme with the Zimbabwe Red Cross and John Snow International is providing food to households affected by AIDS (including child-headed households) and some orphanages. We are also starting work with a faith-based organisation in South Africa (the Church of the Province of Southern Africa) to reduce stigma, improve home-based care and care for orphans and vulnerable children.</p>

On World Aids Day I hosted a meeting with NGO's on the UK's &quot;Call for Action&quot; and a new UK Strategy for HIV/AIDS. The issue of how to respond to the growing number of orphans and children made vulnerable by AIDS was raised during this meeting. We will be consulting further with NGOs on this important issue as part of our consultation process for the UK Strategy planned for publication in July 2004.</p>

	<p pid=".21W.5/1">DFID is committed to increasing access to treatment as part of a comprehensive response to HIV/AIDS, and welcomes the WHO/UNAIDS target to get three million people on treatment by 2005. The UK will provide &pound;12.5 million to the World Health Organisation in 2003&ndash;04 to support its work, including '3 by 5'. We have supported WHO to make the strengthening of health services a key part of their strategy to reach the '3 by 5' target. As treatment programmes are expanded it will be essential to invest in health systems in order to ensure that services for HIV, including voluntary counselling and testing and the provision of treatment, and other health services, are of good quality and accessible by poor communities and particularly women. This includes better co-ordination of public, private and NGO treatment initiatives. We also support community involvement in health service delivery as a well-informed civil society has been shown to be essential in the sustainability of comprehensive health systems.</p>
	<p pid=".21W.5/2">DFID has provided &pound;1.5 billion since 1997 to the strengthening of health systems in developing countries and we see this as an essential element of the response to the HIV/AIDS epidemic. We are working with partners to build sound healthcare systems as the cornerstone of efforts to accelerate progress to achieve the Millennium Development Goals; to improve maternal and child health and reduce the impact of HIV and other major communicable diseases. The UK was a prime mover in setting up the High Level Forum on Health MDGs, which was held in Geneva in January 2004 and at which developing and donor countries discussed concrete actions to increase health service capacity to meet international development goals. DFID also supports the integration of HIV/AIDS into wider health sector policies and national poverty reduction strategies.</p>

	<p pid=".22W.2/1">DFID has agreed an &pound;18 million, six-year project of support to WHO Africa Regional Office in 2002 and it is now at the early stages of implementation. We reviewed progress in 2003 and felt that that the project was well on track. All the countries supported under the project having developed Roll Back Malaria (RBM) and Integrated Management of Childhood Illness (IMCI) plans.</p>
	<p pid=".22W.2/2">Countries supported under the project have been able to use their malaria control plans to make applications to the Global Fund for AIDS, TB and Malaria (GFATM). The plans have helped GFATM approve and release significant malaria grants for six countries in the region. WHO has established an inter-country team for the region, which has responded to a number of emergencies such as flood assessments in Malawi and Mozambique. At the same time it has helped to develop country capacity through training and strengthening health systems.</p>
	<p pid=".22W.2/3">The IMCI strategy is being implemented in most countries of the region and seven are now implementing it in more than 50 per cent. of their districts. There have been major achievements in improving health worker skills, demonstrated through Health Facility Surveys and Multi-Country Evaluations. Attention will now be focused upon strengthening some of the health systems issues in the delivery of IMCI.</p>
	<p pid=".22W.2/4">Finally, the WHO's Regional Office for Africa (AFRO) itself has used the project to increase its institutional capacity and has recruited additional staff to work on both RBM and IMCI.</p>

	<p pid=".23W.0/1">It is generally accepted that a significant improvement will be needed if, the MDG target to reduce under five mortality rates by two thirds by 2015 is to be achieved globally. Challenges include: the HIV/AIDS epidemic; economic decline and persistent poverty; inequality; under-resourced and poorly functioning health systems; and lack of progress in reducing the number of deaths of newborn babies.</p>
	<p pid=".23W.0/2">In addition to country-level work, the Department for International Development makes significant contributions to UNFPA, UNICEF, the World Bank, the World Health Organisation and other international and national civil society groups to support their efforts to improve both maternal and child health. We contribute to global initiatives such as the Global Fund to Fight HIV/AIDS, TB and Malaria, the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization and Roll Back Malaria, which have helped revitalise interest in childhood diseases and substantially increased the resources directed to child health. We support implementation of the Integrated Management of Childhood Illness Initiative with partners from the United Nations International Children's Fund, the World Health Organisation, the World Bank and the United States Agency for International Development. This initiative is building the quality and quantity of child health care within countries. The UK is also part of the recently inaugurated High Level Forum on Health which plans to address challenges to achieving the health related Millennium Development Goals.</p>
	<p pid=".23W.0/3">A Child Survival Partnership (formerly Working Group) is being proposed by a number of international agencies which will bring together national governments, international organisations, donors and civil society</p>
	<p pid=".23W.0/4" class="indent">&quot;to galvanise action at the global and national level aimed at revitalizing efforts to reach the under five mortality MDG target&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".23W.0/5">The specific activities that the partnership will undertake have not yet been defined, although they are likely to include advocacy for increased resources to be devoted to child survival, and work to scale up cost-effective child survival interventions at country level. DFID has been asked to contribute to thinking on the partnerships structure and objectives. As with any new initiative, over time we will judge the level of our involvement on its ability to deliver on its objectives and contribution to meeting the MDG targets.</p>
	<p pid=".23W.0/6">We have been working with the Saving Newborn Lives Initiative (a Save the Children US Gates Foundation funded project) and the World Health Organisation to develop a Framework for Neonatal Health, which will provide a series of practical and flexible tools to enable policy makers to develop coherent and integrated strategies to reduce newborn deaths.</p>
	<p pid=".23W.0/7">DFID is also represented on the steering committee of the Partnership for Safe Motherhood and Newborn Health together with the World Bank, the WHO, UNICEF, UNFPA, and other organisations.</p>

	<p pid=".24W.5/1">On average five to 10 Iraqi non-governmental organisations (NGOs) visit the DFID office in Baghdad each week (most NGOs prefer not to meet on their own premises). DFID has also sponsored several meetings, particularly on women's political participation and human rights, involving several hundred attendees, many of whom are from small Iraqi NGOs.</p>
	<p pid=".24W.5/2">The issues raised by the NGOs range widely. One frequent topic is how best DFID and the coalition as a whole can support the development of Iraqi civil society. These discussions inform the development of DFID's strategy and our approach to funding. But many of the NGOs are embryonic and are simply seeking guidance on how to establish themselves properly. We are working with the Ministry of Planning and Development Cooperation and the Coalition Provisional Authority on a registration scheme for all NGOs in Iraq.</p>

	<p pid=".25W.3/1">Since the end of the conflict, United Nation High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) has facilitated the return of relatively small numbers of Iraqi refugees. These include the voluntary return of over 4,000 Iraqi refugees who spent more than 12 years in the Rafha refugee camp in Saudi Arabia, and some 800 refugees from Iran.</p>
	<p pid=".25W.3/2">UNHCR is not encouraging returns to Iraq because of insecurity in parts of the country, a lack of humanitarian access, and economic conditions that cannot support mass returns. However, UNHCR is supporting, where it can, the repatriation of people who actively seek to go back regardless of conditions inside the country. It appears that increasing numbers of refugees in neighbouring countries, particularly Iran, are choosing to return to Iraq without support.</p>
	<p pid=".25W.3/3">Once conditions in Iraq improve, UNHCR plans to step up its work with the Iraqi authorities, the CPA, and governments in countries of asylum, as well as other United Nations agencies and NGO partners, to support the return of Iraqi refugees and internally displaced persons (IDPs). UNHCR has launched pilot projects for the return and reintegration of refugees and IDPs in the northern governorates of Erbil and Dohuk. These projects aim to provide shelter kits to returnee families and to upgrade water supplies for returnees and host communities.</p>
	<p pid=".25W.3/4">An Iraqi Property Claims Commission is being set up to help resolve the claims of returnees whose property was confiscated under previous regimes. A new Ministry of Displacement and Migration has been established to manage issues relating to Iraqi refugees and displaced people.</p>

	<p pid=".26W.2/1">The Millennium Development Goals are central to the Department for International Development's work, including the goal to improve maternal health, and its associated target of reducing maternal mortality. Constraints to reducing maternal deaths in Africa are weak and under-resourced health systems and the general human resource crisis in the health sector.</p>
	<p pid=".26W.2/2">Access to skilled care at birth and emergency obstetric care are main elements to prevent maternal deaths, and help prevent ill health and disability as a result of complications in pregnancy or childbirth. DFID's Public Service Agreement includes ambitious targets on increasing access to skilled attendance at birth. The Department's strategy includes: highlighting the issue internationally; support to countries to strengthen health systems and improve access to maternal and reproductive health services; and support for research and improved measurement and monitoring for safe motherhood. DFID is actively engaged in a new international partnership for Safe Motherhood and Newborn Health.</p>
	<p pid=".26W.2/3">We support the maternal health strategies of African countries through safe motherhood projects, for example in Kenya and Malawi, health sector budget support and, indirectly, through general budget support. We also fund international multilateral agencies and international NGOs active in supporting maternal health programmes in Africa. Since 1997 we have committed approximately &pound;1.5 billion to support health systems. Through our participation in the High Level Forum on health we are promoting, with the WB, WHO and others, a renewed effort to accelerate progress towards all the health related MDGs.</p>

	<p pid=".27W.5/1">Establishing a fair and effective justice system in Rwanda is crucial for the stability and prosperity of the country. The most immediate challenge is to process the more than 100,000 individuals currently in Rwandan prisons accused of genocidal crimes.</p>
	<p pid=".27W.5/2">The UK Government has provided &pound;715,000 for research into the efficiency and effectiveness of gacaca&mdash;the traditional justice system adopted by the Government of Rwanda to try those accused of genocidal crimes. This programme is managed by Penal Reform International (PRI). This financial year, the UK will also provide some &pound;25 million to the Government of Rwanda as direct budgetary support. These funds support the implementation of Rwanda's PRSP, which highlights justice as a priority sector.</p>
	<p pid=".27W.5/3">At the request of the Government of Rwanda, the Belgian Government leads donor activity in the justice sector. Other major donors in this sector include the Dutch Government (construction of gacaca courts), the Canadian Government (the administration of the Supreme Court), the European Union (rehabilitation of the Ministry of Justice and the Supreme Court), and the German Government (rehabilitation of judicial systems).</p>
	<p pid=".27W.5/4">In the case of Burundi, the UK commitment in 2003&ndash;04 so far amounts to &pound;11.62 million. Our programme consists of support to peace building and conflict resolution initiatives; and humanitarian assistance through the United Nations agencies, non-governmental organisations and other international agencies. We are also working with the Government of Burundi providing technical support and advice on their Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper and on capacity building issues. We are looking at the possibility of assistance in collaboration with others in the area of electoral reform.</p>
	<p pid=".27W.5/5">Beyond this, we have no specific plans for support to the justice sector. However, the European Commission, under their recently agreed National Indicative Programme for Burundi for the period 2003 to 2007, are developing a significant support programme in good governance including the justice sector.</p>

These allocations are based on an assessment of London's transport priorities, taking into account affordability following the 2002 spending review. They also take account of the investment needed to deliver a 12 per cent. capacity increase for London Underground by 2012 under the PPP. This is an increase of over 85 per cent. in funding levels from the equivalent provision in 2001&ndash;02, and a significant increase in the overall amount available for investment in transport infrastructure, including an unprecedented funding commitment for London Underground, averaging more than &pound;1 billion a year to at least 2010&ndash;11. The overall provision for 2006&ndash;07 is subject to the current spending review, which is due to be completed this summer.</p>

The Cat Stane was taken into account, alongside a range of other factors, in the design and appraisal of the options for a new runway at Edinburgh and the development of White Paper policy. The ancient monument would ultimately lie between a new runway and the existing one and is therefore unlikely to be affected by development. The necessary protection of the Cat Stane will be addressed in the master plan for the airport and any future planning application for the development of a new runway.</p>

	<p pid=".38W.8/1">Since April 2001, when the Rail Regulator modified Railtrack's network licence to require the company to establish and maintain an asset register, the company has thoroughly reviewed the state of its asset knowledge, established the key principles of how its asset information strategy needs to improve its business planning processes and developed detailed plans to meet these business needs. Good progress is being made, and Network Rail is continuing to press ahead with the implementation of these plans.</p>
	<p pid=".38W.8/2">Development of the asset register comprises a number of key elements. It is replacing many old databases with new systems that will provide access to integrated and consistent, company-wide data for the first time. In some cases, existing data systems can be maintained, but they are being overhauled to ensure that data are accurate and fully up to date.</p>
	<p pid=".38W.8/3">Much of this work is highly detailed and requires a painstaking review of large volumes of data. Inevitably, this is time consuming, but good progress is being made. Some elements of the project are complete, while others, such as the new system for managing maintenance work known as MIMS <sup>1</sup> , are well developed and in the course of introduction. It is expected that MIMS will be fully implemented by April 2004.</p>
	<p pid=".38W.8/4">As the asset register is being completed, new data collection and storage systems are being implemented, requiring significant changes to the culture of data management within Network Rail. Development will continue to take effect for many years, but it is expected that a fundamental milestone will be the completion of a baseline asset inventory which will contain accurate and fully up-to-date information about the key attributes of the network assets by mid-2005.</p>

	<p pid=".39W.2/1">The purpose of the asset register is to ensure that Network Rail has appropriate knowledge of the condition, capability and capacity of the network assets.

	<p pid=".39W.2/5">Work to develop these long-term planning tools is still in progress but, in their early stages, they provided important input to the Rail Regulator's review of access charges during 2003&mdash;particularly in respect of track renewals.</p>
	<p pid=".39W.2/6">The Regulator's conclusions, published on <phrase class="date" code="2003-12-12">12 December 2003</phrase>, provide for increased levels of funding for infrastructure maintenance and renewals.

Ofcom (formerly the Radio Authority) is required to draw up and from time to time review a statement setting out the principles to be followed in calculating qualifying revenue. Before doing so, Ofcom must consult the Secretary of State and the Treasury. This statement was last reviewed in November 1995. I understand there are currently no plans for further revisions.</p>

	<p pid=".44W.0/1">The UK Film Council, the Government's strategic agency for film, has recently announced a comprehensive Distribution and Exhibition Strategy costing &pound;24 million over the next three years aimed at widening audiences for film and ensuring a broader and more diverse range of films is available.</p>
	<p pid=".44W.0/2">&pound;14 million of this funding will be allocated, in partnership with the Arts Council of England, to a Digital Screen Network which will enable the exhibition of a wider range of films, through the provision of equipment enabling the digital exhibition of films.</p>
	<p pid=".44W.0/3">The strategy also includes a Specialised Print and Advertising (P&amp;A) Fund, with &pound;1 million per annum over the next three years, to assist distributors to widen the availability of films defined as &quot;specialised&quot;. These are films characterised by an innovative cinematic style, or which engage with challenging subject matter, offering audiences a different experience of cinema from that provided by mainstream US studio-originated material. Support will be available under this fund to enable a distributor to increase the print run and media investment (P&amp;A) for specialised films.</p>
	<p pid=".44W.0/4">The &pound;1 million UK Film Distribution Programme is another strand of the strategy which is aimed at assisting distributors to increase the theatrical release of indigenous UK films that are aimed at a wide, commercial market.</p>

	<p pid=".49W.0/1">The Government are taking the issue of transparency of pay seriously. We believe that secrecy can perpetuate the gender pay gap. Employers must ensure that pay systems and practices do not lead to pay inequalities between men and women. This is particularly important with discretionary performance pay and bonuses. We have introduced the equal pay questionnaire to help people who think they have an equal pay problem find out from their employers whether this is the case. We believe that carrying out an equal pay review should be good business practice for every employer and have developed a number of initiatives to help them, including funding the Equal Opportunities Commission to develop equal pay toolkits. We are working in partnership with business, trade unions, the EOC and Opportunity Now to ensure that 35 per cent. of large employers have done pay reviews by 2006. We are also improving the way the Equal Pay Act works in practice and will be consulting shortly on proposals to speed up and simplify complex equal value cases.</p>

	<p pid=".52W.0/1">There is no central data collected on the information requested. It is a matter for each MCC whether joint training and other events take place in co-operation with local authorities and the police. In making these decisions MCCs will also take regard to the need to protect the judicial independence of the magistracy. Local Criminal Justice Boards (LCJB) are the forum through which such co-operation may be discussed and agreed. For example, we know of an LCJB which has been instrumental in developing a protocol on anti-social behaviour order matters which is used by all criminal justice service agencies.</p>
	<p pid=".52W.0/2">LCJBs are run under a tripartite arrangement involving the Home Office, my Department and the Crown Prosecution Service and seek to include the chief officers from the Police, the Probation Service, Crown Prosecution Service, Crown and Magistrates' Courts, the Prison Service, and Youth Offending Teams. Magistrates' Courts are not represented by magistrates, but the Justices Chief Executive (JCE) does attend as the senior official from the local MCC on their behalf. The JCE has overall responsibility for ensuring that appropriate training is planned and delivered to magistrates and can direct as necessary on issues arising from LCJBs.</p>

	<p pid=".62W.5/1">We support the Sri Lankan peace process both politically and practically and welcome the progress made since February 2002 when the ceasefire came into effect. We are concerned that the political dispute between President Kumaratunga and Prime Minister Wickremesinghe could have a detrimental effect on the process at a crucial stage. We continue to impress upon the two leaders the importance of resolving the underlying issues in a transparent way and of finding a rapid and positive way forward so that peace talks can resume as soon as possible. We are working closely with international partners to reinforce these messages. We are encouraged that the ceasefire continues to hold and we welcome the continued commitments of the President, Prime Minister and of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) to the ceasefire and the peace process.</p>

	<p pid=".70W.3/1">The Ministry of Defence does not provide legal advice or representation to reservists seeking reinstatement to their civilian employment under the terms of the Reserve Forces (Safeguard of Employment) Act 1985. It does, however, provide advice to reservists on their legal right to reclaim their civilian employment and how to seek reinstatement. Each reservist receives a copy of JSP 532, &quot;Guidance for Reservists Returning to Civilian Employment Following a Period of Mobilised Service&quot;. The Supporting Britain's Reservists and Employers (SaBRE) campaign team provides a help line and a website which gives additional information and advice.</p>

	<p pid=".70W.6/1">Since the launch of the SaBRE campaign in October 2002, there have been two substantial pieces of independent research on the impact and effectiveness of the campaign, both commissioned through COI Communications. The reports found that while employers' awareness of the campaign in its first year of existence was low, over 60 per cent. of companies who had been in contact with SaBRE felt that that contact had been positive and worthwhile. The lessons we learn from both these and future studies will form a central part of future SaBRE campaign activity.</p>

	<p pid=".78W.0/1">The Government take bullying at work very seriously and believe that employees should be able to work without fear of being bullied or harassed by employers, fellow employees or anybody else.</p>
	<p pid=".78W.0/2">There is a safety net of legislation already in existence that employees can turn to. This includes the: Sex Discrimination Act, Race Relations Act, Disability Discrimination Act, Protection from Harassment Act, Health and Safety Act, Employment Rights Act and the Employment Act 2002.</p>
	<p pid=".78W.0/3">In addition New Employment Equality Regulations came into force last December protecting those experiencing discrimination, harassment and victimisation at work on grounds of sexual orientation or religion or belief. We are working to support the dissemination of high quality best practice information on the new regulations to employers, individuals and&mdash;importantly&mdash;advice giving organisations and agencies through the funding we have allocated in the current financial year.</p>
	<p pid=".78W.0/4">The Health and Safety Executive are producing a set of management Standards. The Standards are designed to provide a yardstick for organisations by which they can gauge the levels of stress and other associated problems among staff thereby helping them to identify where action is required. One of these, the Relationship Management Standard, focuses on bullying.</p>
	<p pid=".78W.0/5">Assisting with the development of best practice operations is a group, under ACAS management called Race and Equality Advisory Service (REAS). This team of advisers deliver practical, best practice equality advice to organisations. This complements ACAS's wider role of providing services to organisations to help their businesses to flourish.</p>
	<p pid=".78W.0/6">Continuing the promotion of best practice is the Partnership at Work Fund administered by DTI. This has provided grants to support organisations wishing to focus on best practice initiatives specifically encouraging employees and employers to work together to resolve issues. A number of projects have focused on reducing bullying, while others have included it as part of their wider objectives.</p>
	<p pid=".78W.0/7">Bullying and harassment is an area of growing importance in the work of ACAS. It uses multiple channels for dissemination of guidance including: publications (available in hard copy and through the internet); face to face training and seminars; advice via the ACAS National Helpline; and also more in depth focused work within workplaces Two publications&mdash;'Bullying and Harassment: A Guide for Managers and Employers' and 'Bullying and Harassment: A Guide for Employees' with an annual distribution of approximately 26,000 copies offer guidance and form the basis of training programmes and seminars organised by ACAS.</p>
	<p pid=".78W.0/8">In 2003, around 200 seminars and training events were run focusing on the subject of bullying and harassment. The feedback from delegates to ACAS events is overwhelmingly positive with, across the board, 97 per cent. reporting that they were satisfied with the quality and content of their training. Follow up work with delegates in 2003, around 200 seminars and training events were run focussing on the subject of bullying and has also shown that the guidance offered by ACAS has positive and lasting benefits with 60 per cent. saying that they review policy and practice after attending ACAS events and around a third actually implemented change or introduced new policies after attending events.</p>
	<p pid=".78W.0/9">The ACAS National Helpline also plays an important role in disseminating guidance. Around 600 calls are received monthly on this issue. Overall the feedback on the helpline is found to be extremely beneficial with 92 per cent. reporting satisfaction with the service received from the Helpline and 84 per cent. of callers reporting that they found the information provided was valuable in fully answering their inquiry.</p>

Smart originally operated as a competition with a fixed number of &quot;Stage 1&quot;, or feasibility, awards but a variable number of &quot;Stage 2&quot;, or development, awards. The SPUR scheme was introduced in 1991 and merged with Smart in 1997. Since that time there has been a separate provision for the expanded Smart.

	<p pid=".86W.2/1">The best source of information on this topic are the large number of studies which have already been undertaken by international organisations such as the World Bank, IMF, UNCTAD and the OECD, and by charitable organisations such as Oxfam. The work of these organisations demonstrates through individual case studies the adverse effects which dumping of subsidised agricultural products on world markets can have on developing country economies. It remains, however, very difficult to make an accurate quantitative economic assessment of the overall impact of dumping of subsidised agricultural produce on developing country markets. The World Bank have, however, estimated that the comprehensive reform of all aspects of agricultural policies in developed countries could boost the income of developing countries by as much as $100 billion.</p>

	<p pid=".89W.0/1">The procedures in place are that the Department is making interim payments&mdash;of 75 per cent. of the estimated share of general damages payable by British Coal&mdash;to claimants who have worked for both British Coal and a small private mine, where no other interims have been paid previously. The first of these interim payments was made in December 2003. Where an interim payment has been paid previously&mdash;for example, on the basis that the claimant has previously received a DWP payment for respiratory disease&mdash;the Department will reassess the claim after having completed interim payments to those claimants who have received no payments, and will ensure that compensation is topped up to the equivalent of 75 per cent. of estimated British Coal share of general damages.</p>

	<p pid=".89W.6/1">The Rover Task Force (RTF) was set up in 2000 to look at the potential effects on the region's economy of the then expected decline of Rover and its supply industry&mdash;which was a severe risk at the time of the BMW withdrawal from the company. The report it produced has been carried forward primarily by Advantage West Midlands (the RDA). It remains one of the best examples of speedy response to a crisis coupled with long-term action to address structural change.</p>
	<p pid=".89W.6/2">There are three themes arising from the RTF:</p>
	<p pid=".89W.6/3" class="indent">Modernisation&mdash;support to the automotive supply chain in its continuous improvement activity;</p>
	<p pid=".89W.6/4" class="indent">Diversification&mdash;promotion of and support to encourage businesses to engage in new activity to enable the region to be less dependent on its traditional industries; and</p>
	<p pid=".89W.6/5" class="indent">Regeneration&mdash;the creation of High Tech Corridors to support the modernisation and diversification of the region's economy by attracting and developing more high tech, high value added businesses by virtue of the presence of research institutions, universities and property opportunities.</p>
	<p pid=".89W.6/6">Modernisation and Diversification projects are continuing with spend on target and outputs exceeding or in line with expectations. For example, at end of 2002&ndash;03 over 2,500 jobs have been safeguarded against a target of 1,700. Equally on the Regeneration agenda, a strategy is in place for High Tech Corridors to provide long-term sustainable development of the region.</p>

	<p pid=".93W.0/2">My Department has not undertaken any research specifically on consumer attitudes to offshoring call centre jobs and services. The DTI paper &quot;Services and Offshoring: The Impact of Increasing International Competition on Services&quot;, published on <phrase class="date" code="">5 December</phrase>, outlined the main issues on offshoring and highlights initial areas identified for further research. It invites all those with an interest in the wider offshoring debate, including businesses, employees and their unions, and consumer groups, to share their views with us. On <phrase class="date" code="2005-02-02">2 February</phrase> I will be hosting a roundtable on offshoring with companies and organisations interested in offshoring issues. My Department is also commissioning research on the key factors contributing to the relative competitiveness of the UK's call centre industry to help identify any appropriate actions which need to be taken by industry or Government in response to the increasingly global market for call centre services.</p>

	<p pid=".100W.5/5" class="indent">In all cases falling under the &quot;old scheme&quot; where the resident parent (that is, the parent with care) is not receiving a prescribed benefit or Tax Credit, the Agency will seek to verify that parent's financial circumstances. Specifically we will ask the parent with care for evidence of their earnings and any other income, as well as their housing costs. We will do this whether or not the parent with care has a partner and whether or not the non-resident parent has applied for a departure.</p>
	<p pid=".100W.5/6" class="indent">It may help you to know that, under the &quot;old scheme&quot;, if the parent with care has a partner, the Agency will ask for verification of that partner's income only if they share a child. This is because the only relevance of the partner's income is in determining whether we should make full allowance for the shared child in the parent with care's exempt income, or whether the partner can contribute to the support of the child. Under the revised Child Support scheme the Agency does not take into account the financial circumstances of the parent with care in any way.</p>

	<p pid=".103W.11/1">Section 74 of the Pensions Act 1995 sets out the provisions on overriding scheme rules so as to enable the trustees of a scheme to discharge their liabilities to members for pensions and other benefits even if the those pensions and benefits are not fully secured. When an occupational pension scheme is winding up, it ceases to contract-out and its trustees must secure members contracted-out rights.</p>
	<p pid=".103W.11/2">The Inland Revenue manual CA15 (Cessation of Contracted-out Pension Schemes) contains guidance on securing contracted-out rights. CA15 is available via the Inland Revenue website at: <a href="http://www.inlandrevenue.gov.uk">www.inlandrevenue.gov.uk</a>. Inland Revenue writes to scheme administrators making them aware of the guidance once the scheme has ceased to contract-out. Also, when they are informed that a scheme is no longer contracted-out, the Inland Revenue sends form CA7992 to scheme trustees. This gives general guidelines on securing the liabilities, and the options that are available.</p>

	<p pid=".113W.8/1">The information requested falls within the responsibility of the National Statistician, who has been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid=".113W.8/2" class="letterfrom">Letter from Len Cook to Mrs. Claire Curtis-Thomas, dated <phrase class="date" code="2004-01-26">26 January 2004</phrase></p>
	<p pid=".113W.8/3" class="indent">As National Statistician, I have been asked to reply to your request for a statement on progress in establishing an appropriate method for measuring net migration into the UK. (150333)</p>
	<p pid=".113W.8/4" class="indent">A substantial amount of work in this area has already been completed, and a program of further work is ongoing.</p>
	<p pid=".113W.8/5" class="indent">The results of the 2001 Census showed that the mid-year population estimates had over-estimated the population of the UK over the previous decade. Subsequent research showed that this was partly because net migration into the country had been over-estimated. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) made several improvements to the methodology for estimating total international migration, making fuller use of the available sources. The improved methodology was used to produce the international migration estimates for 2001, and was also applied retrospectively from 1992 onwards in order to produce revised total international migration estimates for the inter-censual decade. ONS released final revised international migration estimates for 1992&ndash;2001 in June 2003. The revised methodology was used again to produce the 2002 international migration estimates published in November 2003, which are available on the National Statistics website at the following address: <a href="http://www.statistics.gov.uk/pdfdir/inme1103.pdf">http://www.statistics.gov.uk/pdfdir/inme1103.pdf</a></p>
	<p pid=".113W.8/6" class="indent">It was already recognised that international migration is the hardest component of population change to measure before the results of the 2001 Census were published. A National Statistics Quality Review of international migration statistics was initiated in March 2002. This was aimed at identifying the means of making the required improvements to the reliability and comprehensiveness of international migration statistics. The National Statistics Quality Review report was published on the National Statistics website in September 2003. Following the publication of this report, ONS produced an implementation plan for taking forward the review's recommendations. This was published on the National Statistics website in January 2004. Both the review and the implementation plan are available at the following address: <a href="http://www.statistlcs.gov.uk/methodsquality/qualityreview/population.asp">http://www.statistlcs.gov.uk/methods quality/quality review/population.asp</a></p>
	<p pid=".113W.8/7" class="indent">The work outlined in the implementation plan is already underway. ONS, in conjunction with the Home Office are working to complete some of the actions identified by the end of 2004. Other actions are suitable for longer term planning, and in some cases are dependent on developments in other government departments for their successful completion.</p>

	<p pid=".114W.2/1">I am delighted to inform the House that on <phrase class="date" code="2005-01-20">20 January</phrase> EU Finance Ministers agreed to base the new Lamfalussy committee of banking supervisors ('CEBS') in London. The equivalent committee for securities supervisors ('CESR') will continue to be based in Paris and that for insurance ('CEIOPS') will be based in Frankfurt. The location of these regulatory committees in Europe's major financial centres is a good outcome for the UK and for financial markets in the EU. This high-level committee of EU banking supervisors and central banks will be a key forum for national authorities to improve supervisory practices and advance the EU's legislative agenda. It should help ensure that more flexible EU legislation is adopted quicker, with improved consultation, transparency, and greater input from market practitioners. This should help drive forward the EU Financial Services Action Plan, providing Europe with a more dynamic, innovative, efficient and competitive financial services sector, to the benefit of consumers and businesses. The banking committee will meet at least three times a year, and should meet in London for the first time in the spring. It has already assumed its responsibilities and is currently looking to secure permanent offices in London. The committee is currently chaired by Jose Maria Roldan, Director General of the Bank of Spain, and around forty senior regulators and central bankers will participate in its meetings.</p>

	<p pid=".116W.11/2">In June 2003, Sport England published the report, &quot;The Value of the Sports Economy in England&quot;, which presented a summary of the value of the sports economy to the economy in England. The data in the report relates to 2000, the last year for which comprehensive data is available. The report found that sport generated more than &pound;9.8 billion in value added to the economy in England, approximately 1.5 per cent. of total gross value added (GVA) for England. The breakdown according to sector is as follows:</p>

	<p pid=".119W.4/1">Funding in the next financial year&mdash;to support parents both nationally and locally&mdash;will be available from a number of sources within my department. Our best estimates of the funding options available in Tower Hamlets are as follows:</p>
	<p pid=".119W.4/2">In the financial year 2004/05 &pound;331,909 is available in Tower Hamlets for groups to apply to the Local Network Fund for Children and Young People.</p>
	<p pid=".119W.4/3">The Local Network Fund (LNF) provides community groups with small grants to support local projects and activities for 0 to 19-year-olds experiencing disadvantage and social exclusion. The fund enables local people to identify solutions to local issues affecting children and young people through grants ranging between &pound;250 and &pound;7,000 to community groups under four themes: Aspirations and experience; Economic disadvantage; Isolation and access; and Children's voices. Groups whose activities support parenting, involve or target parents, providing there is a clear outcome for children and young people are eligible to apply for a Local Network Fund grant.</p>
	<p pid=".119W.4/4">Decisions on allocating funding are made by assessment panels comprising local people with knowledge of issues faced by children and young people in the communities served by the funds.</p>
	<p pid=".119W.4/5">Funding for Sure Start local programmes and children's centres in Tower Hamlets over the next financial year is as follows:</p>

	<p pid=".119W.4/20">In addition each local programme has been allocated a capital grant of just over &pound;1 million bringing the total capital investment to &pound;7.7 million.</p>
	<p pid=".119W.4/21">For children's centres Tower Hamlets has been given indicative funding to March 2006. Revenue funding is &pound;1,621,304 and capital funding is &pound;4,472,384. The local authority is now planning their proposed profile of spend between now and March 2006.</p>
	<p pid=".119W.4/22">In the financial year 2004/05, &pound;75,000 is available to Tower Hamlets from the Sure Start Plus pilot programme to provide personal support and advice for teenagers who discover that they are pregnant, so that they can make responsible and well-informed decisions according to their individual circumstances.</p>
	<p pid=".119W.4/23">In the financial year 2004/05, approximately &pound;35,000 from all Tower Hamlets Sure Start local programmes will provide a teenage pregnancy midwifery lead for teenage parents offering one-to-one case worker support, running teenage parent ante-natal classes and developing working protocols for maternity services in supporting this group.</p>
	<p pid=".119W.4/24">Tower Hamlets received a Teenage Pregnancy Local Implementation Grant of &pound;25,258 to enable adjustments to George Greens Children's Centre to support teenage parents with babies in returning to education, training and employment and support positive parenting.</p>
	<p pid=".119W.4/25">Tower Hamlets Children's Fund spent &pound;200,649 on services delivering parental education during July to September 2003. Further funding will be available in 2004&ndash;05 to enable the Children's Fund to continue to deliver preventative services for children, young people and their families.</p>
	<p pid=".119W.4/26">Tower Hamlets also has an allocation of over &pound;62 million for children's social services in 2004&ndash;05 through the local government finance settlement, some of which may be available to support organisations helping parents.</p>
	<p pid=".119W.4/27">Projects in Tower Hamlets may also benefit from national programmes such as the Family Support Grant and Parenting Fund. Parents in all parts of England are able to use Parentline Plus's helpline which receives core funding from the Family Support Grant.</p>

	<p pid=".121W.8/1">Research on expenditure on children is made complicated by the difficulty of separately identifying child and non-child expenditure within family expenditure and the issue of children sharing in the wealth of their parents. There is no consensus on the factors to be included in estimating the cost of raising a child.</p>
	<p pid=".121W.8/2">Academic and business research on this question highlights the complexities involved and has resulted in a large range of estimates. For example, a study commissioned by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation in 1997 suggested a cost of around &pound;50,000 for 'regular' support up to the age of 17. Recent research by the Centre for Economics and Business Research for the Liverpool Victoria Friendly Society suggested a much higher average cost of &pound;140,000, which includes spending on both 'necessities' and 'luxuries'. Such results are of course not directly comparable due to the differences in the factors included and the methodology used.</p>

That is why Government guidance on safeguarding children, including Working Together to Safeguard Children (1999) and Framework for the Assessment of Children in Need Practice Guidance (2000), highlights the need to promote a high level of awareness of this increased vulnerability and sets out measures that should be taken to strengthen the capacity of disabled children and their families to communicate abuse.</p>

	<p pid=".125W.0/1">Section 17 of the Children Act 1989 sets out the duties of local authorities for safeguarding and promoting the welfare of children in need, including disabled children. Services for disabled children and their families are provided through local authorities, the health service and the voluntary sector. These services help to support families safeguard children and improve their life chances. Support services include short term breaks; day care; home help; domiciliary care; nursing and medical support; social events and outings for parents and children, as well as advice, guidance and counselling. In cases where there are concerns about possible abuse and neglect of disabled children, support services should work closely with local child protection services to ensure that all necessary steps are taken to safeguard the child.</p>

	<p pid=".125W.3/1">We have not had specific representations about abuse of disabled adults. However, the Department of Health liaises closely with a number of organisations who represent vulnerable adults and the Government is aware of their concerns in this area.</p>
	<p pid=".125W.3/2">The abuse of vulnerable adults is of great concern to the Government. We have already instigated a range of general measures, such as the National Service Framework for Older People and National Minimum Standards for particular aspects of service provision, to raise the standards of care of older people and other vulnerable adults. It has implemented specific measures to tackle abuse, principally &quot;No Secrets&quot; guidance, which councils, the NHS and police forces have used to establish and strengthen their local procedures for preventing and tackling abuse. By June 2004, we intend to introduce the Protection of Vulnerable Adults list, which in practice will amount to a workforce ban on those who have abused or mistreated vulnerable adults in their care.</p>
	<p pid=".125W.3/3">The Department for Education and Skills regularly receives correspondence from parents and voluntary groups about issues affecting disabled children including child protection. This has included reports from the NSPCC, the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, and the National Working Group on Child Protection and Disability, which have influenced policy development. In particular, recent representations from the NSPCC were taken into account by the Disabled Children's External Working Group developing standards as part of the National Service Framework for Children, Young People and Maternity Services which will be published later this year.</p>
	<p pid=".125W.3/4">The Joint Chief Inspectors' Report Safeguarding Children, published in October 2002, contained a recommendation that all relevant Inspectorates should ensure that, prior to the next report, appropriate inspection activity had been undertaken on children with disabilities.</p>
	<p pid=".125W.3/5"><i>Safeguarding Children </i>asked Chief Inspectors to consider whether there was a need to supplement the planned programme of inspections in any way. In planning for the next children's safeguards review, the Inspectorates have identified that additional acitivity is required in relation to children with disabilities and special needs and are developing plans to enhance their programmes in this area.</p>
	<p pid=".125W.3/6">Local mechanisms for safeguarding disabled children are set out in chapter six of the Government's child protection guidance, &quot;Working Together to Safeguard Children (1999)&quot;.</p>

Friends in the Department for Constitutional Affairs, we are considering carefully how the family justice system and related children's services can better meet the needs of all children and their parents following relationship breakdown. We want to ensure that better outcomes are achieved for children by, where possible, helping parents agree contact arrangements without the intervention of the courts. We expect to conclude these considerations in the early part of this year and then to publish the Government's response to the Children Act Sub-Committee's report 'Making Contact Work'.</p>

	<p pid=".128W.3/1">There are 149 Children's Fund partnerships in England. These are listed in the annexe together with their lead and accountable bodies. The programme was launched in November 2001 and runs until March 2006. Each partnership is made up of representatives from the voluntary and statutory sector.</p>
	<p pid=".128W.3/2">Children's Fund partnerships will continue to receive grants for 2004&ndash;05 and 2005&ndash;06. These grants will enable the partnerships to continue to deliver preventive services for five to 13-year-olds in their area. In the early years of the programme the Partnerships under spent their allocations. To avoid this recurring partnerships were allowed to increase their planned commitment with increased allocations and monies used for other initiatives for five to 13-year-olds. However, it has become clear that the partnerships have been more effective in their spending, to the point that they are spending more closely to profile. In order to avoid over-spends, not permitted under Government accounting, the Department is taking action now so as to reduce the levels of over-commitment without damaging the programmes already in place.</p>
	<p pid=".128W.3/3">A mid year review of expenditure was undertaken in November 2003 to identify and take back genuine under spend from the first half of 2003&ndash;04 and to estimate and take back likely under spends from the second half of the year.</p>
	<p pid=".128W.3/4">The Department did not have a formal process for appealing against mid year review decisions. However, following representations from 11 partnerships, the Department wrote to all 149 on <phrase class="date" code="">19 December</phrase>. We advised them that decisions on taking back under spend would be revisited where they were too harsh and that we would restore funds where partnerships ability to meet contractual commitments were compromised by our decisions. These measures will ensure the mid year review does not mean partnerships have to implement redundancies or close services. I expect the process of identifying the total number that need funds restored to be completed by the end of January.</p>
	<p pid=".128W.3/5">In a letter to all partnerships before Christmas the Department also explained that there was over-commitment in the programme and that there will therefore be some reduction in allocations for 2004&ndash;05 and 2005&ndash;06 in order that the programme can spend within its limits. Officials are currently assessing the extent of over-commitment in the programme. I expect this work to be completed by the end of January so that we can confirm partnerships' allocations for 2004&ndash;05. Until then we have advised partnerships not to commission any new services.</p>
	<p pid=".128W.3/6">There has not been any closure of Children's Fund partnerships. It is a key characteristic of the fund that decisions on which services to commission are taken locally, not by central Government, against the aims and objectives of the Children's Fund programme. Partnerships themselves may decide which services to retain or close at any time, in response to evolving local circumstances.</p>

As a result of the extra investment, the number of students entering medical school will increase to over 7,300 in 2005.

	<p pid=".139W.0/1">I have not commissioned such research. Medical students do not have to repay student loans until they graduate and earn over &pound;15,000 per year. Doctors earn considerably in excess of the national average: a newly qualified GP can expect to earn over &pound;45,000, and will receive considerably more than that in time. Consultants will earn even more. So medical graduates will be able to pay off their student loan for living costs and for tuition fees comparatively rapidly.</p>

From April 2004, six months ahead of the original target, the entitlement will be extended to all three year olds. A free place consists of a minimum of five two and a half hour sessions for thirty-three weeks of the year.

	<p pid=".142W.5/20"><sup>(34)</sup> Family Support Helpline extension, as detailed below</p>
	<p pid=".142W.5/21">The Home Office commissioned an evaluation of the Parentline Plus family support helpline. This was carried out between August 2002 and March 2003 by the Thomas Coram Research Unit at the Institute of Education, University of London, and will be published on the Home Office website shortly. The evaluation recognised that Parentline Plus provides a good quality helpline service to over 60,000 callers pa (three quarters of whom were first-time callers), and that further expansion in the helpline service is necessary to meet demand from callers. The charity makes significant use of trained volunteers.</p>
	<p pid=".142W.5/22">The main work supported by the recent &pound;762,690 investment from the Parenting Fund is:</p>
	<p pid=".142W.5/23" class="indent">(a) expanding helpline provision to answer 75,000 calls pa (equivalent to a 25per cent. increase in call numbers);</p>
	<p pid=".142W.5/24" class="indent">(b) developing and piloting an email service to answer an anticipated 10,000 emails pa;</p>
	<p pid=".142W.5/25" class="indent">(c) developing and piloting a more efficient system for call handling, in particular for improved ways of working with more specialist providers of family support advice;</p>
	<p pid=".142W.5/26" class="indent">(d) developing a ring-back telephone support service offering more detailed support to those parents who need most help;</p>
	<p pid=".142W.5/27" class="indent">(e) establishing telephone-based parenting groups; and</p>
	<p pid=".142W.5/28" class="indent">(f) promotion of the helpline and email service.</p>
	<p pid=".142W.5/29">Staffing and systems at Parentline Plus will be flexible so that call-takers can deal with either telephone calls or emails. This means that the 75,000 telephone call/10,000 email balance may change, to best meet demand. It is therefore not possible to quote the cost per email dealt with. It is not possible to state the exact number of parents benefiting from recent investment, although the number of calls/emails are detailed above.</p>

The governing body cannot refuse. In Essex funding is delegated in budget shares for all schools and consequently the statutory duties rest with the schools' governing bodies. If the authority provides a 'buy-back' service a school may choose to purchase that from the authority; if it does not, the school governing body must make alternative provision. The Department is in touch with Essex County Council regarding support for schools as the current contract comes to an end.</p>

Courses funded by the Department for Education and Skills through the Teacher Training Agency and which lead to the award of Qualified Teacher Status by the General Teaching Council for England are governed by the Education (School Teachers' Qualifications) (England) Regulations 2003. These require that any periods of practical experience undertaken as part of a course of initial teacher training in England must take place wholly or mainly at schools in England, but do not preclude some periods of teaching experience taking place elsewhere. The same regulations provide for the automatic recognition in England of teaching qualifications awarded by the General Teaching Council for Wales.</p>

	<p pid=".159W.2/3" class="indent">(b) The impact on council tax payers should be considered by authorities when considering reserves. This may point to spreading any burden on council tax payers over a number of years.</p>
	<p pid=".159W.2/4" class="indent">(c) The level of risk will not change as a result of the move to precepting status. CFAs should explore arrangements with their constituent authorities that reflect this.</p>

This applies to all authorities, including fire and rescue authorities. My right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister is prepared to use his capping powers if necessary. When considering capping, the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister would want to look closely at local authorities' budgets and council tax rises before coming to a view on what might be appropriate factors to take into account.</p>

	<p pid=".166W.8/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid=".166W.8/2">The Social Exclusion Unit report on reducing re-offending by released prisoners, published in July 2002, recommended that the Government develop and implement a National Rehabilitation Strategy involving all relevant departments and agencies. In response, the Home Office has set up two inter-departmental groups of Ministers and officials to develop an action plan planned for publication in early 2004. Its work strands include finance and benefits; drugs; health; employment, training and education; children and families; and accommodation.</p>
	<p pid=".166W.8/3">Within the accommodation strand, the Home Office, Office of the Deputy Prime Minister (ODPM), and the Department for Work and Pensions are working together to devise an accommodation strategy for offenders. This will aim initially to increase the number of people leaving prison with some form of accommodation arranged. Its longer terms aims will be: to assess and identify the particular accommodation needs of each offender; to enable offenders to maintain or, where appropriate/to close down their accommodation while in custody; and to develop systems that enable offenders to access appropriate and sustainable housing options on release. The strategy will encompass the roles and responsibilities of the correctional services, local authorities and other housing providers, the voluntary sector and Jobcentre Plus. Pilots are currently being developed to test how best to join up these services, working initially with street crime offenders.</p>
	<p pid=".166W.8/4">The strategy will build on some important provisions already in place in the community and custody: the Homelessness Act 2002; the Homelessness (Priority Need for Accommodation) (England) Order 2002; the Supporting People programme; and the Prison Service's Custody to Work Initiative.</p>

	<p pid=".194W.2/1">People who have experienced a stroke for the first time should be admitted to hospital for immediate assessment and to plan for their rehabilitation. Many stroke units are now developing early discharge schemes to help some people (usually those with satisfactory domestic caring arrangements) to return home at an early opportunity to continue rehabilitation at home for a few more weeks. Most disabled stroke patients who are discharged from hospital at any stage of their care will benefit from a period of post-discharge rehabilitation. This has been shown to stabilise the patient's function and make a small additional improvement in independence. During the period following discharge, there will also commonly be contact with mainstream health and social care community services. These will include: the patient's general practitioner; community nurses; and the home care service. These contacts often continue long-term for patients with persisting disability. The national service framework for older people has stipulated that stroke patients should have a review, performed by a stroke co-ordinator six months after discharge, to reassess their care needs.</p>

	<p pid=".195W.6/1">Under sections 9(1) and 18(2) of the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986, members of the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Inspectorate provide the Secretary of State with expert technical advice about whether and on what terms applications for licences and certificates should be granted, and on their review, amendment or variation. The Inspectorate is the only source of such advice considered necessary in dealing with most applications for project licences, personal licences and certificates of designation. The Inspectorate has no powers to grant, refuse, revoke or vary licences or certificates. That responsibility lies with the Secretary of State.</p>
	<p pid=".195W.6/2">Where issues arising from project licence applications prompt the Secretary of State to seek advice from other experts, the 1986 Act makes provision, under section 9(1), for the appointment of independent assessors. This option is seldom used, but may be exercised in a variety of circumstances. For example, advice may be sought when the issues raised require specific, expert knowledge not available within the Inspectorate. It may also be appropriate when there is debate within the scientific or welfare communities, or between the Inspectorate and an applicant, as to the scientific validity of the hypothesis or methodology; the scope for further refinement of the programme of work; the benefits likely to arise from a programme of work; or the welfare costs to the animals.</p>
	<p pid=".195W.6/3">Section 12 of the Act defines the actions to be taken by the Secretary of State when it is proposed to refuse an application for authorities under the Act, or to vary or revoke existing authorities other than with the consent of the holder of the licence or certificate. In such circumstances, the Act allows the appointment of a person of suitable legal qualification to consider any representations against such proposals and to report the outcome to the Secretary of State..</p>
	<p pid=".195W.6/4">Sections 19 and 20 of the 1986 Act establish the Animal Procedures Committee, an independent body created to advise the Secretary of State on matters concerned with the Act and the Secretary of State's powers under it. The Committee may consider and advise on matters of its own choosing, as well as those that are referred to it by the Secretary of State. In its considerations, the Committee must have regard both to the legitimate requirements of science and industry and to the protection of animals against avoidable suffering and unnecessary use in scientific procedures. The Committee regularly publishes general advice to Ministers, most recently in its reports on the use of non-human primates and on the cost benefit assessment, and also offers additional advice on the limited range of project licence applications referred to it.</p>
	<p pid=".195W.6/5">The Secretary of State is not bound by the advice received from the Inspectorate, assessors, persons appointed to consider representations, or the Animal Procedures Committee, in respect of licence applications. Such advice only informs the Secretary of State's decision.</p>
	<p pid=".195W.6/6">More generally, as the Home Office Minister responsible for the implementation of the 1986 Act, I regularly meet representatives of the scientific community and animal welfare and animal protection groups, as well as Ministerial colleagues in other Government Departments and Members of Parliament, to discuss policy relating to the use of animals in scientific procedures. I also receive correspondence and a variety of reports and written representations from these and other sources on the use of animals in scientific procedures.</p>

The exact location of the Liverpool Community Justice Centre is due to be announced later this year to ensure that the Justice Centre can commence operations at the end of 2004.</p>

	<p pid=".200W.8/1">The national Persistent Offender Scheme was launched in April 2003. It is a component of Local Criminal Justice Boards' action plans to increase the number of offences brought to justice, aimed at targeting a small group of prolific offenders who are responsible for a disproportionate amount of crime. Areas have devised their own 'premium service' protocols which include elements of proactive policing, improved investigation and case management, priority court listings, and strategies for rehabilitation.</p>
	<p pid=".200W.8/2">The National Probation Service is piloting 15 Intensive Supervision and Monitoring Schemes (ISMSs) for persistent offenders in local probation/police areas. All Schemes involve joint working between probation and police. In addition, some Schemes are testing mechanisms for involving the prison service in pre-release work with persistent offenders. ISMSs target the most prolific offenders in a locality, based on police intelligence. They provide intensive surveillance and supervision of offenders, offering fast access to services and support for rehabilitation, alongside swift action and penalties for non-compliance. They involve other partner agencies such as providers of housing, education and training, alcohol and drug abuse treatment groups and employment services.</p>
	<p pid=".200W.8/3">In addition, the Government has given the courts new secure remand and tagging powers for 12- to 16-year olds who repeatedly offend on bail, funded the Youth Justice Board'sIntensive Supervision and Surveillance Programmes for the most prolific young offenders and renewed its commitment to maintain the time from arrest to sentence for persistent young offenders at or below 71 days.</p>

	<p pid=".201W.2/1">None. The Scheme has functioned effectively since its inception in 1964 without the need to define what is meant by such terms as 'criminal injury' or 'crime of violence'. Any detailed definition runs the risk of being too prescriptive and excluding borderline cases where discretion might reasonably be exercised. There would also be the risk of failing to include sufficient scope to accommodate changes in the nature of crime, such as deliberately infecting someone with Aids, or stalking. We consider that in its present form the Scheme strikes an appropriate balance between breath of scope and necessary clarification.</p>

	<p pid=".206W.2/1">Following successful pilots of the Auld recommendation to increase the role of crown prosecutors in charging decisions, measures to put this on a statutory footing have been enacted in the Criminal Justice Act 2003. The relevant provisions will be brought into effect in April 2004, and the new arrangements will then be implemented on an area-by-area basis.</p>
	<p pid=".206W.2/2">In preparation for that implementation, Crown Prosecution Service areas and their police partners are establishing shadow charging arrangements in each area. This will provide an infrastructure of duty prosecutors working in police operational units to provide on-the-spot advice to investigators, to be available for early consultation in investigations, and to make charging decisions in a wide range of cases.</p>
	<p pid=".206W.2/3">Early guidance will focus on the lines of enquiry to be pursued in individual cases, the likely charges to be preferred and the evidential requirements to support these. Guidance will also be given on the case preparation requirements in each individual case.</p>
	<p pid=".206W.2/4">Charging decisions will be made by crown prosecutors following a review of all the available evidence in each case. Where the evidence presented by an officer is insufficient for the charging decision to be made at that time, further guidance will be given on continuing case preparation and evidential requirements.</p>

	<p pid=".207W.5/1">The Youth Justice Board (YJB) commissioned an internal study from PA Consulting on the factors inhibiting or assisting the take up of early release.</p>
	<p pid=".207W.5/2">PA's report, in September 2003, found that establishments generally saw early release as a useful incentive to influence the behaviour of trainees serving terms of eight months or more. Where early release was not granted, the main reasons were decisions by review meetings that trainees were unsuitable; lack of appropriate accommodation for them to go to; and young people's refusal of early release. PA recommended monitoring the reasons for decisions not to agree early release; investigating ways of improving the availability of suitable accommodation; and developing a system to record centrally the outcomes of early release decisions. The YJB are pursuing these recommendations.</p>

	<p pid=".210W.2/1">The Home Office has not carried out a survey specifically addressing public attitudes to the Home Detention Curfew (HDC) scheme but the scheme has been running successfully for over four years and public confidence in the Prison Service over this period has remained good. Ministers regularly receive correspondence about the scheme. Most of this concerns individual cases; only a small proportion expresses any concerns about the principles that underpin HDC.</p>

	<p pid=".211W.2/1">The Cabinet Office Study on Identity Fraud (published in 2002) estimated the cost of identity fraud in a number of Government departments. According to the Study the main departments affected by identity fraud are Department of Health, Customs and Excise, Department for Work and Pensions and the Home Office&mdash;the amount lost in 2000&ndash;01 was estimated to be &pound;681 million.</p>
	<p pid=".211W.2/2">The incorporation of biometric information into identity documents, which was announced by my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary in his statement on a national identity cards scheme, will provide a unique link between the identity document and the person to whom it is issued. This will allow Government departments who provide a public service to identify uniquely whom they are dealing with and therefore help to prevent losses caused by identity fraud.</p>
	<p pid=".211W.2/3">Identity cards will also allow Government departments to prevent unauthorised access to services, an example would be claims to free non-emergency NHS treatment by people whose immigration status does not entitle them to this treatment.</p>
	<p pid=".211W.2/4">The Home Office has recently established a cross public-private sector work programme to tackle identity theft and identity fraud. This programme is specifically examining:</p>
	<p pid=".211W.2/5" class="indent">policy development (eg identify opportunities for combating identity fraud through data sharing or creating new criminal offences)</p>
	<p pid=".211W.2/6" class="indent">developing and sharing good practice (eg improving the procedures for checking and issuing official documents such as passports and driving licences)</p>
	<p pid=".211W.2/7" class="indent">scoping studies and potential pilots to identify new systems to counter identity fraud</p>
	<p pid=".211W.2/8">In addition to this work, the Passport Service is piloting a system to conduct more background checks on passport applications. DVLA is working with the Passport Service and other Government Departments to raise the quality of its identity checks using good practice already identified elsewhere.</p>
	<p pid=".211W.2/9">We have also looked at legislative changes to make identity theft or fraud easier to prosecute or to ensure that the penalties associated with fraudulent use of documents reflect their use in creating false, or stealing genuine, identities. The Criminal Justice Act 2003 changed the law to align the penalty associated with fraudulently obtaining a driving licence with that for fraudulently obtaining a passport and to make these offences arrestable. This will ensure consistency of approach during prosecution so that fraudulently obtaining either document will incur a maximum penalty of two years imprisonment, serving as a more effective deterrent and ensuring that neither document is considered a weak link in establishing a false identity.</p>
	<p pid=".211W.2/10">We have also announced our intention to create a new offence relating to being in possession or control of false identity documents, without reasonable cause. This offence will provide the police with the means to disrupt the activities of organised criminals and terrorists at an earlier stage of their activities.</p>
	<p pid=".211W.2/11">The Home Office and its Agencies take every reasonable action to identify fraudsters and pass on their details to the police for appropriate action.</p>
	<p pid=".211W.2/12">We are satisfied that an identity cards scheme that complies with the Data Protection and Human Rights Act can be developed and implemented, just like other similar schemes operating currently in European countries.</p>
	<p pid=".211W.2/13">&quot;Identity Cards&mdash;The Next Steps&quot; (Cm 6020), published in November 2003, by my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary explained that the National Identity Register would only contain basic identity information such as name, address, date of birth, gender, immigration status and a confirmed biometric&mdash;and that this will be set out in statute. Organisations using the National Register to verify identity will not be able to get other personal information, for instance health or tax records, via the Register.</p>
	<p pid=".211W.2/14">The police and other organisations will not have routine access to data stored on the National Register. However, there are strong arguments for giving them access to help fight serious crime and terrorism. Such access will be set out in statute and there will be independent oversight of the arrangements as there is at the present time. There will be no new power for the police to stop someone and demand to see their card.</p>

	<p pid=".214W.0/1">There have been discussions with the Irish Government at both Ministerial and official level about those aspects of the introduction of identity cards which are of particular relevance of them, including the Common Travel Area. The Common Travel Area cover the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man as well as Ireland, and the UK and its operation affects everyone travelling within it, whatever their nationality. Routine immigration checks are not carried out on people travelling within the area. The Government's proposals for identity cards do not compromise the principle of the Common Travel Area. Discussions will continue with the Irish Government on those issues.</p>

	<p pid=".214W.3/1">Following the conclusion of the consultation on Entitlement Cards and Identity Fraud in July 2003, the Home Office is taking work forward on the introduction of identity cards, including examining the role identity cards could have in countering identity theft and fraud.</p>
	<p pid=".214W.3/2">In addition to this work, the Passport Service is piloting a system to conduct more background checks on passport applications. DVLA is working with the Passport Service and other Government Departments to raise the quality of its identity checks using good practice already identified elsewhere.</p>
	<p pid=".214W.3/3">We have also looked at legislative changes to make identity theft or fraud easier to prosecute or to ensure that the penalties associated with fraudulent use of documents take account of their use in creating false, or stealing genuine, identities. The Criminal Justice Act 2003 changed the law to align the penalty associated with fraudulently obtaining a driving licence with that for fraudulently obtaining a passport and to make these offences arrestable. This will ensure consistency of approach during prosecution so that fraudulently obtaining either document will incur a maximum penalty of two years imprisonment, serving as a more effective deterrent and ensuring that neither document is considered a weak link.</p>
	<p pid=".214W.3/4">We also announced in 2003 our intention to create a new offence relating to being in possession or control of false identity documents, without reasonable cause. This offence will provide the police with the means to disrupt the activities of organised criminals and terrorists at an earlier stage of their activities.</p>
	<p pid=".214W.3/5">The Home Office has recently established a cross public-private sector work programme to tackle identity theft and identity fraud. This programme is specifically examining:</p>
	<p pid=".214W.3/6" class="indent">policy development (e.g. identify opportunities for combating ID fraud through data sharing or creating new criminal offences);</p>
	<p pid=".214W.3/7" class="indent">developing and sharing good practice (e.g. improving the procedures for checking and issuing official documents such as passports and driving licences); and</p>
	<p pid=".214W.3/8" class="indent">scoping studies and potential pilots to identify new systems to counter ID fraud.</p>

	<p pid=".215W.2/1">It is not currently a criminal offence for a person simply to use another identity.

Under the International Criminal Court Act 2001, the United Kingdom can also reach agreement with the Court so that persons convicted by the Court can serve their prison sentences in this country.</p>

The Crown Prosecution Service are co-located and work closely with the police from an early stage of investigation to progress cases through the courts. In one case last year a defendant was charged and convicted in the Liverpool Crown court in 30 hours.</p>

	<p pid=".222W.11/23">The Prison Service is also developing a violence reduction strategy that re-addresses problems of inter-prisoner violence and bullying by providing a national framework of protective mechanisms and positive behaviour management. A new national cell-sharing risk assessment tool was introduced in June 2002 to enable staff at reception to identify those who may be high-risk prisoners, to prevent cell sharing that may generate prisoner-on-prisoner assaults, and to take the necessary steps to minimise potential harm to others. This procedure is currently being revised in the light of the alleged homicide in 2003.</p>

	<p pid=".225W.2/1">The prison projections model has been shown to be accurate in predicting the prison population given the correct assumptions about sentencing. It is not possible to be certain about the direction of future trends in sentencing because trends observed over a number of years cannot be assumed to continue. It is for this reason that the projections cover a range of different scenarios and are regularly updated to take account of changing trends and new policies affecting the prison population. The central projections were updated in the summer and published in the April Prison Population Brief in September. The actual prison population was 116 below the projection used for planning purposes on <phrase class="date" code="2003-12-12">12 December 2003</phrase>.</p>

	<p pid=".226W.2/2">Private sector contractors are responsible for carrying out the movement of prisoners from courts to prisons. Remand and convicted prisoners, including male and female prisoners, can travel in the same vehicle. No central record of journey times is kept, nor is it possible to identify any differences in journey times between remand and convicted, male and female prisoners.</p>
	<p pid=".226W.2/3">Contractors are required to deliver prisoners to courts before 9.30 am and back to prisons before their receptions close. Contract managers are robust in monitoring their performance and there are financial remedies built into the present contracts for failure to deliver prisoners to prisons on time.</p>

	<p pid=".231W.2/1">The Home Office is working on a value for money case for a replacement programme to create a new generation of larger prisons with the facilities needed to deliver effective programmes designed to reduce re-offending. New large prisons could also provide economies of scale, which would allow us to close some smaller prisons and redirect resources to community punishments. This case will be subject of discussion in the forthcoming Spending Review the outcome of which will be published. We will not publish the case we make to the Treasury on which decisions are taken.</p>
	<p pid=".231W.2/2">There is an established procedure for the announcement of decisions to change the role of or close prisons. Once Ministers take a decision to change the role of or close a prison, staff and local MP's affected by the change or closure are briefed before the formal announcement.</p>
	<p pid=".231W.2/3">A survey has been commissioned to identify suitable sites for new, large prisons although no sites have yet been purchased or other commitments made. To be effective in delivering regimes that aid rehabilitation and reduce re-offending new sites need to be close to, or have good transport links with, large conurbations. The search is concentrating on sites available in London and the south east, the west Midlands, the north west and Wales. These are the regions that have the greatest need for additional prison capacity at this stage.</p>

	<p pid=".233W.5/1">The three relevant Home Office Inspectorates are Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary, Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Prisons and Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Probation. I am not able to comment on action by other Inspectorates.</p>
	<p pid=".233W.5/2">Inspection activity is currently being undertaken by the Home Office Inspectorates in respect of relevant aspects of recommendation 2.15 of the joint Chief Inspectors' report, as follows:</p>
	<p pid=".233W.5/3">(a) In relation to young offender institutions, inspection of child protection arrangements is a central part of each inspection by Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Prisons of Young Offender Institutions and Immigration Removal Centres holding children and young people aged under 18 years. Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Prisons also advises Her Majesty's Prison Service on children's safeguarding matters, for example supporting a recent review of safeguarding arrangements in all Young Offender Institutions holding children. The inspectorate also undertakes joint inspection of Secure Training Centres with the Social Service Inspectorate.</p>
	<p pid=".233W.5/4">(b) In relation to the impact of domestic violence on children:</p>
	<p pid=".233W.5/5" class="indent">Police issues: Domestic violence is an area of police activity specifically considered by Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMIC) during scheduled Inspections of police forces undertaken during a year. In addition, during 2003, a joint inspection of domestic violence was undertaken by HMIC and the Crown Prosecution Services Inspectorate, which included specific consideration of children's safeguarding issues. The report is due to be published early in 2004. A major HMIC Thematic Inspection on Child Protection is also planned for 2004, to address one of the recommendations made by Lord Laming following the Climbie Inquiry.</p>
	<p pid=".233W.5/6" class="indent">Probation issues: A thematic element on domestic violence, with a clear focus on children, has been included in the main inspection programme of probation areas by Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Probation&mdash;the Effective Supervision Inspection programme. The report on this element is due to be published in summer 2004. The Effective Supervision Inspection programme also includes general consideration of child protection issues in all probation areas.</p>
	<p pid=".233W.5/7">(c) In relation to the work of Youth Offending Teams (YOTs), a joint inspection programme of YOTs is under way, led by Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Probation with involvement from Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary and Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Prisons (along with four other inspectorates). The methodology has been designed to ensure that children's safeguarding issues are covered specifically from early in 2004.</p>
	<p pid=".233W.5/8">More generally, alongside the specific work above, the Government have put in place arrangements to commission from the Chief Inspectors of services involved with children a joint report on children's safeguards every three years. The next report is due in 2005, A Steering Group involving nine Inspectorates or other regulatory bodies and led by the Social Services Inspectorate has been established to prepare for this.</p>
	<p pid=".233W.5/9">It is intended that the aim of the report will be:</p>
	<p pid=".233W.5/10" class="indent">To review the arrangements across agencies to safeguard children, giving particular attention to children's views and experiences, progress since the last report and the areas identified within the first review as requiring more attention. The review will result in a report to Government making recommendations as necessary.</p>
	<p pid=".233W.5/11">The themes and subject areas identified have been chosen to ensure that each of the issues highlighted in recommendation 2.15 of the last report is covered. Much of the inspection work will relate to cross-cutting issues between agencies.</p>

	<p pid=".235W.2/1">The Government are currently considering ways in which further support may be provided to victims of sexual crime. This objective may be achieved through the use of Sexual Assault Referral Centres (SARCs); rape crisis and other counselling and support services; national or local telephone helplines; or some combination of these. We are looking at all the options as part of the work being undertaken to implement the national strategy for victims and witnesses, which was published in July 2003.</p>
	<p pid=".235W.2/2">An Inter Departmental Ministerial Group (IDMG) on Sexual Offending has been set up. It comprises representation from the Home Office, Department of Health, Department for Education and Skills, Department for Work and Pensions, Department for Constitutional Affairs, Law Officers' Department, Department of Trade and Industry and the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister. The group will focus on: prevention, protection, and support; taking forward the implementation of the Sexual Offences Act; and promoting an effective, joined up approach to tackling sexual offending. The Inter Departmental Ministerial Group will consider provisions for victims of sexual offences, including issues around the development and funding of SARCs throughout England and Wales.</p>
	<p pid=".235W.2/3">The Home Office has funded research into three existing SARCs: St. Mary's, Reach and Star. The interventions, which were funded from July 2000 to the end of March 2003, included: training a forensic nurse to conduct forensic examinations; an intervention to help reduce attrition; and an intervention to support young victims of sexual violence. An independent evaluation of these interventions and of the overall services of the three SARCs has now been completed and the findings are due to be published in late spring 2004.</p>
	<p pid=".235W.2/4">No directive has been issued to the police or health trusts on the role that they ought to play in the establishment of SARCs. The research findings and the Inter Departmental Ministerial Group will inform future policy on the development and funding of SARCs, including the development of good practice guidance. This will draw on the experience of existing SARC managers and victims.</p>
	<p pid=".235W.2/5">Many existing SARCs are based at hospitals and the police have worked closely with health trusts in their establishment. However, different models of SARC will be best suited to different areas and the needs of the local community. Funding of existing SARCs has been negotiated and agreed locally, in most cases between the police and local health authority. The cost of establishing and running a SARC will vary according to the model.</p>
	<p pid=".235W.2/6">The Home Office recently made funds available to support the development of SARCs. In September all police authorities were invited to bid for this funding. Grant offers are being finalised and an announcement will follow shortly.</p>

	<p pid=".236W.2/1">The requirement for sex offenders to notify the police of their name and address was introduced in the Sex Offenders Act 1997 and has proved an invaluable tool in helping the police to monitor convicted sex offenders within their area. An offender who is subject to the notification requirements must inform the police within 14 days of using a new name or moving to a new address. A failure to comply with the requirements is a criminal offence, with the maximum punishment set at five years imprisonment. We estimate that compliance with the requirements is currently around 97 per cent.</p>
	<p pid=".236W.2/2">We are improving the notification requirements through the Sexual Offences Act 2003. Once the Act comes into force, relevant offenders will have to go to their local police station at least once every 12 months to confirm that the details held by the police are correct. They will also have to provide the police with their national insurance number and notify any change to their name or address within three days, rather than the current 14 days.</p>
	<p pid=".236W.2/3">The Sexual Offences Act also includes a new power which will enable the information notified by registered sex offenders to be regularly checked against information held by the Department of Work and Pensions, the UK Passport Service and the Driver Vehicle and Licensing Agency. The purpose of this is to verify that the information notified by relevant offenders is correct and this will help to identify more quickly those cases where an offender assumes a new name or address without telling the police or where an offender absconds.</p>
	<p pid=".236W.2/4">Sex offenders who are subject to the notification requirements will also:</p>
	<p pid=".236W.2/5" class="indent">(a) continue to be visited by police officers as part of the routine management of sex offenders living in the community;</p>
	<p pid=".236W.2/6" class="indent">(b) be subject to the Multi-Agency Public Protection Arrangements which provide an increasingly effective way of enhancing public protection through better joint-agency working, including intelligence on where an offender is living and any other homes they may use;</p>
	<p pid=".236W.2/7" class="indent">(c) have their details recorded on the new Violent and Sex Offender Register (ViSOR) database which will hold additional information and improve the sharing of intelligence between law enforcement agencies.</p>

	<p pid=".239W.5/1">The significant increase in the female prison population, and the wider consequences of this in terms of disruption to their families, particularly their children, underlines the importance of using custody as a last resort.</p>
	<p pid=".239W.5/2">The Women's Offending Reduction Programme (WORP) is a three-year programme that aims to promote a more focused and joined-up response to the range of factors that have an impact on why women offend.</p>
	<p pid=".239W.5/3">A long-term aim of the WORP is to reduce the number of women in custody. We are particularly concerned about the 58 per cent. of women held on remand who do not go on to receive a custodial sentence. This is why the WORP focuses on the need to maximise the opportunities for diversion at the pre-sentence stage.</p>
	<p pid=".239W.5/4">Gender specific training and guidance for sentencers, court report writers and bail information staff will be supported by the development of more appropriate community interventions that are better tailored to meet the needs of women, particularly those with mental health and substance misuse problems. Ensuring appropriate housing or bail hostel provision for women will also be key to reducing the use of remand. The potential for diversion is likely to be increased by improving the court's confidence in available community provision.</p>

	<p pid=".240W.2/1">Arrangements for escorting juveniles home on release are made on a case-by-case basis, usually at the final review meeting at the end of the period in custody. The preferred arrangement is for a parent, relation or other carer to meet the young person and take him or her home. Where this is not possible&mdash;for example, where alternative accommodation has been arranged&mdash;a youth offending team worker will usually accompany the young person.</p>
	<p pid=".240W.2/2">In reaching decisions the age and assessed vulnerability of the young person is always taken into account.</p>

	<p pid=".240W.5/1">To ensure that effective treatment is available when it is needed, we have made significant investments in the youth justice system and drug treatment sector throughout the United Kingdom with the north west and Lancashire among those areas benefiting.</p>
	<p pid=".240W.5/2">Sustained investment in young peoples drug treatment, means that by March 2004 95 per cent. of all drug action teams (DATs) will provide a minimum of six different types of treatment interventions, which meet a tough set of young peoples focused quality standards. The interventions include restricted and Tier 3 services.</p>
	<p pid=".240W.5/3">In addition, the Youth Justice Board (YJB) is providing &pound;8.5million funding each year to give all 155 youth offending teams across England and Wales access to an allocated named drugs worker. The drugs worker is able to assess the needs of young people and ensure that they receive appropriate treatment or other interventions. This project is currently being evaluated by the Home Office.</p>
	<p pid=".240W.5/4">An arrest referral scheme for young people is currently being piloted, to get young offenders into treatment or other appropriate interventions as early as possible. &pound;6 million is being invested to pilot arrest referral for young people in 10 high crime areas across England including Liverpool and Manchester. Trained staff in the police custody suites identify if young people have a substance misuse issue and refer them to appropriate treatment or intervention.</p>

	<p pid=".241W.2/1">Young offenders should be deprived of their liberty only as a last resort. Courts considering a custodial sentence must be satisfied that the offending behaviour is so serious that only a custodial sentence can be justified or, in the case of a violent or sexual offence, that such a sentence is needed to protect the public from serious harm. The only other situation where custody can be given is where the young offender refuses to co-operate with the requirements of a supervision order or a drug treatment and testing order. The court must also explain in open court its reasons for giving custody.</p>
	<p pid=".241W.2/2">There is a further requirement where the court is considering making a Detention and Training Order on an offender below the age of 15: the court must additionally be satisfied that the young person is a persistent offender. (The Detention and Training Order is the standard order for offenders under 18 who are sentenced to custody).</p>

	<p pid=".241W.5/1">In 2004&ndash;05, the Youth Justice Board (YJB) for England and Wales will have a new diversity target. The precise form of words is still to be agreed but the aim will be to ensure that local youth offending teams in England and Wales have measures in place to tackle differential outcomes for different ethnic groups within the youth justice system.</p>
	<p pid=".241W.5/2">To support this target, the YJB are working with the National Association for the Care and Resettlement of Offenders to help youth offending teams to produce action plans. This work will be informed by research commissioned by the YJB from Oxford University looking at the experiences of young black people in the youth justice system. This research is due to be published early in 2004.</p>
