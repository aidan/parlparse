	<p pid=".3W.0/1">Gender equality is an essential precondition for poverty eradication and upholding human rights. Addressing domestic violence is an important component of this work. My Department is making a substantial effort to raise awareness of this complex issue, through partnerships with many poor countries, and with the donor community, including the World Health Organisation, the International Labour Organisation and the UN Development Fund for Women. Support for legal literacy, and access to justice programmes, focus on women and address the root causes of disempowerment and vulnerability to violence&mdash;especially domestic, but also by police, and in prisons.</p>
	<p pid=".3W.0/2">In working to meet our objective to increase women's personal security and reduce gender-based violence, we are supporting for example:</p>
	<p pid=".3W.0/3" class="indent">Reform and strengthening of criminal and civil law</p>
	<p pid=".3W.0/4" class="indent">Awareness-raising of women's rights among police and judiciary</p>

	<p pid=".3W.0/7" class="indent">Improved knowledge and statistics</p>
	<p pid=".3W.0/8">For illustration, DFID assistance is helping to establish the first family protection unit in the Arab world, providing &pound;2 million over three years in Jordan. We are supporting work to sensitise the police in Bangladesh to violence against women, and counselling for the survivors of domestic violence (&pound;4 million over five years). In Pakistan, we are assisting in the design of a comprehensive national strategy including awareness-raising through a national &quot;zero tolerance&quot; media campaign, and the building of referral systems to provide support and recourse for victims, and for community-based dispute resolution (&pound;2 million over three years). In Uganda, we have supported pilot work to establish policy, procedures and practical measures at community level (&pound;95,000). There are many other similar examples.</p>

	<p pid=".4W.2/1">The Iraqi people, including the children who make up half of the population, are already vulnerable. The prevalence of low birth-weight babies has increased more than five times in the last 10 years. A sudden disruption to this already fragile situation, including to the UN Oil for Food programme on which 60 per cent. of Iraqi people are dependent, could lead to a spiralling human catastrophe.</p>
	<p pid=".4W.2/2">My Department is holding regular discussions with the Ministry of Defence, the US, UN and others about ways to minimise the suffering of the Iraqi people. One key priority would be to re-establish the Oil For Food distribution network as quickly as possible if it is disrupted. We are also providing an additional &pound;3.5 million funding for support to UN humanitarian contingency planning for Iraq, including the prepositioning of food and other essential supplies. My officials continue to discuss the humanitarian situation with NGOs, especially those who we are funding for ongoing humanitarian work in Iraq, including Save the Children.</p>

	<p pid=".8W.9/1">Throughout the periods of industrial action by the Fire Brigades Union, the emergency fire cover service provided by the armed forces, supported by the police service for Northern Ireland and the retained firefighters who were not on strike, was able to deal effectively with all major fire-related and road traffic incidents. The armed forces operated well within capacity and there were no major disruptions to transport or other essential public services as a result of the dispute.</p>
	<p pid=".8W.9/2">Although there were a number of road traffic fatalities and two fire-related deaths during the strikes, there are no indications that any of these deaths could have been avoided had normal fire cover been available.</p>
	<p pid=".8W.9/3">We have always maintained that the alternative fire arrangements provided by the armed forces cannot replicate the normal firefighting capability. I therefore welcome the Fire Brigades Union decision not to set any new strike dates and to again engage in a fresh round of negotiations at the National Joint Council under the auspices of ACAS, to find a negotiated and fair settlement to this dispute.</p>

	<p pid=".9W.8/2">A first draft was prepared in 1999, but it soon became clear that more work was required, and the Trustees agreed to set up a small working group to take the matter forward. The outgoing Trustees did not have an opportunity to consider the next draft before the end of their term of office in June 2002. Since then, some further detailed work has been carried out, and it is hoped that the new Board will be able to consider and formally adopt the new draft shortly.</p>

This equipment will also allow witnesses to give evidence from a remote location.</p>

Work is currently under way to establish the number of additional video links that are required to meet current and future demand. The Court Service will then liaise with Criminal Justice System partners, including the Crown Prosecution Service and the Home Office, on how to take this forward.</p>

These include a pilot project funding duty schemes in the county courts to cover housing possession cases; and spending &pound;2 million per year on a telephone advice pilot under which several housing advice services are providing legal help. We are also working to integrate the CLS into a number of cross Government initiatives on tackling social exclusion and working closely with other Departments to increase the number of quality marked outlets for CLS information.

These developments represent a small but important increase in the number of people qualified to appear before the courts, widening the availability of legal services to the public. Reform of the law relating to conditional fees agreements has also allowed innovative products to be developed which have increased the funding options available to individuals with winnable cases.</p>

The removal of such practices could provide an incentive for lawyers, or other providers, to introduce innovative, high quality and affordable services to the public. In most cases, open and competitive markets are the best way to ensure that consumers get the best possible service, while continuing to protect consumers and ensuring probity. The Government has consulted on matters that fall to it following on from the Office of Fair Trading's report on competition in professions. We are currently considering the responses to that consultation.</p>

In a recently published report the Senior Salaries Review Body (the SSRB) stated that it was proposing to review the relationship between judicial salaries and those of the Senior Civil Service. The Lord Chancellor has asked that this review be extended to cover the statutory relationship between his own salary and that of the Lord Chief Justice.</p>
	<p pid=".17W.5/18">The Department's Ministers do not have personal expense accounts. Costs incurred by Ministers, in the course of their official duties, are met by the Department. Occasionally, Ministers pay such costs themselves and are then reimbursed, rather than having them billed direct to the Department. Since <phrase class="date" code="1997-05-01">1 May 1997</phrase>, the Lord Chancellor has paid, and been reimbursed for, the following amounts. These costs were incurred in furtherance of departmental objectives including, for example, the provision of hospitality to overseas judges.</p>

	<p pid=".27W.11/2">The National Task Force on Violence Against Social Workers recommended in 2001 that employers urgently undertook an audit of their organisation's ability to deal with violence and abuse and then did a training needs analysis for their workforce. They were then asked to prepare and begin an action plan to effect planned developments.</p>

This was created in 1999 to equip qualified social workers with the required level of knowledge, understanding and skills to carry out the full range of expectations and duties of contemporary children's personal social services. However, as part of the reform of social work education, the General Social Care Council (GSCC) is undertaking a review of the current framework for post-qualifying training for social work. This will include a review of the PQ child care award.</p>
	<p pid=".27W.11/4">In addition to this, the prescribed curriculum of the new social work degree includes the national occupational standards for social work, which require students to demonstrate the management of risk to individuals, families, carers, groups and communities and to assess, minimise and manage risk to self and colleagues.</p>

	<p pid=".31W.5/1">From <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-01">1 April</phrase> this year, for the first time we are introducing regulation to the domiciliary care sector that will bring into force new requirements for employers when checking the suitability of new employees. These new requirements will add significantly to the level of protection from abuse to vulnerable adults in their own homes.</p>
	<p pid=".31W.5/2">The protection of vulnerable adults (PoVA) list will be implemented when we are confident that the CRB are able to cope with the demand. When PoVA checks are introduced they will further enhance the level of protection offered to the recipients of domiciliary care services.</p>

	<p pid=".34W.2/1">All National Health Service hearing aid services in England will be fitting digital aids by the end of March 2005. These will be provided as appropriate for all new patients and for existing hearing aid users upon review. For adults that review would not normally be less than three years from fitting of their last aid, unless their hearing has become significantlyworse in the interim. A shorter review period applies to children's services.</p>

	<p pid=".38W.8/1">The proposed pilot project in Warwickshire, led by the South Warwickshire General Hospitals National Health Service Trust, would treat selected patients who have presented at the hospital with infections of the skin, wound or bone. The service is for patients who would be in hospital only to receive intravenous antibiotic therapy. The hospital's clinical teams would still carefully manage the patients. Patients with highly contagious infections who require isolation in hospital will continue to be treated as inpatients.</p>
	<p pid=".38W.8/2">This project is patient-centred and offers a choice to both patients and carers. The patient would have a reduced risk of hospital-acquired infection and conversely existing patients would not be exposed to the infection.</p>

	<p pid=".49W.9/1">The Government's policy towards the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) and the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention (BWC) is to work towards their universal adoption and universal compliance with their obligations.</p>
	<p pid=".49W.9/2">The United Kingdom abandoned its offensive chemical and biological weapons programmes in the 1950s. Subsequently we have played a leading role in the negotiations both of the BWC of 1975, for which we are a depositary government, and the CWC which entered into force in 1997. We are fully compliant with our obligations under both Conventions and continue to press for their full and effective implementation. To this end, both nationally and with our EU partners, we have conducted a series of demarches world-wide, with particular attention to regions of tension such as the Middle East.</p>
	<p pid=".49W.9/3">The United Kingdom was instrumental in securing a successful outcome to the BWC Review Conference in November 2002, which saw agreement on a three year work programme of practical measures to deal with the BW threat. At the forthcoming CWC Review Conference (<phrase class="date" code="2005-04-28">28 April</phrase>-<phrase class="date" code="2003-05-09">9 May 2003</phrase>) the UK will be presenting a number of important technical and scientific papers.

	<p pid=".50W.3/1">My right hon. Friend the Prime Minister has made Africa a priority for this Government. Our aims in Africa are peace and security; ending inequality and poverty; social justice and human rights; and improved political and economic governance.</p>
	<p pid=".50W.3/2">Last year at Kananaskis, the Prime Minister announced that the UK development programme for Africa will increase to 1 billion a year by 2006. Our development programme addresses the range of challenges faced by Africa and supports African governments' own efforts to achieve the internationally agreed Millennium Development Goals in Africa. For example, our work on health includes supporting the development of health systems, improving access to essential medicines and working towards eradicating polio. In education we are working with African governments to realise their aspirations of education for all.</p>
	<p pid=".50W.3/3">The UK recognises that peace and security is a prerequisite for Africa's development. In April 2001, we established the Africa Conflict Prevention Pool, which brings together all relevant government ministries to identify ways to tackle violent conflict in Africa.</p>
	<p pid=".50W.3/4">We continue to work with international financial institutions to ensure that the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) initiative achieves its aim of freeing eligible African countries from unsustainable debt. In addition, the UK goes further than required under HIPC and gives 100 per cent. debt relief to countries once they qualify. For the 22 African countries that have reached 'decision point' all repayments on their debts (worth over &pound;800 million) have ceased.</p>
	<p pid=".50W.3/5">African commitment to progress is encapsulated in the New Partnership for Africa's Development (NEPAD) where African governments have made commitments to improve political and economic governance, solve conflicts and to move forward development. The UK was one of the prime movers behind the formulation of the G8 Africa Action Plan launched at Kananaskis last year in support of NEPAD.</p>

	<p pid=".54W.2/1">In July 1992, the Consular Action Plan (CAP) was established to ensure the principles of the Citizen's Charter were introduced into consular work.</p>
	<p pid=".54W.2/2">On prison visiting, the CAP sets the target time for the first contact to be made with the detainee within 24 hours of notification of arrest and the first visit within 48 hours of that notification. Thereafter, consular staff are advised to visit at &quot;reasonable&quot; intervals, depending on the circumstances and needs of the individual prisoner. In countries where prison conditions are harsh, efforts are made to ensure that detainees receive at least quarterly visits.</p>

	<p pid=".57W.10/2">English Heritage has additionally undertaken evaluation work to identify nationally important 20th century military sites, industrial monuments and bridges in Cornwall, as well as throughout England. This work has contributed to our understanding of such archaeological sites and has identified sites for statutory designation in Cornwall. There has also been increasing involvement in more recent years with the World Heritage Site bid for Cornish Mining and a programme to protect nationally important mining remains within the selected bid areas is under way.</p>

	<p pid=".58W.2/1">The Department's responsibility for underwater archaeology primarily extends to administering the Protection of Wrecks Act 1973 in England and designating wrecks off English waters under the Act. It is the Department's policy to protect the best examples of our underwater heritage while encouraging greater access to it. To achieve this, we seek to work constructively with both the archaeological and diving communities, and to encourage co-operation between the two groups.</p>

	<p pid=".58W.5/1">Voluntary or not for profit sports clubs do not enjoy any special status under current alcohol or entertainment licensing law. They may, however, operate as registered clubs under the Licensing Act 1964 and therefore enjoy a different status to those operating under justices' licences. Under the Licensing Bill the separate system for authorisations for qualifying clubs will continue through the new club premises certificate. The Regulatory Impact Assessment that accompanies the Bill states that there are currently just over 22,000 registered clubs.</p>
	<p pid=".58W.5/2">Registered clubs are not currently completely exempt from the need for permission to have live entertainment. They need a certificate of suitability from the local authority and a special hours certificate from the magistrates if they currently wish to provide entertainment for extended hours.</p>
	<p pid=".58W.5/3">Qualifying clubs will be required to obtain authorisation to provide regulated entertainment under the Bill, this is to ensure that the activity is carried on in accordance with the requirements necessary to promote the licensing objectives: the prevention of crime and disorder; public safety; the prevention of public nuisance; and the protection of children from harm.</p>
	<p pid=".58W.5/4">The Government estimate that under the provisions of the Licensing Bill an application for a club premises certificate would cost between &pound;100 and &pound;500 with an annual charge of between &pound;50 and &pound;150 to maintain a revenue stream and cover continuing inspection and enforcement. It will cost no more, in terms of time or money, to apply for a certificate permitting the sale of alcohol and the provision of regulated entertainment than it would to apply for one permitting the sale of alcohol only. The Licensing Bill will not, therefore, impose additional costs for clubs. No specific impact assessment was carried out on not for profit sports clubs. The Regulatory Impact Assessment that accompanies the Bill estimates that voluntary associations and other non-profit making bodies would save around &pound;150 million over the first 10 years of operation.</p>

Some overseas visitors might be more reluctant to travel, but more British people might choose to holiday in the UK. We are working closely with the British Tourist Authority and the tourism industry to share information and to ensure that clear and consistent messages are provided to our potential overseas visitors.</p>

A requirement for there to be first aid equipment on the premises and members of staff trained in its use is therefore common. The application of licence conditions does not in any way replace or reduce the underlying statutory duty of employers or self-employed persons to comply with the requirements of the Health and Safety at Work etc Act 1974 and any associated regulations and codes of practice. Employers and self-employed persons are required to assess the risks to their workers and any others (e.g. members of the public) who may be affected by their business so as to identify what measures are needed to avoid or control the risks. Accordingly, the businesses would ideally need to provide first aid equipment on their premises, in working order, and at least one member of staff trained in its use.</p>

	<p pid=".62W.6/1">Our policy is to prevent joint ownership of a substantial share of the newspaper market and a substantial part of Channel 3, the only commercial public service broadcaster that currently has universal access to a mass audience. We believe this would represent an unacceptable concentration of influence.</p>
	<p pid=".62W.6/2">The Communications Bill is therefore retaining restrictions on newspaper proprietors holding Channel 3 licences. The rules in the Bill are as follows:</p>
	<p pid=".62W.6/3" class="indent">No one controlling more than 20 per cent. of the national newspaper market may hold any licence for Channel 3;</p>
	<p pid=".62W.6/4" class="indent">No one who runs a national newspaper with more than a 20 per cent. share of the total national market share may hold more than a 20 per cent. stake in any Channel 3 company;</p>
	<p pid=".62W.6/5" class="indent">No Channel 3 licence holder may be a participant with more than a 20 per cent. interest in a body which runs a national newspaper controlling 20 per cent. of the national market;</p>
	<p pid=".62W.6/6" class="indent">A company in which such a newspaper proprietor holds more than a 20 per cent. share cannot itself hold more than a 20 per cent. share in such a service.</p>
	<p pid=".62W.6/7">There is also a parallel local rule so that:</p>
	<p pid=".62W.6/8" class="indent">No one may own a Channel 3 licence if he runs local newspapers which together have more than 20 per cent. of the local market share in the coverage area of the service.</p>
	<p pid=".62W.6/9">We believe that these new rules will allow more freedoms for Channel 3 whilst at the same time safeguarding against substantial joint ownership of the newspaper market and Channel 3. We believe that there are less grounds for concern about the cross-ownership of Channel 5 by a large newspaper group, as it has a relatively small audience, does not reach the whole UK population and has fewer public service commitments than ITV. Were the nature of the service to change, however, and its audience share increase under new ownership, it will be possible to alter the public service obligations of the Channel 5 licence, and to introduce a nominated news provider system.</p>

	<p pid=".63W.2/1">The Communications Bill ensures that rules will be retained to safeguard democratic debate at national, regional and local level. In particular, there will be limits on the joint-ownership of newspapers and ITV. Newspapers are the most editorially influential mass medium, and television is people's most trusted source of information. Joint-ownership of a substantial share of the newspaper market and a substantial part of Channel 3, the only commercial public service broadcaster that currently has universal access to a mass audience, would represent an unacceptable concentration of influence. Therefore, no one owning a regional Channel 3 licence may own more than 20 per cent. of the local/regional newspaper market in the same region.</p>
	<p pid=".63W.2/2">We believe that there are less grounds for concern about the cross-ownership of Channel 5 by a large newspaper group, as it has a relatively small audience, does not reach the whole UK population and has fewer public service commitments than ITV. Were the nature of the service to change, however, and its audience share increase under new ownership, it will be possible to alter the public service obligations of the Channel 5 licence, and to introduce a nominated news provider system.</p>
	<p pid=".63W.2/3">The existence of the BBC and Channel 4 will ensure that there are at least three separately controlled free-to-air public service TV broadcasters, in addition to the expanding range of digital channels.</p>
	<p pid=".63W.2/4">There will also be a scheme to protect the range of voices that exist in the local media. Newspaper and television owners will be subject to local ownership rules that will ensure the existence of at least three local or regional commercial media voices (in TV, radio and newspapers) in most areas.</p>

	<p pid=".64W.3/1">Various assessments have been made of access to child care for women. Access to child care was fully explored in the Repeat Study of Parents' Demand for Childcare, focusing on working mothers and non-working mothers (including single mothers). Aspects of access to child care investigated included the role of child care, child care arrangements and difficulties with child care. The issue of access to child care for parents, including mothers was investigated in the 'Fifth Survey of Parents of Three and Four Year Old Children and Their Use of Early Years Services'. The survey included the amount of information available to guide their choices, the quality of education provided by their main provider and the quality of nursery education and child care provided by local providers.</p>
	<p pid=".64W.3/2">My Department has also included questions on child care in this year's Work-Life Balance surveys of employers and employees. We expect to have the findings this summer. The Women and Equality Unit have also commissioned research into women's decision-making about child care, in relation to participation in the labour market, involving minority ethnic women in particular. The findings of this research will also be available in the summer.</p>

Achievement against these targets is published annually in the Department's annual expenditure plans report (EPR) and in individual agency's own annual reports and accounts. The Department's EPR for 2003&ndash;04 to 2004&ndash;05 is due to be published in April 2003. British Trade International produces a separate EPR which is also due to be published in April 2003.

	<p pid=".69W.11/1">There are a number of factors which affect the effectiveness of scrubbers removing mercury emissions. Around 40&ndash;60 per cent. of the mercury produced during coal combustion is in the elemental vapour form and the type of wet scrubbers used on coal-fired plant (eg flue gas desulphurisation (FGD) used for sulphur dioxide control) are not effective in removing this form of mercury from the flue gas. Of the remaining mercury, which is in an oxidised form, wet emissions scrubbers have been shown to be effective. In summary, it is estimated that about 50 per cent. of mercury produced is removed by wet scrubbers. There is no information on dry scrubbers although there is research being carried out on this.</p>
	<p pid=".69W.11/2">A study on the monitoring and control of trace elements from coal-fired power generation is about to be let within the DTI's Cleaner Coal Technology Programme and this will include mercury emissions, their measurement, and their effects, and will cover the emerging legislative and policy issues.</p>

	<p pid=".76W.0/2">The Office of Fair Trading (OFT) received 83 submissions in connection with the proposed acquisition by Tesco PLC of T&amp;S Stores PLC, of which 72 were from third parties raising concerns about possible impacts on their business. It is strict OFT policy to observe confidentiality in all aspects of its operation and, as part of this, the identity of those third parties making representations is not made public. It would not, therefore, be appropriate to place a copy of the submissions in the Library.</p>
	<p pid=".76W.0/3">The OFT, as an independent competition authority, conducted an inquiry into the proposed merger, focusing on the effects of the merger on competition. It recommended that the merger should not be referred to the Competition Commission for an in-depth inquiry. In line with the Government's policy of accepting the advice of the OFT on merger references in all bar exceptional circumstances, on <phrase class="date" code="2002-12-17">17 December 2002</phrase> I announced that I would not make a reference in this case.</p>

	<p pid=".78W.0/1">The byelaws deal with the particular circumstances applying on Lake Windermere. Government policy on recreation in national parks is set out in Circular 12/96, which enjoins national park authorities to promote the widest range of recreational opportunities while fully respecting the special qualities of the parks. The circular acknowledges that the intrusive nature of some recreational activities may unacceptably affect other people's enjoyment of these nationally important areas. No particular opportunities should be excluded from the parks as a matter of principle.</p>
	<p pid=".78W.0/2">The byelaws are expected to cause fast power boating to cease on Lake Windermere, together with associated activities, of which waterskiing is the most popular. On the other hand more people may be attracted to engage in other water-based recreational pursuits when what has been seen as a fundamental problem of incompatibility between power boating and lower key activities has been solved.</p>

	<p pid=".78W.3/1">Wide consultation and a careful examination of the implications was undertaken. The Lake District National Park Authority consulted over 50 organisations representing recreational and business interests both locally and nationally, before advertising proposals locally. The authority then considered all representations in response to the advertisement before making the byelaws that will introduce a speed limit.</p>
	<p pid=".78W.3/2">The implications of the byelaws were examined in detail in 1996 at a public local inquiry held by an independent inspector. The issues examined included potential job losses and loss of revenue. The inspector concluded that the strong need for the speed limit had to be balanced against the possibility of some limited economic disruption. He found the overall balance clearly in favour of confirmation of the byelaws. In February 2000, after further views had been invited, the Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for the then Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions agreed with the inspector's conclusion. He observed that the tourist profile in the region might alter but that it was not clear whether this would result in a net economic loss or a gain.</p>
	<p pid=".78W.3/3">The byelaws came into operation on <phrase class="date" code="2000-03-29">29 March 2000</phrase> and the Secretary of State has no role in their implementation. The five year lapse until the speed limit comes into effect in 2005 should allow businesses and people who engage in power boating and waterskiing to make alternative arrangements.</p>

	<p pid=".79W.5/1">The substances listed above all have some impact on global warming, but the effect is indirect in some cases. It is not possible to calculate the specific impact on global warming of one tonne of each of the above substances, as this amount is relatively small in comparison to emission values used for climate calculations.</p>
	<p pid=".79W.5/2"><i>(a)</i> and <i>(b)</i> Large amounts of particles, known as aerosol, can either have a cooling effect on the climate by reflecting incoming solar radiation back out to space, or a warming effect, by absorbing radiation. Aerosols have a relatively short residence time in the atmosphere so their influence tends to be short-lived and regional in nature.</p>
	<p pid=".79W.5/3"><i>(c)</i> Sulphur dioxide is an indirect greenhouse gas, as it takes part in atmospheric reactions that form products that effect the climate. These reactions include some that lead to the formation of sulphate aerosol, which tends to have a cooling effect on climate, and some leading to the formation of tropospheric ozone, which is a potent greenhouse gas.</p>
	<p pid=".79W.5/4"><i>(d)</i> Carbon dioxide is the only direct greenhouse gas listed. It is the benchmark for determining the global warming potential (GWP) of other direct and indirect greenhouse gases and has a GWP of 1. Concentrations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere are increasing at a rate unprecedented in at least the last 20,000 years.</p>
	<p pid=".79W.5/5"><i>(e)</i> and <i>(f)</i> Benzene and butadiene are both Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs). They take part in atmospheric reactions related to the formation of tropospheric ozone, and act to increase levels of this greenhouse gas in the atmosphere.</p>
	<p pid=".79W.5/6"><i>(g)</i> and <i>(h)</i> Nitrogen oxides (NOx) and carbon monoxide (CO) are indirect greenhouse gases.

It also suggested that these figures should be raised in real terms by &pound;1t/C per annum as the costs of climate change are likely to increase over time. These values are currently under review following recent advances in the academic literature, and general developments in the UK Government economic appraisal guidance (such as the new Treasury Green Book).</p>

	<p pid=".82W.2/1">Biodiesel could offer an opportunity for diversification of agricultural activities and the development of new markets. Following the introduction of the reduction in duty by 20 pence per litre, compared to ultra-low sulphur diesel, in July 2002, we have yet to see biodiesel produced from British-grown oilseed rape. The duty cut is, however, already bringing forward production of biodiesel from used vegetable oil and over 60 forecourts in the UK are already retailing biodiesel. To develop biodiesel production from feedstocks from British agriculture, the return to farmers will need to be sufficient to compete with established food and animal feed markets which currently offer higher prices.</p>

	<p pid=".83W.9/1">Action to address the issue of dolphin and porpoise by-catch needs to be taken internationally, as fishing vessels from many countries are involved. We have been pressing for such action and have commissioned a programme of research and development to reinforce our arguments. Urgent action is needed in the pair trawl fishery for bass off South West England, in which the substantial bulk of vessels are from other member states. Our research programme identified a significant by-catch problem in this fishery and is now trialling a possible gear solution. This looks promising, and I am determined to achieve a solution by this or other means. The second urgent need is to deploy EU observers to identify and assess other problem fisheries. In recent weeks we have advanced the case for action by intervening at the January meeting of the Council of Agriculture and Fisheries Ministers, and I have since followed this up by writing to Commissioner Fischler. In addition, with the devolved Administrations, I will shortly be issuing a consultation document outlining a UK by-catch response strategy.</p>

The agency does not maintain central records of expenditure in the form requested and therefore the information could be provided only at disproportionate cost. However a table showing agency capital projects costing in excess of &pound;1 million on which grant has been claimed, has been placed in the Library of the House. This does not include expenditure ineligible for grant such as project management costs which can form between 15 per cent. and 25 per cent. of the total project cost.

	<p pid=".87W.8/1">Fly tipping is the same offence no matter where it occurs and the Government do not have different policies on clearing fly tipped waste from different types of land. Powers are provided to both local authorities and the Environment Agency under Section 59 of the Environmental Protection Act 1990 to allow them to clear fly tipped waste and to recover the costs of doing so from either the perpetrators of the crime or the occupants of the land unless they can demonstrate that they did not knowingly allow or permit the fly tipping to take place.</p>

Under the protocol, local authorities deal with fly tipping of non-special waste, and the agency deals with fly tipping of special/ hazardous waste.</p>
	<p pid=".87W.8/3">The Government are keen to do more to empower both local authorities and the agency to deal with fly tipping on all forms of land, since we recognise that it is a growing anti-social problem. We are currently considering bringing forward changes to legislation in consultation with other Government Departments, the local government associations and the agency.</p>

	<p pid=".89W.0/1">The Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs has signed a statement, under section 19(1)<i>(a)</i> of the Human Rights Act 1998, that in her view the provisions of the Hunting Bill are compatible with the Convention rights on the basis that she was satisfied no obstacles prevented her from so doing.</p>
	<p pid=".89W.0/2">It is the Government's view that the requirements of the Hunting Bill would, for the purposes of Article 1 of Protocol 1 to the European Convention on Human Rights, amount to an interference with the use and enjoyment of property rather than a deprivation of property, and that accordingly no compensation should be payable for any economic losses that may be suffered as a consequence of the Bill by the persons concerned.</p>
	<p pid=".89W.0/3">There are numerous occasions where new legislation interferes with existing contractual rights without the individuals being compensated. In this respect the Government consider that persons entering contracts in connection with hunting with dogs have no legitimate expectation that any or all types of this activity would continue to be lawful. The contracting parties will have been aware for a considerable period of time of the intention of the Government to legislate on hunting with dogs, and the present Bill is the result of an extensive and well-publicised process of consultation over a long period.</p>
	<p pid=".89W.0/4">The detailed reasons for this view are set out in a memorandum submitted by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs on <phrase class="date" code="2003-01-31">31 January 2003</phrase> in response to a letter from the Chair of the Joint Committee on Human Rights to the Minister for Rural Affairs of <phrase class="date" code="2003-01-21">21 January 2003</phrase>. The Committee indicated that, subject to this point, their provisional opinion was that the present Hunting Bill is compatible with the relevant human rights obligations.</p>
	<p pid=".89W.0/5">Representations on the Hunting Bill which relate to human rights issues have been couched in general terms and have included the suggestion that the continuation of traditional forms of hunting is or should be protected by the European Convention on Human Rights. There have also been references to the rights protected by the United Kingdom's international commitments under the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development 1992, in particular Principle 22 which refers to the role indigenous people and their communities play in relation to environmental management and development. Other representations have argued that there is no right to be cruel.</p>

The regulation of radioactive waste, under RSA 93, in England and Wales, is the responsibility of the Environment Agency and a system of &quot;discharge authorizations&quot; is used to control the nature and quantities of radioactive waste that may be discharged into the environment from any site. However, under the Radioactive Substances (Substances of Low Activity) Exemption Order 1986 solid radioactive waste that is substantially insoluble in water and that has activity of less than 0.4 Becquerel/gram is exempt from the controls under RSA 93, so-called &quot;free release&quot;. As such waste is exempt from regulatory control, no centrally held records are kept of the quantities that have been released.</p>

This is through in depth design features which provide the necessary levels of resilience, including backup facilities at a remote location. Remote in this sense, means far removed from the main facility, yet accessible to authorised users via modern electronic communications. Assessment of the effectiveness of the RIMNET 3 system will be undertaken during its development and the acceptance trials.

	<p pid=".98W.2/1">We have no current plans to ban the trade in all birds and animals taken from the wild. International trade in birds and animals is subject to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES), which is implemented within the EU under Council Regulation (EC) No 338/97 and Commission Regulation (EC) No 1808/1. All commercial trade in those species listed as endangered is prohibited, while the trade in the other less vulnerable species is strictly regulated to ensure that it will not be detrimental to their wild populations.</p>
	<p pid=".98W.2/2">Last month we began a public consultation exercise outlining proposals to strengthen the existing domestic controls over wildlife trade. This included increasing the penalties for certain offences to up to five years imprisonment, and strengthening the relevant powers of police officers and wildlife inspectors. Subject to the outcome of the consultation, we intend to introduce revised provisions as soon as possible thereafter.</p>
	<p pid=".98W.2/3">Within Great Britain the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 prohibits the possession or control of any live or dead wild bird or animal listed on Schedule 5 of the Act, or any part of or anything derived from such a bird or animal. A licence can be issued derogating from this protection. The penalty for taking an animal or bird illegally is a maximum of &pound;5,000 and/or six months custodial sentence.</p>

	<p pid=".100W.5/1">GW Pharmaceuticals have completed their advanced clinical trials into the development of a medical preparation of a cannabis-based drug and are preparing to submit a dossier of their findings to the Medicines Control Agency (MCA), an agency of the Department of Health, for evaluation in the near future.</p>
	<p pid=".100W.5/2">This assessment by the MCA is one which all prospective new medicines have to go through and is designed to protect public health.</p>
	<p pid=".100W.5/3">If approval of the safety, quality and effectiveness of the product is forthcoming, the Government will seek Parliament's agreement to make the necessary changes to the Misuse of Drugs Regulations 2001 to enable the prescription of cannabis-based medicine by doctors to their patients at the earliest opportunity. We recognize how eagerly awaited these changes are and intend to press ahead with them as quickly as possible.</p>

	<p pid=".101W.5/1">Under European e-commerce legislation, Internet Service Providers (ISPs) may not be held liable for unlawful material that they unknowingly transmit, store or host on behalf of their customers. There is also a requirement not to place general monitoring obligations on intermediary service providers, and as such there will be no legislative requirement for United Kingdom ISP's to undertake monitoring of their services for child pornography.</p>
	<p pid=".101W.5/2">However, if an ISP is warned of illegal material on a website that they host but fails to take the appropriate action by removing or disabling access to the material in question, they will be liable for prosecution.</p>
	<p pid=".101W.5/3">With regards to sites which host child pornography, the Government supports the work of the Internet Watch Foundation (IWF), an industry funded body which allows anyone to report the presence of images of child abuse anywhere in the world. The Foundation determines whether the reported website carries potentially illegal material and takes steps to have access denied to the site. The Foundation passes details of illegal material to the relevant law enforcement agencies to initiate action against the originators. If the originators are abroad, the Foundation passes the report to sister hotlines abroad and to the National Criminal Intelligence Services (NCIS) who liaise with enforcement agencies of the countries concerned.</p>
	<p pid=".101W.5/4">The Government continues to seek to revise and improve the mechanisms and processes for the reporting and removing of illegal material hosted on the web, for example through the work of the Home Secretary's Task Force on Child Protection on the Internet.</p>
	<p pid=".101W.5/5">The taskforce, established in March 2001, involves a partnership of child welfare organisations, the internet industry, government, the police and others working towards finding solutions to make the internet a safer place for children, and in January 2003 launched good practice models and guidance for the internet industry on a range of services including web based services dealing with adult content.</p>

	<p pid=".105W.8/1">The Government recognises that plastic card fraud in the UK has increased considerably over recent years. In the Home Office publication, &quot;Crime in England and Wales, 2001&ndash;02: Supplementary Volume&quot; published on <phrase class="date" code="2003-01-09">9 January 2003</phrase>, it was shown that the police recorded 153,281 cheque and credit card offences in 2001&ndash;02. The Association for Payment Clearing Services (APACS) estimated the losses from cheque, debit and credit or charge card fraud in the 12 months to August 2002 at &pound;429.4 million.</p>
	<p pid=".105W.8/2">Skimming (electronically copying a card's magnetic stripe and using it to make an illegal copy of a genuine card) is a relatively new form of card fraud, which is giving the financial services sector and police cause for concern. Counterfeit card losses comprise over a third of total plastic card fraud losses.</p>
	<p pid=".105W.8/3">The Government has committed &pound;1.4 million over two years, in partnership with APACS, to piloting the Dedicated Cheque and Plastic Crime Unit (DCPCU). The Unit, which started work in April 2002, has enjoyed significant early success, recovering more than 3,000 cards and 468 cheques. This has led to 44 arrests and four convictions with potential savings of &pound;5.3 million. A detailed evaluation of the DCPCU's performance will be used to inform decisions on the future of the Unit and to guide national policy for tackling organised and plastic card fraud.</p>
	<p pid=".105W.8/4">The Home Office is also actively supporting the finance and retail industry in its implementation of the Chip and PIN programme. New technology will require UK credit and debit card transactions to be authorised by the customer keying in a four-digit PIN (personal identification number) rather than by signing a receipt. The banking industry expects that by 2005 the new technology will have eliminated over half of the predicted level of plastic card fraud. A public trial of the programme will take place in Northampton shortly and national roll-out will begin after the trial is complete.</p>
	<p pid=".105W.8/5">The Government, working closely with stakeholders, launched its Safe Internet Shopping Campaign in 2001 to advise consumers on safe payment and give them directions to the Government's Consumer Gateway <a href="http://www.consumer.gov.uk">www.consumer.gov.uk</a> which provides links to sources of detailed information.</p>
	<p pid=".105W.8/6">The Government welcomes the involvement of the banking industry in actively seeking ways to prevent and detect crime such as plastic card fraud.</p>

Another smaller but more recent study of women prisoners and their work in custody, published in 2000, found broadly similar results (out of a sample of 567 sentenced women, 66 per cent. had dependent children under the age of 18).</p>

	<p pid=".118W.5/1">One of the principal objectives of the Prison Service is to reduce crime by providing constructive regimes which address offending behaviour, improve educational and work skills and promote law abiding behaviour in custody and after release. The Prison Service increasingly draws upon &quot;What Works&quot; research to develop a more evidence based approach to tackling offending behaviour and the factors that contribute to re-offending. The What Works in Prison Strategy, launched last year, provides a clear direction for the further development of constructive regimes to reduce the risk of re-offending. The strategy encompasses accredited offending behaviour programmes, drug treatment programmes, increased education provision and a custody to work strategy to improve resettlement outcomes. The Prison and Probation Services have been set the challenging but achievable target of reducing the level of reconvictions by fiver per cent. by 2004 compared to the predicted rate.</p>

	<p pid=".118W.8/47">From 2001&ndash;02, budgets for prison education have been ring-fenced and allocated by the Prisoners' Learning and Skills Unit, which reports to the Department for Education and the Home Office. The core budget rose from &pound;57 million in 2001&ndash;02 to &pound;66 million in 2002&ndash;03, and my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Education (Charles Clarke) recently announced that it will rise to &pound;85 million 2003&ndash;04, &pound;110 million in 2004&ndash;05 and &pound;125 million in 2005&ndash;06. Core funding buys teaching hours, induction and assessment sessions, Library services and education materials. While basic skills are a significant part of prisons' education provision, and each prison has basic skills targets, we cannot say exactly how much of overall education funding goes on basic skills.</p>

	<p pid=".120W.2/1">One hundred and seventy-seven prisoners have participated in the Cognitive Self-Change programme since it was accredited in September 2000. Effectiveness is currently evaluated through reports on institutional behaviour, psychometric data, and risk assessments. Early provisional indications show reductions in hostility, aggression and impulsivity in prisoners undertaking the programme. Reconviction data will in due course also be used to evaluate effectiveness.</p>
	<p pid=".120W.2/2">Since the inception of the Enhanced Thinking Skills (ETS) programme, 18,564 prisoners had participated up to <phrase class="date" code="2002-03-31">31 March 2002</phrase>. This figures will increase by about 5,000 prisoners for 2002&ndash;03, and over 6,000 prisoners in subsequent years due to additional funding to increase delivery.</p>

There has been an increasing growth in the use of probation service officers to support the work undertaken by probation officers. In particular, the use of accredited programme has seen a number of low/medium risk offenders supervised as part of a group rather than on an individual basis as has occurred in the past. Probation service officers, who receive specific training to enable them to manage these programmes and supervise the offenders participating, run these accredited programmes.</p>

	<p pid=".126W.2/1">The Government are committed to eradicating the sexual exploitation of children, including where United Kingdom citizens go abroad to abuse children. We have already put in place a number of measures to deal with this problem:</p>
	<p pid=".126W.2/2" class="indent">The Sex Offenders Act 1997 enables courts in the United Kingdom to deal with UK citizens who commit sex offences against children abroad. This provision is being re-enacted in the Sexual Offences Bill;</p>
	<p pid=".126W.2/3" class="indent">Since June 2001, 'registered' sex offenders are required to notify the police if they intend to travel abroad for eight days or more. The police can, and do, pass this information to other jurisdictions where they believe the offender may commit offences overseas;</p>
	<p pid=".126W.2/4" class="indent">We are proposing, as part of the Sexual Offences Bill, a new order that would require those who have committed sex offences overseas to register if they come to the UK (which will mean they will have to notify the police if they intend to travel abroad);</p>
	<p pid=".126W.2/5" class="indent">The Criminal Justice (Terrorism and Conspiracy) Act 1998 makes it an offence for a person to conspire to commit an offence outside the UK, including sexual offences against children.</p>
	<p pid=".126W.2/6">As my right hon. Friends the Home Secretary, the Prime Minister and Lord Falconer have recently made clear, we are looking further at the issue of sex tourism, including the number of days a sex offender 'registered' in the United Kingdom can travel overseas before he is required to notify the police. We are determined to ensure that effective arrangements are put in place to tackle this issue and we will address this in the Sexual Offences Bill.</p>
	<p pid=".126W.2/7">However, legislation is not the only way of dealing with this problem. Sex tourism is one part of a wider set of issues in which poor people&mdash;particularly young women and children&mdash;are vulnerable to the interests of the sex industry, national and international trafficking and associated illegal activities. It is an international problem which requires internationally coordinated action. We are working with Governments, law enforcement agencies and non-governmental organisations (NGOs) to tackle this problem head on wherever it occurs.</p>
	<p pid=".126W.2/8">The Foreign and Commonwealth Office and the Department for International Development support projects in many parts of the world aimed at combating those who commit offences against children. Much of the focus of such projects is on reducing the vulnerability of young people being recruited into this industry. Across Government, we are supporting the efforts of regional and international agencies to combat trafficking, strengthen law enforcement and improve the mechanisms for prosecution of those who commit sex offences abroad.</p>
	<p pid=".126W.2/9">The Government are actively involved in a number of projects to combat sexual exploitation, particularly in South East Asia.</p>
	<p pid=".126W.2/10" class="indent">Through the International Labour Organisation we are funding a major programme in South East Asia to raise awareness, help women and children escape from sexual exploitation, and reintegrate them into their own or new communities.</p>
	<p pid=".126W.2/11" class="indent">We are working with World Vision in Cambodia to run an information programme on the dangers of sexual exploitation aimed at children at risk, local authorities and the tourism industry.</p>
	<p pid=".126W.2/12" class="indent">We are funding projects to help train the Cambodian police to detect and disrupt paedophile activity and to raise awareness of the issue among street children.</p>
	<p pid=".126W.2/13" class="indent">We have worked to improve child protection and support in Thailand by bringing over expert trainers from the Northumberland police and The National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (NSPCC).</p>
	<p pid=".126W.2/14" class="indent">We have provided child protection equipment and training to the Thai Public Welfare Department.</p>
	<p pid=".126W.2/15" class="indent">We have funded the translation and adaptation of End Child Prostitution Pornography and Trafficking (ECPAT's) &quot;Guide to Protecting Children Online&quot; for use in Thailand, Philippines, Indonesia and Japan.</p>
	<p pid=".126W.2/16" class="indent">We have arranged for the National High Tech Crime Unit (NHTCU) to bring computer hardware and software to combat child abuse online and train officers from the Royal Thai police; and</p>
	<p pid=".126W.2/17" class="indent">there is also close and regular collaboration between officials in Bangkok and their Thai counterparts on the movements and activities of known United Kingdom paedophiles.</p>

	<p pid=".134W.5/1">Domestic violence is a significant social issue and we recognise the need to ensure that it is dealt with effectively within the Armed Forces' community. Domestic violence by Service personnel is not tolerated under any circumstances, not least because of the detrimental impact that such incidents can have on morale, discipline and operational efficiency.</p>
	<p pid=".134W.5/2">A tri-Service policy on domestic violence was issued in February 2002. The policy, which has now been implemented by the Services, sets out the roles and responsibilities of the chain of command and the welfare agencies in detecting and dealing with incidents of domestic violence and in providing confidential advice and support. The Services are proactive in increasing awareness about domestic violence to those in command and in publicising (via leaflets, posters and web sites) the services available to possible victims. There are many agencies, both military and civilian, that exist to provide support to victims. The confidential support lines that are operated by the three Services are able to signpost callers to these support agencies. In cases where immediate or imminent harm is suspected the incident is reported to the most readily available police force; primacy rests with the local Home Department Police Force in United Kingdom whereas cases arising overseas are dealt with by the Service police.</p>

	<p pid=".138W.9/1">Local Overseas Allowance (LOA) is not part of the military salary or a reward for overseas service, but a cost of living addition paid only in circumstances where personnel are likely to incur greater day-to-day expenditure overseas than they would in the United Kingdom. This is not generally the case for those deployed on operations.</p>
	<p pid=".138W.9/2">Those personnel who are temporarily deployed away from their permanent, LOA earning, duty station, and no longer incurring the full range of additional costs associated with that station, still have on-going financial commitments overseas, and many have families who remain at the permanent duty station. Consequently, all Service personnel continue to receive the full LOA rate for the first 17 days of their deployment. Additionally, married accompanied personnel continue to receive their full LOA rate unless their accompanying spouse also leaves the permanent duty station for more than 17 days, at which point an abatement of approximately 35 per cent. is applied. Single or married unaccompanied personnel lose 20 per cent. of their full LOA rate after the first 17 days.</p>
	<p pid=".138W.9/3">Personnel on Operation Telic who meet the eligibility criteria will receive Longer Separated Service Allowance (LSSA) or (for those serving in seagoing units) Longer Service at Sea Bonus (LSSB). These allowances compensate personnel, regardless of marital status, for the effects of separation from home life. They are paid at three rates dependent upon periods of accumulated separation. LSSA is paid for unbroken periods of separation of 10 days or more, while LSSB is paid continuously while in qualifying units. Bonuses are available for those who experience very high levels of accumulated separation and these will be increased to &pound;1,250. In order to reduce the incidence of junior personnel experiencing more than one operational tour without compensation for separation, MOD will reduce the initial qualifying period for LSSA from 18 months' service to 12 months. We are also about to increase the higher rate of LSSB and to reduce the qualifying criteria for LSSB bonuses.</p>
	<p pid=".138W.9/4">The decision to enhance these separation allowances reflects the Ministry of Defence's wish to target those on operations, particularly our most junior personnel. In view of the current operational deployment, it has been decided to introduce the changes with effect from <phrase class="date" code="2003-03-01">1 March 2003</phrase>, following a recommendation by the Armed Forces' Pay Review Body.</p>

	<p pid=".143W.3/2">The recently produced policy document 14&ndash;19: opportunity and excellence was not classified as a White Paper. It was published in two parts, a main document and separate annexes, in order to make the document accessible to the wide range of audiences with an interest in 14&ndash;19 education and training. This allows the wider audience, such as parents and employers, with a more general interest in 14&ndash;19 reform, to order only the smaller main document, while practitioners, for example, can order the detailed annexes in addition. To reflect anticipated demand, we were able to print fewer copies of the annexes.</p>
	<p pid=".143W.3/3">The main document and annexes were printed at a cost of &pound;36,100. Summary versions and young people's versions were also printed, tailored in style andpresentation to different target audiences, and folders to allow collation of the different versions as required. The cost of producing these elements was &pound;29,400, and collation costs were around &pound;2,200.</p>
	<p pid=".143W.3/4">It is not possible to estimate accurately the cost of producing a single document to the same timescales as the two volumes produced. It is likely that the cost would have been less than those incurred producing two documents, but this is offset against accessibility considerations and the lower quantity of annexes produced. Printing a larger 120 page document also requires different, more expensive, binding techniques. Collation costs would also have been incurred as different combinations of main document, summary and young people's version would have had to be collated fordistribution.</p>

	<p pid=".143W.6/1">For secondary schools the Beacon school initiative will be replaced by the Leading Edge Programme, which aims to extend active collaboration and develop cutting edge innovation to raise standards across the school system.</p>
	<p pid=".143W.6/2">There will be no further expansion of a centrally funded Beacon school programme for primary, nursery and special schools. This is in line with the general wish of head teachers to reduce the proportion of funding delivered through ring-fenced grants and to devolve more funding decisions to local communities. Schools and LEAs will be able to broker and fund collaborative partnerships from within the substantial overall increase in resources provided as a result of the 2002 Spending Review. We are encouraging LEAs to fund this activity. My Department intends to explore arrangements for endorsing local programmes through a Beacon recognition scheme.</p>

From 2003, the rules relating to this are being amended to ensure that such a factor always exists. The amount to be distributed is for local decision, but we are encouraging each authority to discuss this issue with its schools forum, with a view to aligning the amounts received by the LEA on the basis of social deprivation with the amounts distributed, and in ways which accurately reflect schools' needs.</p>

	<p pid=".150W.2/1">In order to improve our economic competitiveness, we need to create effective and sustained links between higher education institutions and business. The task for Government is to provide the framework for this to happen and for universities and higher education colleges, businesses and individuals to develop these opportunities. As set out in the recent White Paper, 'The future of higher education' the Government are taking a number of steps to build constructive links between higher education institutions and business.</p>
	<p pid=".150W.2/2">The effective transfer of knowledge and skills is key to our future success. Through recent initiatives we have already helped institutions to improve knowledge transfer, and this has been shown in indicators such as the number of spin-off companies created, the number of patents filed and the proportion of universities employing specialised staff to support commercial work. We announced in &quot;Investing in Innovation&quot;, the Government's strategy for science, engineering and technology, published in July 2002 that the Higher Education Innovation Fund (HEIF) would draw together support for reach out from HE to business and become a permanent third stream of funding worth &pound;90 million a year in 2005&ndash;06. As announced in 'the future of higher education' we are providing additional HEIF funding to establish a network of up to 20 Knowledge Exchanges. These will exemplify collaboration with employers, be focused on serving the local and regional economy and form part of a wider network with the New Technology Institutes that will help local companies to use advanced technology.</p>
	<p pid=".150W.2/3">The Foundation Degree which was introduced in 2001 gave employers a greater role in shaping vocational courses to meet their need for associate professional skills. A major expansion of this work focused degree announced in the HE strategy will further encourage partnership arrangements between employers and higher education institutions in course design, development and implementation. The emergence of new Sector Skills Councils will enable stronger alliances to develop between business in their sectors and the relevant departments in higher education institutions both to develop and market courses and involve employers in the delivery of learning.</p>
	<p pid=".150W.2/4">However, we also need to ensure that all graduates have the skills to equip them to work in a fast changing work environment. We will continue to sponsor work already under way by HEFCE to integrate the skills and attributes which employers need, into higher education courses.</p>
	<p pid=".150W.2/5">The Government have commissioned Richard Lambert to carry out an independent review of how, over the coming decade, business can better draw on universities to the mutual advantage of both sectors. We look forward to the findings of the review later this year.</p>

Moreover, from 2005 we are raising the repayment threshold from &pound;10,000 to &pound;15,000. That means that the burden of repayments will be eased, by &pound;450 a year.

	<p pid=".157W.2/2">Our long-term vision for strengthening universities and increasing access to higher education was recently announced in our White Paper, &quot;The Future of Higher Education&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".157W.2/3">The case for expanding higher education is strong, both to meet the economy's need for higher level skills and to realise the potential of individuals. The measures set out in the White Paper will enable us to deliver our Public Service Agreement target of increasing participation in higher education towards 50 per cent. of those aged 18 to 30 by 2010. This will be mainly achieved through expansion of the work focused foundation degree, which is designed to attract many people who do not currently enter higher education.</p>
	<p pid=".157W.2/4">Progress towards the participation rate is measured by the Initial Entry Rate which sums the percentage of the age group who enter higher education for the first time in each year of age between 18 and 30. Participation is currently 43 per cent.</p>
	<p pid=".157W.2/5">Our programmes to raise achievement levels in schools and to improve studying on rates in full-time education has and the age of 16 coupled with our programmes to encourage ambition and higher aspirations among more young people will contribute towards meeting our target.</p>

	<p pid=".160W.2/1">The information requested is not held centrally. The Government allocates funding for higher education in England to the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE). The HEFCE provide teaching grants on the basis that similar courses are funded at similar rates irrespective of the institution providing the education. The detailed allocations are calculated according to the numbers and types of students in the institutions, and the courses they are taking. Different courses are weighted at different levels to reflect, for example, the higher costs of providing laboratory-based and medical courses. There are also adjustments made to the calculations to reflect London weighting, the additional costs of teaching students from disadvantaged backgrounds and mature and part-time students. Average funding per student in institutions will therefore reflect these weightings and adjustments.</p>
	<p pid=".160W.2/2">Funding for post-graduate research students is also provided through the HEFCE's research funding allocation. The Council allocate funding for research selectively to institutions according to their relative strength in research as measured through the periodic Research Assessment Exercise. The amount of research funding therefore varies widely between institutions.</p>
	<p pid=".160W.2/3">Institutions receive their teaching and research funding as a block grant and are able to decide how it should be spent.</p>

	<p pid=".162W.8/1">The Office for Standards in Education (Ofsted) published an evaluation report in April 2002 on the quality and impact of the work of teaching assistants in primary schools. The report reinforced the Government's view that well-trained and well-managed teaching assistants have the potential to help schools raise standards by showing that the quality of teaching in lessons with teaching assistants is better than in lessons without them.</p>
	<p pid=".162W.8/2">In a survey of headteachers (July 2002) relating to the implementation of the National Literacy and Numeracy Strategies, 89 per cent. said that teaching assistants made a positive contribution to the quality of literacy teaching and the same percentage said that teaching assistants contributed to improving the teaching of mathematics.</p>

	<p pid=".166W.2/1">When we were developing the new LEA funding formula, we looked at whether we should introduce a targeted grant for LEAs with high mobility. However, we found that the problem was surprisingly widespread and it did not therefore seem sensible to introduce a targeted grant which would give a little funding to many authorities. We intend to look further at the question of pupil mobility in the light of data from the Pupil Level Annual Schools Census, with the aim of considering the possible introduction of a relevant factor when the formula freeze on Education Formula Spending ends in 2006&ndash;07.</p>

	<p pid=".166W.8/5">The criteria are set out in the Department's Guidance 0580/2001: The Protection of School Playing Fields and Land for City Academies. The School Playing Fields Advisory Panel provides independent advice on the extent to which applications meet the published criteria. Over the past four years the Secretary of State has approved 118 applications to dispose, or change the use, of an area of school playing field larger than a sports pitch (i.e. 2,000 m <sup>2</sup> ). Of these, 48 were in respect of closed or closing schools and, of the remainder, 45 helped fund improved sports facilities at schools. No application has been approved that did not fully meet all of the criteria.</p>

	<p pid=".167W.2/1">School inspectors are required to consider whether the school monitors health and safety and are expected to report on any hazards that they encounter. They are not, however, health and safety inspectors and do not audit possible health hazards such as the presence of asbestos. The responsibility rests with the head and governing body, and (for community and voluntary controlled schools) the local education authority. While it is impracticable for school inspectors to conduct rigorous health and safety inspections, they are required in every inspection to make a judgment about the extent to which pupils work in a healthy and safe environment.</p>

Mechanisms are in place to recover loans from UK students who live abroad after graduation, and who are outside the UK tax system, through direct payments to the Student Loans Company. The arrangements for collecting varied fees from EU graduates will be based on these arrangements.</p>

The UK has stringent laws to combat money laundering and the financing of terrorism.

	<p pid=".184W.2/1">The child care tax credit within the working families tax credit provides support to families for the costs of registered or approved child care. Once an award of working families tax credit is made, it cannot be adjusted to reflect changes in the claimant's child care costs. However, from April 2003, working families tax credit is replaced by the new child tax credit and working tax credit. The working tax credit includes a child care element which provides more flexible support for the costs of child care. In particular, the child care element of working tax credit can be adjusted to reflect significant changes in average weekly child care costs.</p>
	<p pid=".184W.2/2">In response to concerns raised with me by parents paying child care costs weekly, who may have short increases in child care costs during the school holidays, we will shortly bring forward regulations making a minor change to the system to allow parents to take account of changes in costs lasting less than four weeks. This will allow parents with fluctuating child care costs to have their tax credit based on their average child care costs, including any short-term fluctuations. It is our intention to produce this addition to the rules in good time for the start of the new tax credits system in April 2003. The Inland Revenue will issue clear guidance for parents and child care providers on how the system will work from April 2003.</p>

	<p pid=".185W.3/1">The Green Paper takes a comprehensive look at the issue of women, work and pensions.</p>
	<p pid=".185W.3/2">It recognises that it is often harder for women to build up state and private pensions rights than it is for men. This is because of a combination of factors including shorter working lives, lower pay and lower occupational pensions coverage among part-time workers. The Green Paper also recognises that the current generation of female pensioners are over represented in those groups of pensioners with low incomes.</p>
	<p pid=".185W.3/3">We have already taken action to address these issues.</p>
	<p pid=".185W.3/4">The introduction of the State Second Pension, from April 2002 provides extra help to those on low or moderate earnings, to certain carers and to certain people with long-term illness and disability.</p>
	<p pid=".185W.3/5">The Government have enabled some low paid workers to get national insurance benefits without paying contributions. From April 2000, the start point of national insurance contributions was separated from the lower earnings limit (LEL) for employees and aligned with the personal allowance for income tax. From April 2002&ndash;03, national insurance contributions only become payable on earnings from &pound;89 a week whereas entitlement to national insurance benefits start accruing at &pound;75 a week. This has benefited around half a million women.</p>
	<p pid=".185W.3/6">The Government have also already taken action to support the labour market position of women through, for example, the introduction of the national minimum wage and additional investment in child care.</p>
	<p pid=".185W.3/7">And many current female pensioners should benefit from the introduction of the pension credit in October 2003. Just over half of those entitled to the pension credit are single women. Two-thirds of those entitled to the pension credit will be women, and half of these women will be aged 75 or over.</p>
	<p pid=".185W.3/8">Finally, we are engaging in a wide-ranging consultation on proposals made within the Green Paper. In this document, we state our commitment to providing pensions information for everyone, but we recognise that this is particularly important for women.</p>

	<p pid=".188W.2/1">In August 2002, there were approximately 7,900 customers receiving the minimum income guarantee in the London Borough of Southwark and approximately 3,200 receiving attendance allowance.</p>
	<p pid=".188W.2/2">The information regarding the average take-up rate of minimum income guarantee for 1999&ndash;2000, the latest financial year for which estimates are available, can be found in the DWP publication, &quot;Income Related Benefits Estimates of Take-Up in 1999&ndash;2000&quot;. A copy is placed in the Library.</p>
	<p pid=".188W.2/3">The next edition of the report containing estimates for 2000&ndash;01 will be released on <phrase class="date" code="2003-03-27">27 March 2003</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".188W.2/4">Our fundamental priority is to put money in the pockets of pensioners who need it. The MIG take up campaign has put an average &pound;20 a week extra in the pockets of 144,000 elderly people who would not have received it otherwise. These people would have lost out so the campaign undoubtedly achieved value for money.</p>
	<p pid=".188W.2/5">Because the MIG is more generous and the limits on capital have been increased, there has been a natural increase in the number of people who could claim. Our overall policy is, and will continue to be, that we will get as many eligible pensioners as possible to claim their entitlement to the MIG.</p>
	<p pid=".188W.2/6">Pension credit will be introduced in October 2003 and we have developed a strategy to ensure maximum take-up.</p>
	<p pid=".188W.2/7">First, we will transfer existing MIG recipients to pension credit ready for payments to be made from October 2003;</p>
	<p pid=".188W.2/8">Second, we will run mass advertising (TV and Press) from September 2003 to launch pension credit and advise pensioners and their friends and family of how The Pension Service and partner organisations can support them to consider and take-up entitlement;</p>
	<p pid=".188W.2/9">Third, we will write to all pensioners not already receiving MIG over the take-on period (through to October 2004) to help them consider any entitlement to pension credit and encourage those likely to be eligible to apply; and</p>
	<p pid=".188W.2/10">Fourth, we will work with local partners to help support the communications to pensioners, and tailor marketing and communications activity accordingly.</p>
	<p pid=".188W.2/11">We will review the take-up position during autumn 2004 and take any further action that may be necessary.</p>
	<p pid=".188W.2/12">The DWP set up the Partnerships against Poverty Forum for England and Wales as a working group in 2001 with the Local Government Association and voluntary organisations to develop joint working to improve take-up of minimum income guarantee.</p>
	<p pid=".188W.2/13">The group has, on a national basis, identified and developed a number of initiatives to improve access to entitlements and for the take-up of MIG by older people. The group has been instrumental in helping to develop products such as the shorter minimum income guarantee (MIG) claim form, the new MIG leaflet and the &quot;At a Glance&quot; and &quot;Good Practice Guides&quot;, which all support the take-up of benefit entitlements. It also regularly reviews new and revised leaflets and has provided invaluable feedback into the training packages developed by The Pension Service local service.</p>
	<p pid=".188W.2/14">The Partnership Against Poverty members quickly recognised that the issues that adversely impact the take-up of entitlements by black and minority ethnic (BME) elders needed to be addressed separately. To support this, a sub-group was established.</p>
	<p pid=".188W.2/15">One of the first tasks of the group was to commission research into the barriers to look specifically at the problems faced by black and minority ethnic elder communities. The research will be qualitative and based around seven case studies looking at different groups. One of these is looking at the black African communities in Southwark.</p>
	<p pid=".188W.2/16">Take-up is encouraged through local services via their drop-in surgeries in Southwark. These take place frequently in partnership with local groups and organisations. These are Peckham One Stop, Black Elderly Group of Southwark, South Asian Elderly Organisation, Blackfriars Settlement and at the Surrey Quays Shopping Centre.</p>
	<p pid=".188W.2/17">In terms of attendance allowance, it is not possible to be precise about the number of pensioners who might be entitled if they claimed it. This is because entitlement to AA is determined on the customer's specific circumstances, which can only be determined after a claim has been made. Up-to-date estimates of the take up of AA and disability living allowance are not available and could be obtained only at disproportionate cost.</p>
	<p pid=".188W.2/18">Sutton Disability Benefits Centre undertakes a number of targeted local activities to promote awareness of AA in the area it serves, which includes the London Borough of Southwark. This includes training and awareness sessions for Pension Service staff and external organisations.</p>

	<p pid=".190W.2/2">The levels of all benefits and their components are reviewed annually. Contributory benefits and non-contributory benefits are uprated by the Retail Prices Index to meet the statutory requirement to increase them in relation to the general level of prices. Income-related benefits are uprated by the Rossi index which is based on the Retail Prices Index less housing costs. This index most clearly reflects the cost of living increases for recipients of income-related benefits since housing costs are separately provided for, for example by Housing Benefit for rent. Uprating benefits in line with prices maintains their value in real terms.</p>

	<p pid=".192W.5/1">The United Kingdom has contributed to the voluntary exchange of information and good practice by EU Member States within a framework of common objectives on pensions covering adequacy, financial sustainability and modernisation agreed during the Swedish Presidency of the EU.</p>
	<p pid=".192W.5/2">As part of this process the European Commission published a draft joint report on adequate and sustainable pensions in December 2002 based on national contributions.The draft report recognises that Member States have pension systems that have developed in very different ways and do not conform to one single model of provision. A major theme in the draft report is the need for urgent reform in many public pension systems to ensure they are financially sustainable in the future. This concurs with the UK's position that financial sustainability is a prerequisite for the adequacy of public pension provision. The UK public pension system is one of those found to be financially sustainable in the long term.</p>
	<p pid=".192W.5/3">The draft report concludes that the major challenge for the UK system is ensuring that there is increased access to occupational and personal pension provision and people are encouraged to save enough to meet their expectations in retirement. These same issues are addressed by the proposals set out in the Green Paper published in December 2002 on which we are currently consulting.</p>

	</table>
	<p pid=".196W.5/17">There are some important points to note with regard to the data in the table:</p>
	<p pid=".196W.5/18">'Open' schemes are those that had a registerable date on to the Pensions Scheme Registry during the year in question, and were also recorded as being open on <phrase class="date" code="2003-02-10">10 February 2003</phrase>. This does not represent the total number of schemes that were open in the year in question. Figures in the table refer to the 'flow' of new open schemes in each particular year, rather than the 'stock' of all open schemes. Because of the way scheme-status changes are recorded on the Registry, it is not possible to identify the stock of all those schemes that were open at a particular point in time prior to the current date. Furthermore, scheme trustees have 12 months to notify OPRA of any change to the status of an open scheme, and so some schemes currently included in the table as open may since have changed status.</p>
	<p pid=".196W.5/19">'Closed' schemes are those that have become closed to new members during the year in question and remain closed as at <phrase class="date" code="2003-02-10">10 February 2003</phrase>. Existing members in these schemes can continue to accrue additional pension rights. 'Frozen' schemes are those that have become closed to new accruals during the year in question and remain frozen as at <phrase class="date" code="2003-02-10">10 February 2003</phrase>. The dates used for closed and frozen scheme figures relate to the effective date of change as notified by schemes and recorded by the Registry. In some cases, schemes do not supply an effective date and where this has occurred the date of inputting the change onto the Registry database has been used.</p>
	<p pid=".196W.5/20">Data for closed and frozen schemes refer only to the number becoming closed or frozen in the year in question, and do not represent the stock of the total number of schemes that were closed (previously closed plus newly closed in that year).</p>
	<p pid=".196W.5/21">The table updates previous information used to answer earlier PQs. As referred to above, the Registry system holds information on the most recent change in scheme status and the effective date of the change. Because of the way the data are held a later change will overwrite an earlier change, so data for earlier years become increasingly inaccurate. Trustees are required to report changes within 12 months so there could be a lag between the closure or freeze of a scheme and trustees informing the Registry that the scheme has actually closed or frozen. The table reflects the most up to date data available.</p>
	<p pid=".196W.5/22">Scheme members are those individuals that have accrued pension benefits and do not include those receiving pensions in payment. An individual may have pension benefits accrued in, and therefore may be a member of, more than one scheme.</p>
	<p pid=".196W.5/23">Membership figures for open schemes are given at the date of registration. Membership figures for closed or frozen schemes are given at the effective date of change of status.</p>
	<p pid=".196W.5/24">This information relates only to those schemes recorded on the Registry database as Defined Benefit. It does not include schemes where the benefit type is unknown or those offering a mixture of salary related and money purchase benefits.</p>

	<p pid=".199W.5/1">As the Green Paper 'Simplicity, security and choice: working and saving for retirement' (CM 5677) states that the decisions over how much pension an individual should have depends on their individual preferences and circumstances. Therefore, it is not appropriate for the Government to seek to stipulate the level of income that any particular person will need in retirement, and consequently the additional saving any one individual should make.</p>
	<p pid=".199W.5/2">We are committed, however, to actively encouraging people to consider their pension saving options early so that they have as clear a view as possible of their own pension funding needs. The Green Paper, sets out the Government's proposals to work with employers and the financial services industry to provide:</p>
	<p pid=".199W.5/3">A simple framework to help people understand their choices; Financial education and awareness to navigate the system, including access to generic financial advice for the mass market; Personalised information tailored to individual circumstances, so people can make informed choices; and a choice of suitable products.</p>
	<p pid=".199W.5/4">We are already running a pension education publicity campaign to make people aware of the importance of saving for retirement. The campaign is supported by a range of guides that provides information on pensions options. The current phase of activity started on <phrase class="date" code="2003-02-08">8 February 2003</phrase>. In time, we plan to move the campaign forward from awareness so that it is more focused on taking action.</p>
	<p pid=".199W.5/5">In addition, we have already introduced measures to inform individuals of the level of pension they can expect when they save in a personal pension. New regulations that come into force in April require money purchase pension schemes (occupational, personal and stakeholder) to give members an annual illustration of what their pension might be when they require. This will give them important information about how theirpension plan is progressing.</p>
	<p pid=".199W.5/6">The Green Paper, therefore, sets out proposals for building on work that has already been done, as well as identifying new initiatives, in order to provide a coherent education and information effort. This will enable individuals to make choices as to the level of funding for their personal pensions.</p>

	<p pid=".201W.5/1">The Government has already begun to address the social and economic consequences of demographic change in its role as employer. One of the recommendations of Winning the Generation Game was that public sector employers should review their retirement ages and examine the case for allowing those who want to work on to age 65 to do so. Already 75 per cent. of civil servants now have the option to retire at 65 and the numbers able to serve beyond 60 are expected to increase.</p>
	<p pid=".201W.5/2">All staff in the Department for Work and Pensions, below the Senior Civil Service, are able to choose to remain in employment beyond the age of 60 for any period of time up to the age of 65.</p>
	<p pid=".201W.5/3" class="indent">&quot;Staff in the Senior Civil Service normally retire at the age of 60 but the Head of the Department and Agency Chief Executives have flexibility to retain members of the Senior Civil Service beyond age 60 if they judge it in the public interest and they are satisfied about the fitness and efficiency of the individual to carry out his or her duties. The most senior posts require written approval from the Head of the Home Civil Service to be retained for longer than three months beyond their 60th birthday.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".201W.5/4">This is based on an extract from the Civil Service Management Code.</p>
	<p pid=".201W.5/5">Most public service pension schemes, however, still allow a normal pension to be taken at 60 or under. The Government is seeking views on the proposal that the rules of public service pension schemes should be changed and applied to all new members during the next few years to make an unreduced pension payable from age 65 rather than 60. Such a change would reflect improved longevity, modern working patterns and the practice in the majority of private sector pension schemes.</p>

	<p pid=".202W.3/1">It has been a long-standing principle of the benefits system that it should not provide more than one benefit to cover the same contingency. While income from a War Pension is often disregarded for benefit purposes, there are certain circumstances where the award or cessation of a War Pension or supplementary allowance will necessitate an adjustment to the amount of benefit in payment.</p>
	<p pid=".202W.3/2">We have measures in place to ensure that benefits paid by this Department are co-ordinated with those paid by the Veterans Agency (formerly the War Pensions Agency), and that any appropriate adjustments to benefit claims are made in the normal course of events.</p>
	<p pid=".202W.3/3">Prior to the award of a Social Security benefit, a person must make a declaration of their circumstances, including details of the benefits they receive or have claimed. Once benefit is in payment, the recipient is advised to report any changes in their circumstances, including for example, the award or cessation of another benefit. Claims are also reviewed periodically by the Department to ensure their accuracy.</p>
	<p pid=".202W.3/4">In addition, all claims to benefit are recorded on a computer system to which our agencies and the Veterans Agency have access, enabling the relevant agencies to share information where appropriate.</p>

	<p pid=".204W.9/1">The Government has designed the aggregates levy to protect the international competitiveness of aggregates businesses by applying the levy to the commercial exploitation of all virgin aggregate used in the UK and by exempting exports. The Government has also recognised the unique position of the Northern Ireland processed products sector, those producing concrete, mortar and asphalt, by introducing a transitional relief scheme.</p>
	<p pid=".204W.9/2">This scheme allows the sector more time to adapt to the new market conditions by, for example, making increased use of levy-free alternatives to virgin aggregate.</p>
	<p pid=".204W.9/3">Customs and Excise assure aggregates levy in the same way that they assure other taxes and duties for which they are responsible. Assurance resources are allocated according to risk. Additionally, in the first year of its operation Customs are undertaking education and assurance visits to all companies registered for the levy. The resources allocated to administering the levy in Northern Ireland take account of issues associated with the land boundary, and this resourcing is subject to regular review.</p>
	<p pid=".204W.9/4">The levy is due at the point of first commercial exploitation in the UK and not at the point of import. Consequently aggregates can be imported without levy immediately being due and therefore the question of illegal imports does not arise. Where it cannot be demonstrated that commercially exploited aggregate is from a levy-paid source, Customs will use their powers to recover the revenue due and impose penalties, where appropriate.</p>
	<p pid=".204W.9/5">Similarly, figures for the total weight of aggregate imported into the UK are not available. Aggregates levy returns record the weight of aggregate which is commercially exploited in the UK and do not differentiate between domestically produced and imported aggregate.</p>
	<p pid=".204W.9/6">Data for revenue collected under the levy are recorded for the UK as a whole and are not available by devolved region; therefore, figures for levy revenue raised in Northern Ireland are not available. Equally, the cost of implementing the levy is estimated for the UK as a whole and not by devolved region.</p>
	<p pid=".204W.9/7">There have been no prosecutions for evasion of the levy. Customs' approach in the first year of the tax has been to ensure that those who should be registered are registered, and that the correct liability is established and paid.</p>

	<p pid=".209W.0/1">The only European Commission proposal for full harmonisation of duty rates for diesel fuel used in transport relates to diesel fuel used by lorries over 16 tonnes, buses and coaches. The proposal is that member states should bring their duty rates for such diesel closer together to reach a harmonised rate by 2010 of Euro350 per 1,000 litres, although that rate would be uprated in line with inflation. The Government have submitted an Explanatory Memorandum on this proposal (reference 11571/02 dated <phrase class="date" code="2002-09-26">26 September 2002</phrase>), which set out our opposition to it. That opposition is shared by nearly all member states, so the directive cannot be adopted in its present form, as any decisions taken by the Council of Ministers on matters of taxation have to be unanimous.</p>
	<p pid=".209W.0/2">The only European Commission proposal relating to duty on diesel fuel for marine use is the proposed directive on taxation of energy products. This would generally continue the existing duty treatment of diesel fuel for marine use in the mineral oils structures directive. It provides for a compulsory exemption for diesel fuel used for navigation in Community waters (although it would allow member states to limit the exemption to international and intra-Community transport) and for an optional exemption for diesel fuel used for navigation in inland waterways. In both cases, private pleasure craft are excluded from these exemptions, but the United Kingdom's derogation from the existing directive, allowing the United Kingdom to exempt fuel for private pleasure craft until <phrase class="date" code="">31 December 2006</phrase>, will be unaffected. The Government have submitted a supplementary Memorandum on the latest version of the proposal (reference 13422/02, FISC 266, dated <phrase class="date" code="2002-11-26">26 November 2002</phrase>). This directive will support efforts to deal with the significant environmental problems arising from global warming, which requires cross-border action. This proposal also cannot be adopted in its present form without unanimous agreement by the Council of Ministers.</p>

	<p pid=".226W.5/1">There are currently no plans to introduce a plastic bags tax. Instead, as the Chancellor said in his pre-Budget statement, the Government will be considering how the use of economic instruments can be extended to provide a more comprehensive and coherent framework for waste management more generally, as well as the scope for using other policies to tackle packaging and encourage producer responsibility. However, in both Northern Ireland and the United Kingdom generally, a number of positive steps are being taken to encourage a significant reduction in the use of plastic bags in order to protect the environment, decrease the amount of visible litter and reduce the volume of plastic bags going to landfill.</p>
	<p pid=".226W.5/2">A key element in achieving these results is to change consumer behaviour. In Northern Ireland, I am pleased to confirm that, following negotiations with representatives of the major supermarket chains, a Retail Charter was introduced in October last year. This charter takes a pro-active approach to educating both retailers and consumers in the application of sustainable environmental policies to their shopping habits, a message which has again been promoted in recent months, in the Department of the Environment's intensive 'Wake up to Waste' and 'Reduce, Reuse, Recycle' advertising campaigns.</p>
	<p pid=".226W.5/3">A further key step in changing a culture of indiscriminate use and disposal of plastic bags will be the forthcoming review of litter legislation, which will identify and address any shortcomings in the existing body of litter legislation in Northern Ireland.</p>

	<p pid=".228W.8/1">Translink has introduced a new integrated ticketing system on Citybus from <phrase class="date" code="2001-10-01">1 October 2001</phrase> and on Ulsterbus from <phrase class="date" code="2002-04-01">1 April 2002</phrase>. The new system has not yet been implemented in Northern Ireland Railway hence information is not available to answer questions <i>(a)</i>, nor is any information available which would identify new customers (question <i>(c)</i>).</p>
	<p pid=".228W.8/2">For question <i>(b)</i> it is estimated that the increase in patronage on Citybus is mostly attributable to over 65-year-olds who are entitled to free travel, while less than half of the increase on Ulsterbus resulted from the senior citizen market. It is not thought that there has been any increase in usage of the railways by the elderly sector who are entitled to free travel.</p>
	<p pid=".228W.8/3">For question <i>(d)</i> there was a 4.5 per cent. fares increase in public transport. Overall receipts increased by &pound;0.9 million which was an increase of 6.6 per cent. over the period. Therefore 68 per cent. of the increase in receipts was due to ticket price increases.</p>

	<p pid=".229W.2/1">The number of works complying with the Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive in Northern Ireland for the years 1999 to 2001 is:</p>
	<p pid=".229W.2/2" class="indent">1999&mdash;8 out of a total of 15 complied&mdash;which gives a compliance rate of 53 per cent.</p>
	<p pid=".229W.2/3" class="indent">2000&mdash;8 out of a total of 15 complied&mdash;which gives a compliance rate of 53 per cent.</p>
	<p pid=".229W.2/4" class="indent">2001&mdash;13 out of a total of 37 complied&mdash;which gives a compliance rate of 35 per cent.</p>
	<p pid=".229W.2/5">The apparent fall in the rate of compliance between 2000 and 2001 reflects the phased introduction of targets under the UWWT Directive bringing more waste-water treatment works within its scope. For the year 2002, a total of 35 works have been assessed with the results still needing to be confirmed. However, the initial indication is that compliance is in the region of 50 per cent.&mdash;similar to 1999 and 2000.</p>
	<p pid=".229W.2/6">There is a legacy of under-funding of Northern Ireland's infrastructure. However, the upgrading of Northern Ireland's water and sewerage services to meet EU regulations is a high priority. Over &pound;250 million will be invested on the waste-water infrastructure over the next three years. This increased level of investment has been made possible by the allocation of an additional &pound;180 million for the wider water and sewerage services over the next three years, as was announced in the Budget statement in December 2002. In addition, DRD is actively considering with the Strategic Investment Board the potential for delivering a sizeable Public Private Partnership (PPP) programme which could include a number of wastewater treatment works, as part of the Strategic Investment Programme.</p>
	<p pid=".229W.2/7">This major increase in investment will deliver significant progress towards fall compliance with the Directive.</p>

On the basis of the agreed programme, the Executive Committee of the Northern Ireland Assembly decided that planning applications that had been held on a precautionary basis and future planning applications in the locations affected would be processed to a conclusion.

	<p pid=".232W.6/1">As I indicated in my answer to the hon. Member on <phrase class="date" code="2003-01-27">27 January 2003</phrase>, <phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2003-01-27.584W"><i>Official Report</i>, column 584W</phrase>, the sender of any e-mail that is blocked will be notified and invited to contact the intended recipient, who, by contacting the Parliamentary Communications Directorate (PCD) Helpdesk, can arrange for the e-mail to be swiftly unblocked. This prevents legitimate e-mails being lost.</p>
	<p pid=".232W.6/2">PCD are monitoring the system, which can be easily modified in response to feedback from hon. Members and staff. For example, seven legitimate e-mails about the Sexual Offences Bill were inadvertently blocked: the filter has now been adjusted so that this does not happen. I am aware of concerns that legitimate e-mails might be blocked because they are written in Welsh; this is certainly not the case either for Welsh or for any other language.</p>
	<p pid=".232W.6/3">During the first three weeks that the filter was in place, it blocked 3,465 of the 555,000 e-mails received, or about one in every 160 e-mails. The PCD Helpdesk received only 29 unblocking requests, which is less than one per cent. of the e-mails blocked. These figures suggest that the proportion of e-mails which have been incorrectly delayed as a result of the e-mail filter is around one in every 20,000 received.</p>
	<p pid=".232W.6/4">Only inappropriate incoming e-mails are filtered. No filters are currently in place to block other spam. After further consultation with the relevant domestic committees to determine the views and needs of Members, PCD plan to introduce a new service to help users of the Parliamentary Network identify and manage this additional nuisance.</p>

	<p pid=".236W.2/1">In addition to the general damages paid to those suffering from vibration white finger (VWF) my Department is responsible for compensation to certain claimants who are prevented from carrying out everyday tasks such as DIY and gardening because of the severity of their VWF. Therefore, in accordance with common law it is necessary to identify to what extent VWF itself has caused these difficulties. The second medical examination is designed to identify any other conditions, or co-morbidities, that may impact upon a claimant's ability to undertake the task claimed for. The existing medical examination for VWF was not designed to identify such conditions, which is why a second medical in these circumstances is necessary.</p>
	<p pid=".236W.2/2">Resources for this second medical, or Services MAP, are already being put in place. The Department announced on <phrase class="date" code="2003-02-06">6 February 2003</phrase> that Aon Health Solutions (AHS) has been appointed as the new medical provider for this process. We are now involved actively with all our contract partners towards starting medical assessments by the end of April this year. Currently there are 60 adjusters at IRISC preparing claims for the Services MAP. Resources at AHS will be updated over time in line with the volumes of claims passing through to the medical stage of the process.</p>
	<p pid=".236W.2/3">It is not possible to make firm financial estimates of the cost of Services claims until the numbers of those making claims is clearer. But this is a legal liability and the Department will meet whatever it costs. As well as having financial implications, the final numbers will also impact on the time scale involved. It is hoped to have the majority of claims through the Services MAP by the end of 2005; however, this is significantly dependent on the full cooperation of solicitors in getting claims documentation to our claims handlers.</p>

	<p pid=".237W.3/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid=".237W.3/2">The Cruickshank report on Competition in UK Banking concluded that there was a profound lack of competition in the provision of payment services and recommended the setting up of a regulator to bring about improved competition in this sector. In his March 2000 Budget speech, the Chancellor announced that the Government would legislate to ensure the payments system is open to new competition. The Government remain committed to introducing legislation to give the Office of Fair Trading (OFT) new powers to promote effective competition in payment systems&mdash;and will do so as soon as parliamentary time allows.</p>
	<p pid=".237W.3/3">Progress has already been made through, for example, reforms to the governance structures of the main UK payment systems. The Government welcome these moves by payment system participants to address the competition issues identified by the Cruickshank report and urges the industry to continue with these reforms.</p>
	<p pid=".237W.3/4">The Cruickshank report did not specifically recommend regulating the charges on small businesses for credit and debit card transactions. What it did recommend, however, was that wholesale prices&mdash;such as interchange fees&mdash;should generally be derived through a process that is transparent to final users, and that prices should be based on legitimate costs and should anticipate achievable cost reductions. It is envisaged that the Government's proposed legislation will include provisions designed to promote efficient wholesale pricing. This might reasonably be expected to bring about benefits to all end-users of payment services, including small businesses.</p>
	<p pid=".237W.3/5">To promote its understanding of how payment systems operate, and to help pave the way for its prospective powers, the OFT announced on <phrase class="date" code="">27 November</phrase> that it would conduct an empirical study into recent payment system developments. The terms of reference of this study were published on <phrase class="date" code="2003-01-31">31 January 2003</phrase>&mdash;and include issues related to pricing in the credit and debit card markets. The OFT has undertaken to publish a report outlining its assessment and conclusions in spring 2003.</p>

	<p pid=".238W.8/1">The continuity of service rules under the Government's compensation scheme were extremely generous to claimants. In general, service was regarded as continuous regardless how many gaps a trawlerman had had between voyages on Icelandic water vessels, or how long those gaps had been, or what the reasons for them had been.</p>
	<p pid=".238W.8/2">The only exception was where, during a gap of longer than 12 weeks, the former trawlerman had done other work&mdash;which included, for these purposes, other fishing work on vessels that had never made voyages to Icelandic waters. The rationale for this was that if a former trawlerman had done other work during a lengthy gap between voyages on Icelandic water vessels, it would not have been right to have regarded him as having remained dependent upon the industry during that period.</p>
	<p pid=".238W.8/3">One consequence of the generosity of this aspect of the scheme rules was that time spent in prison did not break continuity, provided the former trawlerman's most recent work before going into prison had been on an Icelandic water vessel, and that he had resumed work on such a vessel after his release, having done no other work in between.</p>
	<p pid=".238W.8/4">The continuity of service rules under the statutory redundancy payments scheme are different, and much stricter. In particular, there is a requirement for continuous service with the same employer (or an associated employer), whereas under the compensation scheme there was no such requirement.</p>

	<p pid=".243W.9/1">We have received assurances from the US authorities that no anti-personnel landmines were stored on Diego Garcia during 2001 or 2002. In contrast to anti-personnel landmines, anti-tank mines are not banned weapons under international law and are not subject to ban under international treaties. No anti-tank mines were stored on Diego Garcia by the British authorities in 2001 or 2002. The storing of such mines by the US authorities would be a matter for them under the various international agreements regulating their defence facility on the island.</p>

Under international law we are prohibited from intervening in individual cases before the courts in another sovereign country. However, we continue to stress to the Indonesian Government the importance of a fair and transparent judicial system, and of applying the law in an even-handed way to all who break it. We have also offered human rights training for a number of Indonesian Supreme Court Judges. The Indonesians welcomed this training, and are keen for it to go ahead.</p>

In the centre and south of Iraq, under-five mortality rates are 131 per 1,000 live births&mdash;worse than the Democratic Republic of the Congo or Mozambique. The situation is particularly bad in the centre and south of Iraq where conditions have been deteriorating since the 1980s.

Aside from our role in the UN, UK assistance to Iraq continues both bilaterally and through the EC. Since 1991 the UK has provided over &pound;100 million for humanitarian work. The Department for International Development's ongoing programme expects to spend &pound;8 million this financial year.</p>
	<p pid=".252W.11/3">We are holding regular discussions with the UN, US and others about ways to minimise the suffering of the Iraqi people, including in the possible event of military action. One key priority will be to re-establish the Oil For Food distribution network as quickly as possible if it is disrupted. In addition to DFID's ongoing programme we are also providing &pound;3.5 million funding for humanitarian contingency planning and prepositioning of basic supplies by UN agencies, including UNICEF and UNHCR.</p>

This is not a new problem and was addressed in the Intelligence and Security Committee's last Annual Report (Cm 5542) and the Government's response (Cm 5543). The Government continues to take this problem seriously, and the Director of GCHQ and Sir David Omand are taking steps to improve the situation. This shortcoming in the accounts has not had any impact on GCHQ's operations. There is no evidence that this problem, has led to any material financial loss.</p>

The six areas identified here, which have been made public (in HC368 of <phrase class="date" code="2003-01-30">30 January 2003</phrase>, page 5) are drawn from the Agencies' individual statements of internal control, the full details of which are available to the Chairman of the Public Accounts Committee and to the Intelligence and Security Committee. On the matter of the shortcomings in GCHQ's management of assets and the Government's determination to correct these, I refer my hon. Friend to the answer I gave him today. Weaknesses in the other areas mentioned were of a smaller scale and steps have already been taken to improve control in these areas. There is no evidence that any of these weaknesses have led to material financial loss and there has been no impact on the Agencies' operational effectiveness.</p>

	<p pid=".255W.3/1">The London Fire Brigade (LFB), and the London Fire and Emergency Planning Authority (LFEPA) and its predecessors, have long been closely involved in contingency planning for a major emergency in the capital. Following the events of <phrase class="date" code="2001-09-11">11 September 2001</phrase>, it was recognised that an enhanced emergency planning capability involving LFB, LFEPA and other key agencies was needed to deal with the new kind of threat. In May 2002, a new strategic planning regime was set up under the London Resilience Forum, chaired by myself with the Mayor as my deputy. LFB and LFEPA are represented at a senior level on the London Resilience Forum, and secondees from LFB and LFEPA are attached to the London Resilience Team, an inter-agency team based in the Government Office for London which reports to me and which is driving forward a programme of action to increase London's preparedness against a major terrorist attack. As part of this programme, LFB, LFEPA and other key agencies have been closely involved in drawing up a new command and control structure for ensuring a co-ordinated response from the emergency services, the Government and other key players in the event of a catastrophic incident.</p>

	<p pid=".264W.6/2">In 1996 DOE published a report &quot;Methane and other gases from disused coal mines: The Planning Response&quot; which discussed the problems posed by gases, including methane, from disused coal mines, in the context of town and country planning. It provided factual information for those involved with land and property such as planners, developers, owners and insurers, and is relevant to both new and existing development. The report mentions that between 1945 and 1994 there were about 75 surface gas emissions recorded, of which 70 per cent. involved methane, and in 35 per cent. of these cases the gas ignited. Half (nine) involved residential property. A copy of the report is in the House Library.</p>
	<p pid=".264W.6/3">Since 1995 the Coal Authority (CA) has been recording incidents of water, gas and major collapses involving non-operational coal mines. The CA's Surface Hazard call-out system, which aims to attend a call within two hours and make safe within six hours, recorded 68 incidents of surface mine gas between 1995 and 2002 of which four were in the West Midlands. These incidents include both methane and other oxygen-deficient gases such as carbon-dioxide. Incidents are tackled urgently to avoid damage or other problems.</p>

	<p pid=".267W.5/1">Within Government, the Sustainable Procurement Group has considered the scope to stimulate markets for recycled goods via public procurement and will make its recommendations to Ministers within the next few weeks. The Group has sought advice from the Waste Resources Action Programme (WRAP) (which was set up to encourage market development for recycled goods) on increasing the uptake of recycled products across Government and we expect its recommendations to point the way to significant improvements in purchasing of recycled products throughout the public sector. The increasing statutory targets that currently exist for local authorities will also provide an incentive for them to ensure that there is a market for recycled goods in place.</p>
	<p pid=".267W.5/2">More recently the Prime Minister's Strategy Unit report on Waste Strategy has recommended that the work that the Waste Resources Action Programme (WRAP) is undertaking with the Local Government Association and Improvement and Development Agency to promote the take-up of green procurement by local authorities be extended still further. It also suggested that formal mechanisms be put in place to roll out best practice tools developed by the Sustainable Procurement Group to local government. In Central Government it recommended targets for the use of recycled materials. Voluntary green targets were also recommended for local authorities to purchase more recycled goods, minimise waste volumes and to encourage them to recycle more of their waste. The Government aim to publish their response to that report in the spring.</p>

	<p pid=".270W.2/1">We monitor the humanitarian situation in Burma and Thailand including the situation for the 140,000 refugees living in camps, an estimated 1 million irregular migrants living on or near the border and the vulnerable populations living in border areas in Burma itself. Getting relief to internally displaced people living on the Burmese side of the border is difficult and dangerous. We provide humanitarian assistance on both sides of the border through carefully selected agencies eg UNHCR and ICRC in Thailand and Burma. The ICRC is the only organisation with a permanent international presence on both sides of the border. We also support WHO's border health programme in Thailand. In addition, we support food relief assistance for refugee camps through the Burmese Border Consortium (BBC). In the current financial year 2002&ndash;03 DFID's assistance in these areas will amount to around &pound;3 million.</p>

	<p pid=".277W.3/1">We are providing assistance in various ways to help bring the benefits of mobile communications to poorer people in developing countries. For example, the Building Digital Opportunities programme is supporting work at the policy level (e.g. by assisting regulators to develop pro-poor policy environments) and with communities (e.g. supporting local approaches to providing valuable information to poorer communities through mobile phones). Strategic interventions such as our new CATIA programme (Catalysing Access to ICTs in Africa) and the Open Knowledge Network, both include support for pro-poor mobile communication channels.</p>
	<p pid=".277W.3/2">In addition, we are working to attract greater private sector participation in expanding mobile communications in developing countries. In close consultation with key private companies and the DTI, we are jointly exploring how to enable the private sector bring affordable communications services to the great majority of people in developing countries without easy access to a public telephone. Mobile communications will play a critical role in this. In addition, DFID is contributing to broader infrastructure investment funds, such as the EAIF&mdash;Emerging Africa Infrastructure Fund&mdash;which can support, inter alia, investments in mobile communications facilities.</p>

	<p pid=".278W.3/1">The economic crisis has seriously compromised household welfare. Many Palestinian families have endured long periods without work or incomes, and are now dependent on food aid for their daily survival. The international community has responded to the growing crisis through a range of interventions, including the provision of food. Donor disbursements have doubled accordingly in the last two years. But unless Palestinians can move around to work and trade, the Palestinian economy will continue to stagnate and the spiral of unemployment, poverty and malnutrition will worsen.</p>

	<p pid=".278W.6/1">Nearly two thirds of the world's population will be living in countries of significant water stress by the year 2025. 1.2 billion people currently lack access to safe drinking water and 2.4 billion people lack access to basic sanitation.</p>
	<p pid=".278W.6/2">The percentage of people served with some form of improved water supply rose from 77 per cent. in 1990 to 82 per cent. in 2000. The greatest gain in improved water coverage was in South-central Asia, from 72 per cent. to 85 per cent. The percentage of people with access to basic sanitation increased from 51 per cent. to 61 per cent. in the same period. Much work, however, has yet to be done. In sub-Saharan Africa, only 58 per cent. of the population has access to improved water sources. The 2002 UN Human Development Report has indicated that nearly 25 countries, the majority in Sub-Sahara Africa, are lagging or are far behind in respect to meeting the MDG for water, with another 75 countries lacking data to effectively assess their progress. But all of the goals remain achievable if developing countries and the international community have the determination to ratchet up their efforts.</p>
	<p pid=".278W.6/3">My Department is providing substantive financial support and technical assistance to initiatives that support the assessment of access to improved water supplies and sanitation, including the United Nation's Joint Monitoring Programme which provides the UN reference at both global, regional and country levels and the World Water Assessment Programme, a collective and consolidated UN system-wide assessment and reporting facility which provides analysis and data on the state of global freshwater and status review of the attainment of the water and sanitation targets.</p>
	<p pid=".278W.6/4">To promote sustainable access to safe drinking water, my Department's activities at the international and national levels are looking to address the issues of political will, institutional capacity to provide and maintain services, scaling up initiatives to increase coverage, and long term sustainability incorporating cost-recovery and maintenance.</p>

	<p pid=".280W.5/1">My Department's expenditure on water supply and sanitation has remained broadly static between 2000&ndash;02, at approximately &pound;63 million, which accounts for 70 per cent. of the total water sector expenditure. Of that, 60 per cent. was allocated to urban and 40 per cent. to rural water and sanitation programmes. Total expenditure in the water sector was &pound;90.6 million in 2000&ndash;01 and &pound;87.2 million in 2001&ndash;02. Figures are not yet available for 2002&ndash;03. New commitments to the water and sanitation sector made during 2001&ndash;02 totalled &pound;86.2 million.</p>
	<p pid=".280W.5/2">We are not able to disaggregate expenditure data to determine precise allocation to specific activities within the water supply and sanitation sector. However the underpinning premise of all our water and sanitation programmes is to build and strengthen institutional capacity and human resource capacity in developing countries.</p>
	<p pid=".280W.5/3">In addition to our work through our Country programmes, our Knowledge and Research (KAR) programme works to encourage our engagement with Southern institutions to encourage capacity building of formal and informal poor urban communities to improve local water and sanitation services. Additionally, through our resource centres, OASIS and WELL, my Department is actively engaging with developing countries and their supporting institutions to build human resource capacity within the water and sanitation sector.</p>

	<p pid=".281W.5/1">The latest Zimbabwe Vulnerability Assessment Committee survey indicates that 7.2 million people are currently in need of emergency food aid. The WFP and bilateral programmes aim to target 40 per cent. of needs, with the Government of Zimbabwe and the private sector responsible for the greater part of the response. Government reports imports of around 700,000 tonnes of maize to date, but the distribution of this food is not transparent, and the private sector has been excluded from participation.</p>
	<p pid=".281W.5/2">The performance of the World Food Programme and its implementing partners has improved steadily. In January 2003, 3.3 million people were fed, and another 2 million people received supplementary food through bilateral programmes. The WFP is close to meeting its revised target of feeding 4.5 million people in February 2003, and 5 million in March 2003. Contributions and pledges to the WFP emergency appeal mean that the main WFP pipeline is 83 per cent. full until June of 2003.</p>
	<p pid=".281W.5/3">Prospects for the coming year are under assessment. Insufficient maize was planted and the lack of fertilizers and rainfall raise the prospect of another poor production year. The capacity of the Government of Zimbabwe to continue to import maize in quantity is of concern, and it is already clear that continued international assistance will be needed. Donors are already planning for the future, and urging Government to ease price controls, which are distorting internal markets, and to open importation to the private sector to help meet needs.</p>

	<p pid=".281W.8/1">The current FMD outbreak started in August 2001 at the time of the farm invasions, when fences were destroyed and domestic cattle were allowed</p>
	<p pid=".281W.8/2">to mingle with wild buffalo that carry the disease. Since then the illegal movement of animals and livestock theft has widened the geographic area of the outbreak.</p>
	<p pid=".281W.8/3">Although the disease is highly infectious it appears to have a lesser impact in local domestic livestock, which although they become ill rarely die. There are fears however that the disease could spread to the more susceptible dairy animals. Exports of beef, dairy and pork products have been banned, halting the country's US$ 60 million export trade.</p>
	<p pid=".281W.8/4">As smallholders own most of the cattle in Zimbabwe they are exposed to restrictions on animal movements and receive lower prices for their animals from infected areas. Foreign exchange shortages are limiting efforts to vaccinate animals at risk. Despite the best efforts of the veterinary services to control the outbreak there is neither the funding nor the political will to prevent illegal movement and restore the wildlife fences.</p>

These vehicles, which are in most cases eligible for Government grants under the Powershift programme, can make a small but significant improvement to local air quality in and around airports. BAA is also helping a number of local authorities to develop air quality action plans where its airports contribute to local air pollution problems. These action plans are likely to include further commitments to reducing emissions of pollutants from BAA's vehicle fleet.</p>

TRL Report 286 is principally a study of observed cycle helmet wearing rates in 1996. The report includes an assessment of current local authority initiatives to promote cycle helmet wearing and observed wearing rates but does not provide sufficient evidence to draw any firm conclusions about the effect of promotional campaigns on the levels of cycling.</p>
	<p pid=".285W.5/2">Our objectives to increase cycling and improve the safety of cyclists are complementary. A key component in making cycling more popular is to make it a safer and more pleasant activity. Cycle helmets are effective at reducing head, brain and upper facial injuries, so encouraging the use of cycle helmets is one of many approaches to improving the safety of cyclists on our roads. A number of other approaches are summarised in TRL Report 365.</p>

	<p pid=".288W.5/1">These figures are difficult to estimate, since they would require a detailed knowledge of the types of vehicle concerned, the extent of their overloading, the roads that they travelled on, and the distances they travelled. These figures are not available.</p>
	<p pid=".288W.5/2">Two thirds of heavy goods vehicle mileage occurs on motorways and trunk roads. On these roads carriageways and bridges are designed to cater for overweight vehicles, and the effect of these vehicles is too small to quantify when compared to the cumulative effect of traffic over the life of a road.</p>
	<p pid=".288W.5/3">Most modern articulated lorries are capable of carrying more than their normal operational weight safely. Overloading offences declined with the introduction of 40 tonne lorries in January 1999, and declined further when 44 tonne lorries were introduced in February 2001.</p>

	<p pid=".288W.8/1">Zebra crossings operate 24 hours a day and part-time operation of beacons could be taken to imply that this was not the case. It would also remove an important safety element that warns drivers that they are approaching a zebra crossing. There is, therefore, a real danger that adopting this proposal would increase accidents at pedestrian crossings at times when the flashing beacons are turned off. In view of this, we have no plans to make this amendment to the regulations.</p>

	<p pid=".290W.5/1">In response to Government targets, my Department has switched a number of its sites over to the purchase of electricity from renewable energy sources that are exempt from the Climate Change Levy. Where this has taken place, the actual average price was 4.07p/kWh, the 'standard' electricity price would have been 3.9p/kWh, so the increase due to the purchase of this renewable energy is 0.17p/kWh or 4.3 per cent.</p>

It explains the differences between the Traffic Signs Regulations and General Directions (TSRGD) 2002 and the TSRGD 1994 that they replace. It does not contain guidance on sign clutter. However the Department will be publishing updated guidance later this year which will remind signing practitioners that signs should be used sparingly whether in the countryside or in towns. The revised Chapter 4 of the Traffic Signs Manual, on the use of warning signs, which we expect to publish in the summer, will provide advice on how to provide effective signing while minimising environmental intrusion. Revised guidance on the use of directional signs to tourist destinations will remind local authorities of the need to minimise the environmental impacts of signs, particularly in rural areas.</p>

Friend the Secretary of State for Defence announced the way forward for CVF. Our conclusion was that, to obtain value for money and provide the best capability, an alliance approach would offer the best meansof delivering a programme of this magnitude. We envisage that the alliance will be led by BAE Systems as the preferred Prime Contractor, with responsibility for project and shipbuilding management. Thales UK will assume a major role as the Key Supplier of the whole ship design. We intend the Ministry of Defence to take up a formal role within the Alliance. Negotiations on the alliance arrangements are now underway, and it is therefore not yet possible to state what proportion of the costs will be paid to BAE Systems or Thales. It is not intended to place the Prime Contract for the Demonstration and Manufacture phase of the CVF programme, during which the ships will actually be built, until the spring of 2004.</p>

	<p pid=".297W.8/1">Collaboration in defence programmes can bring economic benefits by sharing non-recurring costs and through economies of scale in production and, further through the life cycle, by sharing in service support and upgrade costs. Collaboration is considered in all equipment programmes when developing the procurement strategies to best meet the needs of our Armed Forces, but it is not an easy option. Harmonising requirements, aligning funding and approvals processes and meeting workshare expectations amongst anything from two partners upwards is rarely straightforward. Thus tune, cost and performance risks can be magnified in collaborative programmes. Overall, however, the benefits more than outweigh the potential disadvantages.</p>

	<p pid=".300W.2/1">The Ministry of Defence has issued 27 licences for hunting with dogs on the Defence Estate for the 2002&ndash;03 season, including one for the Colchester area. In the absence of a statutory ban, my Department has no legal grounds on which to stop this activity, which has been undertaken under licensed conditions for many years on its estate. However, mindful of all the issues involved, foxhunting is restricted to those hunts that have traditionally held licences or enjoyed such rights on the Defence Estate.</p>

	<p pid=".301W.9/1">As was made clear in the SDR New Chapter in July 2002, in post-Cold War conventional military operations there has been an increased emphasis on the need for precision in the use of force, to minimise unintended casualties and accidental damage.</p>
	<p pid=".301W.9/2">The ability to conduct covert stand-off reconnaissance and surveillance, the accurate pin-pointing of targets, the updating and communication of targeting information in near real time and the ability to strike hard with a high degree of precision, will all be important. Land attack cruise missiles can play a key role in such a scenario. This capability is presently provided by submarine-launched Tomahawk missiles.</p>
	<p pid=".301W.9/3">The principal role of the Type 45 Destroyers will be Anti-Air Warfare. However, they are being designed and built with significant space and weight margins to enable incremental acquisition, should an emerging requirement necessitate a different equipment fit. Our requirements are being kept under review and, under such circumstances, the design could be modified to incorporate improved land attack capabilities, including a land attack cruise missile system.</p>

	<p pid=".306W.5/24">The Ministry of Defence does not have a specific research and development budget. There is a research budget covering non-nuclear research known as the Research Building Block. Separately, the MOD has a much larger budget for the acquisition of equipment within which some expenditure may be regarded as equipment development and some as equipment production. The development element of the acquisition expenditure is not used as a control total. The amount that is statistically counted as development (rather than production) in any one year is largely a consequence of the stage of the procurement cycle at which major equipment projects happen to be in the year in question. Expenditure on 'development' for 2001&ndash;02 to 2003&ndash;04 is therefore not yet separately identifiable.</p>

This led to the design and build of the 97 metre demonstrator RV Triton, which has recently completed an extensive and very successful trials programme. The data gathered will be shared with industry in support of possible trimaran solutions for future defence requirements.</p>

We expect to select a single successful contractor for the demonstration and manufacture phase by mid-2004. Watchkeeper is a complex programme, involving the integration of aerial vehicles with a ground control segment and wider connectivity to future communication systems such as Bowman. Therefore it was important to ensure that those companies selected for the remainder of the assessment phase can deliver a solution that will meet our operational requirements, at price we can afford and within the required timescales. After initial assessment of the bids, we sought clarification on a range of issues from each of the four bidders in December 2002. The decision and subsequent announcement was then made as quickly as possible following receipt of each bidder's response to these additional points of clarification.</p>

As a rule, it should attract a custodial sentence unless it is a first time offence and there are clear mitigating circumstances. Sentences act as a deterrent in a number of ways, including restricting opportunities to re-offend and by tackling the causes of an individual's offending behaviour.</p>

	<p pid=".315W.3/1">The operating contractor of Ashfield young offender institution is Premier Prison Services which also operates Doncaster prison and young offender institution, Dovegate and Lowdham Grange prisons. I have not had discussions with Premier about any of these prisons, but I visited Ashfield on <phrase class="date" code="2002-08-29">29 August 2002</phrase> because of the concern that had been expressed about its performance. I am also regularly informed by the Prison Service about significant developments there and elsewhere in the Service.</p>
	<p pid=".315W.3/2">No sanctions have been imposed on Premier directly as a result of the report of Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Prisons. However the Prison Service has made deductions from the fee payable to Premier totalling &pound;350,305 during the period November 2001 to October 2002 for failures to deliver acceptable levels of performance.</p>
	<p pid=".315W.3/3">Premier has recently introduced a new employment package for existing staff and new recruits in response to Prison Service concerns. The initial signs are encouraging in that the rate of staff resignations is falling.</p>
	<p pid=".315W.3/4">The Director General of the Prison Service made the following statement on <phrase class="date" code="2005-02-03">3 February</phrase> in response to the report of Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Prisons on Ashfield young offender institution also published on <phrase class="date" code="2005-02-03">3 February</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid=".315W.3/5" class="indent">Ashfield has been struggling for some considerable time to provide an environment for young people which is safe and constructive. Premier's failures were so significant that in May 2002, some time before the Inspectorate's visit, I considered closing it and would have done so were it not for the population pressures we were facing. Instead, I took the unprecedented step of imposing a public sector governor and he made significant improvements. As Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Prisons (HMCIP) report acknowledges, a new, more constructive and safer regime, some weeks in the design stage, was successfully launched shortly after the HMCIP visit.</p>
	<p pid=".315W.3/6" class="indent">But these early improvements were not built upon as I had hoped. Since then I have personally intervened to help Premier recruit, in Vicky O'Dea, one of the most talented, committed and inspirational governors in the Prison Service. I have immense confidence in her and at last I am beginning to see signs of fundamental change for the better.</p>
	<p pid=".315W.3/7" class="indent">Premier runs good prisons at Doncaster and Lowdham Grange and is fast improving Dovegate prison. However, the company is under no illusion that if the recent improvements at Ashfield are not built upon I will have to consider terminating the contract by inviting Premier's bankers to appoint another private sector company to run the prison. Failing that, I will have to consider bringing Ashfield into the public sector. For the time being, we will only be using half the places at Ashfield and paying Premier only part of its monthly fee.</p>
	<p pid=".315W.3/8" class="indent">The introduction of the private sector into the running of prisons has brought immense benefits. My best prison is probably a private sector prison. But Ashfield, by some measure, is the worst. Sustained improvement is now vital if I am to be persuaded to leave the management of Ashfield in Premier's hands.</p>

	<p pid=".319W.2/1">The Government's policies are designed to ensure thatvictims of domestic violence receive help and support irrespective of gender, whilst recognising that this is a crime which predominantly affects women. Women are more likely to experience such violence over a lifetime, more likely to experience repeat victimisation, more likely to be injured and seek medical help, and more likely to experience frightening threats. Ministers have therefore emphasised that all forms of domestic violence are unacceptable and must be recognised and treated seriously, but have retained the policy focus on domestic violence against women, and children affected by domestic violence. This focus for the immediate future was agreed by the Ministerial group on Domestic Violence.</p>

	<p pid=".320W.2/1">Domestic violence is not separately identified in recorded crime statistics collected by the Home Office.</p>
	<p pid=".320W.2/2">The British Crime Survey (BCS) provides information on the number of incidents of domestic violence in England and Wales. It estimated that there were 122,000 incidents of domestic violence against men and 514,000 incidents against women in interviews in 2001/2.</p>
	<p pid=".320W.2/3">The BCS figures are derived from a sample and so are subject to sampling error. Moreover, the BCS is carried out by face-to-face interviews and some respondents may be unwilling to reveal experience of domestic violence to interviewers. The 1996 BCS included a self-completion component on domestic violence to encourage disclosure. Results were published in Home Office Research Study No. 191&mdash;copies are available in the Library. This more confidential approach to measurement revealed that the proportion of women that were victims of domestic assault in the last year was over three times higher than in the main BCS. It found that six per cent of women and five per cent of men had been threatened or assaulted by a current or former partner in the last year.</p>

	<p pid=".327W.5/15">Under the Crime Fighting Fund (CFF) recruitment initiative Nottinghamshire Police have been allocated an additional 157 recruits over and above the force's previous recruitment plans for the three years to March 2003. Funding for these officers will continue in 2003&ndash;04. The CFF will continue in 2003/04 and we will fund 75 per cent of the cost of new recruits through CFF rather than 100 per cent as in the past three years. Nottinghamshire Police Authority has been allocated &pound;96,000 which on the basis of 75 per cent funding should be sufficient for the force to recruit a further 17 police officers through this fund.</p>

	<p pid=".329W.8/1">The delivery of prisoners to court on time has been affected by the recent increase in the prison population. The Prison Service is trying in a number of ways to improve performance and service delivery.</p>
	<p pid=".329W.8/2">A recent pilot exercise at Pentonville prison streamlined the escort contractor's work so as to prioritise the delivery of prisoners to court, according to the needs and timings of court business; this resulted in an 11 per cent. improvement in performance in London. The pilot may be extended across the wider Prison Service estate, subject to further findings.</p>
	<p pid=".329W.8/3">The number of courts linked to the video link system is also increasing, with 123 magistrates' courts and one crown court currently using the service. A further 30 crown courts are to receive video link equipment by the end of August 2003, with funding currently being sought for a further 50 crown courts to be linked to the system. This use of the video links system between courts and prisons, which results in a decrease in the number of prisoners having to attend court in person, should help to release contractors' resources and so reduce delays in the movement of prisoners.</p>
	<p pid=".329W.8/4">The Prison Service is also reviewing the internal working practices of some of those prisons that serve the courts to see if a closer correlation between those arrangements and court business hours could be achieved.</p>
	<p pid=".329W.8/5">The contracting out of prisoner escort arrangements has offered better value for money, a reduction in the number of escapes and has freed up prison officers to concentrate on their core duties. A recent Prison Service review confirmed that the service should continue to be contracted out. It also concluded that existing contracts, which are planned to become operational in 2004, should be replaced with more flexible ones to allow the Prison Service to respond more quickly to future business needs. The Prison Service is developing this approach and, together with the relevant agencies in the criminal justice system, is considering how all involved can work together to improve the service.</p>

The following tables show the proportion of violent incidents in which victims felt that the offender/s was under the influence of drink or drugs, firstly for all violence reported to the survey and then separately for the breakdown by individual types of violence.

Individual LEAs will therefore hold information on how much capital investment is being directed towards replacing classrooms in their area.</p>

	<p pid=".339W.5/1">Over the last five years, average class sizes in maintained primary and secondary schools in Havering LEA have been very similar to the national average, as shown in the table. In September 2002, Havering achieved full compliance with infant class size legislation.</p>
	<p pid=".339W.5/2">Retention of good quality teachers in Havering, as elsewhere, is a key priority and we are aware that some schools in some areas are still experiencing problems. However, the new National Agreement signed by the Department and its key partners will enable us to take forward our plans for remodelling the teaching profession. This in turn will address the key recruitment and retention issues of workload and bureaucracy. Taken together with our work on improving pupil behaviour and strengthening leadership within schools, we believe this will lead to a further increase in new teachers in London and elsewhere and encourage more existing teachers to remain in the profession.</p>

	<p pid=".341W.3/2">We are reducing and will continue to reduce the burden of unnecessary red tape on further education colleges. We have already announced plans to reduce the number of separate budget lines for the Learning and Skills Council from 45 to five, and to consolidate targeted funds for pay and staff training into colleges' core funding, and to introduce three year funding for colleges, from this year.</p>
	<p pid=".341W.3/3">The Government and the Learning and Skills Council are committed to implementing in full the recommendations of the Bureaucracy Busting Task Force, chaired by Sir George Sweeney, which reported in November 2002. In particular, we will establish powerful scrutiny arrangements to keep in check demands on colleges, remove the requirement for all colleges to have an annual external audit of their Individual Learner Records, and work across government agencies to avoid repeat requests to colleges for the same information.</p>
	<p pid=".341W.3/4">We are determined to go further. In particular, we are working with the Inspectorates to introduce more co-ordinated inspection arrangements, for example for colleges providing both FE and HE, and lighter touch inspection arrangements for better performing colleges. We will also assess, in 2003, the regulation of FE institutions through a review of the Instrument and Articles of Government.</p>
	<p pid=".341W.3/5">FE institutions are independent corporations responsible for their own staffing and employment policies. As administrative burdens reduce, college managers will be free to make their own decisions about how they allocate resources within their own</p>

We decided not to pursue bonds as an option because the gains from a Government issue of bonds were not clear, and the cost of borrowing by higher education institutions (to fund the lending involved in a bonds option) would inevitably have been higher than borrowing by Government.

	<p pid=".342W.3/1">We said in the White Paper, The Future of Higher Education, that those with higher education qualifications earn around 50 per cent. more than non-graduates. Since graduates earn more than non-graduates, they also pay more tax. The amount of extra income tax they would pay over a working life will depend on how personal allowances, tax rates and thresholds change over time.</p>
	<p pid=".342W.3/2">In drawing up the proposals in the White Paper, no specific estimates were made of the extra income tax that graduates would pay over their working lives compared to non-graduates.

	<p pid=".344W.2/15">Figures have been individually rounded</p>
	<p pid=".344W.2/16">These estimates are based on projected student numbers for English and Welsh domiciled students in UK Higher Education Institutions in 2001&ndash;02. As numbers increase so would the cost of providing grants to a fixed percentage. The figures in the table assume that all students either the lowest 25 per cent. or 10 per cent. qualify for the full amount of the grant and that those above these levels get no grant. In practice, means tested grants are almost always tapered out more gently above the threshold for entitlement of the full grant. This increases the costs.</p>

	<p pid=".347W.2/1">The Government is not yet in a position to make a statement about the assistance that will be given to private individuals meeting the costs of learning. As part of the fundamental Review of the Funding of Adult Learning that is currently being undertaken, we are looking at all possible options for funding the acquisition of skills, from the points of view of both individuals and employers. The outcomes of the Review will form part of the Skills Strategy, to be published in June 2003. The Strategy will set out how different government programmes and policies will contribute to raising the skills of the population.</p>

	<p pid=".347W.5/1">I have not received any significant representations from learning providers on the need for higher level skills in the Information Technology (IT) sector in recent months. However, we remain aware of their ongoing importance and committed to the policies we have introduced to meet these needs. Skills deficits in the sector have declined from their peak in 1999 when the Stevens report, &quot;Skills for the Information Age&quot; highlighted these issues. Since that time, an &pound;8 million programme of measures has been put in place to improve the image of the IT industry, build greater understanding of the labour market and strengthen links between education and industry.</p>
	<p pid=".347W.5/2">Recent developments include establishing New Technology Institutes to provide high quality teaching facilities and progression routes into honours degrees, based on partnership between universities, colleges and employers. And currently, e-skills-UK are in the final stages of development to becoming the Sector Skills Council for the industry. They will provide a vital lead in articulating employers' requirements and helping to ensure there is high quality and relevant provision available.</p>

	<p pid=".351W.2/1">Schools and local education authorities have duties under the Education Act 1996 to identify, assess and make suitable provision for children with special educational needs, including those with autism. Provision for children with autism is made in mainstream schools with support; autism units attached to maintained schools; generic special schools; independent, non-maintained or maintained autism specialist schools or through home-based provision.</p>
	<p pid=".351W.2/2">To help schools, local education authorities and others develop and audit appropriate provision, my Department, in partnership with the Department of Health, published good practice guidance on autistic spectrum disorders last year. Among other things, this reflected the work of the Department for Education and Skills-funded West Midlands SEN Regional Partnership which has been focusing on a regional, multi-agency approach to creating a range of provision to meet the range of autistic children's needs.</p>

	<p pid=".354W.5/1">The latest data from the Universities and Colleges Admissions Service (UCAS) show UK and overseas applicants for entry into English universities are up by 1.7 per cent. from 300,000 in 2002&ndash;03 to 305,000 in 2003&ndash;04. These are very early figures as the applications cycle is only just beginning, but we welcome the increase in applicants. It is too early to say what the final picture will be as it is final acceptance figures, not early application figures, which are the most important indicator of entry to HE.</p>

	<p pid=".354W.8/1">Over 95 per cent. of school pupils already undertake work experience placements in their last years of compulsory schooling to develop the skills and attitudes essential for the world of work. About 75 per cent. of these placements are for two weeks or longer. The Department provides &pound;25 million a year, via the Learning and Skills Council (LSC), for school/business links activities. Around &pound;10 million goes towards the costs of the work experience programme, which aims to ensure that all Key Stage 4 pupils can undertake at least two weeks' high quality work experience. In addition, a range of guidance and support is provided by the Department and the LSC to help local partners meet this objective. Independent evaluations of work experience show that placements are generally satisfactory and well-received by schools, pupils and employers.</p>

This analysis showed an apparently small investment&mdash;2 per cent.&mdash;in research into cancer prevention. But this category only included research aimed at the direct application of strategies to prevent cancer, and several other facets that inform preventive strategies are covered by other categories, such as aetiology, which includes diet.</p>
	<p pid=".358W.6/3">The real investment in research relevant to future cancer prevention strategies was therefore larger than 2 per cent., but was still relatively low. The NCRI partner organisations agreed that the scale of research into cancer risk would benefit from closer joint examination. The NCRI has established a strategic planning group to carry out a much more detailed analysis of the research activity in this area, to discuss any potential opportunities and to identify any further action necessary.</p>

	<p pid=".360W.0/3">The HPC consulted about which titles should be protected by law and has undertaken extensive market research to understand the public's perception of titles currently in use by healthcare professionals. The HPC's decision to propose the protection of both chiropodist and podiatrist reflects the general perception that these titles are used interchangeably. The titles indicate that those registered have met HPCs standards of competence. All applicants for registration will be expected to meet standards of proficiency, whether they are applying through the transitional arrangements, as international applicants or as UK applicants who have completed an approved course.</p>
	<p pid=".360W.0/4">The HPC proposes using subsections of the register to distinguish between modalities of care but believes that to distinguish between skill levels would be confusing and unnecessary. The HPC has no plans to introduce a sub-register for those practitioners who do not meet the Council's standards of proficiency and who would not therefore be able to use the protected titles. Ultimately, it is for the HPC to propose and the Privy Council to determine the protected titles that will be associated with parts and subsections of the Health Professions Register.</p>

	<p pid=".371W.2/1">A central budget of &pound;50 million per annum for the year 2003&ndash;04 to 2005&ndash;06 has been set up for specialist palliative care. This ensures that the pledge in the NHS Cancer Plan of an additional &pound;50 million per annum by 2004 is met. South Tyneside Primary Care Trust (PCT) has provisionally been allocated &pound;173,000.</p>
	<p pid=".371W.2/2">Before any allocations can be made from the central budget, the agreed cancer network plans will need to be approved by the strategic health authority&mdash;which will oversee the process and retain its monitoring role&mdash;and then be submitted to and approved by the National Partnership Group.</p>
	<p pid=".371W.2/3">The National Partnership Group is chaired by Professor Mike Richards, the National Cancer Director. It includes representatives from all levels of the National Health Service and a wide range of voluntary organisations. Network plans must be submitted to the National Partnership Group by <phrase class="date" code="2005-03-31">31 March</phrase> at the latest and the group will approve plans as soon as possible after that. Allocations will be made as soon as plans are approved. The &pound;50 million is to help tackle inequalities in access to specialist palliative care and to enable the NHS to make a realistic contribution to the cost hospices incur in providing agreed levels of service. The money is for specialist palliative care services in their entirety and not for voluntary hospices alone although, as they play an essential role and provide two thirds of all specialist palliative care, it is reasonable to expect they will get a fair slice of this extra money. Information about this process, about the criteria and of the provisional allocation for each PCT has been placed in the Library and is available on the Department of Health's website at <a href="http://www.doh.qov.uk/cancer/palliative0306.htm">www.doh.qov.uk/cancer/palliative 03 06.htm</a>.</p>

	<p pid=".375W.8/1">The training for the new social work degree has an emphasis on learning for practice. There is a requirement for students to spend a minimum of 2002 days learning in practice in at least two settings, to include statutory social work tasks involving legal intervention and of providing services to at least two user groups. Training providers must also ensure that students undertake specific learning in a number of key areas including communication skills with children, adults and those with particular communication needs. Partnership working and information sharing across professional disciplines and agencies must also be covered. I have placed a copy of the Requirements for Social Work in the Library.</p>
	<p pid=".375W.8/2">On qualification there are opportunities for further training in specialist areas such as childcare. As part of the reform of social work education, the General Social Care Council (GSCC) is undertaking a review of the current framework for post-qualifying training for social work. This will include a review of the PQ Child Care Award.</p>

However, at the Association of Directors of Social Services (ADSS) conference in October 2000 my right hon. Friend, the Secretary of State, announced funding for a three-year student support scheme for those studying for first level professional social work qualifications.</p>
	<p pid=".376W.2/2">The funds for this scheme were put into a ring-fenced sub-programme of the Training Support Programme Grant and they have been used to enable employers to develop their experienced care staff by putting them forward for training in the Diploma in Social Work (DipSW). This year the funds can also be used to support staff who commence the new three year degree in social work in September 2003. The funds available in this TSP sub-programme are as follows:</p>

	</table>
	<p pid=".376W.2/13">In 2003&ndash;04, &pound;6 million will be allocated to ensure that each local council area has a Trainee Social Worker scheme. Some councils already have schemes to 'grow their own' social workers through trainee social worker schemes. The programme we are proposing will ensure that a scheme will be operating in all areas.</p>

	<p pid=".378W.0/1">We do not collect routinely information on stroke services at the level of detail requested in these questions. The most comprehensive source of information is the National Sentinel Stroke Audit, carried out by the Royal College of Physicians. The audit was commissioned by the National Health Service in 1998 and was last updated in 2002. The results can be found at</p>
	<p pid=".378W.0/2"><a href="http://www.rcplondon.ac.uk/pubs/strokeauditQl-02.pdf">http://www.rcplondon.ac.uk/pubs/strokeauditQl-02.pdf</a>.</p>
	<p pid=".378W.0/3">The audit contains information covering discharge arrangements, and clinical assessments including swallowing assessments and visual fields. The 2002 audit shows that 73 per cent. of trusts who participated had a stroke unit, compared to 56 per cent, three years earlier. In addition, 83 per cent, of patients receive brain imaging&mdash;the highest ever level. The audit shows that 80 per cent, of trusts that participated have a consultant physician with specialist knowledge of stroke who is formally recognised as having principal responsibility for stroke services. While it is recognised that some services need to increase their capacity, the audit notes that very significant improvements have already been made.</p>
	<p pid=".378W.0/4">Our major vehicle for further improving standards for stroke services is through the older people's national service framework (NSF), which sets specific milestones for improvement by 2004 of stroke services in primary care trusts (PCTs), specialist services and general hospitals that care for people suffering from a stroke. Our document, Improvement, Expansion and Reform, which sets for the NHS a priorities and planning framework for 2003&ndash;6, makes clear that implementation of the older people's NSF is a top priority and that the 2004 milestone around specialist stroke services is a key target.</p>
	<p pid=".378W.0/5">We monitor progress against the key milestones in the NSF. From the information gathered so far, we know that 83 per cent, of the hospitals who have replied now have plans to have a specialist stroke service in place by April 2004.</p>
	<p pid=".378W.0/6">Under the NSF, PCTs will need to ensure that every general practice can identify and treat patients identified as being at risk of stroke because of high blood pressure, atrial fibrillation or other risk factors by April 2004. To help ensure that the treatment they receive is of a consistent standard, the National Institute of Clinical Excellence is developing guidelines for the management of hypertension in primary care. The Institute's report is expected next year.</p>
	<p pid=".378W.0/7">Implementation of the NSF for older people is leading to real improvements in stroke services and making a difference to people's lives. The development of better services and improved standards in stroke care requires the right balance between national standards, provided by the NSF, national clinical guidelines and local control. It will be important to ensure that stroke care services are co-ordinated and fully integrated within a full range of other relevant local services.</p>
