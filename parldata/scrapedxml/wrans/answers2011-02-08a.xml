	<p pid="a.131W.5/1">I commissioned the Sport and Recreation Alliance to review regulatory burdens which affect sports clubs in the UK. The review will examine what prevents or hinders sports clubs and volunteers providing sport, and I anticipate them coming forward with a range of policy recommendations with the objective of cutting red-tape at grassroots level. The review is due to conclude in March.</p>
	<p pid="a.131W.5/2">The &#163;135 million sport legacy strategy, Places People Play, launched in November, will be funded by lottery money and has been developed in partnership with Sport England, the London Organising Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games (LOCOG), the British Olympic Association (BOA) and the British Paralympic Association (BPA).</p>
	<p pid="a.131W.5/3">As part of the programme, the Inspired Facilities fund will see Sport England invest &#163;50 million in creating a tangible legacy by improving up to 1,000 local sports facilities. Applications for funding will be open in April for the first of five &#163;10 million funding rounds, with the final one in 2014-15. Community sports clubs will be eligible to apply for the fund.</p>
	<p pid="a.131W.5/4">In addition, the Iconic Facilities fund will support innovative and sustainable large scale multi-sport facilities' projects that will become beacons for grassroots sports. &#163;30 million of capital national lottery funding will be invested by Sport England over three years. Applications for the first &#163;10 million funding round were accepted until December 2010 with further funding rounds opening in autumn 2011 and 2012.</p>
	<p pid="a.131W.5/5">We would also encourage every club to consider registering as a Community Amateur Sports Club (CASC). The scheme has provided valuable funding to sports clubs which allows them to benefit from certain tax reliefs, similar to those normally given to charities.</p>

	<p pid="a.134W.7/1">Nearly all British Waterways' water bodies are designated as heavily modified or artificial under the water framework directive, for which the objective is good ecological potential (GEP). In relation to the physical impacts caused by navigation, 82% of the water bodies owned by British Waterways are classed as being at GEP or better. This is not expected to change significantly by 2015. Most of British Waterways' canals are expected to meet the GEP target by 2027, in line with the objective set by the Environment Agency.</p>

British Waterways is working with the Environment Agency and private sector partners to identify funding for fish passes for another 20 weirs identified as a priority. Of the remaining weirs, some are so low that fish are already able to pass, some are at locations where there are alternative routes for them to pass, and others are on rivers where there are obstructions downstream that need attention first.</p>

	<p pid="a.135W.3/1">We are aware that signal crayfish have a profound impact on the native crayfish population, due to predation, competition, and the spread of disease. We are also greatly concerned that abundant signal crayfish populations also impact other native freshwater invertebrates, particularly soft-bodied species, thus altering the ecology of rivers. To help ensure the long-term survival of the native species, Natural England and the Environment Agency are supporting projects to establish refuge sites for white clawed crayfish. They are currently finalising a best practice/guidance document on decision-making in the placement and establishment of Ark sites, and other conservation requirements. Natural England is currently funding a project in south-west England involving a captive rearing programme at Bristol Zoo, the identification of Ark sites and reintroduction of white-clawed crayfish to a number of sites across the south-west.</p>
	<p pid="a.135W.3/2">Guidance on the creation of Ark sites has been drawn up by Buglife, and Ark site creation projects have been carried out by Buglife and the Peak District National Park, funded by Natural England through DEFRA's Aggregates Levy Sustainability Fund.</p>

	<p pid="a.135W.6/1">Natural England (NE) does not regularly monitor habitat loss outside of protected areas. As with other Schedule 5 species similarly protected under Section 9 of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981, in areas where white-clawed crayfish are present and work needs to be carried out, all practical measures must be taken to avoid or minimise impacts on the species. NE with the Environment Agency has produced guidance to help those planning work avoid or minimise impact on crayfish and improve habitats where possible. Depending on the type of project, various mitigation measures may be required with the aim being to ensure the long term survival of the resident breeding population. White-clawed crayfish inhabiting the affected area have to be temporarily removed by licensed crayfish handlers and are generally held until works have been completed. Crayfish habitat must be reinstated at the end of the works.</p>

	<p pid="a.136W.0/1">DEFRA is aware that research on signal crayfish shows that the species has an impact on both the physical nature of aquatic habitats (through burrowing and consequent siltation and erosion damage), and on a range of fauna and flora in rivers. The most noted impact is on the native white-clawed crayfish, but effects on other invertebrates and a number of fish species have been recorded. Clearly the scale of any impact will be increased as the signal crayfish population sizes increases in a given environment. A preliminary assessment of ecosystem health under the water framework directive indicates that up to 43 riverine water bodies (out of 5,818 in England and Wales) are likely to fail to achieve 'good ecological status' because of signal crayfish.</p>

There are safeguards in place so that housing benefit can be paid to the landlord if the tenant is unable or unlikely to pay their rent. Benefit is also paid direct to the landlord if the tenant is in arrears by eight weeks' rent.</p>

The income measures used to derive the estimates shown employ the same methodology as the Department for Work and Pensions publication &quot;Households Below Average Income&quot; (HBAI) series, which uses disposable household income, adjusted (or 'equivalised') for household size and composition, as an income measure as a proxy for standard of living.<br/> 5.

The Government's preferred measures of low income for pensioners are based on incomes measured after housing costs.

	<p pid="a.161W.5/1">The ability of patients to receive services outside of the 'catchment' area of the responsible general practitioner consortium will depend on local commissioning decisions for specific services and on existing contractual arrangements, and on the proposed introduction of patient choice of any willing provider (as such providers could be outside the 'catchment'). This is one of the key issues the Department has consulted on as part of the recent choice consultation. Details of how the choice offer will develop will be made in the response to choice consultation in the spring.</p>

Egg-allergic patients recommended to receive seasonal influenza vaccination should seek medical advice from their general practitioner (GP). The risk to the individual of not being immunised and the severity of the individual's egg allergy should be taken into account by GPs when considering whether to vaccinate. There are very few individuals who cannot receive influenza vaccine due to a history of confirmed anaphylactic reaction to any egg-containing product. In these rare cases, specialist advice should be sought with a view to immunisation under controlled conditions. In light of the reduced levels of egg protein in current seasonal influenza vaccines, the Department is aiming to review advice on the vaccination of patients with egg allergies.</p>

	<p pid="a.164W.6/1">The cross-Government mental health outcomes strategy 'No health without mental health', published on <phrase class="date" code="2011-02-02">2 February</phrase> was informed by an assessment of both the personal and economic costs of mental health problems. The costs of treatment alone are expected to double in the next 20 years, if we do nothing.</p>
	<p pid="a.164W.6/2">The strategy represents a major step forward in mainstreaming mental health and supporting the Government's important aim of achieving parity of esteem between physical and mental health. By promoting good health and intervening early we can help to prevent mental illness from developing and mitigate its effects when it does.</p>
	<p pid="a.164W.6/3">The Office for National Statistics survey 'Mental health of children and young people in Great Britain, 2004' found that 9.6% of children aged five to 16 years had a clinically recognisable mental disorder.</p>
	<p pid="a.164W.6/4">An estimate of future prevalence of mental health disorders was made in the King's Fund report 'Paying the Price: The cost of mental health care in 2026' published in 2008. It projected that by 2026 the number of children with conduct disorder, emotional disorder, hyperkinetic disorder and co-morbid disorders would increase by 13.3% to 687,969, up from an estimated 607,402 in 2007.

	<p pid="a.164W.6/6">The Adult Psychiatric Morbidity Survey is a survey among adults living in private households. In 2007 16.2% of the adult population reported prevalence of any common mental health disorder (CMD) similar to 2000 (16.4%) 9.7% of the population had a prevalence of mixed anxiety and depressive disorder compared to 9.4% the previous year.

For a particular provider, services would be designated by Monitor as subject to additional regulation ('designated services') upon application by the relevant commissioner(s) and where Monitor was satisfied that the statutory criteria had been met (see clause 69).</p>

The relaunch was also highlighted in the Department of Health's GP Bulletin.

The Government are committed to promoting the transition to a low carbon economy in the UK and the EU, and believe that this region can be at the forefront of such a transition. The Prime Minister gave his backing to plans for a European supergrid, giving further momentum to work in this area. The Government are already an active participant in the North Seas Offshore Grid initiative, which is looking at the potential for greater interconnection of electricity networks across the whole region.

I am keen that the reasons for high prices and supply issues this winter are thoroughly investigated by an independent authority. I wrote to the Office of Fair Trading (OFT) to ask it to bring forward its competition and consumer study into off-grid energy. I also asked the OFT if the study could explore the longer term consumer issues such as lifetime payback, consumer standards and labelling for alternative energy sources or supplies. Such a study would provide an independent assessment of the off-grid market and establish what further action may be necessary to ensure it works properly.</p>
	<p pid="a.183W.3/3">I welcome the independent assessment of the off-grid market to be made by the OFT, and we look forward to seeing its conclusions in advance of next winter so that the lessons from this winter can be learned and any necessary changes made.</p>

	<p pid="a.186W.0/1">It is not feasible to make a robust estimate of the total subsidies to wind power that will be necessary for it to be commercially viable without support. It would depend on a number of factors including when this occurs and the support mechanism. When this occurs will itself depend on factors including the speed at which wind costs fall (related to the degree of technological learning, commodity prices and supply chain development), future wholesale electricity prices and the relative costs of alternatives to wind.</p>
	<p pid="a.186W.0/2">The renewables obligation (RO) is currently the Government's main mechanism for incentivising large scale renewable deployment. Between its introduction in April 2002 and March 2010 it has provided approximately &#163;2.2 billion in 2010-11 prices of support to wind power.</p>
	<p pid="a.186W.0/3">Evidence is currently being gathered to inform the renewables obligation banding levels from 2013-17, and we are also consulting on electricity market reform, including the introduction of feed-in tariffs with contract-for-difference for low-carbon generation, and premium payments as a credible alternative.</p>

	<p pid="a.193W.2/2">There is no formally agreed definition of frontline, middle office and back office services, although these are terms in relatively common use across the police service. Consideration is being given, with the police service, to the establishment of a common definition. Although no fixed definition exists, frontline officers and staff are generally those directly involved in the public crime fighting face of the force. This includes neighbourhood policing, response policing and criminal investigation. Middle office services include a variety of functions which provide direct support to the frontline, such as police training and criminal justice administration. Back office services are those which keep police forces running smoothly such as finance and HR. Forces should focus on maintaining and improving frontline services, while reducing costs as much as possible in middle and back office support functions, consistent with supporting frontline services. Police forces can also maintain and improve frontline services by enabling frontline officers and staff to work more efficiently and effectively.</p>

	<p pid="a.198W.2/2">The Home Office does not assess specific provision of support services for male victims of sexual violence at either a national or local level.</p>
	<p pid="a.198W.2/3">In 2010-11, the Home Office has, in partnership with the Department of Health, allocated over &#163;2.2 million to support the creation and operation of new and existing Sexual Assault Referral Centres (SARCs) around the country. These centres provide crisis support and medical care for victims in the immediate aftermath of rape and are open to men and women above 14 or 16 years of age with some centres also providing services for children. They enable victims to access services anonymously, including a forensic examination if they wish, and to consider making a report to the police in a supportive and caring environment. SARCs also provide follow-up care, and often refer victims on to other forms of specialist local provision.</p>
	<p pid="a.198W.2/4">In addition, the Home Office has made available &#163;860,000 in 2010-11 to support Independent Sexual Violence Advisors (ISVAs). ISVAs work with victims of recent and historic serious sexual crimes to enable them to access the services they need in the aftermath of the abuse they have experienced. They provide impartial advice to the victim on all options open to them, such as reporting to the police, accessing Sexual Assault Referral Centres, seeking support from specialist sexual violence organisations and other services like housing or benefits.</p>
	<p pid="a.198W.2/5">In launching the cross-Government vision for tackling violence against women and girls on <phrase class="date" code="2010-11-25">25 November 2010</phrase>, the Secretary of State for the Home Department confirmed Home Office funding of more than &#163;28 million for specialist services until 2015. Of this, &#163;1.72 million will be available each year to support ISVAs in both the specialist voluntary sector and in SARCs.</p>

	<p pid="a.199W.9/1">The Department does not hold any information on the number of head teachers who have completed training on asbestos in schools in the last 10 years. However, many local authorities, as duty holders under the Control of Asbestos Regulations, have provided training to school staff and governors. Those who have responsibility for the maintenance of school buildings must be aware and have knowledge of the effective management of any asbestos containing materials.</p>
	<p pid="a.199W.9/2">The Department's guidance to schools on asbestos management is located on the Teachernet website at:</p>
	<p pid="a.199W.9/3" class="indent"><a href="http://www.teachernet.gov.uk/asbestos">www.teachernet.gov.uk/asbestos</a></p>
	<p pid="a.199W.9/4">There is extensive guidance and information on managing asbestos on the Health and Safety Executive's (HSE's) website, including a guide on the Management of Asbestos in Non-Domestic Premises, available at:</p>
	<p pid="a.199W.9/5" class="indent"><a href="http://www.hse.gov.uk/pubns/books/l127.htm">http://www.hse.gov.uk/pubns/books/l127.htm</a></p>
	<p pid="a.199W.9/6">Partnerships for Schools is currently working with HSE and asbestos training providers to produce training for head teachers to make sure they are fully aware of their roles and responsibilities.</p>
	<p pid="a.199W.9/7">Asbestos containing materials should be managed in accordance with the Control of Asbestos Regulations 2006 and HSE guidance. So long as asbestos is effectively managed there is no significant risk in leaving it in place. Asbestos which is in good condition and unlikely to be disturbed or damaged is better left in place and managed until the end of the life of the building as this presents less risk of exposure to the occupants than the process of removing it. Asbestos which is in poor condition, or which is likely to be damaged or disturbed should be sealed, enclosed or removed.</p>
	<p pid="a.199W.9/8">The Department has not commissioned any special study into the health risks to teachers, support staff and pupils from asbestos in schools. Evidence indicates that school teachers, as an identifiable occupational group, are no more at risk from contracting asbestos related diseases than the general population. Asbestos in the majority of local authority schools is being satisfactorily managed and HSE is continuing to promote the need for competence and vigilance on the part of those who have responsibility for the maintenance of school buildings, and take action where they find non compliance.</p>

	<p pid="a.203W.2/6" class="indent">Furthermore, the chance of survival increases as each successive year of age is reached. This means that a woman born in 1954 who has survived to age 57 in 2011 has an average 32 years of life remaining, giving an average life expectancy of 89 years.</p>

	<p pid="a.208W.5/1">The Apprenticeships programme is demand led. Government do not plan apprenticeship places by level but provides funding and forecasts the overall number of places that may be afforded. We rely on employers and providers to work together to offer sufficient opportunities to meet local demand, taking advantage of the greater freedoms and flexibilities that we have created in the further education system.</p>
	<p pid="a.208W.5/2">In 2009-10, the planned expenditure on participation in apprenticeship training was &#163;1,042 million<sup>(1)</sup>. The apprenticeship budget for the 2010-11 financial year is &#163;1,328 million<sup>(2)</sup>: &#163;780 million for 16-18 year olds; &#163;548 million for 19+. We expect to spend over &#163;1,400 million in the 2011-12 financial year: &#163;799 million for 16-18 year olds; &#163;605 million for those aged 19 and over<sup>(3)</sup>.</p>
	<p pid="a.208W.5/3">The total volume of apprenticeship starts in 2009/10 was 279,700. This is an increase of 16.6% compared to 2008/09. Of these there were:</p>
	<p pid="a.208W.5/4" class="indent">190,500 apprenticeship (Level 2) starts-a 20.2% increase on 2008/09;</p>
	<p pid="a.208W.5/5" class="indent">87,700 advanced apprenticeship (Level 3) starts-a 7.9% increase on 2008/09.</p>
	<p pid="a.208W.5/6" class="indent">1,500 higher level apprenticeship (Level 4+) starts-a large increase on 2008/09.</p>
	<p pid="a.208W.5/7">We have ensured there is sufficient funding in place to train over 350,000 apprentices in England in the 2010/11 academic year. For the 2011/12 academic year, our indicative forecast is to fund over 360,000 apprenticeship places. The levels that these places are at will be determined by the level of skills employers actually need in their business.</p>
	<p pid="a.208W.5/8">Provisional data shows that there were 119,800 apprenticeship starts in the first quarter of the 2010/11 academic year. Of these there were:</p>
	<p pid="a.208W.5/9" class="indent">76,300 apprenticeship (Level 2) starts;</p>
	<p pid="a.208W.5/10" class="indent">42,300 advanced apprenticeship (Level 3) starts; and</p>
	<p pid="a.208W.5/11" class="indent">1,200 higher level apprenticeship (Level 4 or higher) starts.</p>
	<p pid="a.208W.5/12">We are committed to improving, expanding and re-shaping apprenticeships so that Level 3 becomes the level to which learners and employers should aspire. We will also ensure there are clear routes into apprenticeships to widen access to the programme, and clear routes into higher level skills training including, but not exclusively, Level 4 apprenticeships.</p>

I am keen that the reasons for the high prices and supply issues affecting domestic consumers are thoroughly investigated by an independent authority. I therefore wrote to the Office of Fair Trading (OFT) to ask it to bring forward its competition and consumer study into off-grid energy, and asked the OFT if the study could explore the longer term consumer issues such as lifetime payback, consumer standards and labelling for alternative energy sources or supplies. Such a study would provide an independent assessment of the off-grid market and establish what further action may be necessary to ensure it works properly.</p>

By way of context, the number of applications received for the 2009/10 academic year cycle (up to mid October 2009), the SLC had received 914,000 applications for student financial support. In the same year (calendar year 2009), the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills received 3,070 pieces of correspondence about the SLC although there is a disproportionate cost to the Department to determine how many of these are specific complaints about the Company or how many of these have also complained directly to the Company.</p>

	<p pid="a.220W.6/1">International sanctions, including those adopted by the UN and the EU, show the strength of international concerns about Iran's nuclear programme. It is clear that sanctions are having an impact. Iran is finding it increasingly difficult to acquire access to goods of proliferation concern and is also finding it hard to access international finance, restricting its ability to fund its nuclear programme.</p>
	<p pid="a.220W.6/2">Inspections and reports by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) continue to reveal the progress of Iran's nuclear programme and highlight the areas where Iran is refusing to co-operate with the IAEA or comply with its safeguards obligations. This ensures that IAEA concerns over possible military dimensions to the Iranian programme are available for all to see.</p>
