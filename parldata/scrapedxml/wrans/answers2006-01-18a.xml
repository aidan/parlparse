	<p pid="a.1326W.8/2">The Government was aware of the existence of legitimate South African chemical and biological defence programmes from the 1980s. Initial reports indicating offensive chemical biological weapons activities (later known as &quot;Project Coast&quot;) were not received until 1993, but they were inconclusive, although there were unsubstantiated claims of chemical weapon use by South African forces in Angola, Mozambique and Zimbabwe in the 1980&ndash;90s. More detailed evidence of previous offensive activities was received in the years leading up to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission hearings in 1998, when further details of the offensive activities emerged. In 1994, we understood that the South African Government had terminated offensive chemical and biological weapon activities.</p>

	<p pid="a.1328W.3/1">DFID has been working with the international pharmaceutical industry in a number of ways to increase access to medicines, including for the treatment of HIV and AIDS, and for children.</p>
	<p pid="a.1328W.3/2">In March 2005 DFID, the Department of Trade and Industry and the Department of Health, launched a framework encouraging 'good practice' in the pharmaceutical industry to increase access to medicines. The framework contained a number of recommendations on how companies could increase access to medicines in developing countries, including through making medicines more affordable and through more research on diseases affecting developing countries. The framework encourages investment into new medicines for children among other areas.</p>
	<p pid="a.1328W.3/3">The UK also provides support to increase research into treatments and vaccines for diseases affecting developing countries, including for HIV and AIDS. This includes tax credits and direct support to product development public private partnerships. DFID has funded research on the use of existing medicines in developing country settings, such as a trial of co-trimoxazole that significantly reduced mortality among children living with HIV.</p>
	<p pid="a.1328W.3/4">DFID will continue to ensure the needs of children and other vulnerable groups are addressed as we work towards scaling up to universal access to treatment by 2010, as agreed by the G8 and by the millennium review summit. The Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), has established a Global Steering Committee, which the UK will co-chair. Plans will be based on the principle of country ownership&mdash;recognising the need to work through existing national structures and processes and focus on mobilising countries to scale up in line with the 2010 target.</p>
	<p pid="a.1328W.3/5">In addition the Global Steering Committee will encourage countries to identify obstacles and develop solutions, including addressing the development of appropriate treatments for key groups, such as children.</p>

	<p pid="a.1329W.2/1">Taking Action, the UK's strategy for tackling HIV and AIDS in the developing world, published in 2004, states that, our support for children affected by AIDS is reflected in all of DFID's country assistance plans in all affected countries. This comprehensive approach includes prevention, care and treatment as well as recognising the impact AIDS has on society, including increasing orphan rates. DFID's expenditure reporting reflects this comprehensive approach and given the aid instruments we use, it is not possible to disaggregate between moneys spent on treatment and those used for other AIDS related activities.</p>
	<p pid="a.1329W.2/2">The UK funds AIDS programmes in nearly 40 countries and works with a variety of organisations in respect of children affected by AIDS. DFID's spend on AIDS is not solely through bilateral programmes. A significant proportion is spent through multilateral instruments including the Global Fund to fight AIDS, TB and Malaria, the World Bank, UNICEF and the World Health Organisation (WHO); these play a role in funding paediatric treatment and care. The UK also finances a wide range of Civil Society organisations, including local NGOs such as the Dananai and Mavambo Trust in Zimbabwe, who are ensuring over 4,000 vulnerable children are able to attend school and that traumatised children receive appropriate counselling.</p>
	<p pid="a.1329W.2/3">In Malawi, for example, as part of DFIDs support to the National AIDS programmes, there are now over 60 facilities in Malawi delivering anti retroviral therapy for HIV and over 37,000 people on treatment. The numbers are increasing, around 4,500 people starting on therapy in the first three months of last year. 95 per cent. are over 13 years old and 81 per cent. of people who have ever taken treatment are alive. The UK will continue to advocate for comprehensive AIDS programmes that meet the needs of children as well as adults.</p>
	<p pid="a.1329W.2/4">The WHO reports <sup>1</sup> that access to HIV care and anti-retroviral therapy has not been extended widely to children. However, data is incomplete and the UK has urged the WHO, the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) and others to track the extent to which treatment and care programmes are meeting the needs of the poor, women and children.</p>
	<p pid="a.1329W.2/5">The Global Partners Forum on Children Affected by HIV and AIDS, which the UK is hosting in early February, will explore the current obstacles to treatment of children with HIV and AIDS, as well as other services and needs. In addition, the Global Steering Committee on Scaling up Towards Universal Access, which in turn is due to report to the UN General Assembly High Level meeting in June 2006, is considering the obstacles to scaling up access to treatment for children, including the lack of appropriate and effective diagnostic tools and treatments.</p>
	<p pid="a.1329W.2/6">Following publication of the DFID-funded Medical Research Council research findings, the WHO, UNAIDS and UNICEF issued a joint statement in November 2004 on the use of cotrimoxazole as a prophylaxis in HIV exposed and HIV affected children.</p>
	<p pid="a.1329W.2/7">The joint statement advocates that prophylactic dosing with Cotrimoxazole for HIV infected children with any sign or symptoms suggestive of HIV is a key intervention that should be offered as part of a basic package of care to reduce morbidity and mortality.</p>
	<p pid="a.1329W.2/8">The document further states that Cotrimoxazole prophylaxis is also a crucial potentially life saving intervention that should be given to all HIV exposed children born to HIV- infected mothers, in settings where HIV infection status cannot be reliably confirmed in the first 18 months of life.</p>
	<p pid="a.1329W.2/9">Following the joint statement, Cotrimoxazole is now universally accepted as a standard treatment package for all children exposed to HIV and on treatment and it is advocated for all children with HIV, regardless of whether they are receiving treatment.</p>
	<p pid="a.1329W.2/10">As a follow on to the Cotrimoxazole study DFID is providing funding support for a further trial through the Medical Research Council to examine the best use of anti-retrovirals for children.</p>

	<p pid="a.1330W.2/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="a.1330W.2/2">Terminator seeds' are plants bred using genetic use restriction technologies known as GURTs. The parties to the United Nations convention on biological diversity decided, in 2000, that there should be a precautionary approach to the use of GURTs while research into the possible impacts of these technologies was carried out. Parties at the meeting in March, this year, will consider a recommendation by the convention's subsidiary body for scientific technical and technological advice to reaffirm the previous decision. The subsidiary body's recommendation also encourages parties to continue to undertake further research on the impacts of GURTS and to share information from these studies and addresses capacity building for decision making in developing countries. Parties at the meeting will also consider a report on related matters from one of the convention's inter-sessional working groups before deciding what further decision is appropriate.</p>
	<p pid="a.1330W.2/3">Our position at the meeting will take full account of these reports, as well as the EU's own regulatory regime which requires that no GM seed may be marketed in the EU unless it has been specifically approved by the member states. Decisions on applications to market GMOs are made on a case-by-case basis taking full account of a scientific assessment of the particular GMO and the risks associated with its use against the criteria in the EU legislation. An application for a GMO incorporating GURTs would be dealt with in the same way as any other GMO. Approval would only be granted if the evidence showed that a deliberate release of the GMO would not pose an unacceptable risk to human health or the environment.</p>

	<p pid="a.1331W.2/1">My right hon. Friend, the Secretary of State for International Development, attended part of the conference; he was accompanied by his principal private secretary. DFID officials who attended all or part of the conference with my right hon. Friend, the Secretary of State, as part of the UK delegation, were: the Director of Europe, Trade and International Financial Institutions Departments, the Head of the International Trade Department and other departmental officials.</p>
	<p pid="a.1331W.2/2">No carbon offset measures specific to this conference were established, but DFID is committed to reducing carbon emissions from official air travel and, together with the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, has developed a pilot programme to help neutralise greenhouse gases. Under this pilot Programme, DFID staff can exchange air miles earned on official travel for &quot;earth miles&quot; at an agreed conversion value. Our aim is for partner airlines to return some of the revenue from flights sold to DFID to pay for a portfolio of 'carbon offset' projects. Carbon offsets, for example, clean energy technology or sustainable land use would neutralise carbon dioxide emissions and contribute to sustainable development in developing countries. We have set up agreements on this with three major airlines. In addition to this pilot programme, the Prime Minister has announced that offsetting would apply to all central Government Departments from April 2006.</p>
	<p pid="a.1331W.2/3">I have arranged for the document entitled 'trade and development package for G90' which was prepared by DFID for the World Trade Organisation (WTO) ministerial in Hong Kong to be deposited in the Libraries of the House. It sets out our view of a package of measures to assist the least developed and other poor and vulnerable WTO member countries&mdash;a 'development package'. The UK has been working to build international support for these measures, on which some progress was made in Hong Kong. Other documents produced in the run up to the ministerial will not be made public, since to do so may prejudice the Government's ability to negotiate in the UK's interests and would be likely to prejudice our relations with other states.</p>

Since 2001, the Department has operated between 50 (in 2000&ndash;01) and 65 (in 2003&ndash;04 and 2004&ndash;05) individual research and non-research contracts. These are spread across five research programmes&mdash;strategic policy analysis; eutrophication and acidification; photochemical pollution; toxic air pollutants; and ambient air&mdash;with a total value of around &pound;10 million per year. Details of the individual contracts, including total value, lead contractor and final reports (where applicable), can be accessed via the UK National Air Quality Information Archive: <a href="http://www.airquality.co.uk/archive/contracts/index.php">http://www.airquality.co.uk/archive/contracts/index.php</a>; the majority of contracts span between three and five years.</p>

	<p pid="a.1341W.2/1">In August 2005 the Pesticides Safety Directorate (PSD), an Executive Agency of DEFRA, wrote to relevant stakeholders explaining the implications of the removal of the authorisation for the use of strychnine and advising on alternative methods of control. This information is available on the PSD website (<a href="http://www.pesticides.gov.uk/approvals.asp?id=1475">www.pesticides.gov.uk/approvals.asp?id=1475</a>) and includes details of two aluminium phosphide fumigant products currently approved for use (Luxan Talunex and Phostoxin).</p>
	<p pid="a.1341W.2/2">Other methods of control are available including traps, repellents, habitat modification and fencing. In 2004, recognising the difficulties that removal of the strychnine authorisation could cause we commissioned the Central Science Laboratory to undertake a review of the range of controls. A copy of the report is available on the DEFRA website (<a href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/wildlife-countryside/vertebrates/reports/mole-review.pdf">http://www.defra.gov.uk/wildlife-countryside/vertebrates/reports/mole-review.pdf</a>).</p>
	<p pid="a.1341W.2/3">DEFRA's Rural Development Service has also published a Technical Advice Note (No.3) on mole control, including use of the two fumigant products.

	<p pid="a.1342W.2/1">Last year the Government launched the Courtauld Commitment, a voluntary agreement between 13 major retailers and WRAP to reduce packaging waste. There are three broad objectives to meet, which are:</p>
	<p pid="a.1342W.2/2" class="indent">i. to design out packaging waste growth by 2008;</p>
	<p pid="a.1342W.2/3" class="indent">ii. to deliver absolute reductions in packaging waste by March 2010; and</p>
	<p pid="a.1342W.2/4" class="indent">iii. to identify ways to tackle the problem of food waste.</p>
	<p pid="a.1342W.2/5">The are also two sets of Regulations which cover packaging in the UK both of which encourage producers (including retailers) to minimise packaging. The Producer Responsibility Obligations (Packaging Waste) Regulations 2005 are intended to increase the recovery and recycling of packaging waste. The amount of packaging waste producers have to recover and recycle is determined, in part, by the amount of packaging they handle. Therefore businesses can save money if they reduce the amount of packaging they use around their products. The Packaging (Essential Requirements) Regulations 2003 (as amended) place a number of requirements on all packaging placed on the market in the UK, including a requirement that packaging should be manufactured so that the packaging volume and weight are limited to the minimum adequate amount to maintain the necessary level of safety, hygiene and acceptance for the packed product and for the consumer.</p>
	<p pid="a.1342W.2/6">Although legislation is one way of reducing packaging consumers also have a part to play. For example, if consumers made a point of choosing goods that are not heavily packaged, or bought 'loose' food rather than pre-packaged, or used their own shopping bags or boxes, manufacturers would be more inclined to reduce the quantity of packaging on their products.</p>

	<p pid="a.1343W.2/1">It is Government policy to focus on reducing the environmental impacts of pesticides rather than the total amount of pesticide used. This is because impact depends on a variety of factors of which the volume used is only one. Different pesticides can be active at very different rates and replacing a pesticide used at high volume with a more active one used at lower volume would reduce the volume used but may have no environmental benefit or could even be counter-productive.</p>

	<p pid="a.1345W.2/1">The Department has not made these assessments and studies. That is because industries switching from the use of recovered fuel oil to virgin fuels will remain subject to environmental regulation under the Pollution Prevention and Control (England and Wales) Regulations 2000. It is therefore for the regulator to set emission limits and other permit conditions according to the general principles of those Regulations that installations should be operated in such a way that <i>(a)</i> all the appropriate preventative measures are taken against pollution, in particular through application of the best available techniques; and <i>(b)</i> no significant pollution is caused. Those principles apply irrespective of the type of fuel and provide a high level of protection for the environment. However, where oil is waste as defined under the EU Waste Framework Directive, the regulator is obliged to set emission limits at least as stringent as those set out in the Waste Incineration Directive.</p>

	<p pid="a.1353W.6/1">The Quartet Special Envoy for Disengagement, Mr. James Wolfensohn, has identified several key issues for Israeli disengagement from Gaza to be judged a success. While these mostly concern improved movement and access for Palestinians, the development of a credible Palestinian medium-term development plan is one of the issues where a small amount of support could have a transformative impact. At the request of the Palestinian Authority, the Department for International Development, together with the World Bank, is providing technical assistance with the preparation of such a plan. It will be important that the plan is effectively implemented and that the international community lends its full support. A key outcome from the conference held in London to promote economic growth in the West Bank and Gaza through the private sector was the Joint Declaration from Israeli and Palestinian business leaders on the steps required for promoting Palestinian economic growth and their expectations from the Palestinian Authority, Government of Israel and the international community. The Declaration (available in PN109/05 on the HM Treasury's website) includes an action plan to overcome obstacles to private sector led investment and growth with the establishment of a Private Sector Working Group. The first meeting of the Private Sector Working Group is expected to take place this month, at which the parties will agree their forward work plan. The Government will work with the World Bank to support the Group.</p>

	<p pid="a.1357W.8/1">The Home Secretary is today making a statement on the measures the Government are taking to address identity fraud.</p>
	<p pid="a.1357W.8/2">But I want to inform the House of the detailed action HMRC is taking to identify and root out identity fraud and to work with banks to address a problem HMRC investigations have identified and about which they are in discussion with banks-that is, the use of stolen identities to set up bank accounts under false pretences.</p>
	<p pid="a.1357W.8/3">As a result of investigations by HMRC and DWP, DWP was alerted to the false use of the names of a number of DWP staff in setting up bank accounts under false pretences and then making fraudulent claims. On <phrase class="date" code="2005-12-02">2 December 2005</phrase> DWP and HMRC announced that a criminal investigation had been launched. At the same time, HMRC suspended the internet service with immediate effect.</p>
	<p pid="a.1357W.8/4">Over the past six weeks DWP investigators and HMRC compliance officers have undertaken detailed inquiries. While one initial estimate was that up to 13,000 staff might have been affected by the identity theft, it is now established that some 8,800 staff identities may have been stolen in 2003&ndash;04 and that of these 6,800 have been used in an attempt to defraud the tax credits system in autumn 2005. Of the 6,800 fraudulent claims, around 4,100 were fully intercepted by HMRC before any payment, so that no payment was made. Of the remaining 2,700 claims where tax credit payments were made into multiple bank accounts using the stolen identities payments were suspended immediately they were discovered, and all payments were suspended by <phrase class="date" code="2005-12-16">16 December 2005</phrase>. Swift action addressed the risk of higher losses, limiting the loss from this fraud to an estimated &pound;2.7 million.</p>
	<p pid="a.1357W.8/5">In a statement issued alongside National Statistics published on <phrase class="date" code="2005-12-23">23 December 2005</phrase>, HMRC stated that a number of criminal investigations were under way. As a result of these investigations, which are ongoing, HMRC have uncovered evidence that banks have been the victims of multiple bank accounts opened under false pretences-using the names of individuals whose identities were stolen. With HMRC informing the banks of this fraud, the banks concerned will be addressing the issues we are raising with them.</p>
	<p pid="a.1357W.8/6">As previously announced on <phrase class="date" code="2005-12-23">23 December 2005</phrase> we are subjecting around 30,000 claims to detailed further investigation, although not all of these are likely to be fraudulent. This includes the use of staff information stolen from Network Rail and which then led to bank accounts created for Network Rail employees under false pretences. Our detailed investigations have so far resulted in at least 16,000 claims being stopped, with information being referred to the National Criminal. Intelligence Service, which will form part of the Serious Organised Crime Agency (SOCA) on <phrase class="date" code="">1 April 2006</phrase>. I will keep the House informed in a manner consistent with the ongoing criminal investigation.</p>
	<p pid="a.1357W.8/7">New measures already announced in the pre-Budget report will result in a doubling of the number of pre-payment checks carried out on new claims. In addition, I have offered the banking sector and other financial institutions the help and expertise of HMRC in detecting such identity fraud, and ensuring that sufficient checks are in place to prevent fraudsters from opening bank accounts using stolen identities. We will continue to work with them to help tackle the problem. HMRC will also, seek to contact companies or individuals where it finds evidence that they might have been targeted by such fraudsters and work with them to assist in the investigation.</p>

	<p pid="a.1362W.5/4" class="indent">The Office for National Statistics (ONS) compiles statistics for the United Kingdom of public sector employment from a quarterly survey of public sector organizations. However, estimates at local area level are not available.</p>

However, in this source, the categorization of employment in the public or private sector depends upon the responses from the individuals interviewed.

	<p pid="a.1364W.9/22" class="indent">In response to your second question, 'absenteeism' is a term that is not used by the Department for Work and Pensions or the Child Support Agency. In line with Departmental Human Resources policy the Agency treats all sickness absence as genuine since it is self-certificated for periods of up to 7 days and certificated by a doctor beyond that period.</p>
	<p pid="a.1364W.9/23" class="indent">The reduction in days lost to sickness this year has been achieved by a combination of measures. Line managers have been given training in new procedures, introduced across the Department, which aim to promote an understanding that our employees are valued, that the Department wants them to be at work and if they are absent to understand why and to assist if it can. Increased support has been provided through the services of the Occupational Health Provider and Employee Assistance Programme. In return the department expects its employees to attend regularly and a warning is given when attendance falls below the level which can be sustained by the business.</p>

	<p pid="a.1367W.5/1">The rules in the old child support scheme for determining the net income of absent parents and parents with care are contained in Regulations 7 and 8 and Schedules 1 and 2 of the Child Support (Maintenance Assessment and Special Cases) Regulations 1992 (SI 1992/1815).</p>
	<p pid="a.1367W.5/2">In the new scheme, when a maintenance calculation is first calculated, the net weekly income of a non-resident parent consists only of the types of income specified in the Schedule to the Child Support (Maintenance Calculations and Special Cases) Regulations 2000 (SI 2001/155). These are an employee's or self-employed person's earnings, tax credits and payments from occupational or personal pension schemes.</p>
	<p pid="a.1367W.5/3">However, income from capital can be taken into account as a result of Regulations 18 and 19 of the Child Support (Variations) Regulations 2000 (SI 2001/156). Under Regulation 18, where a non-resident parent has significant assets, a parent with care can apply to have them taken into account. This applies where the assets are worth more than &pound;65,000.</p>
	<p pid="a.1367W.5/4">In addition, from April 2005, Regulation 19 has been amended, so that in certain circumstances a variation can be made where a non-resident parent receives income from a business or company in a form which is normally ignored in the maintenance calculation. This applies where the non-resident parent receives such income of more than &pound;100 a week and has the ability to control their income, for example, as a company director receiving income in the form of dividends.

	<p pid="a.1370W.2/2">The joint DWP and HMRC investigation conducted into the identity theft of DWP staff details and the subsequent use of some of these details to fraudulently claim tax credit has completed its analysis of the numbers of staff affected. The initial estimate of those potentially affected was around 13,000. However, the investigation has now established that the number of stolen identities was around 8,800. All the 8,800 people concerned worked in Jobcentre Plus London region (including the linked benefit processing and contact centres) in 2003&ndash;04.</p>
	<p pid="a.1370W.2/3">All the records have been analysed and the joint DWP and HMRC investigation has now confirmed that:</p>
	<p pid="a.1370W.2/4" class="indent">around 6,800 fraudulent tax credit claims were made using the stolen data, of which:</p>
	<p pid="a.1370W.2/5" class="indent">around 4,100 were intercepted by HMRC before any payment had been made.</p>
	<p pid="a.1370W.2/6" class="indent">around 2,700 were successful and went into payment but are now stopped</p>
	<p pid="a.1370W.2/7">There is no evidence to suggest the security of DWP's IT systems has been breached. None of our customers appear to have been affected by this in any way.</p>
	<p pid="a.1370W.2/8">Our internal records are completely separate from systems used to manage customer information.</p>
	<p pid="a.1370W.2/9">The HMRC E-portal used to make fraudulent tax credit claims remains closed. A criminal investigation into the circumstances which led to this fraud was instituted as soon as the fraud was discovered and is still in progress.</p>
	<p pid="a.1370W.2/10">DWP and HMRC are working urgently to ensure the records concerned are corrected. They will ensure that staff are not disadvantaged as a result of this incident and arrangements are in place to contact individually all those affected.</p>

However, people in receipt of pension credit who live in a care home and have done so for 13 weeks or more at the end of the September qualifying week do not receive a winter fuel payment. This is because the majority receive public funding for their care costs including heating.</p>

	<p pid="a.1377W.2/1">The Fees and Charges Regulation, which came into force on <phrase class="date" code="2005-06-01">1 June 2005</phrase>, requires that applications for a number of approvals and certificates can only be made to the European Civil Aviation Agency and that only the Agency can charge for the technical investigations needed to support the grant of such applications, even when a national authority carries out the work on its behalf. In such cases, the work is set up and paid for under the terms of agency/authority contracts. The manner of implementation of these processes has affected the Agency's ability to undertake their certification tasks in a timely and efficient way. There has also been some knock-on effect on other Agency activities as staff have been allocated to help deal with the demands of the fees and charges system.</p>
	<p pid="a.1377W.2/2">The Secretary of State has not received any specific representations from UK industry on the impact of the Agency's Fees and Charges Regulation. But UK industry ahs alerted the Department for Transport to the adverse impact of this Regulation at regular consultation meetings. The Department has asked the Civil Aviation Authority to monitor and report on problems that industry has drawn to its attention.</p>
	<p pid="a.1377W.2/3">UK companies have also reported difficulties in getting applications handled in a timely fashion and this has impacted adversely on their work including delays to several aviation projects. The Department, in conjunction with the Civil Aviation Authority, is working energetically on these problems with the Agency, the European Commission and other member states so as to ensure that the situation improves.</p>

	<p pid="a.1378W.0/1">The financial and budgetary requirements governing the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) follow general Community principles as applied to Community Agencies. EASA's requirements are set down in Regulation (EC) No. 1592/2002 as subsequently amended by Regulation (EC) No. 1643/2003.</p>
	<p pid="a.1378W.0/2">The Regulation provides that Agency revenues will comprise a contribution from Community funds, fees paid by certificate applicants and holders and charges for publications, training and any other services provided by the Agency. In principle the fees revenue should cover the full costs of delivering EASA's certification functions. However, the Regulation provided that until <phrase class="date" code="">31 December 2006</phrase> the contribution from Community funds might be used to cover expenditure related to the initial running phase of the Agency, including some of the cost of the Agency's certification functions.</p>
	<p pid="a.1378W.0/3">The Agency presented to its management board on <phrase class="date" code="">13 December 2006</phrase> its assessment of whether income generated by the Fees and Charges Regulation, together with the transitional use of some of the agreed contribution from Community funds, would cover the cost of delivering the Agency's certification functions during 2006. The Agency concluded that its estimated income would fail to cover costs unless remedial measures were put in place. The Agency proposed cutting back and prioritising its certification tasks in line with the estimated income. The UK Civil Aviation Authority prepared for the UK member of the management board a detailed analysis of the Agency's assessment and proposals which agreed that the estimated income would not cover all the certification tasks which the Agency should carry out in 2006. The Authority advised that cutting back the certification tasks would cause major problems for industry and be unacceptable.</p>
	<p pid="a.1378W.0/4">The management board agreed that the Agency should not prioritise its certification tasks despite the anticipated shortfall in income. The consequences of this decision on the Agency's budget will be revisited at the next meeting of the board in March in the light of urgent work commissioned by the Board. Consultants have been contracted to analyse the financial situation of the Agency and to report in time for the March meeting. In the meantime the Agency is continuing its own review of options to improve the situation, including possible amendments to the Fees and Charges Regulation.</p>
	<p pid="a.1378W.0/5">The management board's review of the 2006 budget reflects requirements placed on the Board in the Regulation (EC) 1592/2002 as amended. The budget is adopted by the Board following final adoption of the general budget of the European Union. This is a process which involves additional examination and review of the budget by the Community institutions.</p>

	<p pid="a.1379W.2/1">The European Aviation Safety Agency (the Agency) publishes on its website a list of the titles and reference numbers of the airworthiness directives that it has approved since it came into being on <phrase class="date" code="2003-09-29">29 September 2003</phrase>. To identify airworthiness directives for European products issued prior to that date industry must continue to refer to information published by the National Aviation Authorities of the EU member states, as the Agency has not yet gathered and collated that information.</p>
	<p pid="a.1379W.2/2">The Agency does not yet have an airworthiness directive distribution service to make available the detailed content of its airworthiness directives. The full texts of a small minority of its airworthiness directives can be accessed through the Agency's website but, in general, the industry must rely upon the airworthiness directive publication services of the National Aviation Authorities of the EU member states to obtain such directives. The UK CAA is continuing to maintain and update its own publication services and will continue to do so until such time as the Agency has put in place a comprehensive and effective system.</p>

	<p pid="a.1379W.5/1">The Regulation establishing the European Aviation Safety Agency came into force in September 2002 and the Agency assumed responsibility for its tasks 12 months thereafter. At that time the Agency relied almost entirely on the Commission and the aviation authorities of member states for the resources and data it needed to execute those responsibilities. Initially, the national aviation authorities carried out all the Agency's certification tasks on its behalf.</p>
	<p pid="a.1379W.5/2">The Agency has been steadily recruiting the staff and building up the infrastructure it needs to perform its tasks in-house, however it is still reliant on national aviation authority support, delivered under contract. The Agency is recruiting staff mainly from the Commission, industry and national authorities; this pool of European technical experts must also serve the continuing needs of the national authorities and the aviation community more widely. It is a major challenge for everyone concerned to ensure that neither the Agency nor the national authorities run short of skilled manpower during this period of transition.</p>
	<p pid="a.1379W.5/3">The Agency's manpower plans and their effect on national authorities is being monitored by the Management Board. The Board has established a small group of high-level technical experts from national administrations, plus representatives of the Agency and the Commission, to examine rigorously whether the Agency's strategies are successfully ensuring the necessary qualified staff and to monitor the associated risks. As a result the Agency has established a risk register which it is required to present at each meeting of the management Board.</p>
	<p pid="a.1379W.5/4">The working group has stressed the importance of the Agency and the national aviation authorities working together to plan and manage technical resources, recommending that the Agency hold detailed discussions with each authority. Such discussions should be comprehensive and broader than the formal contractual arrangements under which the authorities currently carry out certification tasks for the Agency.</p>

Decisions on which services to support are a matter for each authority. The Department does not collect information on the particular towns served as a result of these decisions. However, monitoring returns for 2003&ndash;04 show that in that year RBSG was used to support a total of about 2,200 services on which over 29 million passenger journeys were made (data for 2004&ndash;05 is currently being collected).</p>

Section 153 sets out the principles to be applied by licensing authorities in considering premises licence applications. That section requires licensing authorities to aim to permit the use of premises for gambling in so far as they think that accords with any relevant Commission code of practice or guidance and with their own policy statement, and in so far as they think that to do so would be reasonably consistent with the licensing objectives of the Act.</p>

These groups are not formal Council working groups, are voluntary and assist the Commission to develop initiatives. Experts in this context may be expert officials from the particular government department or non-governmental experts appointed by Ministries or the Commission, depending on the remit of the group.</p>
	<p pid="a.1399W.2/3">There is also an Advisory Committee on Vocational Training, attended by officials, which has a statutory basis: to advise the European Commission on any initiatives it takes in the field of vocational education and training.

	<p pid="a.1409W.5/1">The Department has not received any formal representations on the effectiveness of personal dental services (PDS) agreements. The evidence of pilot PDS agreements, now covering 35 per cent. of dentists, is that when a dentist's national health service earnings are no longer directly related to individual treatments, he or she are able to plan to plan simpler and more appropriate courses of treatment. This frees up time and capacity that can be used to spend more time with patients, adopt a more preventive approach to dentistry, and improve management of workload.</p>
	<p pid="a.1409W.5/2">Assessing cost-effectiveness depends on what criteria are used to measure outputs or outcomes. Any assessment based on measuring individual items of treatment would not take into account the benefits for patients of simpler and more appropriate courses of treatment and a greater focus on oral health promotion. In the future, the cost effectiveness of contracts could be assessed by comparing expenditure with courses of treatment, numbers of patients accessing services and improvements in oral health.</p>

	<p pid="a.1410W.2/1">We do not have such a policy. At our request, the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence issued a guideline, in 2004, on the most appropriate clinical treatment for people with fertility problems. That guideline did not refer to restricting in vitro fertilization treatment to women aged 30 and over. The primary responsibility for the provision of infertility services rests with the national health service at local level. We are discussing with Infertility Network UK, the leading voluntary organisation representing the interests of fertility patients, ways in which they can work with primary care trusts to help ensure that the patient's voice is heard when decisions about the provision of services are made at local level.</p>

	<p pid="a.1411W.8/1">Data on smoking for those aged 16 and over are available from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) general household surveys (GHS). Questions on smoking have been included in the GHS biannually since 1974 and annually since 2000 in order to monitor trends in patterns of consumption.</p>
	<p pid="a.1411W.8/2">The weighting of data was introduced on the GHS in 2000. The general household survey 2000 specifies that the introduction of weighted data uses a two-step approach: &quot;The data is weighted to compensate for non-response in the survey (sample-based weighting). The second step weights the sample distribution so that it matches the population in terms of region, age group and sex (population-based weighting)&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1411W.8/3">The general household survey 2000 report presents weighted and unweighted data for 1998 to give an indication of the effect of weighting. Consequently, from 1998 there is discontinuity in the time trend with previous years.</p>
	<p pid="a.1411W.8/4">The ONS general household survey 2004 specifies that &quot;the effect of weighting on the smoking data is slight, increasing the overall prevalence of cigarette smoking by one percentage point each year&quot;.</p>

The following table gives the number of deaths registered in Northern Ireland in the two-year period 2003&ndash;04, where MRSA was mentioned on the death certificate, by place of death and pensionable age.

	<p pid="a.1425W.11/2">The recently launched Respect action plan outlines our commitment to invest up to &pound;52 million over the next two years to enable a change in the way public services offer support to parents and families. This investment will facilitate delivery of evidence based good quality parenting programmes in main stream settings such as children's centres and extended schools. As part of the action plan over the next three years a further &pound;45 million will be made available to the Youth Justice Board to fund early intervention preventative programmes including new resources for parenting interventions.</p>
	<p pid="a.1425W.11/3">In addition over &pound;28 million will be available in 2006 for the support of parents, carers and their families. This money which will be allocated to the voluntary and community sector through five grant programmes. These will contribute to our continued investment in the direct delivery of parenting programmes, research, evaluation, consultation and training of parenting support practitioners.</p>

The Recovered Assets Incentive Fund was set up in 2003&ndash;04 with &pound;15.5 million a year for three years to incentivise asset recovery agencies. From the Fund, the West Midlands Regional Asset Recovery Team, which covers Staffordshire, was allocated &pound;4.4 million over three years to disrupt criminal groups, confiscate more criminal assets and to tackle money laundering.</p>

However, we do not believe that such licensing is a realistic solution to the problems of opium cultivation in Afghanistan, not least because it risks a high level of diversion of licit opium into illegal channels. It is clear from the feasibility study, as well as expert opinion, that Afghanistan currently does not meet the prerequisites necessary to control licit cultivation. There is also a risk that prices would rise, attracting new entrants into the illicit market.</p>
	<p pid="a.1428W.12/2">The production of opium is also contrary to the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan. The Afghan Government has expressed its opposition to licit cultivation in Afghanistan. When the Senlis Council presented its study in Afghanistan in September 2005, the Afghan Minister for Counter Narcotics, Habibullah Qaderi, said,</p>
	<p pid="a.1428W.12/3" class="indent">&quot;The poor security situation in the country means there can simply be no guarantee that opium will not be smuggled out of the country for the illicit narcotics trade abroad. Without an effective control mechanism, a lot of opium will still be refined into heroin for illicit markets in the West and elsewhere. We could not accept this.&quot;</p>

The UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) will provide an early indication of this season's (2005&ndash;06) production figures in their Rapid Assessment Survey, which is due to be published in the next couple of weeks. In November 2005, the UNODC confirmed the poppy cultivation and production figures for the 2004&ndash;05 season from their annual survey. They estimated that opium production was around 4,100 metric tonnes, a decrease of only 100 tonnes (2.4 per cent.) compared to 2004, despite a significant 21 per cent. reduction in poppy cultivation from 131,000 hectares (ha) in 2003&ndash;04 to 104,000 ha in 2004&ndash;05. Good weather and an absence of crop disease were responsible for a significant increase in yield in 2004&ndash;05.</p>

	<p pid="a.1432W.6/1">The UN Mission in Ethiopia and Eritrea (UNMEE) provides a vital stabilising factor in the border dispute between the two countries. The restrictions placed on UNMEE by Eritrea are wholly unacceptable. We have worked with United Nations Security Council partners to press Eritrea to reverse these restrictions. In particular, we supported the adoption of Security Council resolution 1640 (2005) demanding that all restrictions be lifted and that both Eritrea and Ethiopia take action to reduce tension by returning troops to previous positions. The resolution repeated the Security Council's call on both parties to ensure the implementation of the decision of the Ethiopia/Eritrea Boundary Commission. Most recently, the Security Council met on <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-09">9 January</phrase> to review compliance with UNSCR 1640 and UNMEE's continued ability to operate. The Council has agreed that UNMEE should retain its present functions and configuration while concerted efforts are made to address the wider border dispute. We are working closely with the United States and other interested parties to engage Eritrea and Ethiopia in these efforts. We continue to keep the situation under close review.</p>

Any document which the Secretariat produces in respect of this Recommendation will have to be considered by the next meeting of the IWC.

	<p pid="a.1437W.0/1">We welcome the progress that the Government of Kazakhstan has made on human rights and democratic reform since independence. This includes a moratorium on the death penalty, progress on prison reform including reduction of the number of persons in detention and the introduction of public monitoring of places of detention, and, most recently in December 2005, ratification of the UN International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR).</p>
	<p pid="a.1437W.0/2">But there is still some way to go. Political pluralism has been affected negatively by legislation, which restricts freedom of expression, association and assembly. The powers of the Parliament and Government and the independence of the judiciary could be further enhanced to introduce checks and balances into the system of administration. In December 2005, the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe's Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights International Observation Mission noted that despite some administrative improvements, the presidential elections did not meet international standards.</p>
	<p pid="a.1437W.0/3">Wherever possible we look to work with the Kazakh authorities to improve the human rights situation. We have funded projects aimed at improving the conditions in prisons, preventing torture in places of detention and encouraging the abolition of the death penalty. We have an on-going dialogue with the Government of Kazakhstan on transparency issues and are working closely with non-governmental organisations on this too. We also stand ready to work with President Nazarbayev on his programme of democratic reforms.</p>
	<p pid="a.1437W.0/4">When he met Foreign Minister Tokayev following the presentation of his credentials on <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-09">9 January</phrase>, our newly accredited ambassador to Kazakhstan, Paul Brummell, assured the Foreign Minister of the readiness of the British Government to work with Kazakhstan across this agenda.</p>
	<p pid="a.1437W.0/5">We will continue to raise, both bilaterally and with our EU partners, the importance of respect for human rights and good governance in Kazakhstan and look for opportunities to provide suitable assistance.</p>
