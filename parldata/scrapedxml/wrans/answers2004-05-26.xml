Work is progressing during 2004 to identify and agree among contracting parties to OSPAR appropriate management measures (which may include marine protected areas) for a selection of the habitats and species on this list.</p>

	<p pid=".1622W.0/1">The question of what to do about a wildlife reservoir of bovine tuberculosis is a complex one. The Government are determined to base its future TB policy on sound scientific evidence. The Randomised Badger Culling Trial (RBCT), due to be completed in 2006, should help decide whether culling badgers can form part of a cost-effective, sustainable and practical TB control policy.</p>
	<p pid=".1622W.0/2">On 9 February, Defra launched a consultation on the key principles on which a new long-term strategy for tackling bovine TB will be developed. This consultation asks questions on a wide-range of issues, including how the Government can establish targets, balance costs, benefits and risks, work in partnership with all the key interest groups and how policy can be developed in the light of emerging scientific evidence. That will include evidence from the ongoing RBCT and elsewhere (including the Four Areas badger culling trial in the Republic of Ireland, when published).</p>
	<p pid=".1622W.0/3">On 6 April, Defra announced the publication of a report from an independent scientific panel chaired by Professor Charles Godfray FRS. The report reviewed the progress of the RBCT and associated Defra research, as part of a wider review of Defra's science. The Government are giving careful consideration to the complex recommendations of the report, and the review's conclusions will inform Defra's wider review of TB strategy. Defra has extended the deadline for the public consultation on the TB Strategy review until 4 June, to allow sufficient time for this report to be assimilated and commented on.</p>

	<p pid=".1622W.3/1">The Government want to see sustainable development become a mainstream issue for local authorities, their partners, and local communities. We believe that the most effective way to achieve this is to build upon the experience of partnership working and community engagement gained through Local Agenda 21 (LA21) and subsume LA21 strategies within statutory community strategies. These are required, by law, to promote sustainable development. Many councils have already done this, and we encourage others to follow suit. It is for authorities to decide whether to have additional plans or a dedicated partnership to support the delivery of sustainable outcomes, but we would expect them to ensure these are in place if LA21 is to end.</p>

	<p pid=".1623W.8/2">The UK has had initial discussions on future action with a number of developing countries, both at official and ministerial level. For any future climate regime to be effective, it must be as inclusive as possible, and must certainly cover the main developing countries. We are committed to ensuring that developing countries are included in the early stages of the discussions on future action, not only to ensure that the outcome is acceptable to the largest emitting developing countries and we achieve as near universal acceptance as possible, but also to ensure that equity concerns are addressed.</p>
	<p pid=".1623W.8/3">We will continue to engage with developing countries at all levels, both through the formal channels that exist in the UNFCCC and through informal channels. We are currently considering how to build on this dialogue and stimulate further discussion.</p>

The Department took these concerns seriously and decided to commission an independent audit of this phase of the study. On the recommendation of the Association of British Neurologists, Professor Kerry Mills from King's College Hospital London, was asked to carry out the audit. Professor Mills' prior commitments and correspondence between the physicians involved, resulted in the audit being started on 19 April this year. This process may take six months to complete.</p>

All train operators either have a revised DPPP approved by the SRA or are seeking such approval. Twenty Train Operating Company Disabled People's Protection Policies have been approved to date. Each revised DPPP places an obligation on the operator to provide a 'reasonable alternative means' of making a journey accessible to disabled passengers where physical barriers preclude them from doing so.</p>

	<p pid=".1634W.9/1">Throughout 2003, once it was clear that there was a possibility of UK troops becoming involved in Iraq, there were regular and co-operative discussions between Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) Ministers and officials and the ICRC on Iraq.</p>
	<p pid=".1634W.9/2">During these meetings, the ICRC briefed on the general humanitarian situation in Iraq and reminded us of our international humanitarian law obligations concerning detainees. Our records do not indicate that any specific oral or written concerns about coalition forces were passed to the FCO in 2003. As is standard practice, they would have been passed in the first instance to the authorities directly responsible for the treatment of detainees. I have no reason to doubt that the UK military authorities responsible for detainees in Iraq took appropriate action in response to any ICRC concerns. As my hon. Friend the Minister of State for the Armed Forces (Mr. Ingram) made clear in the House on 13 May, HMG co-operates fully with the ICRC. It is offered full access to the detention facilities that we operate and each concern that it brings to our attention is treated very seriously and investigated fully.</p>

	<p pid=".1639W.9/1">We share Amnesty International's concerns about deteriorating housing conditions in the Occupied Territories and the wider human rights and humanitarian consequences of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. In a press statement on 17 May I expressed my concern at the demolition of Palestinian homes in Rafah. These actions are contrary to Israel's commitments under the roadmap and are unacceptable. And on 19 May, I expressed my profound concern about the deaths of Palestinian civilians demonstrating against house demolitions. Copies of both my statements are available on the Foreign and Commonwealth Office website: <a href="http://www.fco.gov.uk/policy/news/press-releases">www.fco.gov.uk/policy/news/press-releases</a>. Demolitions are provocative, exacerbate tension and undermine ongoing efforts to bring about an end to violence and a return to negotiations. Israel must act within international law and refrain from using excessive force and taking actions which amount to collective punishment. The UK voted for UNSCR 1544 which condemned Israel's actions on 19 May 2004.</p>

	<p pid=".1646W.8/1">The new HPSS pay system, Agenda for Change, has been designed around jobs within the NHS across the UK, and when implemented it will only directly be applied to jobs that are within the range of NHS organisations. It is acknowledged however, that any amendment to the terms and conditions of employment of HPSS personnel could have implications for the terms and conditions of staff employed within the private or voluntary health sector.</p>
	<p pid=".1646W.8/2">While the setting of pay rates and defining of terms and conditions for such employees is a matter for the individual independent employers concerned, my Department recognises the financial pressures facing independent sector nursing and residential homes and has made provision for above inflation increases in the regional tariffs over the past three years. This has meant for example an increase of almost 20 per cent. in the weekly fee paid by Trusts for a nursing home place for an elderly person since 2001&ndash;02.</p>
	<p pid=".1646W.8/3">The Department has also commissioned PricewaterhouseCoopers to undertake research into the specific costs of providing nursing, residential home and domiciliary care in Northern Ireland. The consultants are expected to present their final report in June 2004, in time for the research to inform budget decisions from April 2005</p>

	<p pid=".1649W.2/1">Residential homes may charge individual residents different amounts based on the type and extent of care needed and the standard of facilities and accommodation provided. For those residents who are not self-funding, Health and Social Services Trusts will normally pay agreed regional tariffs for the appropriate standard placement for each class of resident. In recognition of the increased pressures faced by the independent care home sector, the Department has made significant additional resources available to provide for increases above inflation. Above inflation increases have been made in each year since 2001&ndash;02 and the additional money this year has enabled Health and Social Services Trusts to increase rates paid for an elderly residential home place from &pound;230 in 2001&ndash;02 to &pound;273 in 2004&ndash;05, an increase of around 16 per cent.</p>

	<p pid=".1649W.5/1">I have not made an estimate of this kind. The forthcoming Special Educational Needs and Disability Order aims to strengthen the right of children with special educational needs to be educated in mainstream schools. Any costs arising from this will be dependent on the nature and extent of the exercise of this right over time, and will depend on the needs of the individual child. Educational provision will continue to be tailored to meet these needs, whether in mainstream schools, special units attached to mainstream schools, or special schools. I anticipate that special schools will continue to play a vital role in supporting pupils with significant and complex needs, in accordance with parental wishes and professional advice, and that they are likely to develop their role further in the future in the provision of specialist advice and support to mainstream schools.</p>

	<p pid=".1658W.2/2">The information is not centrally available in the form requested. The cost of early retirement on ill-health grounds is mitigated to an extent by the fact that the retired officer will normally be replaced, either directly or indirectly, by a recruit on a lower salary who can perform all the ordinary duties of a member of the force. A broad indicator of the cost to forces in any year is the aggregate of the cash lump sums they pay to officers retiring on ill health grounds. Based on the estimated number of ill-health retirements for 2003&ndash;04 published by the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy the Government Actuary's Department estimate that the total cost of ill-health pension lump sums in England and Wales is about &pound;50 million.</p>

	<p pid=".1658W.5/1">We do not think it right to do so, thus making more widely available details of the methods of conversion identified so far. The Forensic Science Service identified a number of different ways in which such revolvers and pistols were used with ammunition other than air cartridges. These varied considerably in their effectiveness and ease of conversion and with one exception were not specific to one particular model. Having discussed the problem with the manufacturers of the air cartridge system and an independent engineer it was concluded that the main problem was with the air cartridge system itself which could not be modified to remove the danger.</p>

	<p pid=".1669W.11/1">A food security assessment conducted by the Food and Agriculture Organisation and World Food Programme during 2003 found that approximately 41 per cent. of the population of the Gaza Strip are &quot;food insecure&quot;, with a further 28 per cent. at risk of becoming so. Another nutritional assessment done in 2002 by Johns Hopkins and Al-Quds Universities looked at children six to 59 months, and found that in the Gaza Strip, 13.3 per cent. had acute malnutrition (wasting), and 17.5 per cent. had chronic malnutrition (stunting). The United Nations Relief and Works Agency provides emergency food aid to an estimated 128,000 families.</p>
	<p pid=".1669W.11/2">Palestinians have very low water consumption. Per capita Palestinian water consumption in Gaza is 88 litres/day, compared with a World Health Organisation recommended basic minimum for developing countries of 100 litres/day. The United States Aid to International Development (USAID) is leading a major programme of activities to increase the quantities of water available for water supply in Gaza. This includes protection and management of the coastal aquifer, which is the only local source of freshwater in Gaza. USAID has also agreed to fund the construction of a desalination plant that will purify up to 20 million cubic metres of sea water each year, equivalent to nearly 40 per cent. of Gaza's current municipal consumption. A main water pipeline the length of Gaza will also be constructed to distribute high-quality water throughout the Gaza Strip.</p>

	<p pid=".1671W.6/56">1. Impact of Emissions Trading Scheme is on gas costs as users of gas will need to hold emission allowances.

	<p pid=".1676W.2/1">My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State is aware of the concerns of independent and small format retailers about consolidation in the convenience sector. However, the independent competition authorities are responsible under the Enterprise Act 2002 for decision-making in merger cases against an explicit competition test, and parties with concerns about the effects of mergers in this sector are encouraged to contact the Office of Fair Trading to put forward their views. Ministers have no role in this process, and my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has not, therefore, met with those in the convenience sector to discuss any concerns.</p>

	<p pid=".1678W.5/1">Royal Mail is fully aware of the importance of ensuring that it provides a reliable service during the pilot postal elections in June. This could affect just over 14 million people and DTI Ministers have received assurances from Allan Leighton that Royal Mail will be giving the handling of the ballot papers the highest priority.</p>
	<p pid=".1678W.5/2">The Department of Constitutional Affairs, which is overseeing the elections, has had several meeting with Royal Mail to discuss the development of national and detailed local plans for the all-postal pilot elections. It has ensured that there are robust plans in place for the delivery and return of electoral mail in June.</p>

	<p pid=".1684W.2/2">In relation to transmission losses, these will affect all forms of electricity generation in a similar manner related to the distance transferred, type of power cable transferred through etc. Overall losses in the England and Wales transmission system are approximately 1.5 per cent. but no estimate has been made of what proportion of this energy loss is attributable to wind energy.</p>

	<p pid=".1684W.5/2">Large-scale blackouts are very rare events in the UK. For example, in England and Wales, the amount of energy not supplied by NGT due to transmission failures over the last 12 years is an extremely small proportion to total system throughput, averaging less than 0.0001 per cent. This compares very favourably with other transmission network operators.</p>
	<p pid=".1684W.5/3">The Government are working closely with the electricity industry to ensure that all necessary reinforcements required by the integration of renewable generation will be completed expeditiously. In addition, the industry is working to ensure that wind and other renewable generation connection to the system in future will have the characteristics necessary to maintain the integrity of the electricity networks. The Government in conjunction with the electricity industry, are also exploring possible means of further mitigating the effects of intermittency and unpredictability, for example by the application of additional electricity storage. DTI and Ofgem will continue to monitor electricity security issues through the Joint Electricity Security of Supply working group.</p>

	<p pid=".1689W.5/2">It is not possible to calculate what the change in income to higher education institutions would be if EU students ceased to be treated in the same way as UK students for fees and funding purposes. This is because the change in income will depend on the courses that these students are following and institutions' decisions about the fee levels for those courses. Fees for non-EU overseas students are not regulated and institutions determine the amount they charge depending, for example, on the costs of the course offered. The Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) provides funding for EU students but not for non-EU overseas students. The amount paid by HEFCE will also depend on the type of course the student is taking. Information for each HE institution showing student numbers and fee income received is published by the Higher Education Statistics Agency (HESA) in &quot;Students in Higher Education Institutions and Resources of Higher Education Institutions&quot; respectively, copies of which are available from the House Library.</p>

	<p pid=".1696W.14/1">I am aware of a number of organisations who have published their estimates of the numbers of Iraqi civilians killed since coalition operations began.</p>
	<p pid=".1696W.14/2">There is no reliable means of accurately ascertaining numbers of civilian fatalities. It is not always possible to confirm whether fatalities have occurred, as Iraqi injured or dead are sometimes removed from the scene of incidents by their compatriots. The Coalition always takes great care to minimise the risks to civilians. However, I cannot comment in detail as Fallujah is in the United States' area of operations.</p>

It has been agreed that a further period of up to 120 days will be allowed to enable the contract discussions to reach conclusion. We are hopeful of agreement within that period, and that if reached quickly, it shall not have an impact on the opening date of the treatment centre at Ashford, which is still expected to open by April 2005.</p>

	<p pid=".1699W.2/1">The Government's policy is to foster scientific innovation and strengthen the evidence base for modern health care in partnership with universities, charities and industry. High quality clinical trials are an important means of testing pharmaceutical and other innovations. Through the new clinical research collaboration announced by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Health in March, the Government aim to increase opportunities for people to take part in clinical research. There is now a legal framework across the European Union to ensure that clinical trials with medicines are conducted to internationally agreed principles and standards of safety.</p>
	<p pid=".1699W.2/2">The randomised controlled trial is one of a range of research techniques that generate benefits for patients and users of health and social care. As a research funder the Department takes independent expert advice on the design and methods that are most appropriate for a particular question. Accordingly, research supported by the Department has covered the full range of qualitative and quantitative, randomised and non-randomised research methodologies.</p>
	<p pid=".1699W.2/3">The national health service research and development methodology programme promotes the identification, development and use of appropriate research methods so that health and social care can be built on the best possible evidence base. Publications from this programme have included reports on the following areas of particular relevance to the question:</p>
	<p pid=".1699W.2/4" class="indent">Evaluating non-randomised intervention studies (2003).</p>

	<p pid=".1699W.2/6" class="indent">Using routine data to complement and enhance the results of randomised controlled trials (2000).</p>

	<p pid=".1702W.5/18">1. Time waited statistics from hospital episode statistics (HES) are not the same as the published waiting list statistics. HES provides counts and time waited for all patients admitted to hospital within a given period whereas the published waiting list statistics count those waiting for treatment on a specific date and how long they have been on the waiting list. Also, HES calculates the time waited as the difference between the admission and decision to admit dates. Unlike published waiting list statistics, this is not adjusted for self-deferrals or periods of medical/social suspension.</p>
	<p pid=".1702W.5/19">2. The main operation is the first recorded operation in the HES data set and is usually the most resource intensive procedure performed during the episode. It is appropriate to use main operation when looking at admission details e.g. time waited, but the figures for &quot;all operations count of episodes&quot; give a more complete count of episodes with an operation.</p>

HES provides counts and time waited for all patients admitted to hospital within a given period, whereas the published waiting list statistics count those waiting for treatment on a specific date and how long they have been on the waiting list. Also, HES calculates the time waited as the difference between the admission and decision to admit dates. Unlike published waiting list statistics, this is not adjusted for self-deferrals or periods of medical/social suspension.</p>

	<p pid=".1705W.5/1">The concept of national health service national care records service and the national programme is to provide integrated clinical information systems across the whole care continuum. Support for delivery of care by general practitioners and other primary care practitioners is an integral part of the programme.</p>
	<p pid=".1705W.5/2">There are some specific systems relevant to GP practices and the general medical services payments project. They cover payments for practices and primary care information management systems and are currently being tested for conformance to standards and operation with existing GP systems.

Phase two covers implementation by 2008, to include a richer NHS care record service, with core data and reference links to local electronic patient record systems for full record access.</p>
	<p pid=".1705W.5/4">An additional third phase is planned for implementation between 2008 and 2010 to provide ambulance telemonitoring implemented in all emergency response vehicles, home telemonitoring in all homes requiring it, and a unified health record that includes all appropriate social care information.</p>

Customs deploy their resources on the basis of risk assessment driven by intelligence, which maximises their impact in enforcing a range of prohibitions and restrictions, including those relating to firearms. They respond to all specific intelligence on firearms. Strategic threat assessments produced by NCIS and Customs will inform future action. Meanwhile Customs are working with NCIS and other partners in the ACPO Strategic Criminal Use of Firearms Group to improve intelligence gathering and assessment and to contribute to activity under the joint action plan.</p>

	<p pid=".1711W.11/1">Like any other business, private museums can recover VAT incurred on buying goods and services providing those purchases relate to their taxable business activities. This would be the case where a museum is providing museum entry where admission charges are taxable at the standard rate of VAT.</p>
	<p pid=".1711W.11/2">Under the normal VAT rules provided for in the European Sixth VAT Directive, VAT incurred on goods and services relating to non-business activities, such as providing free entry to museums, cannot be recovered. This is also the case where VAT is incurred on exempt business activities, such as providing museum entry where no VAT is applied to admission charges under the VAT exemption for cultural bodies. The source of such an organisation's funding cannot be used to determine its VAT position.</p>
	<p pid=".1711W.11/3">However, since September 2001, the Government have provided a refund scheme that allows the main national museums and galleries which do not charge for admission to recover VAT they incur on related purchases. This scheme removes the obstacle VAT was creating to the delivery of our 1997 manifesto commitment that there should be free access to the main national museums and galleries.</p>
	<p pid=".1711W.11/4">That commitment has been an outstanding success. In this year's Budget, the Chancellor announced that, building on that success and on the recommendation of the Goodison Review, we are considering in the context of the forthcoming Spending Review extending the free access commitment for the main national museums and galleries, and the VAT refund scheme that has helped to deliver it, to university museums.</p>
	<p pid=".1711W.11/5">For bodies in receipt of National Lottery funding, irrecoverable VAT can be included as eligible project expenditure for lottery support. By funding this cost, the Heritage Lottery Fund's grant assessment process ensures that lottery-funded projects are not disadvantaged if they incur VAT on their expenditure. Any VAT recovered under a refund scheme should, therefore, be excluded from any grant awarded by the Heritage Lottery Fund.</p>

	<p pid=".1712W.8/2">Minutes of the ministerial meeting constitute internal discussion and advice and are therefore not published: Exemption 2 of the Open Government Code applies. However, the conclusions of these meetings will be reflected in the Government's science and innovation investment framework document, which will be published alongside the Spending Review this summer.</p>

We estimate that there are approximately 100,000 people in Great Britain paid via late payment runs (0.8 per cent. of all payments). However, since late payment runs are mainly in respect of non-system cases whose claim had not been received by Qualifying Week, they are heavily skewed towards men aged 60.</p>
