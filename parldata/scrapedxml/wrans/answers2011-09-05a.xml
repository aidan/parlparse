	<p pid="a.1W.6/4">There is no requirement for any MP to use his or her personal resources to pay for costs allowable under the MPs' Expenses Scheme. We have introduced several mechanisms to ease any potential cashflow problems for MPs including:</p>
	<p pid="a.1W.6/5">an interest-free loan of up to &#163;4,000;</p>
	<p pid="a.1W.6/6">the use of a payment card for a number of types of expenses; and</p>
	<p pid="a.1W.6/7">payment on invoice and direct payments for rent and pooled research services.</p>
	<p pid="a.1W.6/8">Where an MP necessarily incurs a cost related to their parliamentary functions which is not covered by the MPs' Expenses Scheme, they may also apply to the contingency fund.</p>
	<p pid="a.1W.6/9">We estimate that 71% of costs by volume may now be paid direct.</p>
	<p pid="a.1W.6/10">MPs may make representations about other costs not covered by the Expenses Scheme and we will consider such representations as part of the next Annual Review of the Scheme.</p>

	<p pid="a.13W.0/20">The hon. Member will note that the estimated running cost for the London control centre over the next 12 months is reduced compared to the current monthly cost given in the answer to the hon. Member for Hayes and Harlington. This is because the London Fire Brigade expects to move into the building at the end of this year and will take over the running costs except for the rent during this period. The Department has also taken steps to reduce facilities management costs by 25 per cent through renegotiating the contract and utilities costs by 35 per cent through reduced usage in all the buildings.</p>
	<p pid="a.13W.0/21">Our aim is to achieve the best possible value for money for the taxpayer from these buildings. Our preference is for fire and rescue services to use the centres, as they are highly resilient and built for this purpose. We have already reached agreement with the London Fire and Emergency Planning Authority to take over the control centre in Merton. The London Fire Brigade intends to move in later this year and will take over the running costs at that point. Those fire and rescue services hoping to move into the buildings are not expected to begin contributing to the rent during the period in question. Where we cannot reach agreement for fire and rescue services to move in, we are actively seeking suitable tenants for them. This will further reduce costs.</p>

	<p pid="a.35W.2/1">The aim of Department for International Development (DFID) funded systematic reviews is to identify the effectiveness of key policy interventions of interest to DFID. Systematic reviews enable evidence to be neutrally mapped out, quality assured and synthesised, in order to inform policy and practice decisions, and increase value for money by basing decisions on a rigorous understanding of what works.</p>
	<p pid="a.35W.2/2">By the end of March 2011, the 10 systematic reviews had been completed and were available on the Department for International Development's Research for Development website at a cost of &#163;329,849. The groups that carried out the reviews were supported and peer reviewed by the International Initiative for Impact Evaluation and the Evidence for Policy and Practice Information and Co-ordinating Centre.</p>

	<p pid="a.36W.11/2">Britain also supports the Africa Enterprise Challenge Fund (AECF) which was established in 2008 and has already supported a million farmers through the provision of grants or interest free loans to commercial enterprises to innovate and find profitable ways of improving market access for small farmers. In south Sudan, AECF has supported SAB Miller to work with small-holder farmers to grow cassava for beer production. This will improve market opportunities for around 2,000 farmers and create much needed employment in Africa's newest country. In Zimbabwe, AECF support is expected to create around 1,400 agriculture-related jobs by 2015.</p>

	<p pid="a.40W.2/1">Control policies for dealing with exotic disease are developed and reviewed in close partnership with delivery agents, core groups of stakeholders and specialists. This ensures they are proportionate and evidence based within the framework of European and national law. Our contingency plans for dealing with outbreaks, if they occur, are regularly reviewed. Plans are regularly tested at local and national level, working closely with delivery partners and industry. We closely monitor outbreaks of high impact disease around the world and assess the risk to the UK. All of these measures rely very much on vigilance by farmers and animal keepers in identifying and reporting possible disease. Monitoring animals for signs of disease and following good biosecurity and hygiene practices are essential ways of reducing risk of disease in the first place and then preventing spread.

	<p pid="a.42W.6/1">The average effects seen during and post culling in the Randomised Badger Culling Trial (RBCT) can be used to estimate the average net effect of culling over different sized areas over a nine year period (average five years' culling and four year post cull period). For example, the estimated average net benefit of culling over an area of 150 km<sup>(2)</sup> and the surrounding 2 km ring is a 16.0% reduction in confirmed TB incidence (95% confidence interval: 7.9% reduction to 24.2% reduction), equating to the prevention of 47 cattle herd breakdowns. What is seen in reality will vary greatly depending on local conditions including the size of the area, local background incidence of TB, the relative contribution that badgers make to the disease and the degree to which the culled area is surrounded by barriers or buffers to minimise the perturbation effect. Any estimates of overall beneficial effect are illustrative for a defined set of circumstances.</p>

We are proposing reductions of local badger populations in order to have a local impact in high incidence areas.

The Randomised Badger Culling Trial (RBCT) provided evidence on the humaneness of cage-trapping and shooting. No badgers were injured but not killed in this trial. Controlled shooting was not part of the RBCT, but has been effective in controlling other wild animal populations such as deer and foxes. This method has not been used to date in any trial or field test on badgers, which is why (if the Government decide to proceed with the policy following the current consultation) we intend to pilot it in two areas, to test our assumptions about its effectiveness (at removing badgers) and humaneness. These pilots would be overseen by an independent panel of scientific experts.</p>

	<p pid="a.45W.0/1">The Government's TB control programme is focused on reducing the incidence of TB in cattle (and other vulnerable livestock) across the whole of England. The proposed badger control policy aims to reduce the incidence of TB in cattle in areas with a reservoir of disease in badgers and where infection is cycling between the species. In such areas the transmission risks can be reduced by badger culling and/or badger vaccination. In areas without a reservoir of disease in badgers, the main TB risk is from cattle movements. DEFRA's recently published &#8220;TB Eradication Programme for England&#8221; outlines a comprehensive range of cattle measures to address bovine TB which remain the cornerstone of our efforts to control the disease right across the country.</p>

	<p pid="a.46W.5/1">The results of the Randomised Badger Culling Trial (RBCT) showed that incidence of TB in cattle on land immediately surrounding the culling area had a temporary increase, which then tailed off. With the latest post-trial analysis showing that 12-18 months after culling stopped the level of TB in cattle in the surrounding area was compatible with the survey-only areas. This is thought to be due to the disruption of the organisation of badger social groups, called perturbation, causing remaining badgers to range more widely. However, measures can be put in place to mitigate the negative effects seen in the surrounding area, including making use of barriers such as coastlines and major rivers, to limit badger movement. Vaccination could also be used to mitigate the negative effects of culling. Our proposal (on which we are currently consulting) therefore requires participants to take reasonable, proportionate and appropriate measures to minimise the risk of potential negative effects.</p>

	<p pid="a.47W.0/1">In the Randomised Badger Culling Trial (RBCT), an average five years of proactive culling over 100 sq km was associated with an average 23.2% decrease in confirmed TB incidence in the culled area, and an average 24.5% increase in the surrounding 2 km-wide ring of land, relative to survey-only areas.</p>
	<p pid="a.47W.0/2">As the size of a culled area increases, the relative impact of any detrimental effects in the surrounding ring diminishes compared to the benefits seen in the culled area, so the overall net benefit increases. The size of this effect also depends heavily on other factors, including the local background incidence of TB, the density of cattle herds and the degree to which the culled area is surrounded by barriers or buffers to minimise the perturbation effect.</p>
	<p pid="a.47W.0/3">The effects seen during and post culling in the RBCT can be used to estimate the average net effect of culling over different size areas.</p>
	<p pid="a.47W.0/4">For example, the estimated average net benefit of culling over a culled area of 150 sq km and 2 km surrounding ring is a 16.0% reduction in confirmed TB incidence (95% confidence interval: 7.9% reduction to 24.2% reduction) over a nine year period (based on an average five years' culling and four year post cull period). This estimate assumes a higher initial TB incidence in the culled area relative to the surrounding ring.</p>
	<p pid="a.47W.0/5">For comparison, for culling over a 100 sq km area (as in the RBCT), the estimated average net benefit over a nine year period would be a 14.0% reduction (95% confidence interval: 5.3% reduction to 22.8% reduction).</p>

Coastal and inland counts are not reported separately so figures for the number of cormorants which roost and feed inshore are therefore not available.

Where cormorants come into conflict with inland fisheries Natural England may issue licenses to lethally control cormorants. Licences to shoot cormorants, typically as an aid to scaring, are issued on a case by case basis at sites where there is evidence of serious damage to fisheries, or a risk of serious damage occurring, and all other practical alternatives have been tried and have failed.</p>

	<p pid="a.53W.5/1">Information in terms of the holdings of Fixed Quota Allocation (FQA) units by members of each UK fishermen's Producer Organisations is available as part of the information released each year as part of the process of allocating the overall UK quota out to various parts of the industry. The latest information available is on holdings as at <phrase class="date" code="2010-01-01">1 January 2010</phrase> used to distribute quotas for 2010, and it is available from the Marine Management Organisation's internet site at:</p>
	<p pid="a.53W.5/2"><a href="http://www.marinemanagement.org.uk/fisheries/management/quotas.htm">http://www.marinemanagement.org.uk/fisheries/management/quotas.htm</a></p>
	<p pid="a.53W.5/3">Similar information for the position as at <phrase class="date" code="2011-01-01">1 January 2011</phrase> is currently being finalised as part of final allocations of quotas for 2011.</p>
	<p pid="a.53W.5/4">These reports do not include details of holdings by non-active fishermen. Such information would include personal data as defined in Section 1(1) of the Data Protection Act as information relating to living persons, and thus disclosure would breach the principles within the act. In addition, the information requested is effectively details of a commercial (or personal) asset held by the owner and is thus regarded as commercially sensitive, in that if others gain knowledge of their quota ownership (or possibly lack of ownership), it may potentially affect business agreements they might enter into.</p>
	<p pid="a.53W.5/5">The commercial sensitivity and personal nature of the information also prevents the provision of the information. In addition, a significant proportion of quota is held by producer organisations themselves on behalf of their members or other individuals. The actual beneficial holder of the quota is known by the producer organisation involved but this information is not routinely collected by fisheries administrations. As such it is not possible to determine to what extent these holdings may be held by those who are not-active fishermen.</p>
	<p pid="a.53W.5/6">An exercise was carried out in 2007 to look at the details on the ownership of the quota allocation units held by Producer Organisation (PO) on behalf of others. This indicated that for the total holdings of FQA units in the UK, the proportion held by Pos themselves rather than linked to individual vessels was 18.6%. Of this, 3.1% was being held by the PO itself on behalf of its members as a collective asset, 5.5% on behalf of individual active members of the PO, 4.4% held on behalf of vessel agents or salesmen, 2.0% held as part of Community Quota Schemes and 3.5% on behalf of other types of owner.</p>

	<p pid="a.55W.2/1">Although Government Buying Standards (GBS) will only be mandatory for central Government, GBS is also being promoted to the wider public sector including local authorities, who control procurement in many public bodies care homes and schools. There is a balance to be struck between the need to ensure food procured by the public sector is healthier and more sustainable and the need for local public sector bodies to make their own decisions on how best to spend the public money that they are allocated. Given the current financial pressures on all public expenditure it is essential that the measures are affordable and deliver real benefits in terms of sustainability and improved nutrition.</p>
	<p pid="a.55W.2/2">There are many examples of public bodies finding good, healthy and sustainable food, that is no more expensive, right on their doorstep and I know that many people would like to see this happen more. In keeping with the Government's localism approach, we want to give people and communities power to make changes on issues like this that are important to them. We would like to see all public sector bodies procuring at least to GBS standards and we will encourage them to do so. But many people want to go further than this, and our approach to public sector procurement has been designed to support them. We want local people to be able to express their own preferences and for their voices to be heard.</p>

	<p pid="a.57W.5/1">Under the EU Plant Health Directive, the UK implements a series of measures to prevent the entry of plant pests and diseases. These include the requirement to inspect plant imports and for consignments of plants to be accompanied by a phytosanitary certificate. These certificates confirm that the exporting country has attested to the health of the plants and that they meet the EU's import requirements. Despite this regime of inspection and other statutory requirements, there are frequent findings of pests and diseases in imports both from within and outside the EU. The weaknesses of the current regime in providing adequate protection for the UK and other member states from plant pests and disease has prompted a review of the EU's plant health regime, which we are actively supporting.</p>
	<p pid="a.57W.5/2">The UK and other member states are pressing for improved controls so that import inspections are focused on trades presenting the highest risks, and so that new trades, particularly those involving plants for planting, are subject to assessment of risk in advance of import. Other issues, such as the tightening of the concession which allows travellers to import limited quantities of plants and plant material for personal use are also under consideration. We anticipate these will be consulted on next year after the EU publishes its draft proposals for change.</p>
	<p pid="a.57W.5/3">To strengthen controls at our borders, there is also a programme of research at the Food and Environment Research Agency to improve methods of detection of pests in consignments of plants. This includes the development of quick test kits to detect the DNA of plant pathogens and the use of acoustic technology to detect insect larvae within the stems of plants.</p>

	<p pid="a.59W.8/1">There are regular and frequent meetings and discussions between the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) and Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) staff, police and Ministers on a range of issues. Case-related meetings are not recorded in a way that allows the interrogation of the central records to identify the defendant's occupation. Cases might also be discussed as part of meetings on other topics.</p>
	<p pid="a.59W.8/2">The CPS's case management system records cases under defendants' names. It does not specifically identify the occupation of defendants. While the CPS's special crime division deals with serious cases, including those involving police officers as defendants, cases involving more minor allegations against police officers may be dealt with by any of the CPS's area offices throughout England and Wales. Cases involving journalists could also be dealt with by any of the area offices. Defendants' occupations could be identified in every case only by examining individual case files.</p>
	<p pid="a.59W.8/3">The CPS, like all Government Departments, operates a carefully controlled policy under the Public Records Acts, which ensures that paperwork is retained for as long as is necessary, but no longer. Since 2003, some of the case files relating to police officers or journalists as defendants will therefore have been destroyed in accordance with their departmental policy in relation to the retention and destruction of files.</p>

The Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="unknown" name="None">the Member for Richmond (Yorks)</phrase> (Mr Hague) asked my noble Friend Baroness Warsi, Minister without Portfolio, to represent the UK. Her presence at the event (which she also attended on behalf of the Government in July 2010) underlines the importance the UK attaches to marking the anniversary, to honouring the victims and to expressing sympathy with their friends and families. In addition, the Prime Minister issued a statement marking the occasion. He reiterated his conviction that the world must never again allow such atrocities to occur unopposed.</p>
	<p pid="a.60W.9/2">The UK has committed considerable programme funding to Srebrenica-related projects since 2000, including contributing to construction of the memorial complex in Srebrenica, support to the International Commission for Missing Persons and legal secondments to the team in the Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) State Prosecutor's Office dealing with Srebrenica-related crimes. My noble Friend Baroness Warsi visited partners in British embassy project activity relating to Srebrenica during her visit. The Foreign Secretary and I have also taken the opportunity to learn more about this work during our own visits to Sarajevo over the past year.</p>
	<p pid="a.60W.9/3">There has been considerable progress towards regional reconciliation in recent years, and many of those responsible for war crimes in the Balkans have already faced justice. The recent arrest of Ratko Mladic underlines the international community's commitment to bringing to justice those responsible for war crimes. While this judicial process can never compensate the bereaved for the losses they continue to bear, the arrest of Mladic, and the subsequent arrest of the last remaining International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia indictee, Goran Hadzic, should mark a turning point for all the countries of the Western Balkans and the start of a new chapter of cooperation and reconciliation.</p>

	<p pid="a.61W.5/1">The immediate and unconditional release of Burma's estimated 2,000 political prisoners is an important benchmark by which the UK judges the Burmese Government. We are encouraged that Aung San Suu Kyi met the Burmese President on <phrase class="date" code="2011-08-19">19 August</phrase> and we have called for tangible progress from this dialogue including the release of all political prisoners.</p>
	<p pid="a.61W.5/2">Our ambassador to Rangoon regularly raises with the Burmese authorities the need for the release of all political prisoners. Officials pressed the Burmese President's Chief Political Adviser on <phrase class="date" code="2011-08-18">18 August</phrase> to take such action. The Government also repeatedly raise this issue during discussions with our international partners and in the UN. We are currently working to secure the toughest possible resolution at the UN General Assembly which we hope will repeat calls for Burma to release all political prisoners and work towards national reconciliation.</p>

	<p pid="a.62W.8/1">The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO)'s Consular staff in London and overseas regularly answer phone calls from British Nationals seeking our help, including through our 24 hour Global Response Centre. Consular Directorate also provides the following telephone helplines:</p>
	<p pid="a.62W.8/2">Travel Advice telephone line&#8212;This service offers access to Foreign Office travel advice to those who are unable to view it online, or who wish to inquire in person. The service is currently provided by a commercial partner and we have budgeted &#163;180,000 for 2011-12. We continue to improve our online travel advice, and hope to reduce this cost by making online advice easier to use.</p>
	<p pid="a.62W.8/3">Overseas Crises&#8212;In a crisis affecting British Nationals overseas the FCO may activate a call handling capacity to take calls from affected members of the public, either in-house or outsourced to a commercial partner or the police. This depends on the scale of the incident. These call handlers usually respond to calls to a dedicated emergency hotline number. Funding for operational costs is not allocated in advance, but these costs can be claimed for from the Treasury held Emergency Disaster Reserve should the total costs of our crisis response surpass &#163;150,000.</p>
	<p pid="a.62W.8/4">Legalisation, and Births, Deaths and Marriages Inquiries&#8212;This service is currently being provided by a commercial partner, to enable the Legalisation Office staff to process documents as efficiently as possible and ensure calls are always answered promptly. The budget for 2011-12 is &#163;80,000. Within the same contract, there is an inquiry line for British Nationals looking to register a birth or death or with questions about getting married or arranging a civil partnership overseas.</p>
	<p pid="a.62W.8/5">Passport Inquiry line&#8212;Between <phrase class="date" code="2009-06-01">1 June 2009</phrase> and <phrase class="date" code="2011-04-01">1 April 2011</phrase>, Consular Directorate employed Careline, a UK based company, to provide a telephone inquiry and tracking service for customers applying for passports overseas. Careline continue to provide this service but the contract is now managed by the Identity and Passport Service, an executive agency of the Home Office. The FCO did not pay for this service; customers are charged direct by Careline. Exceptionally, the FCO covered the cost of calls to Careline, from <phrase class="date" code="2011-07-15">15 July</phrase> to <phrase class="date" code="2011-07-31">31 July 2011</phrase> for customers served by the Regional Passport Processing Centre in Dusseldorf and from <phrase class="date" code="2011-07-15">15 July</phrase> until <phrase class="date" code="2011-08-31">31 August</phrase> for customers served by the Processing Centre in Washington because of delays in passport production. The final amount of these exceptional costs is not yet known.</p>
	<p pid="a.62W.8/6">Consular Directorate provides specific telephone numbers for certain customers requiring FCO support. These are regular FCO phone lines manned by Consular staff at no additional cost:</p>
	<p pid="a.62W.8/7">The Child Abduction Section helpline to answer urgent questions from British Nationals involved in a parental child abduction, residence or contact dispute overseas;</p>
	<p pid="a.62W.8/8">The Forced Marriage Unit helpline, for British Nationals who are worried about a possible forced marriage. This is a joint initiative with the Home Office; A helpline for MPs wishing to speak to a member of Consular Directorate about constituency cases.</p>

	<p pid="a.64W.6/2">North Africa is particularly vulnerable to food price volatility, with poor domestic conditions and significant exposure to international markets. The region is a substantial net importer of wheat and heavily subsidises consumption. Food price inflation was one contributory factor to the Tunisian and Egyptian unrest, and fuelled discontent across the region. Morocco, Tunisia and Egypt have all reassured citizens that food and commodity subsidies will be maintained amidst the recent unrest. Although allowing Governments to quell immediate discontent, this brings significant fiscal constraints, shoring up problems for the future. We believe Governments need to adopt sustainable economic and targeted social protection policies which deliver long-term benefits for the development of their societies and prospects for their people. Putting these policies in place will need to be carefully sequenced over time especially given the very high expectations of people to see tangible benefits from reforms.</p>
	<p pid="a.64W.6/3">The major oil exporters in the middle east are well guarded against the fiscal pressures of rising food prices. Food insecurity continues in Yemen, and recent droughts have turned Iran from a significant wheat exporter to a wheat importer.</p>

	<p pid="a.65W.5/1">Our Overseas Business Risk website which is run jointly by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and UK Trade and Investment offers country specific advice to British companies to help them manage political and reputational risks when operating overseas. We intend to develop the website further in order that it provides context on some of the key issues that business may want to consider, such as complying with UK legislation on Bribery or the potential impact their business activity can have on human rights and how to avoid adverse impacts as a part of their political and reputational risk management.</p>
	<p pid="a.65W.5/2">We believe that free trade and economic growth promote development and respect for human rights. We encourage British businesses to be aware of their potential impacts on human rights. Not only is there a moral imperative to ensure that human rights are respected, we think there is also a strong business case for doing so as an important contribution to stable, healthy and sustainable markets.</p>

	<p pid="a.66W.3/1">Jerusalem has unique religious significance to many different faith groups. Our goal is a secure and universally recognised Israel living alongside a sovereign and viable Palestinian state, based on the borders of 1967, with Jerusalem the future capital of both states. It is important that all religions can enjoy the religious sites and practice their religious beliefs in a safe and secure environment with mutual respect.</p>

The Government condemns all instances of violence and discrimination against individuals and groups because of their faith or belief.

	<p pid="a.75W.6/2">I am not aware that during the Prime Minister's visit to Afghanistan in December 2010 he made any reference to the number of insurgents killed by UK drones. Comprehensive figures are not recorded because of the immense difficulty and risks that would be involved in collecting robust data. Prior to the visit the Ministry of Defence briefed on the agreement to double the UK's Reaper Remotely Piloted Aircraft System capability and the state of the military campaign.</p>

	<p pid="a.84W.8/1">The estimated relative cost of operating the Typhoon Force from RAF Lossiemouth and RAF Leuchars over a 25 year period, including the costs of transferring from Leuchars to Lossiemouth, is approximately &#163;604 million and &#163;565 million respectively. The costs were refined and updated during the course of the basing review, as is usual in such a process. They will be refined further during detailed planning for the implementation of the Defence basing decisions.</p>
	<p pid="a.84W.8/2">In taking these decisions, the balance of financial advantage between Leuchars or Lossiemouth as RAF bases was outweighed by wider Defence considerations. These included the necessity to establish a coherent plan for basing the Army following its return from Germany and the need to realise receipts by disposing of high value estate, including in Edinburgh, while ensuring the build-up of the Typhoon force.</p>

	<p pid="a.88W.8/3">However, we have been very clear and consistent throughout the basing review that the paramount criteria must be what makes overall sense for Defence. We will make more efficient use of the existing Defence estate by using bases that are otherwise underused, such as Kirknewton, and realising receipts from high-value sites, such as Dreghorn, Craigiehall and Redford Barracks. It makes military and financial sense to consolidate on fewer, larger sites. But our rebasing plan may, regrettably, mean a reduction in Defence-related economic activity for some communities and local businesses. We will continue to consult with the Scottish Secretary, the Scottish Government and other partners to see how any harmful socio-economic impacts that may result might be minimised, including in Edinburgh.</p>

The intent of the review was to deliver a basing plan that would accommodate the Army units returning from Germany; a geographical footprint that delivered the operational and personnel requirements of multi-role brigades, that made most efficient use of the existing Defence estate by using bases that are otherwise underused such as Kirknewton; and realising receipts from the sale of high-value sites no longer required. Kirknewton is one element of the overall solution we identified that offered best value for money, met these requirements, and will offer the Ministry of Defence flexibility in planning the return of the Army from Germany.</p>

	<p pid="a.96W.12/6">We have instead interpreted your question as what percentage of complaints to the Child Support Agency were either fully resolved or had a resolution plan in place within 15 days. The percentage of complaints that were fully resolved and/or with a resolution plan in place within 15 working days of receipt in the year ending March 2011 was 99.2%. This is an increase from 98.5% in the year ending March 2010 and 97.1% in the year ending March 2009.</p>

We have set up an independent panel to look at arrears and provide advice on how arrears of child maintenance might be dealt with most effectively in the long-term.

In Ashington in Northumberland, support on child maintenance is being delivered in a children's centre where other services are offered. A similar project has started in children's centres in Essex with the key difference that parents of children aged up to 19 use these centres. In Nottingham, we are looking at how our services can be integrated into wider local authority support provision including health, youth and community services.</p>

The Department plans to realise substantial efficiency savings over the period of the spending review 2011-12 to 2014-15 through measures which will deliver both savings and improved customer service, as well as focussing its resources on key reforms of the welfare system.

This figure is subject to ongoing review and may change.</p>

	<p pid="a.109W.5/1">There are advantages in paying the housing component to individuals, rather than the current system of payments direct to landlords. This would encourage people to manage their own budget in the same way as other households. Additionally, we do not want to take away responsibilities for rent payment that tenants have handled perfectly well perhaps all their working lives.</p>
	<p pid="a.109W.5/2">However, we also recognise the importance of stable rental income for social landlords to support the delivery of new homes. We are developing universal credit in a way that protects their financial position, and we plan to retain a facility for direct payments to social landlords, including charities.</p>
	<p pid="a.109W.5/3">We do recognise that, in encouraging more people to manage their own budgets, there may well be a need for additional financial education and support. We are considering precisely what additional support services might be required in the run up to universal credit.</p>

	<p pid="a.112W.6/1">The estimated savings to the public purse of the 20 Jobcentre buildings identified for potential closure is &#163;32.1 million over eight years (to 2017-18) at Net Present Value (NPV).</p>
	<p pid="a.112W.6/2">Jobcentre Plus is endeavouring to become a leaner, more flexible and productive organisation that delivers more of its services over the telephone and internet. As it implements more digital services and as unemployment falls, Jobcentre Plus will be able to free up more capacity in its estate. Face-to-face contact in Jobcentres will reduce as more services can be accessed online and through the simplification of the benefit system.</p>
	<p pid="a.112W.6/3">While Jobcentre Plus does not anticipate announcing any further closures this year, it will continuously review its estate so that efficiency savings and value for money for the taxpayer can be achieved. Jobcentre Plus will also be working alongside its partners to explore every opportunity that might further reduce estates costs and constantly monitoring its workloads and the impact of universal credit to assess the potential for further rationalisation.</p>
	<p pid="a.112W.6/4">Since the estates review commenced (post 2010 spending review), Jobcentre Plus has announced the closure or consultation on the closure of 44 offices.</p>
	<p pid="a.112W.6/5">On <phrase class="date" code="2011-05-13">13 May</phrase> it was announced that 22 Benefit and Contact Centres would close.

Contact Centres at Caerphilly, Clydebank, Grimsby (Europarc), Liverpool and Preston will close by May 2012. A further two Benefit Centres at Carlisle and Hartlepool will close during 2012-13.</p>
	<p pid="a.112W.6/6">On <phrase class="date" code="2011-07-08">8 July</phrase> Jobcentre Plus announced consultation on the closure of Banff and Girvan Jobcentres and the intention to move all staff and services into the premises of partner organisations in the respective towns.</p>

	<p pid="a.112W.6/27">Birmingham airport Jobshop is an employer only facility and the same facilities can be provided at nearby Jobcentres.</p>
	<p pid="a.112W.6/28">Prior to the announcement on <phrase class="date" code="2011-07-19">19 July</phrase>, confidentiality prevented Jobcentre Plus from progressing beyond high level discussions with potential co-location partners at the sites. Now that the announcement has been made, Jobcentre Plus is able to embark upon a six week consultation exercise with all of our customers, partners and key stakeholders and the subject of co-location will be an integral element of the exercise. Jobcentre Plus district managers have written to stakeholders to instigate and encourage participation in the consultation exercise.</p>
	<p pid="a.112W.6/29">If it is concluded following consultation that the closures should go ahead, typically they will close in 12 months unless a lease break enables earlier exit.</p>

It has always been the claimant's responsibility to meet any shortfalls. All individuals applying to the HOLD scheme must be able to demonstrate to their mortgage lender and the housing association provider that they are able to meet the cost of buying their share and that they can sustain the financial responsibilities that home ownership brings.</p>

	<p pid="a.116W.8/1">We have concluded that the Consumer Prices Index (CPI) is a reliable measure of pensioners' experience of inflation for a number of reasons.</p>
	<p pid="a.116W.8/2">Firstly the CPI basket of goods does not include mortgage interest payments, which are not relevant to the majority of pensioners, only 8% of whom have a mortgage. The inclusion of mortgage interest payments in the Retail Prices Index (RPI) led to negative RPI growth of -1.4 per cent in the year to September 2009, whereas the CPI showed 1.1 per cent growth during the same period.</p>
	<p pid="a.116W.8/3">The CPI includes the expenditure of pensioner households who receive 75% or more of their income from the state, a group excluded from the RPI.</p>
	<p pid="a.116W.8/4">The CPI also employs a methodology that is a more accurate reflection of how consumers, including pensioners, respond to price rises, than the methodology employed in the RPI.</p>

We are currently carrying out an informal consultation on the draft criteria to seek the views of disabled people and their organisations on how they will work and how they might be improved. We are also testing them by carrying out around 1,000 sample assessments over the summer. The testing will help us to better understand the likely effect of the criteria, including the effect on those vulnerable adults with low to moderate needs.

	<p pid="a.122W.2/4">The term 'habitual residence' is not defined in social security legislation. This means that each case is considered on its own merits, in the light of the person's individual circumstances. In deciding whether a person is actually habitually resident, decision-makers consider a wide variety of factors. These include reasons for coming to the United Kingdom, the length of their stay, future intentions, previous links with the country and, in the case of people returning to the United Kingdom, the reasons for their absence. DWP guidance, based on case law, suggests that a period of between one and three months is likely to be appropriate to demonstrate that a person's residence is habitual in nature.</p>

	<p pid="a.126W.2/1">We have strict rules in place to prevent abuse of the benefit system by benefit tourism. One of the principal measures is the Habitual Residence Test. People coming from abroad can claim income-related benefits only if they have a right to reside and are habitually resident in the Common Travel Area<sup>(1)</sup>. Claimants are required to show that they are habitually resident in this country and have a settled intention to remain. Any exceptions (refugees, for example) are linked to the immigration status awarded by the Home Office.</p>
	<p pid="a.126W.2/2">To support staff in applying the Habitual Residence Test, we recently introduced an electronic data gathering form in Jobcentre Plus. The aim is to improve both the collection of information relevant to the test, and the quality of the decisions made in respect of it.</p>

	<p pid="a.126W.2/5">We recognise that it is important that we provide support to people who come to this country, in line with our national and international obligations. However, it is also necessary to protect the taxpayer and the benefit system from possible abuse.</p>

	<p pid="a.132W.2/1">The hon. Member will no doubt be aware that a significant proportion of claimants report mental health as one of their health problems. In view of the numbers involved, it would not be appropriate to delay the appeals of others in order to prioritise the appeals of this particular group. Importantly, all claimants can continue to receive employment and support allowance at a basic rate pending the outcome of the appeal where they appeal against a limited capability for work decision.</p>
	<p pid="a.132W.2/2">We have now commenced the reassessment of everyone on incapacity benefit, severe disablement allowance and income support paid because of an illness or disability to see if they are ready and capable of work. As we know that the assessment process may prove stressful for some customers we have taken a number of steps to ensure those affected are fully informed of what will happen and how it may affect them. Jobcentre Plus write to claimants when their benefit becomes due for reassessment (prompted by the date that they would have been due a Personal Capability Assessment) to tell them about the changes. We also phone the customer shortly after this to check they have received the letter and that they understand what action they need to take, and to find out if they need any extra help. We are now looking at extending this more personal treatment in response to Professor Harrington's recommendations made in his recent report on the operation of the Work Capability Assessment.</p>
	<p pid="a.132W.2/3">Responsibility for administering appeals against decisions on entitlement to benefits lies with Her Majesty's Courts and Tribunals Service, which is an Executive Agency of the Ministry of Justice. The Ministry of Justice have confirmed that they would be willing to refer any individual request to prioritise an appeal for consideration by a Social Security and Child Support Judge, but this would only be done in exceptional cases.</p>

	<p pid="a.141W.2/1">The European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) originates from European regulations concerning the free movement of migrant workers around Europe, and it is likely that any charge to the citizen that is over and above the cost of producing the card would be seen as a barrier to citizens accessing their rights in Europe.</p>
	<p pid="a.141W.2/2">It is free of charge to apply for the card in the United Kingdom online, by phone or by post directly through the NHS Business Services Authority (BSA), which administers EHIC applications and renewals on behalf of the Department.</p>
	<p pid="a.141W.2/3">Since the card's introduction in the UK, several websites have set up providing a service whereby, for a charge of around &#163;10, they check a citizen's EHIC application and forward the application to the NHS BSA. These websites can be misleading: they sponsor links on search engines so that they appear above the Government's websites; they use official sounding language and official looking images on their websites; and they sometimes do not make it clear enough that it is free to apply directly through the NHS BSA.</p>
	<p pid="a.141W.2/4">The EHIC application website and the NHS Choices website, which provides information about the EHIC, are currently the top two non-sponsored results on Google, and also feature highly on other similar search engines. The Department has also amended the wording on its website to make it clearer that there is no need to pay for the EHIC, and has taken steps to ensure that this messaging appears in the descriptions of its results on Google and other search engines.</p>
	<p pid="a.141W.2/5">All digital content published on NHS Choices and on the Department's website is designed to perform well in search results.</p>
	<p pid="a.141W.2/6">While the Department does not have specific details about each company that charges for checking applications for the EHIC, it has referred several websites that offer such services to the Office of Fair Trading (OFT), for it to investigate and take appropriate action. On <phrase class="date" code="2011-07-14">14 July 2011</phrase>, the OFT announced new investigations into the deceptive online selling of Government services, in particular those that are usually low cost or free of charge.</p>
	<p pid="a.141W.2/7">The Department does not hold information on the number of commercial companies charging a fee for registration through a website for services offered by the Department free of charge, nor does it have a general policy on commercial companies offering services for a fee.</p>

	<p pid="a.148W.2/1">We are providing &#163;750 million over the next four years to support the national health service to deliver &#8220;Improving Outcomes: A Strategy for Cancer&#8221;, published on <phrase class="date" code="2011-01-12">12 January 2011</phrase>. The strategy sets out an ambition to save an additional 5,000 lives every year by 2014-15 through early diagnosis of symptomatic cancer and improved access to screening and radiotherapy treatment.</p>
	<p pid="a.148W.2/2">It is now accepted that late diagnosis is one of the main reasons our cancer survival rates are worse than many other European countries. To understand the reasons for this disparity we are leading an International Cancer Benchmarking Partnership to explore the impact of the stage of diagnosis and access to treatment by surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy on avoidable deaths from cancer.</p>
	<p pid="a.148W.2/3">We know that for many other conditions earlier diagnosis is also an important factor in delivering better outcomes. That is why to achieve earlier diagnosis of dementia, we are working in partnership with the Alzheimer's Society on the Living Well with Dementia campaign. In March we launched a one-month pilot in the North West and Yorkshire and the Humber to help people to recognise dementia symptoms and we are now evaluating the impact of the campaign.</p>
	<p pid="a.148W.2/4">Our Mental Health Strategy, &#8220;No Health Without Mental Health&#8221;, also highlights the importance of prevention and early intervention, as half of those with lifetime mental health problems first experience symptoms before the age of 14. This is why we are working in partnership with the Department for Education and Schools to consider how schools can best support children and on the roll-out of interventions to help the most vulnerable children.</p>
	<p pid="a.148W.2/5">Prevention as well as earlier diagnosis is an important factor in delivering better outcomes. This is why we are undertaking prevention activity in a number of areas. For example, through the NHS Health Check we are working to identify people aged 40-74 at risk of heart disease, stroke, kidney disease and diabetes and to support them to reduce or manage that risk through individually tailored advice and support.</p>
	<p pid="a.148W.2/6">The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence is also developing a range of Quality Standards to support the early diagnosis and treatment of people with a wide range of conditions.</p>

	<p pid="a.156W.3/1">The &#8216;NHS (Charges to Overseas Visitors) Regulations 2011&#8217; impose a statutory duty on national health service hospitals to identify persons who are chargeable and to make and recover such charges from them.</p>
	<p pid="a.156W.3/2">The Department's &#8216;Guidance on Implementing the Overseas visitors Hospital Charging Regulations&#8217;, makes clear that hospitals are obliged to recover debts and should pursue them to whatever extent they consider reasonable in the circumstances. They have the option to write off debts when it would not be reasonable to pursue them, such as when the patient is genuinely without funds or has died, or attempts to secure the debt are unsuccessful. I understand that most hospitals choose to make use of debt recovery companies if initial attempts at recovery prove unsuccessful.</p>
	<p pid="a.156W.3/3">In its response to a public consultation on <phrase class="date" code="2011-03-18">18 March 2011</phrase>, the Home Office announced plans to refuse further requests for visas to enter or remain in the United Kingdom for persons with unpaid debts for NHS treatment in excess of &#163;1,000. These new immigration rules are expected to be introduced in the autumn.</p>
	<p pid="a.156W.3/4">A search of the Department's correspondence database has identified 43 items of correspondence received since <phrase class="date" code="2011-01-01">1 January 2011</phrase> about the cost of treatment provided by the NHS to patients who are not entitled to free NHS treatment. This is a minimum figure which represents correspondence received by the Department's central correspondence team only. Over the same period, the Department has also received 16 parliamentary questions.</p>
	<p pid="a.156W.3/5">On <phrase class="date" code="2011-03-18">18 March 2011</phrase>, Ministers published a response to an earlier consultation on &#8216;Access to the NHS by Foreign Nationals&#8217; that had received 166 responses. In their response, Ministers announced that the Government will conduct a full, wide-ranging review of the rules and practices relating to charging overseas visitors for using the NHS. It is hoped that this will report early next year.</p>

Changes to the figures over time need to be interpreted in the context of improvements in data quality and coverage (particularly in earlier years), improvements in coverage of independent sector activity (particularly from 2006-07) and changes in NHS practice. For example, apparent reductions in activity may be due to a number of procedures which may now be undertaken in out-patient settings and so no longer include in admitted patient HES data. <i>Note</i>: Data quality: HES are compiled from data sent by more than 300 NHS trusts and primary care trusts in England and from some independent sector organisations for activity commissioned by the English IMHS. The NHS Information Centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies. While this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain. <i>Source</i>: Hospital Episode Statistics (HES), The NHS Information Centre for Health and Social Care</td> </tr>

The most recent testing of milk samples from Somerset was in May 2011. The analytical method used can detect for the presence of both Caesium-137 and Iodine-131. Neither of these radionuclides were detected in the samples in May and are not routinely detected in samples from Somerset.</p>

	<p pid="a.169W.2/1">The &#8216;NHS Outcomes Framework 2011/12&#8217; was published in December 2010 and signals the direction of travel for the national health service in focusing on outcomes. It is intended to support continuous improvements in outcomes for patients across the range of activities the NHS is responsible for delivering.</p>
	<p pid="a.169W.2/2">For example, in Domain 5: &#8216;Treating and caring for people in a safe environment and protecting people from avoidable harm&#8217;, there are two indicators which will track the progress of the NHS in reducing incidences of healthcare associated infections. Existing data show that in the year ending March 2011 the number of methicillin-resistant <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> bloodstream infections decreased by 22% and <i>Clostridium difficile</i> infections decreased by 15% on the year before. These are positive outcomes in this domain, and we expect improvements to occur across all five domains.</p>
	<p pid="a.169W.2/3">To support the outcomes and indicators in each domain of the NHS Outcomes Framework, a suite of National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) Quality Standards are being developed, and we have commissioned NICE to produce two Quality Standards on patient experience.</p>

	<p pid="a.171W.2/1">Implementation of the Organ Donation Taskforce recommendations has seen donor rates rise by around 28% since 2008 and over 18 million people&#8212;some 28% of the United Kingdom population&#8212;have registered on the Organ Donor Register. Work continues at a local, regional and national level to increase donor rates still further to the 50% by 2013 anticipated by the Organ Donation Taskforce.</p>

	<p pid="a.171W.5/1">In 2008, the independent Organ Donation Taskforce examined the case for moving to a system of presumed consent for organ donation. It recommended against it, concluding that while such a system might have the potential to deliver benefits, it would present significant difficulties which might not bring about the desired increase in organ donation rates. Action has been taken to strengthen the donation infrastructure and since the publication of the taskforce's report in 2008, organ donor rates have increased by around 28%. We need to give time for these improvements to work through fully and assess their success, before looking to change the system further.</p>

	<p pid="a.172W.0/1">The All-Party Parliamentary Group on Osteoporosis' report of its inquiry into the role of nutrition in preventing osteoporosis and promoting bone health sets out a number of recommendations for Government, the national health service, local authorities, social care providers, those responsible for delivering public health messages and the food, advertising, retail and cosmetics industries.</p>
	<p pid="a.172W.0/2">In our recently published social marketing strategy, &#8216;Changing Behaviours, Improving Outcomes&#8217;, we have set out our intentions to expand on the Change4Life programme to include all relevant advice to promote healthier lifestyles. This will include broader dietary and physical activity messages.</p>
	<p pid="a.172W.0/3">The Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition (SACN) is currently reviewing the data on vitamin D and health in light of the new evidence that has become available since it published its position statement &#8216;Update on Vitamin D&#8217;, in 2007. This review will consider the vitamin D status of United Kingdom populations, the thresholds to define deficiency and the relative contributions of diet and sunlight exposure to maintain vitamin D status. It is expected that SACN's review will take three to four years to complete.</p>
	<p pid="a.172W.0/4">Technology Appraisal guidance published by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) supports calcium and vitamin D supplementation in post-menopausal women receiving osteoporosis treatment unless clinicians are confident that the patient already has adequate levels. Healthcare professionals are expected to take the guidance fully into account when exercising their clinical judgment. However, the guidance does not override the individual responsibility of health care professionals to make decisions appropriate to the circumstances of the individual patient, in consultation with the patient and/or guardian or carer. Commissioners and providers are reminded by NICE of their responsibilities to implement this guidance in light of local circumstances.</p>
	<p pid="a.172W.0/5">Resources published as part of the prevention package for older people, are designed to support the NHS and local authorities in prioritising and effectively commissioning services that support the health, well-being and independence of older people. The document &#8220;Falls and fractures: effective interventions in health and social care&#8221; sets out a systematic approach to falls and fracture prevention. This includes an objective to prevent frailty, preserve bone health and reduce accidents through preserving physical activity, healthy lifestyles and reducing environmental hazards.</p>
	<p pid="a.172W.0/6">The NHS Outcomes Framework 2011-12 includes an indicator, which focuses on:</p>
	<p pid="a.172W.0/7">&#8216;improving recovery from fragility fractures&#8212;the proportion of patients recovering to their previous levels of mobility/walking ability at (i) 30 days and (ii) 120 days&#8217;.</p>
	<p pid="a.172W.0/8">Following consultation on the draft Adult Social Care Outcomes Framework, an indicator on the proportion of people suffering fragility fractures who recover their previous level of mobility/walking after 120 days was excluded for 2011-12 as further work was required on data development and the analysis of the impact of social care. However, this does not preclude the inclusion of such an indicator in future years.</p>
	<p pid="a.172W.0/9">In the recent consultation on proposals for a public health outcomes framework, an indicator on &#8216;Acute admissions as a result of falls or fall injuries for over 65s&#8217; was included. This was selected for inclusion on the basis that falls account for the majority of admissions to hospital for unintentional injury among older people, and so falls prevention is a key public health priority. The response to the consultation was, in general, very supportive of the broad concept of the outcomes framework, its breadth and the focus on life-course and health inequalities, which are both particularly relevant to the rates of falls in older people. As we develop the final outcomes framework which we intend to publish later this year, we will consider the full range of responses from stakeholders to the consultation to determine the final set of indicators for inclusion in the final framework.</p>
	<p pid="a.172W.0/10">Work to reduce hospital admissions due to fractures among older people will require joint effort across the wider public health, NHS and adult social care systems. Alongside the development of the public health outcomes framework over the next few weeks and months, we will work with stakeholders to clarify and publicise the close alignment of all three outcomes frameworks, supporting local Health and Well-being Boards in their work to improve outcomes across the board and to encourage joint work across the NHS, local authority and providers to support older people in this case to live longer, healthier lives.</p>
	<p pid="a.172W.0/11">The prioritisation of potential indicators for inclusion in the Quality and Outcomes Framework is the responsibility of NICE. Following publication of the indicators, NHS Employers negotiate with the British Medical Association on which indicators should be included within the Quality and Outcome Framework, achievement levels and the value of those indicators.</p>

	<p pid="a.181W.5/1">&#8216;Real-time&#8217; patient feedback is a general term for the use of a variety of approaches to capturing feedback from patients and service users at the point of care level&#8212;this can include hand-held devices, texting, kiosks, and comment cards. The 2011-12 Operating Framework for the national health service states that systems should be in place to capture the views and experiences of patients, service users and carers, and this will include the collection of real-time feedback.</p>
	<p pid="a.181W.5/2">Local organisations should use whichever methods of real-time feedback are most suitable and appropriate for their patients and populations. The information obtained can be used directly by staff to improve services at or near the time care is provided. Due to organisations collecting different data in different ways, any national aggregation would be meaningless. The Department does not collect real-time feedback data centrally.</p>

Practitioners have access to specialist tissue viability nurses who provide training as well as expert advice in the care of individual patients.

	<p pid="a.183W.0/1">Work to reduce salt in food is being taken forward under the Public Health Responsibility Deal. Ministers and officials have been talking to a range of representatives from the manufacturing, retailing, catering and supply sectors. The response has been very positive and to date 55 companies have pledged to meet the Responsibility Deal salt reduction targets for 2012 with many more considering how they might contribute to this work.</p>
	<p pid="a.183W.0/2">In 2003, the Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition recommended that the average adult population salt intake should be reduced to no more than 6 grammes per day, and less for children. The salt reduction targets agreed by the Food Network of the Responsibility Deal and to be met by 2012 will give a total salt reduction of nearly 1 gramme per person per day compared to the levels in food in 2007.</p>
	<p pid="a.183W.0/3">We recognise that reducing salt intake in the population is a key intervention to decrease the risk of high blood pressure and cardiovascular disease. We have supported its inclusion as a priority global action to prevent non-communicable diseases in the forthcoming outcomes document for the UN Non-Communicable Diseases High Level Meeting in September 2011.</p>

	<p pid="a.186W.2/1">We are aiming to reduce premature mortality from stroke in a number of ways.</p>
	<p pid="a.186W.2/2">The NHS Health Check programme assesses people aged between 40 and 74 for their risk of heart disease, stroke, diabetes and kidney disease and helps them to reduce or manage that risk through individually tailored lifestyle advice and support so they stay well for longer. Phased implementation began in April 2009 and this Government is committed to the continuation of the programme. At full roll-out, the programme could prevent at least 1,600 heart attacks and strokes a year.</p>
	<p pid="a.186W.2/3">Implementation of the National Stroke Strategy and the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence Quality Standard for stroke provides the NHS with evidence based characteristics of a good stroke service that have and will continue to improve stroke care resulting in better outcomes for patients in terms of prevention and treatment. Progress on stroke care in England is measured through the National Sentinel Stroke Audit.</p>
	<p pid="a.186W.2/4">Another wave of the Act FAST public awareness campaign is being planned for the autumn. This aims to help the public recognise the signs and symptoms of a stroke so that stroke patients get to hospital faster and receive quicker treatment, and so save lives.</p>
	<p pid="a.186W.2/5">The NHS Improvement Programme is leading work on raising awareness of the role of atrial fibrillation (AF) in stroke in primary and secondary care. For example, it is promoting opportunistic pulse checks in primary care, such as at flu clinics, to detect AF earlier in older people so that it can be treated and so reduce their risk of stroke.</p>

	<p pid="a.190W.5/2">While controlling the size of the budget is the UK's main priority, the Government believe that funding for climate change should make up a larger share of an EU budget that increases, at most, by no more than inflation in the next Multi-Annual Financial Framework, and that climate change objectives should be mainstreamed across all relevant headings, ensuring that the EU's investments are compatible with and contribute to the EU's cost-effective transition to a low carbon economy. The Government have made this case to the Commission and will continue to do so as negotiations on the next Multi-Annual Financial Framework progress.</p>

	<p pid="a.192W.2/1">The aim of electricity market reform is to ensure the investment we need to meet our security of supply and decarbonisation targets at least cost. Energy efficiency could have a role to play in meeting our targets in a cost-effective way, and we will assess whether the existing package of energy efficiency measures is providing adequate encouragement for efficiency improvements in electricity usage, to determine whether there might be a need for appropriate additional measures.</p>

We have already taken decisive action to reduce central Government emissions by 13.8% (exceeding our original target of a 10% reduction). We are now being even more ambitious with a 25% target by the end of this Parliament.</p>

The EDRP found that savings from generic written advice and historic feedback resulted in a reduction in consumption of up to 5%.</p>

A recent review of 57 feedback studies in nine different countries by the American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy<sup>(2)</sup> found that on average feedback reduces energy consumption between 4-12%, with higher (9%) savings associated with real-time feedback.</p>

Recent research by The National Skills Academy (August 2011) estimates that in the peak years of 2016 and 2017, around 7,500-8,000 meter installers will be employed compared to existing work force levels of approximately 3,200 people.</p>

	<p pid="a.198W.5/1">The Government's impact assessment estimates that the roll-out of smart meters to the domestic sector will deliver a net benefit of almost &#163;5.1 billion, leading to an average bill saving of &#163;23 per household in 2020 and &#163;42 in 2030. This reflects an estimated total gross cost of the programme of &#163;10.8 billion, offset by more than &#163;15.8 billion in gross benefits.

The remote functionality of smart meters will allow switching between payment methods (credit or prepayment) without the expense of exchanging the meter and will reduce the current higher than average costs associated with providing services to pre-payment customers. It is expected that new and more flexible payment options will be introduced, such as top-ups over the phone, via the internet, or at automated teller machines (ATMs), supporting a wider pay-as-you-go market. The pre-payment capability should also enable suppliers to better manage customer debt, resulting in cost savings that can be passed on to all consumers.</p>

Plant operators are undertaking the stress tests and will report their findings to the national nuclear regulators for assessment and verification in two stages, a progress report by <phrase class="date" code="2011-08-15">15 August</phrase> and a final report by <phrase class="date" code="2011-10-31">31 October 2011</phrase>. National regulators will then produce a national report on progress by <phrase class="date" code="2011-09-15">15 September</phrase> and the final findings by <phrase class="date" code="2011-12-31">31 December 2011</phrase>. Both reports will be submitted to the European Commission.</p>
	<p pid="a.203W.2/2">The UK national regulator, the Office of Nuclear Regulation (ONR), has written to, and had meetings with, all UK nuclear power plant operators setting out what is expected of them in relation to applying the criteria of the stress test. This has been done as part of ONR's regulatory function to ensure that operators are complying with the UK's regulatory framework which requires operators to achieve, so far as is reasonably practicable, continuous improvements in safety. Applying the lessons learned from events at Fukushima is covered by this general legal duty on operators.</p>
	<p pid="a.203W.2/3">Should the ONR consider that operators are not meeting their statutory responsibilities at any time, it has the necessary enforcement powers to achieve compliance.</p>

It is funded by a combination of direct Government grant, and commercial income. The following table sets out what the NDA has spent since its formation on completing its core mission, excluding commercial operations, alongside its projected spending for each year of the next spending review period. Due to the integration of many of civil and military historic legacy facilities, it is not possible to separate expenditure on civil and military decommissioning. The NDA's mission is to decommission the whole nuclear legacy estate as efficiently as possible, and the most effective approach is to treat it as a whole&#8212;irrespective of origin.</p>

	<p pid="a.203W.5/17">Prior to 2005 nuclear legacy issues which are now the responsibility of the NDA were owned by British Nuclear Fuels and the UK Atomic Energy Authority. Details of their expenditure on decommissioning are set out in their published annual reports and accounts.</p>
	<p pid="a.203W.5/18">The decommissioning of current military nuclear facilities is the responsibility of the Ministry of Defence (MOD), and covers a wide range of activities, from submarine reactors and nuclear warheads to infrastructure. Details of budgeted and actual costs for military nuclear decommissioning, are not held centrally, and could be provided only at disproportionate cost. Furthermore, the MOD does not routinely publish figures for anticipated annual project expenditure, as to do so would prejudice commercial interests and jeopardise the negotiating position of the Department.</p>

We cannot, however, sustain investment in new, wholly unabated coal if we are to meet our carbon targets. Fossil fuels with Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) can play a vital role in our future energy mix, helping to balance baseload nuclear and intermittent renewables. CCS is the only technology that can significantly reduce C02 emissions from fossil fuel power stations&#8212;by as much as 90%. That is why the Government are committed to providing public funding for four CCS demonstration plants.</p>

Ofgem, regulates the companies through five-year price control periods which mimic the effects of competition by curbing their expenditure and incentivising them to be efficient and to innovate technically.</p>
	<p pid="a.206W.3/2">Price controls are set for the 14 companies that run the regional electricity networks, the four companies that operate the energy transmission networks and the four companies that own the local gas distribution networks.</p>
	<p pid="a.206W.3/3">Competition does exist with regard to constructing new connections between the consumer and the local electricity network, which is an important element of work undertaken by network operators. Customers of network operators have the option to have some of the connection work, referred to as contestable work, carried out by a third party connection provider.</p>

	<p pid="a.211W.5/2">The DVLA operate a strategy of education, warning as well as direct enforcement action to help tackle non-compliant unlicensed foreign vehicles. This approach has included presentations to community leaders, articles in the media, the issue of information leaflets and warning notices placed on vehicles' windscreens.</p>

It makes clear that we do not believe that mandatory re-testing is the best way forward. We favour an approach which helps older drivers to maintain and adapt their skills, including providing advice and support on when to reduce or stop driving and change to other methods of travel to maintain mobility. The framework includes a number of examples of education schemes for older drivers provided by local authorities and the training industry. We are looking to work with the voluntary sector and the training industry to develop further training schemes for older drivers.</p>

	<p pid="a.217W.2/1">Work is under way to provide additional rolling stock on many routes around the country. Combined with the IEP, Thameslink and Crossrail projects, our plan is that 2,700 new carriages will be in service by the end of 2019. 349 additional carriages were added to the network during the coalition's first 12 months in office and progress has been made on the procurement process for carriages to be delivered under the IEP, Thameslink and Crossrail programmes.</p>
	<p pid="a.217W.2/2">The last formal rolling stock plan was prepared by the previous administration, and published in July 2008. We will be considering Sir Roy McNulty's recommendations on rolling stock but start from the position that the rail industry should be best placed to lead on rolling stock cascade proposals, with the Government's role primarily focused on ensuring that these represent value for money.</p>

	<p pid="a.217W.8/1">For rolling stock procurements led by the Department (namely the Thameslink and Intercity Express Programme procurements) bidders needed to clear compliance and deliverability assessments in order to pass the pre-qualification process. The empirical evidence of bidders' delivery in the UK and other countries was assessed in each programme's Pre-Qualification Questionnaire using a derivative of the European Foundation for Quality Management (EFQM) Business Excellence Model aligned to the Department's objectives in conjunction with the RADAR method. The accreditation process for Thameslink, with associated weightings, may be viewed on the Department's website at:</p>

	<p pid="a.217W.8/3">Following pre-qualification the bidders' responses to the Thameslink Invitation to Tender were required to include management plans demonstrating project deliverability. The RADAR methodology was also applied here. The assessment used the information submitted in the bidders' plans. The project deliverability assessment for Thameslink and associated weightings can also be seen on the Department's website.</p>

	<p pid="a.220W.6/2">The Home Office does not maintain records of police operational practice. Police forces should not make referrals of the sort suggested. Both the police and their contractors are bound by data protection legislation. When necessary the police do make arrangements for the removal of vehicles, including those involved in road traffic collisions. They contract with vehicle recovery operators for this work. The charges the police can impose on vehicle owners for such removals are set by secondary legislation and aim to meet the costs incurred. The exercise of their removal powers and the arrangements made in every case are operational matters for the police forces concerned.</p>

	<p pid="a.228W.5/3">Since January 2009, the British Crime Survey (BCS) was extended to cover victimisation of children aged 10 to 15 years. Figures from the 2009-10 and 2010-11 surveys for this age group were published on <phrase class="date" code="2011-07-14">14 July 2011</phrase>:</p>

	<p pid="a.228W.5/9">In autumn 2010 the Home Office commissioned an evaluation of schemes based in police stations that assess young people who have been arrested and can, where appropriate, divert them into other interventions and services. Additionally, the Home Office is carrying out analysis to produce estimates of how much recorded crime is attributable to young people (aged 10 to 17). Both studies will be completed later this year.</p>

	<p pid="a.228W.8/1">The proportions of adults worried about burglary, car crime and violent crime in 2009-10 and 2010-11 are at their lowest since questions on this were introduced into the British Crime Survey. Police forces, working with local partners, are responsible for tackling crime&#8212;including concerns of the local elderly population. The Government are freeing up the police from bureaucracy and red tape to do so. We have given the public the information they need about local crime through crime maps, and are introducing a national non-emergency police number (101) to enable the public to contact the police more easily. These developments, together with neighbourhood policing teams, beat meetings and, in due course, elected police and crime commissioners, will ensure all sections of the community (including the elderly) can hold their force to account.</p>

	<p pid="a.229W.0/2">The Home Office funded Age UK, working in partnership with the Neighbourhood and Home Watch Network, Victim Support, and the home improvement agency sector, to run a project to reduce the fear of crime through the delivery of a training programme, earlier this year, to empower vulnerable elderly people to take the steps they need to keep themselves safe in their home and community. Age UK estimate that their message was communicated to more than 7,500 vulnerable people, and that over 5,500 of them took actions to improve their home or personal security. It is estimated that a further 6,000 people will be reached through the work of Victim Support.</p>

	<p pid="a.229W.3/2">The Prevent strategy is concerned with the threat posed by terrorists to radicalise and recruit people to their cause, including their use of the internet for these purposes and forms one part of the Government's overarching counter-terrorism strategy&#8212;Contest.</p>
	<p pid="a.229W.3/3">The Prevent strategy aims to mitigate the threat of terrorist use of the internet by restricting access to unlawful online content in specific premises, such as schools, public libraries and other public buildings; and ensuring that action is taken to try to remove unlawful content from the internet. The legal framework for this is provided by sections 1 and 2 of the Terrorism Act 2006 (TACT).</p>
	<p pid="a.229W.3/4">The Prevent strategy also calls on the public to assist in reducing the level of terrorist content on the internet. Members of the public who encounter terrorist or extremist content online are able to anonymously refer it to the Metropolitan police's Counter Terrorism Internet Referral Unit (CTIRU). If the content breaches TACT, the CTIRU act to remove the content and where possible they mount prosecutions.</p>

	<p pid="a.235W.8/1">Information about the number of foreign nationals that the UK Border Agency is unable to remove from the UK on human rights grounds is not readily available on our electronic system and could be obtained only by reviewing individual cases. Many factors will be taken into account when consideration is given as to whether an individual should be allowed to remain in the UK, including the immigration rules, the 1951 Refugee Convention and the Human Rights Act. These often 'overlap' and are not mutually exclusive. An individual may be granted permission to stay for reasons relating to more than one of these provisions.</p>

	<p pid="a.242W.0/1">The escorting contract provides the transfer of detainees both within the UK and overseas and the management of both residential and non-residential short-term holding facilities around the country. It was held by G4S Care and Justice Services Ltd until <phrase class="date" code="2011-04-30">30 April</phrase> with the use of alternative suppliers to meet peaks in demand for the service. All Services transferred to Reliance at midnight on <phrase class="date" code="2011-04-30">30 April</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.242W.0/2">Prior to <phrase class="date" code="2011-04-30">30 April</phrase>, the UK Border Agency paid a fixed fee for most elements of the escorting contract. We do not therefore hold sufficiently detailed information which demonstrates the cost of transferring detainees between places of detention. Although the agency now pays for each individual journey undertaken, it would be at disproportionate cost to examine individual invoices to provide the information since the contract changed.</p>
	<p pid="a.242W.0/3">Around 80,000 journeys were undertaken in the year ending <phrase class="date" code="2011-04-30">30 April</phrase>. These include transferring detainees from police stations, prisons and other places of detention into immigration removal centres, taking them to ports and airports for removal, to hospitals for medical appointments, courts for appeal hearings and embassies for documentation interviews. It also includes the transfer of detainees between different immigration removal centres.</p>
	<p pid="a.242W.0/4">The UK Border Agency keeps the number of transfers to a minimum, but inevitably detainees are sometimes moved for operational reasons. These include where their behaviour requires them to be held in a more secure environment, because they are required for an interview at a particular centre, or because they are being moved close to an airport for their removal from the UK.</p>

	<p pid="a.243W.12/1">In June 2011, Home Office headquarters received centrally 744 letters from hon. and right hon. Members and noble Lords to Ministers for the Home Department to answer. This includes 62 letters received by the Government Equalities Office. (The Department receives some correspondence that is for other Departments of State to answer, which it sends on). The UK Border Agency received 3,172 letters from hon. and right hon. Members and noble Lords to Ministers, the agency chief executive and officials in June 2011. To distinguish between letters from hon. and right hon. Members, and those from noble Lords would attract a disproportionate cost.</p>

	<p pid="a.250W.0/3">Steps are being taken to encourage and provide opportunities for those wishing to become police officers to achieve part of the minimum qualification (the Diploma in Policing) prior to recruitment. Prospective students who have not been recruited as either a student police officer or as a special constable will, however, only be able to complete part of the minimum qualification as the full qualification requires the student officer to be assessed in the work place using police powers. Special constables who are volunteers have police powers and will be able to train and complete the full work based assessment.</p>

The NPIA hopes to be able to continue to provide this service; and,</p>
	<p pid="a.250W.0/8">police forces are looking at the affordability of bursaries, loans and recompense of costs to successful candidates.</p>
	<p pid="a.250W.0/9">The NPIA, working with the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) and the 43 police forces in England and Wales, has developed an equality impact assessment (EIA) for the pre join training arrangements; forces will be required to complete an EIA for their local implementation. The purpose of the EIA is to help to keep under review the impact of the arrangements on any potentially disadvantaged groups and to address any impact.</p>

Although we understand that the majority of forces currently use DASH, it is for individual forces to decide which risk assessment models to use and the training their officers and staff receive. However, ACPO continue to encourage forces to adopt DASH and HMIC inspections are carried out against DASH standards.

	<p pid="a.252W.0/3">Raed Salah was excluded from the UK on <phrase class="date" code="2011-06-23">23 June</phrase> as a result of numerous statements he had made, details of which were obtained from a variety of sources. Exclusion decisions are confidential to the individual concerned, and operationally sensitive, and it is not our practice to consult widely in making the decision or to inform others in a way which may breach that confidentiality. As is our normal practice in making these decisions, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office were consulted as part of the evidence gathering process but the Prime Minister's Office were not. The exclusion was based on an assessment of whether Mr Salah had expressed views which fell within the scope of the Government's published unacceptable behaviours policy. The Secretary of State concluded that Mr Salah had made a number of statements that were considered to be unacceptable behaviour.</p>

	<p pid="a.253W.6/1">The Protection from Harassment Act 1997 already covers cyber-stalking. The Act was always intended to tackle stalking, but was drafted so that it could also include any form of persistent conduct which causes alarm or distress. A specific &#8220;cyber-stalking&#8221; offence or reference to cyber-stalking in the existing offence is therefore not necessary. Where an offender pursues a course of conduct which amounts to harassment, and the offender knows or ought to know their conduct amounts to harassment, it does not matter whether the course of conduct was committed online or offline. As long as the elements of the offence are met, the offence can be charged.</p>

The Home Secretary is responsible for issuing warrants on the application of the Security Service and the Serious and Organised Crime Agency. In addition to the specific safeguards that apply in respect of the Warranty regime in Chapter 1, RIPA also sets out two important further sources of safeguards: a tribunal to investigate specific complaints; and an Interception of Communications Commissioner to oversee the operation of the system of interception as a whole. The only publicly available information on the number of intercept warrants issued is contained in the Commissioner's annual report. A link to the most recent report is at:</p>

	<p pid="a.255W.2/1">Organisations that promote or encourage terrorism, whether in the UK or abroad, can be proscribed under the Terrorism Act 2000. We keep the list of proscribed organisations under constant review. Where there are extremist organisations that do not meet the statutory test for proscription the Government have made clear that no funding or other forms of support will be provided.</p>
	<p pid="a.255W.2/2">The Government will also address the challenge of such extremism, and particularly extremist organisations, through other means including the Government's new approach to promoting integration, which is led by the Department for Communities and Local Government (DCLG); other parts of the criminal justice system (including through legislation regarding religious and racial hatred), debate and civil challenge.</p>
	<p pid="a.255W.2/3">Policy and programmes to deal with extremism and extremist organisations will be coordinated from DCLG. However the line between extremism and terrorism is not always precise. The relationship between terrorism and extremism is therefore complicated and directly relevant to the aim and objectives of Prevent, the part of the Government's counter-terrorism strategy that aims to stop people becoming terrorists or supporting terrorism. Prevent deals with extremism where terrorism draws on extremist ideas; and where people who are extremists are drawn towards terrorism-related activity.</p>

	<p pid="a.261W.3/1">The coalition Government have kept a very tight rein on the creation of unnecessary central Government websites. In line with the Public Accounts Committee recommendations of 2008, new sites are not approved except when necessary and with explicit permission. Since May 2010, only three new domains have been approved: a single machinery of government change (education.gov.uk), a change of name (for The Children&#8217;s Commissioner) and a temporary development site (alpha.gov.uk). The ERG marketing controls, which receive requests on behalf of the Efficiency Board, does not analyse requests for web activity separately and cannot provide the number of requests without incurring disproportionate cost. Good progress is also being made on reducing the number of central Government websites and a list is published quarterly on the Cabinet Office website.</p>

	<p pid="a.267W.5/4">The table provides the number of deaths occurring in NHS psychiatric hospitals or units in each London borough between 2006 and 2010 (the latest year available). Place of death information is provided by the informant at death registration.</p>

	<p pid="a.270W.3/1">There are no current plans to commence part 3 of the Charities Act 2006, and make the necessary supporting regulations. The future licensing and regulation of public charitable collections will be considered as part of the review of the Charities Act 2006, due to begin later this year. In the current economic climate implementation of the Charities Act 2006 licensing provisions will have to be weighed against other priorities. Effectiveness, affordability and value for money will be important factors in determining whether the new licensing regime is implemented. Whatever the outcome of the review, we want to make it easier for charities to fundraise responsibly, whilst deterring bogus collectors and preventing nuisance for members of the public. Under the Police, Factories etc. (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1916, and local street collections regulations, local licensing authorities already have the power to regulate most types of charitable street collections.</p>

	<p pid="a.283W.2/2">There is no Home Office policy to this effect. The police are empowered to remove and store any vehicle, stolen or not, that has been left illegally, dangerously or obstructively on a road, has broken down on a road, or has been abandoned. Removal is necessary to enable the police to enforce the law, remove obstructions and potential dangers, prevent any further theft or vandalism of the vehicles, their being used for crime or becoming a focus of crime or environmental degradation, or being driven while in a dangerous condition. To meet the very significant costs involved in such removals and storage nationwide, the police are empowered to charge vehicle owners prescribed fees before releasing a vehicle back to them. This includes in cases where the vehicle was stolen. The police may at their discretion waive the charges in individual cases, but if they do so the cost falls to their general budget and diverts resources from other use. Any request for charges to be waived or for reimbursement of paid charges would be a matter for the individual force concerned. When taking out an insurance policy, motorists may wish to consider whether to seek cover for the charges.</p>

	<p pid="a.295W.3/1">The Ministry of Justice does encourage the production of energy from prison waste using a range of available technologies, including anaerobic digestion (AD). For example, an AD plant is in operation at Guys Marsh prison and the resultant bio-energy used to run a generator that supplements the power supply to the prison's kitchen complex and greenhouse. Additionally, the new prison being constructed at Featherstone, Staffordshire, will also incorporate a small-scale AD plant producing energy to supplement normal provision.</p>
	<p pid="a.295W.3/2">The Prison Service has had for some time, robust waste management practices embedded within prisons' day-to-day operations with the primary objective of minimising waste. Therefore, volumes of organic waste generated are, in most cases, insufficient to warrant the considerable capital outlay required for AD plant. Where prisons are identified as having a need for a sustainable solution for organic waste disposal, locally available facilities, such as AD or sealed container composting, are considered within the mix of responsible waste disposal options. For example, the new prison being constructed at Featherstone, Staffordshire, will incorporate a small-scale AD plant producing energy to supplement normal provision.</p>

	<p pid="a.296W.6/1">The National Offender Management Service (NOMS) works closely with DWP, the Money Advice Service, Unlock, the Legal Services Commission, CAB and others to ensure that financial management skills feature in a range of courses and other interventions available to prisoners.</p>
	<p pid="a.296W.6/2">On reception into custody, prisoners, including those on remand pending sentence, are helped and encouraged to take action to ensure that their financial affairs are placed in as stable a position as possible while they remain in custody. NOMS is working with Unlock and the major retail banks to make it easier for prisoners to obtain banking facilities. At governors' discretion, offenders in custody are permitted to carry out certain financial transactions to facilitate resettlement on release.</p>

	<p pid="a.296W.9/1">It is the policy of the National Offender Management Service (NOMS) that prisoners over 18 are permitted to smoke in single cells or cells shared with smokers. This is in accordance with the Health Act 2006, which exempts prisoner cells from being smoke-free on the basis that a prisoner's cell is deemed to be their home.</p>
	<p pid="a.296W.9/2">However, NOMS recognises the potential risk to staff from exposure to environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) and has issued guidance to staff on entering cells where a prisoner is, or has been, smoking. The guidance, if properly followed, minimises the risks of exposure to ETS by allowing sufficient ventilation of the cell before staff enter.</p>
	<p pid="a.296W.9/3">NOMS continues to keep this guidance under review, as it does with all health and safety matters, to ensure that the safety and health of staff is maintained and improved wherever possible.</p>

	<p pid="a.300W.2/1">The following tables show the numbers of claims leading to orders being made for the repossession of property in each ward in Dartford constituency by mortgage lenders in each year since 2000 and landlords in each year since 2003. Data for previous years are not available due to the lack of valid postcodes.</p>
	<p pid="a.300W.2/2">These figures represent the numbers of claims leading to orders being made. This is more accurate than the number of orders, removing the double-counting of instances where a single claim leads to more than one order. It is also a more meaningful measure of the number of homeowners who are subject to court repossession actions.</p>
	<p pid="a.300W.2/3">These figures do not indicate how many properties have actually been repossessed. Repossessions can occur without a court order, such as where borrowers hand the keys back to the lender. Also, not all possession orders result in repossession. Many orders are suspended and if the borrower complies with the repayment arrangements set out in the suspended order the property will not be repossessed.</p>

	<p pid="a.304W.6/1">Legislation in the Apprenticeships, Skills, Children and Learning Act 2009 made local authorities responsible for securing suitable education and training for young people aged 10-17 in custody. This came into effect on <phrase class="date" code="2010-09-01">1 September 2010</phrase>. The Act also contains duties on &#8220;home&#8221; local authorities to &#8220;take such steps as they consider appropriate to promote the person's fulfilment of his or her learning potential&#8221; while they are in custody, and to share information about the young person's education and any special educational needs they may have.</p>
	<p pid="a.304W.6/2">The delivery of youth justice in the community is devolved to local authority youth offending teams. A statutory function of the Youth Justice Board (YJB) is to identify, make known and promote effective practice in youth justice. To this end the YJB published updated key elements of effective practice documents in 2008. These include the following themes: accommodation, planning, interventions and supervision, education, training and employment. Youth justice services are encouraged to make use of these documents in the design and delivery of their interventions.</p>
	<p pid="a.304W.6/3">Learning and skills for prisoners aged over 18 is jointly commissioned by the Skills Funding Agency and the National Offender Management Service&#8212;this includes social and life skills courses within the public sector secure estate in England for young offenders aged 18 to 20 years of age. The range of accredited courses offered is based upon assessed individual learning need. Some of the courses on offer include Preparation for Work; Assertiveness and Decision Making; Family Relationships; Budgeting and Money Management and Personal Development.</p>

You will be aware that the Secretary of State has asked Ofqual to respond to this question.</p>
	<p pid="a.307W.0/4">I can confirm that Ofqual and the regulators in Wales and Northern Ireland jointly publish the GCSE, GCE, Principal Learning and Project Code of Practice (all of these are available on Ofqual's website for download). The Code states that:</p>
	<p pid="a.307W.0/5">1.11 The scrutineer is responsible for:</p>
	<p pid="a.307W.0/6">i. checking the final drafts of all question papers/tasks without reference to the mark schemes to ensure that the questions can be answered in the time allowed and that there are no errors and omissions;</p>

	<p pid="a.307W.0/8">iii. checking the mark scheme to ensure that the marks given are identical to those on the question paper;</p>
	<p pid="a.307W.0/9">iv. preparing a report for the awarding organisation officer.</p>
	<p pid="a.307W.0/10">Awarding organisations are responsible for following this Code of Practice. As part of Ofqual's regular monitoring work, various aspects of the Code are checked on the basis of risk, bearing in mind the need for our monitoring work to be proportionate.</p>
	<p pid="a.307W.0/11">Should awarding organisations not follow the Code of Practice, appropriate action in line with our legislative powers is put into place. This could include removal of awarding organisation status or removal of accreditation for the particular qualification. Any action taken is based on evidence and is particular to the issue being considered.</p>
	<p pid="a.307W.0/12">As you will also be aware, Ofqual have been alerted to concerns about examination errors in advance of and during the live examinations this summer. As a result of our concern regarding awarding organisation compliance to the Code of Practice, you will be aware that we have launched our Inquiry into examination errors and we have already invited you to submit evidence to the Inquiry if you wish. The Inquiry will take into account information and views we have already received from sources including candidates, schools and colleges, parents and student representatives and will also be gathering information from a list of interested and concerned stakeholders such as yourself.</p>
	<p pid="a.307W.0/13">It is intended that we will complete the Inquiry and publish our report by the end of the year.</p>

	<p pid="a.307W.3/1">Ofsted&#8217;s most recent inspection report on personal, social, health and economic (PSHE) education, published in July 2010, was based on visits to 165 schools between September 2006 and July 2009. Ofsted found that the economic well-being and financial capability strand (introduced in September 2008) was still in its early stages and that achievement in this area was less strong than in other areas of PSHE. However, they also found that students in schools that were successfully delivering personal finance education showed a good understanding of personal finance, used financial terms correctly and were able to apply their knowledge in making financial decisions.</p>

	<p pid="a.308W.2/1">The Government provide considerable support to safeguard children from the risk of forced marriage, which is a serious form of child abuse. The joint Home Office/Foreign and Commonwealth Office Forced Marriage Unit (FMU), which was launched in January 2005, provides advice to teachers in schools. The FMU produced statutory guidance on forced marriage in 2008 (revised 2010); revised multi-agency practice guidelines on handling cases of forced marriage in 2009; and supplementary guidelines on handling cases of forced marriage involving persons with learning disabilities in 2010. In addition to these guidance documents which are targeted at frontline practitioners and volunteers, the FMU provide a helpline to support victims and potential victims of forced marriage.</p>
	<p pid="a.308W.2/2">The Government firmly believe that schools are best placed to assess which materials or strategies might be useful to help children who may be vulnerable to forced marriage. All schools have clear responsibilities to safeguard and promote the welfare of their pupils. The inter-agency guidance, &#8220;Working Together to Safeguard Children (2010)&#8221; and guidance to schools and FE colleges, &#8220;Safeguarding Children and Safer Recruitment in Education (2006)&#8221; set out how organisations and individuals should work together to safeguard and promote the welfare of children and young people.</p>

	<p pid="a.308W.5/1">It is not possible to provide automatic entitlement to free school meals (FSM) for eligible pupils. Until a request for FSM is made, a school or local authority would not know which pupils were from households receiving an eligible benefit, and are therefore entitled to FSM.</p>
	<p pid="a.308W.5/2">As set out in legislation, eligibility for FSM is reliant on two things: (1) the parent (or child) being in receipt of one of the eligible benefits; and (2) a request for FSM being made by the parent or child.</p>
	<p pid="a.308W.5/3">Without the provision of personal information, either paper proof of receipt of benefits or personal information to enable a check to be made using the Online Free School Meal Eligibility Checking Service (ECS), there would be no way to identify eligible pupils.</p>

	<p pid="a.309W.2/2">The Department has streamlined the process for applying for free school meals by developing an online eligibility checking system (ECS). This allows local authorities to quickly check data held by other Government Departments (DWP, HMRC and the Home Office) to establish a family's eligibility for free school meals. We are working with local authorities to increase the use of this resource which, as well as reducing bureaucracy and cost for local authorities, is also encouraging more parents to sign up their children for a free school lunch. For those authorities that choose to use it, the ECS has a service which allows parents to check their own eligibility and to apply on line for FSM.</p>
	<p pid="a.309W.2/3">The Government have also commissioned the School Food Trust to carry out further work to improve the take-up of healthy school food, and specifically to increase take-up of free school meals to ensure children from the most deprived families receive at least one good meal a day.</p>
	<p pid="a.309W.2/4">The trust will also continue its ongoing work to provide advice, support and resources to help schools and local authorities increase free school meal registration and take-up. In particular, the trust's free school meal support project will provide support and resources to schools in deprived areas to help increase free school meal registration and take-up. The project will initially target those schools with a significant gap between free school eligibility and take-up, working with them to improve registration; for example, by increasing online free school meal applications.</p>

	<p pid="a.312W.0/1">The Government provide considerable support to assist schools in identifying and supporting pupils at risk of abuse. All schools have clear responsibilities to safeguard and promote the welfare of their pupils. The Government believe that schools are best placed to assess which materials or strategies might be useful to help their pupils, who may be vulnerable to particular types of harm.</p>
	<p pid="a.312W.0/2">The Department for Education works closely with the Home Office, Department of Health and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office on these issues. Together we have produced a number of multi-agency guidelines for a broad range of practitioners to help them when working with young people who are affected by these forms of abuse, whether or not they are in formal education. The Government have also committed to developing an action plan to tackle child sexual exploitation to be published in the autumn.</p>
	<p pid="a.312W.0/3">In addition, the inter-agency guidance, &#8220;Working Together to Safeguard Children (2010)&#8221; and guidance to schools and FE colleges, &#8220;Safeguarding Children and Safer Recruitment in Education (2006)&#8221; set out how organisations and individuals should work together to safeguard and promote the welfare of children and young people. These documents act as signposts to other guidance about specific forms of abuse.</p>

We have also said that, in addition to access to the student support system, not-for- profit institutions will be able to access grants from the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE), to fund additional costs and public policy priorities, such as those associated with high cost or specialist provision, which cannot be met by graduate contributions alone.</p>

	<p pid="a.332W.5/1">The National Minimum Wage (NMW) sets a statutory minimum hourly rate, below which a worker must not be paid and it is illegal to recruit workers below this level. HM Revenue and Customs investigate all complaints made to them about underpayment of the NMW, in addition to conducting targeted enforcement campaigns in particular sectors based on risk assessment of underpayment. Anyone who believes that they are being underpaid should contact the Pay and Work Rights Helpline. The Low Pay Commission (LPC) undertakes analysis each year into low-paying sectors and this informs their recommendations as to the level of the NMW. Their assessment is published in the LPC annual report.</p>

	<p pid="a.332W.8/1">The Government supports the National Minimum Wage (NMW) because of the protection it gives low income workers and the incentives to work it provides. HM Revenue and Customs investigate all complaints made to them and have also recently conducted targeted enforcement in the hotel cleaning and hospitality sectors. As part of the wider employment law review, a review of workplace rights enforcement and compliance is currently being undertaken. The review will consider NMW enforcement, together with other Government enforced workplace rights, to establish what scope there is to streamline them and make them more effective.</p>

The broader licensing and enforcement framework is set out in the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988. The collecting society functions of PRS, PPL, and other collecting societies are not specifically regulated by the Government at present. However, the Government have recently accepted a recommendation made by Professor Ian Hargreaves, in his independent review of Intellectual Property and Growth, that collecting societies be regulated through codes of conduct that enshrine minimum standards of fairness and transparency and which govern their relations with licensees. The Government will consult on the implementation of this recommendation later this year.</p>

In the absence of an appeal or the grant of permission to appeal out of time, the decision became final as regards each of the addressees on the expiry of this time limit. Given the time elapsed between the OFT decision in September 2009 and the recent Competition Appeal Tribunal judgment, the OFT does not propose to review the decision in respect of any addressee of the decision who chose not to appeal.</p>

It will result in the Agency reducing from 1,896 staff to below 1,264 staff and from 20 to 13 offices. The one-off cost is estimated at &#163;48 million. This cost will generate an estimated &#163;20 million savings in the 2011-12 financial year, followed by an expected annual saving by the end of the spending review period of &#163;41 million (i.e. - a reduction of 33% of the baseline budget).</p>

	<p pid="a.350W.6/1">Each member of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) is assigned a quota allocation that broadly reflects its relative size in the global economy based on a formula. The UK's current quota share is SDR 10,739 million (&#163;10,581 million based on the sterling-SDR exchange rate on the <phrase class="date" code="2011-03-31">31 March 2011</phrase>), which represents a 4.52% share.</p>
	<p pid="a.350W.6/2">This represents the potential amount of financing from the UK that the IMF could call on via quota subscription, not an upfront financing commitment.</p>
	<p pid="a.350W.6/3">In December-2010 the IMF's Governors approved an increase in the total quota by 100% from approximately SDR 238.4 billion to approximately SDR 476.8 billion, following an agreement by world leaders at the Seoul G-20 summit. These reforms will enable the fund to meet its resource needs over the medium term, preserve the IMF's status as a quota-based institution and deliver greater quota representation to the dynamic emerging and developing countries.</p>
	<p pid="a.350W.6/4">The UK's total quota share will increase by SDR 9,417 million (&#163;9,278 million) to SDR 20,155 million (&#163;19,858 million).</p>
	<p pid="a.350W.6/5">The values of all individual member countries' current shareholdings and the forthcoming shifts as a result of the 2010 reforms are available at on the IMF's website at:</p>
	<p pid="a.350W.6/6"><a href="http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/memdir/members.aspx">http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/memdir/members.aspx</a></p>
	<p pid="a.350W.6/7">The increase in the UK's subscription to the IMF will only be implemented once the overall quota increase has been approved by member countries accounting for 70% of total quotas (as of November 5, 2010) and once member countries accounting for 85% of the existing quota share have ratified the other amendments to the Articles of Agreement on the reform of the IMF's Executive Board which were also agreed in November 2010. Consistent with the UK's legislative guidelines, the Government have taken steps to domestically ratify this commitment by laying legislation in Parliament on the <phrase class="date" code="2011-06-13">13 June 2011</phrase>. This process is also being undertaken by other IMF member countries. The G-20 countries have committed to completing the reforms by the Annual Meetings in October 2012.</p>
	<p pid="a.350W.6/8">All UK loans to the IMF are financed from the UK's Official Reserves. They remain UK assets and therefore do not count as public spending, and do not contribute to public sector net debt.</p>
	<p pid="a.350W.6/9">The 2011 Budget provided an additional &#163;6 billion of sterling financing to purchase reserve assets. This will ensure the level of foreign currency reserves held is sufficient whilst meeting potential calls from the International Monetary Fund. Once the quota reforms are completed, members are initially required to deposit 25% of their quota at the fund in reserve assets. Aside from this, the amount of financing that the UK provides to the IMF will depend on the number, size and timing of IMF lending programmes and also, at a technical level, on exactly how the IMF chooses to manage the financing of these programmes.</p>
	<p pid="a.350W.6/10">The UK has had a long standing bilateral agreement with France to equalise their shares in the IMF. This has been mutually beneficial, and the UK and France have worked closely together to secure a number of policy objectives, for example reforming the IMF's role in low income countries.</p>

Full details of financial support provided to UK banks are published by HM Treasury on a financial year basis in the HM Treasury Resource and Accounts. Some of these interventions took the form of loans. This included the Credit Guarantee Scheme (CGS), the Special Liquidity Scheme (SLS) (operated by the Bank of England), the transfer to public ownership of Northern Rock and Bradford &amp; Bingley and loans to the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS) which allowed the transfer of deposits or pay out of compensation to depositors in the five banks that went into default in the autumn of 2008.</p>
	<p pid="a.353W.8/3">The overall amount of wholesale lending guaranteed under the CGS peaked at just under &#163;140 billion in May 2009. The most recent published outstanding figure was &#163;115 billion as of December 2010. HM Treasury does not report on individual usage of the scheme.</p>
	<p pid="a.353W.8/4">The Bank of England reported that exposure through the SLS peaked at &#163;185 billion when the SLS drawdown window came to an end in January 2009. As at December 2010 the outstanding exposure was &#163;110 billion following repayments totalling &#163;75 billion.</p>
	<p pid="a.353W.8/5">At <phrase class="date" code="2010-03-31">31 March 2010</phrase> Northern Rock (Asset Management) had repaid &#163;248 million, the outstanding loan balance stood at &#163;23.0 billion.</p>
	<p pid="a.353W.8/6">HM Treasury made loans to the FSCS and as part of the HM Treasury top-up to fund the transfer of deposits or compensation payments to depositors in the five banks that went into default in autumn 2008.</p>
	<p pid="a.353W.8/7">At <phrase class="date" code="2010-03-31">31 March 2010</phrase> &#163;1.2 billion had been repaid through the administration of Kaupthing, Singer &amp; Friedlander (KSF). The outstanding loan balance in respect of KSF was &#163;163 million under the HM Treasury liability and &#163;1.8 billion under the FSCS liability. At <phrase class="date" code="2010-03-31">31 March 2010</phrase> &#163;194 million had been repaid through the administration of Heritable. The outstanding loan balance in respect of Heritable was &#163;40.5 million under the HM Treasury liability and &#163;307.4 million in respect of the FSCS liability.</p>
	<p pid="a.353W.8/8">Further detail on the loans and other Government interventions can be found in the HM Treasury Resource Accounts 2009-10 available on the HM Treasury website. HM Treasury Resource Accounts for 2010-11 will be published in due course.</p>

	<p pid="a.354W.2/1">The interim report of the Independent Public Service Pensions Commission (IPSPC) estimated that of the 19 million private sector employees, there are 2.6 million active members of private sector defined benefit schemes, 1 million members of defined contribution pension schemes and 3 million individuals who are covered by employer sponsored group personal pensions or stakeholder pensions. Chart 1F of the interim report shows that around two thirds of private sector employees, or around 12 million individuals, have no employer sponsored pension provision.</p>
	<p pid="a.354W.2/2">The IPSPC estimate that the average employer contribution to an open defined benefit scheme in the private sector is 14.9% of pay and the average employer contribution to an open defined contribution scheme in the private is 6.4% of pay.</p>
	<p pid="a.354W.2/3">Employers are not currently required to contribute to group personal pensions or stakeholder pension schemes, though many choose to do so. HM Treasury does not hold information on average contribution rates to these schemes. From October 2012 employers will have a new duty to automatically enrol qualifying employees into a workplace pension scheme, and to make mandatory contributions.</p>
	<p pid="a.354W.2/4">There are 5.4 million active members in defined benefit public service pension schemes and the average employer contribution rate to these schemes is just over 15% of pay. Employer contribution levels vary from scheme to scheme and further details of contribution levels are available in Table 3.G in the final report of the Independent Public Service Pensions Commission.</p>

The board is accountable for developing and approving HMRC's overall strategy and final business plans and also performs an assurance role and advises on best practice. HMRC has not set a requirement as to how many of the board should be tax professionally trained as the entire board is supported by tax professionals operating at all levels in the organisation.</p>

However, cost-effective civil settlement procedures are used in the majority of tax avoidance and evasion cases. This represents excellent value for the Exchequer, as all undeclared tax is repaid and defaulters also pay a penalty, which can be up to 100% of the tax evaded, plus interest on the undeclared tax. Every year we collect millions of pounds of evaded tax using these well-established methods.</p>
