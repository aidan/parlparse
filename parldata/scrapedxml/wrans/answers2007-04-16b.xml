	<p pid="b.6W.12/1">Responsibility for this legislation rests with the Home Office. Powers under section 178 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003 to enable the review of a community order have been in operation for almost a year, as a pilot at the Community Justice initiatives in North Liverpool and Salford. We are now assessing their impact, with a view to extending their use to the new community justice courts announced by the Lord Chancellor on <phrase class="date" code="">27 November</phrase>, including Nottingham. This extension will give us further information about the operation of the powers and their impact on offender behaviour, as well as the resources required by the courts and Probation Service. My officials are therefore working with Home Office officials to ensure the affirmative resolution order to extend the powers is taken forward as soon as this assessment is complete.</p>
	<p pid="b.6W.12/2">Section 178 is one element only of the community justice concept however, and the community court in Nottingham will be able to begin operation, just as Liverpool and Salford did, prior to receiving these powers.</p>

A small number of practitioners have recently informed the LSC that they do not intend to continue doing legal aid work. This is not unusual, as the number of providers in the market has always fluctuated. There will be no effect on the provision of service to clients in any area. These few solicitors have made this assertion without sight of either the proposed new fee levels (crime and family), or the structure of the process for competitive tendering (crime), both of which the LSC are due to consult on shortly.</p>

Commencement of the delivery of these facilities is scheduled for early 2012.</p>
	<p pid="b.22W.6/3">There will also be some earlier work to provide for test events in 2011.</p>

These include co-operation projects such as town twinning, structural support for civil society organisations of general European interest and the preservation of the main sites and archives associated with the deportations and the commemoration of the victims of Nazism and Stalinism. The judging of eligible projects will be carried out by independent assessors from member states co-ordinated in Brussels by the Commission.

	<p pid="b.38W.5/2">Through our high commission in Abuja we are actively supporting projects to address religious tensions in northern Nigeria, as part of our efforts to prevent conflict and promote human rights in Nigeria as a whole. This includes the funding of training for police and magistrates in the humane application of Sharia law, and the work of non-governmental organisations to establish local early warning and conflict prevention mechanisms. Federal authorities and Government agencies, such as the Nigerian Police Force, are involved in these activities where appropriate, as are state Governments and senior religious leaders.</p>

	<p pid="b.39W.8/1">We continue to be concerned about extra-judicial killings in the Philippines. We have urged the Philippine Government to address the problem, including through the appropriate involvement of the international community. In this regard, we welcomed the visit by Philip Alston, the UN special rapporteur on extra-judicial killings, to the Philippines in February and will encourage the Philippine Government to follow Professor Alston's recommendations. In August 2006, President Arroyo appointed a special commission to investigate the killings. The Melo Commission, headed by ex-Supreme Court Justice Jose Melo, concluded its investigations and produced a report of its findings in February. President Arroyo recently extended the tenure of the Melo Commission until June 2007, after which the Philippine Commission on Human Rights will investigate the issue further. President Arroyo has made a request to the EU to provide technical assistance for the investigation of extra-judicial killings. We will look at this positively. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office has received letters from members of the public and hon. Members, as well as some parliamentary questions, about extra-judicial killings. On <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-21">21 March</phrase>, the UK raised the issue at a European Council working group meeting for Oceania and Asia affairs.</p>

	<p pid="b.45W.2/1">We are very concerned about humanitarian conditions throughout Somalia. Although food security appears to have improved compared to 2006, the current high risk of conflict may generate widespread additional humanitarian needs. According to the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, up to 100,000 more people may have been displaced since early February.</p>
	<p pid="b.45W.2/2">According to UN agencies, humanitarian conditions in the refugee camps are difficult, with ongoing high levels of child malnutrition. The Kenyan authorities have gone to great lengths in offering shelter to the 174,000 Somalis currently believed to be in camps, and they have legitimate security concerns about the influx of large numbers of Somalis. However, we remain concerned that, since the beginning of the year, they have denied entry to the camps to some Somalis genuinely seeking to flee from conflict. Our high commissioner in Nairobi raised the issue of the border closure with the Kenyan Minister of Foreign Affairs in early January. And the UK has supported a similar approach by the EU presidency. The UK participated in a US-hosted senior level donor round table in late January about the humanitarian impact of the closure of the border with Somalia and we have ongoing discussions with the USAID Office for Disaster Assistance and the USAID Office of Food for Peace about remedial action.</p>
	<p pid="b.45W.2/3">The UK was the second largest bilateral humanitarian donor to Somalia in 2006 and committed &pound;16 million towards emergency relief activities through the UN and non-governmental organisation partners.</p>

	<p pid="b.51W.6/1">There are no immediate plans by the Secretary of State to visit Higham Ferrers. The A45 is categorised as a regional route. The East Midlands region advised in January 2006 that, within their indicative regional funding allocation, a potential grade-separation scheme was not a priority for funding in the period up to 2015/16. It will be for the region to review the priority for such a scheme in future rounds of the regional funding process.</p>
	<p pid="b.51W.6/2">In the meantime, the Highways Agency will undertake a junction capacity review of Chowns Mill junction in 2007/2008. This review will investigate what interim measures can be introduced, short of a grade separation, to alleviate the current operational problems at the Chowns Mill Interchange.</p>

This goes beyond the protection given by the national minimum wage arrangements. Given the fragmented and isolated nature of the agricultural workforce, the strong links between home and job, and the need to protect migrant and seasonal workers from exploitation, the Government decided to retain the agricultural minimum wage when the national minimum wage was introduced in 1999.

In addition, hempseed oil is used in food, cosmetics and various industrial applications. As a result, there is little interest in this country at present in growing it for biofuel production.</p>

	<p pid="b.64W.0/1">Routine cattle herd testing for bovine tuberculosis (bTB) in Great Britain, uses the single intradermal comparative cervical tuberculin (SICCT) test (commonly known as the &quot;skin test&quot;).</p>
	<p pid="b.64W.0/2">Research shows that when the skin test is applied to cattle in bTB-free herds in Great Britain, there is a less than one in 1,000 chance that a non-infected animal will be wrongly classified as a reactor. This is known as the test's false positive rate. An alternative way of defining this is to say that the skin test has a specificity in excess of 99.9 per cent. Although the probability of getting at least one false positive result increases with the size of the herd being tested, it would be extremely rare to find more than one false positive in a herd.</p>
	<p pid="b.64W.0/3">When considering the false positive issue it is important to bear in mind that failure to confirm the disease by post-mortem examination at the slaughterhouse, or by culturing the causative bacterium in the laboratory, does not mean that the animal was not infected with bTB. In the early stages of this infectious disease, it is not always possible to see lesions with the naked eye and, due to the fastidious nature of the organism, it is not possible to culture it from tissue samples in every case. Because of this it is not possible to give a meaningful figure for the number of false positive test results.</p>
	<p pid="b.64W.0/4">Statistics on cattle slaughtered under bTB control measures are not collected on a constituency basis, but at county level. The following table shows the number of cattle slaughtered under TB control measures in Cheshire in the last five years:</p>

	<p pid="b.65W.5/1">TB in dogs is already notifiable. The Tuberculosis (England) Order 2006, introduced a duty to report suspected TB in the carcase of any farmed or pet mammal to the Divisional Veterinary Manager of Animal Health (previously the State Veterinary Service). The Order also made it compulsory to notify the Veterinary Laboratories Agency (VLA) if <i> Mycobacterium bovis</i> (<i> M. bovis</i>) is identified by laboratory examination of samples taken from any mammal (other than a human).</p>
	<p pid="b.65W.5/2">Although TB can affect dogs, the apparent incidence is very low. Until 2006, the VLA typically processed fewer than five samples from dogs each year. Since enactment of the new TB Order in March last year, the number of canine submissions to the VLA has increased and tissue samples from 20 dogs were processed in 2006. Only four cases of confirmed infection of canine TB caused by <i> M. bovis</i> have been recorded by the VLA between 1993 and 2004. There have been no confirmed cases since 2004.</p>
	<p pid="b.65W.5/3">The consensus of veterinary opinion is that dogs are a spill-over host for <i> M. bovis</i> and not an epidemiologically significant source of infection for cattle or other species. Therefore, no research has been conducted in this area.</p>

	<p pid="b.66W.6/3">The most recent estimates of UK emissions of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) in the UK conclude that emissions have been decreasing since 1995. For example, emissions of CFC-11 dropped from 2.3 kilotonnes per year in 1995 to 0.6 kilotonnes per year. Similarly, emissions of CFC-12 and CFC-113 have dropped from 3.6 and 1.1 kilotonnes per year in 1995 to 0.5 and 0.2 kilotonnes per year in 2006, respectively.</p>
	<p pid="b.66W.6/4">This is consistent with global trends of emissions of CFCs following the ban in the developed world on production and consumption of CFCs under the Montreal Protocol since 1996, apart from exempt specialised uses agreed by the Parties.</p>
	<p pid="b.66W.6/5">Estimates of UK CFC emissions by source are not available. The most significant source of emissions is likely to be from historic disposal to landfill sites of equipment containing CFCs.</p>
	<p pid="b.66W.6/6">The main source from remaining specialised uses is likely to be from asthma inhalers that use CFCs. In 2006, 59 tonnes of new CFCs were allocated to the UK for production of asthma inhalers.</p>
	<p pid="b.66W.6/7">DEFRA has established continuous observations of CFCs (and other trace gases) at the Mace Head Atmospheric Research Station on the Atlantic Ocean coastline of Ireland. The Met Office uses the observations to estimate the magnitude and spatial distribution of the European emissions. Detailed information on CFC emissions can be found in Manning et al (2003), Journal of Geophysical Research 108, 4405.</p>

	<p pid="b.67W.2/2">The Stern Review suggests that taking action to mitigate climate change&mdash;by aiming for a stabilisation goal of around 550 parts per million of carbon dioxide equivalent or lower&mdash;will cost a total of 1 per cent. of GDP across the world by 2050. However, Stern does not recommend that this estimated 1 per cent. of GDP should come from Government expenditure; nor does he suggest that every country should directly spend 1 per cent. of their GDP on measures to combat climate change&mdash;some countries will have higher costs than others.</p>
	<p pid="b.67W.2/3">Stern's estimate reflects the likely costs under a timely, flexible, global policy, employing a variety of economic instruments to control emissions of a broad range of greenhouse gases. Stern advocates action on three fronts:</p>
	<p pid="b.67W.2/4" class="indent">1. To create a global price for carbon;</p>
	<p pid="b.67W.2/5" class="indent">2. To provide finance for technology research, development and deployment; and</p>
	<p pid="b.67W.2/6" class="indent">3. To take action to change behaviour&mdash;including encouraging energy efficiency and reduced deforestation, where there are many cheap abatement opportunities, some that even save money.</p>
	<p pid="b.67W.2/7">Therefore Stern recommends action by Government to ensure that the private sector faces clear long-term price signals and incentives to ensure low-carbon economies, for example by establishing cap and trade schemes, as well as some level of Government expenditure to bring forward low-carbon technology and tackle market failures. Using only Government expenditure as the sole means of delivering reductions in emissions is likely to impose greater burdens on economies than the alternatives, and if the signals are not clear enough, or we delay action, the costs could be significantly higher.</p>

	<p pid="b.68W.3/1">Since the 1990s DEFRA and its predecessors have encouraged coastal defence authorities to produce shoreline management plans (SMPs) that provide a framework for long term strategic planning at the coast, taking account of climate change and other factors. These SMPs are developed on a coastal cell basis which is appropriate for the regional planning scale.</p>
	<p pid="b.68W.3/2">The first round of plans for the whole coast of England was completed in 1999 and a major programme of review is currently being implemented for completion by 2010. This review will fully incorporate lessons learnt from the first round plans and three pilot second round plans that have been undertaken to test and develop DEFRA's revised guidance to the authorities. In addition, first round plans have pointed to the need for a number of more detailed strategy studies that have been progressed in many areas.</p>
	<p pid="b.68W.3/3">There is no separate funding allocation for SMPs and these plans and strategic studies are being funded from DEFRA's overall flood and coastal erosion risk management budget. However, priority has been given to such studies in the allocation of limited funds available for new projects in 2007-08 to provide a sound basis for future programmes of improvement works.</p>
	<p pid="b.68W.3/4">SMPs are key documents to ensure consideration of coastal management issues in regional spatial strategies and future river basin district management plans being produced under the Water Framework Directive.</p>

These are aimed at enhancing their efficiency, improving the quality of their advice and enabling interested parties in the UK to participate effectively in the RACs.

Therefore, at any given time, a considerable number of our policy experts will be engaged in different kinds of EU negotiations, ranging from ad hoc informal groups through to high-level formal negotiations.</p>

	<p pid="b.72W.2/1">DEFRA's policy is that significant emails (i.e. those containing information about DEFRA decisions or actions which should form part of the official record) are printed for file or saved and stored corporately in accordance with departmental record management procedures that also apply to paper information. DEFRA's guidance on email management emphasises the importance of capturing all significant email messages but staff are encouraged to delete other emails, such as those relating to meeting arrangements and routine messages, as soon as possible. Deleted emails are recoverable for nine weeks after deletion.</p>
	<p pid="b.72W.2/2">DEFRA's main Agencies/NDPBs follow broadly similar policies though the Environment Agency has implemented a system to delete any email which has not been saved after 180 days and the period during which backups are retained vary between organisations.</p>

	<p pid="b.73W.2/1">I am only able to report on changes which have been made since the formation of my Department in 2001. The non-departmental public bodies which have incurred expenditure through name change and re-branding over this period were Natural England and the Environment Agency and the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew.</p>
	<p pid="b.73W.2/2">Natural England was established in October 2006 when it took over the functions, staff and assets of English Nature; the landscape access and recreation division of the Countryside Agency; and part of the Rural Delivery Service. Natural England does not have information available about changes of name or branding within their legacy bodies prior to that time. The re-branding by Natural England has cost the Exchequer &pound;385,000 for brand materials, website changes, new signs, stationery, publications and launch events.</p>
	<p pid="b.73W.2/3">In 2004, the Environment Agency reviewed its approach to communications and its brand. The work involving research, development, testing and launch was carried out by a mix of in-house teams, brand consultants and a design firm. Costs up to the launch of the re-brand were &pound;120,000. However, it was agreed that communications materials were only replaced when existing stocks became exhausted or when a contract was due for renewal. No additional money&mdash;other than for a short guide to the brand for Environment Agency staff&mdash;has been spent &quot;launching the brand&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.73W.2/4">During 2003 the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew introduced changes to its branding and public face at a one-off cost of &pound;80,000; this exercise did not involve a change of name.</p>
	<p pid="b.73W.2/5">None of the other non-departmental public bodies for which my Department has responsibility have undergone re-naming or re-branding.</p>

	<p pid="b.74W.6/1">The Veterinary Laboratories Agency's (VLA) budget for 2007-08 has remained static. The only area this is likely to impact on is research and it is more likely that it will result in delays in commencing work rather than work actually being cut.</p>
	<p pid="b.74W.6/2">The State Veterinary Service (SVS) 2007-08 budget has been reviewed to reflect Defra's wider business needs and also to reflect changes in the SVS's business needs. The budget changes have been reviewed for their impact on the SVS's capacity and capability to deliver, ensuring that disease risks are not increased. In particular, the changes to the SVS budget will not affect safety or the efficacy of investigative work. The SVS does not undertake research.</p>
	<p pid="b.74W.6/3">The Meat and Livestock Commission (MLC) expenditure is not a matter for my Department. We pay the MLC to carry out certain functions and cuts are planned in some of these work areas. These are not related to the MLC's safety, research or investigative work.</p>
	<p pid="b.74W.6/4">With regards to the Pesticides Safety Directorate, the savings were focused on lower priority activities and were achieved by improving efficiency and also reducing support service costs. The primary aim throughout has been to protect key services and ensure they continue to be delivered to appropriate standards. The savings put in place will, therefore, have no impact on pesticides safety which is the Directorate's top priority. Some research projects, particularly on the behaviour of pesticides in the environment, will have to be postponed. There should be no significant impact on investigative and surveillance work, particularly since efficiency gains from new technology have allowed the number of samples tested within the key pesticide residues surveillance programme to be maintained at lower costs.</p>

	<p pid="b.77W.2/148">WRAP estimate that there are around 140 LAs operating an AWC service, which represents about 40 per cent. of collection authorities. Around one third of all households receive an AWC service and this number is set to increase as schemes are rolled out borough-wide.</p>

	<p pid="b.80W.2/1">It is for each local authority (LA) to decide whether to implement alternate weekly collection, or any other waste management system. However, my Department has funded research and guidance to assist LAs in carrying out their operations in the most efficient and effective manner. This will ensure that such changes in collections do not impact negatively on residents.</p>
	<p pid="b.80W.2/2">Guidance published by the Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP) in 2005 sets out the process councils need to go through if they are considering the introduction of an alternate week collection service. The guidance is based on the experiences of LAs that have already implemented such schemes. WRAP is currently revising its guidance to take account of the latest research, including recent householder and LA experiences. Suitability of an alternate weekly collection service often depends on local geography and housing stock. The guidance also emphasises that a key part of any successful change is following full consultation with local residents.</p>
	<p pid="b.80W.2/3">My Department has made some assumptions about the costs of alternate weekly collections in our modelling] for the review of England's Waste Strategy. Those assumptions were based on collection cost estimates from WRAP's Kerbside Analysis Tool model and five consultants as part of a preliminary benchmarking project run by Be-Environmental and let by WRAP. A more complete study will follow later this year.</p>
	<p pid="b.80W.2/4">WRAP has not carried out a general assessment of cost savings associated with alternate weekly collection. The work that has been done has looked at particular LAs and how alternate weekly collection has been implemented in these cases. The general work that WRAP has been undertaking for Defra looks at different types of alternate weekly collection design and how this impacts on recycling performance and total quantities of household waste collected.</p>
	<p pid="b.80W.2/5">Alternate weekly collection covers a number of important design decisions in relation to residual household waste, recycling and composting collections and only one component of this is whether or not to collect household residual waste on alternate weeks. There are many systems where only elements of recycling and composting alternate with one another and the refuse is still collected on a weekly basis.</p>
	<p pid="b.80W.2/6">WRAP has carried out regular public! attitude surveys since 2004 that have included ratings of how convenient the public find different LA collection systems to use. Only a minority of alternate weekly collection systems received poor convenience ratings and these related to systems where insufficient capacity has been provided to householders in the week that alternated with refuse collection.</p>

If a group of authorities opted to pass waste collection responsibilities to a JWA, then the constituent authorities would no longer have a role in waste collection. The JWA would be responsible for making decisions such as whether to introduce alternate weekly collection. The JWA would be governed by elected members from the constituent local authorities. If a group of authorities chose to pass only waste disposal functions to the. JWA, and to retain waste collection responsibilities themselves, the JWA would not be able to make any decisions about alternate weekly collection.</p>

	<p pid="b.84W.2/1">According to earliest available records (pre-1850), species such as grayling, roach, dace, chub, gudgeon, barbel, common bream, eel and perch are native to the River Don. We have utilised these records, together with the topography of the river, throughout our stocking programmes to stock species appropriate to the location. Fishery surveys were also undertaken after the recent pollution incident, land the data compared to that from previous surveys to help evaluate suitable species for stocking. Stocking needs for 2007-08 will be based upon future monitoring to ensure it meets the demands of the river following this incident.</p>
	<p pid="b.84W.2/2">Stocking is a useful fisheries management tool for developing and recovering rivers, but only one part of the recovery process. The river will slowly recover naturally as fish from upstream and downstream re-distribute, but we are considering what the river needs to improve fish stocks now and protect against possible future storm sewage incidents. Fish passes, for example, may be installed, according to need, in order to allow stocks unaffected by the pollution to migrate upstream. A recovery plan for the river is being finalised.</p>
	<p pid="b.84W.2/3">The Environment Agency has committed to work with angling clubs, British Waterways and Yorkshire Water to ensure the recovery and future protection of the river. Meetings have already taken place and discussions are ongoing.</p>

	<p pid="b.84W.5/1">The UK Government continues to play an active role in negotiating improvements to the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) designed to provide more sustainable long-term fisheries management. We are working to ensure depleted stocks are recovered and subsequently conserved, while at the same time delivering a viable future for our fishing industry, in order to optimise long-term benefits to the nation from fisheries. We are currently consulting the public on our 20-year Strategic vision for marine fisheries in England and English waters. We aim to arrive at a &quot;contract&quot; for marine fisheries recognising that everyone with an interest in fisheries has a role to play in achieving sustainability.</p>

This was possible because of the strong position taken by the UK and our EU partners. We continue to press for effective worldwide action and, with the EU, we will seek to ensure that everybody meets their responsibility to prevent this unregulated form of fishing from destroying so many marine creatures and habitats.</p>

	<p pid="b.85W.2/1">In 2006, the UK under-fished its North Sea nephrops quota by some 3,429 tonnes, 2,443 tonnes of which has been carried over to 2007. This takes this year's UK quota for this stock to 25,087 tonnes, which is 4,084 tonnes above the level of its actual landings in 2006.</p>
	<p pid="b.85W.2/2">In view of this, we concluded that &quot;top-slicing&quot; 375 tonnes from the UK's North Sea nephrops quota to pay for the quota swap with Germany would not have a significant impact on those groups targeting nephrops. Any disadvantage would be greatly outweighed by the benefit to the inshore fleet of securing 150 tonnes of North Sea sole. Without this quantity of sole, there was a real possibility of a significant number of small fishing enterprises going out of business, with a knock-on effect for shore-based companies and the viability of small fishing ports in South East England.</p>

	<p pid="b.86W.5/1">As part of the 2002 Flood and Coastal Defence Funding Review, DEFRA consulted publicly on the idea of a floodplain development charge. This is an initial charge on developers in flood risk areas to cover the costs to the public purse of wider measures to protect proposed developments from flooding, beyond those covered by developer payments under section 106 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990. Further public consultation on the idea was undertaken in 2004 as part of development of the new cross-Government strategy for flood and coastal erosion risk management &quot;Making space for water&quot;.</p>

They act as a catalyst for economic and social regeneration, having the potential to generate jobs and development. There is reckoned to be around a 20 per cent. uplift in land values along a canal corridor. Their contribution to tourism is also significant given the opportunities they provide for leisure and recreation.</p>

	<p pid="b.91W.2/1">The Packaging (Essential Requirements) Regulations 2003 (as amended) require that all packaging should be manufactured so that volume and weight are limited to the minimum adequate amount to maintain necessary levels of safety, hygiene and consumer acceptance.</p>
	<p pid="b.91W.2/2">These Regulations are enforced by Trading Standards officers and a number of companies have already been prosecuted for using excess packaging.</p>
	<p pid="b.91W.2/3">The Producer Responsibility Obligations (Packaging Waste) Regulations 2007 also encourage businesses to reduce the amount of packaging they use. In addition, the Government are encouraging supermarkets to take greater responsibility, in terms of waste, for the packaging and products they place on the market. The Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP) is currently working with retailers through the 'Courtauld Commitment', a voluntary agreement which aims to halt packaging growth by 2008 and make absolute reductions in packaging waste by 2010. 13 major retailers, representing 92 per cent. of the UK grocery sector, have already signed the agreement as well as three major brands.</p>
	<p pid="b.91W.2/4">In addition, DEFRA, working with WRAP and the devolved administrations, has recently secured the agreement of UK retailers to reduce the overall environmental impact of their carrier bags by 25 per cent. by the end of 2008.</p>
	<p pid="b.91W.2/5">Consumers also have a part to play in encouraging producers to reduce unnecessary waste by choosing goods that are not heavily packaged, buying loose (rather than pre-packaged) food and re-using their own bags.</p>

	<p pid="b.93W.5/1">This is a devolved matter and, in Scotland, is the responsibility of the Scottish Executive. However, in England, good progress has been made towards the targets to improve rates of recycling and recovery set out in Waste Strategy 2000. The key targets were to recycle or compost at least 25 per cent. Of household waste by 2005 and to recover value from 40 per cent. of municipal waste by the same date.</p>
	<p pid="b.93W.5/2">Figures for 2005-06 show that we exceeded the recycling and composting target, with 27 per cent. of household waste either recycled or composted in England.

	<p pid="b.95W.0/1">Animal Health (AH) will be an executive agency, sponsored by, and working on behalf of DEFRA. It also works on behalf of the Scottish Executive and Welsh Assembly in implementing animal health and welfare policies, including the regulation of trade in endangered species.</p>
	<p pid="b.95W.0/2">AH will also work on behalf of the Food Standards Agency in England and Wales to protect public health by ensuring that dairy hygiene and egg production standards are met.</p>
	<p pid="b.95W.0/3">The Hampton Review recommended the consolidation of DEFRA inspection and enforcement functions into seven thematic regulators, one being a new executive agency for Animal Health and Welfare, with the State Veterinary Service (SVS) at its core. DEFRA Ministers subsequently determined to merge the Dairy Hygiene Inspectorate, the Egg Marketing Inspectorate, and the Wildlife Licensing and Registration Service (WLRS) with the SVS to create such a body. The Dairy Hygiene Inspectorate joined the SVS in October 2006, and the Egg Marketing Inspectorate and WLRS will join on <phrase class="date" code="2007-04-01">1 April 2007</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.95W.0/4">The organisation undertakes a wide range of tasks (over 600) in animal health and welfare and related areas. The joining organisations have congruent roles relating directly or indirectly to animals, animal health and welfare and public health. As the role of the organisation expands to embrace new partners, responsibilities and enforcement powers, the veterinary-focus of the current SVS brand would not adequately communicate the remit of the organisation.</p>
	<p pid="b.95W.0/5">It is not possible to accurately estimate the cost of this work, or break it down as requested, since it is still ongoing. However, we expect that in total the work will cost less than &pound;60,000.</p>

	<p pid="b.95W.3/1">The Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons (RCVS) sets guidelines for the provision of 24 hour veterinary coverage in the UK. According to these guidelines, emergency cover requires that a veterinary surgeon deals promptly at any time with first-aid (and emergencies either directly or by alternative means (for example, by cooperation with other practices). The veterinary surgeon retains discretion to assess what constitutes an emergency need and may in some ceases delay seeing a case until the next day. There is no statutory requirement for veterinary surgeons to provide 24 cover.</p>
	<p pid="b.95W.3/2">The RCVS has reconvened it's working party on 24 hour cover, to review the current guidelines and in particular, consider how these should be applied in more remote areas.</p>
	<p pid="b.95W.3/3">DEFRA is not aware of any instances where 24 hour cover is declining or not currently being met in rural areas. The recent case reported to us in relation to general veterinary cover in the Scilly Isles has been resolved. We have been working closely through the Vets and Veterinary Services working group to address a number of issues, including the provision of 24 hour cover in rural and remote areas of the country. The group includes representatives from the British Veterinary Association (BVA), the RCVS and the National Farmers Union.</p>
	<p pid="b.95W.3/4">We are continuing to work with the RCVS and the BVA to develop the necessary information base to assess whether there are any areas which may be at risk as a result of the changing agricultural base or changes in the rural/urban landscape. This year, we have included specific questions in DEFRA's Farm Practices Survey to assess the farmer experience of accessing veterinary services.</p>
	<p pid="b.95W.3/5">Some rural practices are making greater efforts to co-ordinate their out of hours services in the same way that small animal practices have done for some time. The BVA has indicated a willingness to develop more information on improved business methods for rural practice, which will help many practices to improve the way they provide 24 hour cover.</p>
	<p pid="b.95W.3/6">In relation to the welfare of animals, the Government stress the statutory requirement for keepers of livestock in rural and remote areas to provide appropriate husbandry for animals in their care. We are working, through our Farm Health Planning team, to support initiatives which will enable veterinary surgeons to provide more managed farm health planning and reduce the reliance on care only in emergency situations.</p>
	<p pid="b.95W.3/7">In order to assure greater transparency and to enable a clearer plan of work in relation to Vets and Veterinary Services, DEFRA has agreed to relinquish chairmanship of this working group and we hope to be able to announce an independent chairman shortly.</p>

	<p pid="b.100W.2/1">The UK Government recognises that health workers are essential to the delivery of essential health services and achievement of the health related MDGs. DFID therefore invests substantially in health, supporting African Governments to strengthen their health services. DFID uses a variety of mechanisms, including support to international agencies, direct support to Government budgets, working jointly with other donors or through projects. For example, in Malawi, where the shortage of health workers is particularly severe, we provide &pound;100 million support for the health sector of which &pound;55 million is earmarked for the Emergency Human Resources Programme. This programme focuses on improving recruitment and retention through salary increases for health workers, expanding training capacity&mdash;doubling the number of nurses and tripling the number of doctors in training&mdash;and using international volunteer physicians and nurse tutors while more Malawians are being trained. The programme also supports human resources planning and management capacity in Malawi's Ministry of Health. In Nigeria and Kenya, DFID provides technical assistance to develop human resources for health plans. A long-term &pound;50 million health reform programme has been agreed in Sierra Leone which will strengthen recruitment, training and retention of key health workers.</p>
	<p pid="b.100W.2/2">DFID engages regionally and globally on policy development and advocacy with key institutions such as WHO, the World Bank and African regional institutions such as the African Union (AU) and the New Partnership for Africa's Development (NEPAD). DFID has recently committed &pound;1 million to support the formation of the Global Health Workforce Alliance which will play a key advocacy, policy and convening role on human resource for health issues.</p>
	<p pid="b.100W.2/3">Health worker brain drain results from a mix of country push factors that motivate staff to leave, and pull factors that attract workers away. DFID works with the UK Department of Health to develop and implement policies that prevent the targeting of developing countries in the international recruitment of health care professionals including agreeing a list of countries, from which the NHS does not actively recruit. In addition, the Department of Health has brokered agreement for this Code to apply to major players in the UK independent healthcare sector.</p>

	<p pid="b.101W.0/1">The recruitment, training and retention of health workers is essential to improve the delivery of basic health services in Africa. This requires budgets that can support and sustain long term public investment. The advice the IMF gives to African countries on budget issues needs to contribute to strengthening health services.</p>
	<p pid="b.101W.0/2">Concerns have been raised in some African countries about the impact of public sector expenditure ceilings on the retention of health workers. We have been closely monitoring the impact of ceilings and discussing these concerns with the IMF. The IMF has agreed to engage further in discussions at national and global level on the issue of health work forces and how these can be best supported by their programmes. These should recognise the constraints all countries face in deciding on appropriate levels of expenditure, domestic deficits and borrowing and also how higher spending on public services can be supported by higher levels of aid. In discussions with the international financial institutions, DFID continues to urge an approach that supports stability, growth and the best use of higher levels of aid. These discussions include the topic of fiscal space which will be discussed at this year's spring meetings.</p>

	<p pid="b.101W.3/2">This includes support to address the shortage of health workers, and remove barriers such as user fees that prevent the poor from using services. For example, in Malawi DFID has provided &pound;55 million over six years to fund an innovative Emergency Human Resources Programme to support the training, recruitment and retention of health workers. This will eventually double the number of nurses and treble the number of doctors. In Zambia DFID has committed &pound;14.5 million over five years to support the abolition of user fees in public health facilities.</p>

In last year's International Development White Paper we committed to further increase spending on basic services, including health, to at least half of the UK's direct support to developing countries.</p>
	<p pid="b.101W.3/4">DFID supports access to health care through a range of complementary approaches; through technical assistance and project support; through support for Global Health Funds, our contribution to UN organisation, support for NGOs and, where the environment is right, through direct budget support.

	<p pid="b.102W.2/3">In Malawi, where DFID is the major donor in the health sector, with an investment of &pound;100 million over the period 2004-10, a rapid scale up in prevention of mother to child transmission services is taking place with the aim that every pregnant woman visiting a health facility will have access to HIV prevention and treatment services. During 2005, 5,000 of 7,000 HIV positive pregnant women received a complete course of Anti Retro Viral prophylaxis. The aim is also that more HIV positive pregnant women offered help to prevent mother to child transmission are referred for care and support services&mdash;currently only one third of women are referred on. The Government, UN and other partners in Malawi are working to overcome the very real constraints associated with cultural beliefs and practices, weak health systems and structures, scarcity of health staff in the country, poverty and stigma.</p>
	<p pid="b.102W.2/4">In addition to core funding to UNICEF, DFID has provided over $1.5 million to an 'Accelerating Action for Children Affected by HIV and AIDS' programme. This gives focus to the &quot;4 P's&mdash;Protection, Prevention, Prevention of mother to child transmission and Paediatric AIDS&quot;. The three year programme aims to expand and accelerate action, increase the availability and quality of evidence, improve coherence between the UN and other partners and increase the prominence of children and AIDS across the UN system.</p>

In addition to funding AIDS programmes, we are supporting UNITAID, the new international drug purchasing facility, to fund second-line Antiretrovirals (ARVs), paediatric ARVs and TB and malaria drugs predominantly in low income countries. We hope that UNITAID will contribute to the necessary reductions in the prices of second-line drugs such Viread and Kaletra. The UK is also helping to strengthen the World Health Organisation (WHO) to accelerate the medicines prequalification process through UNITAID.</p>
	<p pid="b.102W.5/2">In Africa, DFID supports treatment specific programmes; for example, we are providing antiretroviral therapy (ART) in Zambia, Rwanda and also the Democratic Republic of Congo, in programmes that focus on treatment, prevention of mother to child transmission (PMTCT) and post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP). We also support treatment programmes through interventions aimed at strengthening health systems and the provision of technical assistance to Ministries of Health (MOH), for example in Malawi. Decisions on what and how to fund are made in country and are based on partner Government and other donor investments through the presence and engagement of the Global Fund to fights AIDS, TB and Malaria (GFATM), President Bush's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), the World Bank and other bilateral funds.</p>

	<p pid="b.103W.2/1">In Ghana, measurements of the Maternal Mortality Ratio are unreliable. The latest official figures are based on the 1993 Demographic Health Survey (DHS) when it was estimated to be 214 per 100,000 live births. A draft review of health sector performance for 2006 suggests a downward trend and an estimated maternal mortality rate of 187 per 100,000 live births. These figures need to be interpreted with care. At country level, discussions with the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) are taking place over the measurements of maternal mortality in the 2008 Demographic Health Survey and/or the 2010 Census.</p>
	<p pid="b.103W.2/2">Development partners including DFID together with the World Health Organisation (WHO), UNFPA and United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), are discussing within the framework of annual plans of the health Sector Wide Approach (SWAp) and the new five-year health sector plan (2007-11), the implementation of package health interventions. This is aimed at accelerating progress towards Millennium Development Goals 4 and 5 around safe motherhood strategies, improving access to and quality of emergency obstetric care and the promotion of child spacing.</p>
	<p pid="b.103W.2/3">Malawi's 2004 DHS shows a slight decline in the Maternal Mortality Ratio from the 2000 DHS figure of 1,120 per 100,000 live births, to 984 per 100,000 live births. This is unacceptably high.</p>
	<p pid="b.103W.2/4">DFID has committed &pound;100 million over six years to the Government of Malawi-led health SWAp (2004-05-2010-11). Of this, &pound;55 million will address the human resource crisis through salary top-ups to recruit and retain staff, improved training and, as a stop-gap measure, providing expatriate volunteers to fill training and specialists positions. &pound;45 million will finance the Essential Health Package including improved facilities, drugs and other supplies.</p>
	<p pid="b.103W.2/5">On <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-30">30 March</phrase> Malawi's Minister of Health, Marjorie Ngaunje, launched Malawi's 'Road Map' to reduce maternal and neonatal deaths in Malawi under the SWAp. This strategy aims to strengthen service delivery at all levels of the health system and the capacity of individuals and communities to improve maternal and neonatal health. Districts have also been able to 'kick start' action on maternal health using flexible funds from the SWAp. This includes the signing of 47 service level agreements with the Christian Health Association of Malawi to remove user fees for maternal services and using locum payments to midwives to go to health centres to cover staff shortages.</p>
	<p pid="b.103W.2/6">The UN (UNFPA, WHO and UNICEF) supported the development of Malawi's Road Map. The UN and DFID sit together on the sectoral level Sexual and Reproductive Health Technical Working Group which coordinates stakeholder support to the implementation of this government-led strategy.</p>
	<p pid="b.103W.2/7">In Zimbabwe, maternal mortality has worsened significantly in the last 15 years, due mainly to the HIV and AIDS epidemic, deteriorating health services and increasing barriers to access including user fees. Recent figures estimate that the lifetime risk of a woman dying of pregnancy or childbirth related clauses is one in 16 or 6,250 per 100,000.</p>
	<p pid="b.103W.2/8">DFID is working with the UN (UNFPA and UNICEF) and civil society organisations to develop a joint programme to reduce maternal and infant mortality. DFID will contribute &pound;25 million over five years. This programme aims to protect the lives of mothers and newborns, especially those affected by HIV and AIDS and to maintain access to family planning services, including contraceptives and to lifesaving obstetric services and newborn care. The programme will build the evidence base about obstacles to sexual and reproductive care, infant feeding for HIV exposed babies after six months, and will support a national maternal and prenatal mortality study in Zimbabwe in order to inform policy options.</p>

	<p pid="b.105W.2/1">DFID has recently only supported one BBC World Service Trust project in Burma: a grant of &pound;1,997,513 for a radio soap opera to raise awareness of HIV/AIDS in audiences in Burma. The project started in January 2003 and was to last three years. By late 2005, the project was spending DFID's grant more slowly than budgeted, so we agreed an extension until September 2006. A review at that point judged that the project was judged likely partly to achieve its purpose. When the project managers requested a further extension we declined in order to focus our resources on other projects which we judged would be even more effective in reducing poverty in Burma.</p>

Friend the Secretary of State has no immediate plans to meet with chocolate manufacturers to discuss the use of child labour in the production of cocoa, but he met with Cadbury Schweppes at the end of last year and has met with Stop the Traffik. In addition, the UK Government have been engaging with the International Cocoa Initiative, which was set up by the chocolate manufacturers to address concerns about the use of the worst forms of child labour in cocoa production. The Initiative is focusing on surveying working practices in Ghana and Ivory Coast to identify what activities in the production of cocoa would fall into the International Labour Organisation's (ILO) definition of the worst forms of child labour, how widespread these activities are and how best to tackle them. In doing this the International Cocoa Initiative is working closely with the governments of Ghana and Ivory Coast.

	<p pid="b.108W.5/1">The Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) especially those for reducing maternal and child deaths and HIV/AIDS will not be attained without progress in achieving sexual and reproductive health and rights for all.</p>
	<p pid="b.108W.5/2">This view was endorsed in 2006 when the UN Secretary General recommended a new target within the MDG monitoring framework of &quot;universal access to reproductive health by 2015&quot;. An essential element in achieving this will be ensuring that women and men, including young people, have access to condoms, contraceptives, medicines and other products, and the services, information and education they need to protect their sexual and reproductive health.</p>
	<p pid="b.108W.5/3">Conflict and post conflict states pose particular challenges if they are to meet the MDGs. DFID's recent White Paper &quot;Making governance work for the poor&quot; recognises that we must help people have security, incomes and public services. Effective states are central to development, so we must help countries&mdash;especially those at risk of falling even further behind the rest of the world&mdash;do better in ensuring security, achieving sustainable growth, and delivering health and education for all.</p>
	<p pid="b.108W.5/4">To contribute to meeting the sexual and reproductive health needs of people in post-conflict states we have recently agreed a grant of &pound;5 million to the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) for them to provide reproductive health supplies. This is in addition to our annual &pound;20 million core grant to UNFPA.</p>
	<p pid="b.108W.5/5">We also have a number of programmes we directly support in countries. For example, in Rwanda we have provided &pound;250,000 to a project which aimed to increase public awareness and discussion of women's sexual and reproductive health issues and lead to positive changes in knowledge, beliefs, attitudes and behaviour. In Somalia, we have provided over &pound;400,000 to a project which aims to provide free primary health care and increase the access and quality of services provided to women. Part of this programme provides reproductive health education and highlights the benefits of family planning and birth spacing for women and their children.</p>
	<p pid="b.108W.5/6">The World Health Organisation (WHO) has collected evidence from developing countries on what works in preventing HIV/AIDS and sexually transmitted infections in young people. But, I am not aware of specific assessments of the effectiveness of sexual and reproductive health education programmes in post-conflict states.</p>
	<p pid="b.108W.5/7">However, many countries now recognise that education (especially female education) can play an important role in reducing poverty. The link between improved education and improved reproductive health and HIV prevention is also recognised and many developing countries have established or broadened reproductive health policies and programmes. However, over 200 million couples still have no access to effective contraception and 15 to 24-year-olds account for 50 per cent. of new HIV cases. In Africa, 90 per cent. of all HIV infections are sexually transmitted with women and young people disproportionately affected.</p>
	<p pid="b.108W.5/8">DFID continues to give priority to supporting reproductive health and rights for women and to focus our bilateral programmes on strengthening of health systems to deliver effective information, services, and supplies. DFID is investing &pound;1.85 million in a project evaluating the long-term impact of an adolescent sexual health intervention programme in Tanzania.</p>

	<p pid="b.109W.2/1">DFID's strategy &quot;Reducing Maternal Deaths: Evidence and Action&quot; provides the basis for DFID support to improve maternal health at country level. DFID's approach to achieving sustained improvements in maternal health includes work to strengthen basic health services and to ensure that there is full integration between HIV and sexual and reproductive health services and programmes. In countries where there is high HIV prevalence, military conflict and/or weak health systems the challenges to improving maternal health are particularly great.</p>
	<p pid="b.109W.2/2">DFID investments are designed to address the specific needs of a country. For example in Zimbabwe the UK is investing &pound;25 million to improve maternal and newborn health through a programme that aims to ensure full integration of HIV and maternal health services. In Malawi, DFID is providing &pound;55 million to support an Emergency Human Resource Programme to address the acute shortage of health workers, an issue which has been compounded by the AIDS epidemic. This effort directly impacts on the Malawian health service's ability to deliver essential maternity services. While in Nepal DFID's long-term support for maternal health has been adapted to ensure that it remains effective in the context of a changing political environment.</p>

	<p pid="b.110W.5/1">The Department for International Development (DFID) supports a range of projects designed to reduce the risk of pesticide poisoning in the agricultural sector. For example, DFID has researched and promoted integrated pest management practices for cost-effective and sustainable control of cotton bollworm in small-scale cotton production systems in India and Uganda. These practices are currently being scaled up by the Indian Government after they resulted in both increased yields and a 52 per cent. reduction in pesticide use. DFID is a major supporter of development co-operation carried out by the European Commission. The Commission has provided around &euro;30 million towards a 'Pesticide Initiative Programme', including projects supporting improved training for farmers in various African, Caribbean and Pacific countries. Furthermore, DFID works with both regulators and private standard setting organisations to ensure that good agricultural practice related to pesticide use is supported. These good practices include safe handling, application, storage and disposal of pesticides.</p>
	<p pid="b.110W.5/2">Entering the labour force too early, significantly limits young people's opportunities over their life time. Limiting their physical and intellectual development and future choices and aspirations, it helps to trap families in poverty from one generation to the next. All children have the right to education and should not have to work to survive. The Government are committed to the elimination of child labour and is working towards long-lasting changes that tackle the underlying poverty that is at the root of this problem.</p>

	<p pid="b.111W.2/1">DFID has supported a range of training, education and research projects to promote best practice in the use of pesticides in developing countries. Integrated pest management practices researched with the help of DFID have proven to be particularly useful pest control strategies that can significantly reduce or eliminate the use of pesticides. DFID has recently allocated &pound;37.5 million over five years to help scale up some of the most promising research findings and promote their use in Africa and South Asia. DFID is a major supporter of development cooperation carried out by the European Commission and the Commission has provided around &euro;30 million towards a Pesticide Initiative Programme' to improve training for farmers in various African, Caribbean and Pacific countries. There is evidence that small farmers have benefited from these projects through significant reductions in pesticide use and increased yield and income.</p>
	<p pid="b.111W.2/2">DFID also promotes reduced use of hazardous chemicals and pesticides through trading standards and good agricultural practices. DFID has provided core funding for the Fairtrade Foundation which, amongst other things, works to ensure appropriate use of pesticides by 'Fairtrade' certified producers, DFID works with the private standard setting bodies such as the Euro-Retailer Produce Working Group Good Agricultural Practice (EurepGAP) to ensure their global standards are attainable and realistic in developing countries and finally, DFID supports the Standards and Trade Development Facility of the WTO to provide capacity building support to developing countries to meet international standards including those related to maximum residue levels for agricultural pesticides and chemicals.</p>

	<p pid="b.112W.6/1">DFID has not produced any reports on the recent sewage flooding in the Gaza Strip, but the UN Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UN-OCHA) publishes regular updates. DFID is in close contact with UN-OCHA and other agencies to establish the extent of the damage, and humanitarian and longer term needs.</p>
	<p pid="b.112W.6/2">Reports indicate that the volume of waste water exceeded the capacity at the existing treatment plant, leading to the flooding. The World Bank (WB) had been working with the Palestinian Authority (PA) to build a new plant. However, restrictions imposed by Israel and the poor security situation in Gaza hindered access for experts and equipment imports. The excess sewage finally caused the supporting walls of a filtration basin to break, flooding the nearby village of Umm Nasser.</p>
	<p pid="b.112W.6/3">DFID is monitoring the situation and staying in close contact with the PA, civil society and other donors regarding the relief effort. Through the Temporary International Mechanism, the European Commission (EC) is funding fuel for heavy machinery to re-establish the embankment. The European Commission Humanitarian Office (ECHO) is providing &euro;600,000 to consolidate the embankments of the main sewage lake where there is a danger of collapse. The UK contributes about 17 per cent. of EC assistance.</p>
	<p pid="b.112W.6/4">The United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) has sent 300 tents, six water tanks, blankets, mattresses and hygiene kits to the affected area. DFID is providing &pound;15 million of core funding to UNRWA this year. NGOs and other UN organisations have identified relief supplies to provide to those affected. UN-OCHA, which is co-ordinating the humanitarian response, has told DFID that the humanitarian situation is under control. They are not requesting any assistance beyond what has already been pledged.</p>
	<p pid="b.112W.6/5">The Palestinian Water Authority (PWA) and the WB met with the Government of Israel on <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-28">28 March</phrase>. Israel agreed to provide free access to the area, facilitate the import of necessary equipment and provide technicians. The PWA and the WB are looking immediately to address the disaster area, including clean-up and the pumping of surplus sewage to a safe site.</p>

'An Evaluation of DFID's India Programme 2000 to 2005' was carried out by DFID's Evaluation Department and published in August 2006. The evaluation found that DFID India's overall development effectiveness is substantial and increased significantly between 2000 and 2005. For example, DFID's support to primary education through the Government of India's Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA) programme has helped to get millions of children into school and to cut drop out rates. Support to civil society in some of the poorest districts of India has also made significant headway in allowing poor and marginalised groups to realise their rights.

	<p pid="b.114W.3/1">The Government of Pakistan (GoP) has been leading the response to the earthquake, working with a wide range of international partners, including DFID and other donors, the United Nations, and NGOs. The humanitarian relief phase, which came to an end last year, was successful in ensuring adequate provision of food, shelter and basic services to people affected by the earthquake. DFID committed &pound;58 million to immediate relief. A DFID team conducted a follow-up mission early this January to review the humanitarian situation now, particularly to assess the effectiveness of GoP's and the United Nations' winter preparations. Our assessment concluded that winter planning was adequate. Basic services have functioned and the coping ability of most people has been restored.</p>
	<p pid="b.114W.3/2">GoP is now finalising its planning for the major reconstruction season that lies ahead. Some reconstruction of individual health and education facilities, particularly through NGOs and donor agencies, is already being undertaken. However, the bulk of the work will be undertaken by GoP through its Earthquake Reconstruction and Rehabilitation Authority. This will include large programmes of new and replacement schools, health facilities, roads, water and sanitation services, telecommunications, and Government facilities.</p>
	<p pid="b.114W.3/3">DFID has committed to providing &pound;70 million for reconstruction. Of this, some &pound;5 million has already been spent on reconstructing critical bridges, training teachers and educational administrators and on essential support to maintain TB and mental health services. A further &pound;9 million is currently being spent on improving GoP's capacity to deal with the reconstruction. The &pound;56 million remaining is being allocated to the Government of Pakistan in three parts for reconstruction and rehabilitation against their own annual priorities. We have just released the first allocation, of &pound;17.5 million. This money will be used for housing and for reconstructing critical health, education and other facilities.</p>

	<p pid="b.116W.0/1">DFID has supported Public Private Infrastructure Advisory Facility (PPIAF) over three phases since 1999. Our total commitment to PPIAF from 1999 to 2008 is &pound;53 million. Over the last three years, we have disbursed &pound;16.8 million to PPIAF. We do not earmark our funding for specific sectors, allowing PPIAF to respond flexibly to the requests for help it receives from developing country governments.</p>
	<p pid="b.116W.0/2">PPIAF reports in World Bank financial years (July to June) and in US$ dollars. Over the last three years, PPIAF as a whole has spent approximately the following in the water sector:</p>
	<p pid="b.116W.0/3" class="indent">2004&mdash;US$ 2.7 million (&pound;1.47 million), which is 19 per cent. of total PPIAF expenditure.</p>
	<p pid="b.116W.0/4" class="indent">2005&mdash;US$ 3.17 million (&pound;1.6 million), which is 18 per cent. of total PPIAF expenditure.</p>
	<p pid="b.116W.0/5" class="indent">2006&mdash;US$ 3.23 million (&pound;1.6 million), which is 18 per cent. of total PPIAF expenditure.</p>
	<p pid="b.116W.0/6">DFID has committed a total of &pound;5 million to be disbursed to PPIAF for all its activities (including in water and sanitation) for 2007-08.</p>
	<p pid="b.116W.0/7">The majority of developing country governments do not have the capacity to provide good quality infrastructure and services for their people; PPIAF helps them to develop sound policies, regulations and institutions. PPIAF does this by providing developing country governments with technical assistance which they can use to tap the full potential of public-private partnerships in infrastructure. PPIAF also identifies, communicates and promotes best practice on matters relating to public-private partnerships in infrastructure. It is also recognised as a leading resource for training and best practice in the role of public-private partnerships in infrastructure service delivery.</p>
	<p pid="b.116W.0/8">There are many examples of PPIAF's success. For example in Kenya, PPIAF provided technical assistance and training to enable micro-credit banks to lend to small water providers to provide clean water to rural and semi-urban communities. This has led to 21 micro-credit investments and an output based grant which will result in 60,000 people gaining access to clean water.</p>
	<p pid="b.116W.0/9">Also in Ghana, PPIAF supported the Ghana Community Water and Sanitation Agency with regulatory and legal reform to improve small town water services. This has allowed local water operators to provide clean water to communities for the first time. Communities themselves were involved in the selection of the water providers. This has been successfully implemented in three towns and will be rolled out to 300 small towns across the country.</p>
	<p pid="b.116W.0/10">Further information about PPIAF and its successes are available in a fact sheet 'Department for International Development (DFID) Factsheet for the Public Private Infrastructure Advisory Facility (PPIAF)', which has been placed in the Library of the House.</p>

	<p pid="b.117W.0/2">PPIAF has supported 97 water sector activities with a total funding of US$ 21.6 million. These water sector activities can be divided into the following categories:</p>
	<p pid="b.117W.0/3" class="indent">24 activities that support developing country governments with advice on better laws, regulations and institutional structures for the improved provision of water services. These activities help build the capacity of developing country governments to improve their provision of infrastructure and other services for their citizens. Such activities include the establishment of a water regulator, the benchmarking of utilities, workshops and consultations on water sector reform. These activities amount to approximately 15 per cent. of PPIAF funding for water sector activities.</p>
	<p pid="b.117W.0/4" class="indent">31 activities which supported developing country governments with policy studies, which eventually led to some form of private sector participation in water services. These included small scale, local providers of water services. This amounts to approximately 33 per cent. of PPIAF funding for water sector activities.</p>
	<p pid="b.117W.0/5" class="indent">29 activities which supported developing country governments with policy studies, which resulted in the continuation of a public sector option for water service provision. This includes public sector performance contracts using private sector principles. This amounts to approximately 40 per cent. of PPIAF funding for water sector activities.</p>
	<p pid="b.117W.0/6" class="indent">Finally, 13 activities that are ongoing and where the policy option to provide water services has not been decided upon yet by the developing country governments concerned. This amounts to approximately 12 per cent. of the PPIAF funding for water sector activities.</p>
	<p pid="b.117W.0/7">PPIAF is a fund supported by a number of donors including DFID. It provides advice to developing countries to ensure that their citizens get the most out of private sector involvement in infrastructure services. PPIAF achieves this by supporting governments to develop sound policies, regulations and institutions which can tap the full potential of public-private partnerships in infrastructure. It is also a leading resource for training and best practices in the role of public-private partnerships in infrastructure service delivery.</p>
	<p pid="b.117W.0/8">PPIAF only provides advice to developing countries when requested to do so by their governments. For example, in Vietnam, a PPIAF supported grant assisted two small towns with the development of community-based water projects that bring affordable water to poor communities using local private operators. These projects used extensive community outreach to get 90 per cent. of the population to agree on technical, financial and cost recovery options, including tariff design. This demand driven approach is now being replicated through other donor programs and also in the Philippines and Thailand with many other prospects for replication.</p>

	<p pid="b.118W.2/1">Estimates of multilateral funding provided to Serbia and Montenegro (including Kosovo) and the UK's imputed share and percentage share of this funding are provided in the following three tables. Table 1 contains estimates of funding provided by multilateral institutions to Serbia and Montenegro (including) Kosovo) for each calendar year 2000 to 2004. Table 2 contains estimates of the UK's imputed share of this funding and Table 3 contains estimates of the UK's percentage share of this funding on which Table 2 imputed figures are based. The following points should be borne in mind when interpreting the tables:</p>
	<p pid="b.118W.2/2" class="indent">(1) UK funding to multilateral institutions cannot be directly attributed to any country; the estimates below are imputed shares based on the UK's total funding for each multilateral and that multilateral's distribution of Official Development Assistance (ODA) to Serbia and Montenegro (including Kosovo).</p>
	<p pid="b.118W.2/3" class="indent">(2) ODA is defined as flows administered with the promotion of economic development and welfare of developing countries as their main objective, that are concessional in character and convey a grant element of at least 25 per cent. Aid to countries on Part 1 of the Development Assistance Committee (DAC) List of Aid Recipients is eligible to be recorded as ODA. Official Aid (OA) has the same concessional and qualitative features as ODA but covers aid to countries on Part 2 of the DAC List of Recipients. (Note: From 2005 Part 2 of the DAC List of Recipients will cease to exist and aid to countries on a new combined list of DAC List of Recipients of Official Development Assistance will be eligible to be recorded as ODA)</p>
	<p pid="b.118W.2/4" class="indent">(3) The list of multilateral organisations in the tables is not exhaustive; the multilateral listed are those that provide the DAC with detailed information about their distribution of funds to Serbia and Montenegro (including Kosovo) and to whom DFID provided funds over the period.</p>
	<p pid="b.118W.2/5" class="indent">(4) Negatives represent accounting adjustments, not a net flow to the UK; Zero figures are indicated with a dash.</p>
	<p pid="b.118W.2/6" class="indent">(5) The total UK share of multilateral ODA/OA to Serbia and Montenegro (including Kosovo) has been revised slightly from the figure given in the answer of <phrase class="date" code="2007-02-19">19 February 2007</phrase>, <i> Official Report,</i> column 287W, as a result of revisions made by the DAC to the underlying data.</p>
	<p pid="b.118W.2/7" class="indent">(6) Figures for 2005 will be available following publication of the DFID Departmental Report in May.</p>

	<p pid="b.121W.2/1">In total DFID spent just under &pound;8 million in 2005-06 in tackling HIV and AIDS in Uganda. This figure includes directly targeted support to HIV and AIDS related projects, together with a proportion of UK humanitarian support used by UN agencies in Northern Uganda to help prevent HIV and AIDS. The figure also includes an estimate of the proportion of the &pound;30 million of general budget support provided by DFID to the Government of Uganda in 2005-06 which was used to provide services that address the HIV and AIDS problem.</p>
	<p pid="b.121W.2/2">A significant proportion of the &pound;30 million of general budget support provided to the Government of Uganda will also be used to help develop the agriculture industry in Uganda, for example, in delivering essential services in areas such as Agricultural Research and Extension. In addition, during 2005-06 DFID spent over &pound;2 million on projects to develop the private sector, including agriculture, by improving business regulation, increasing access to finance and strengthening markets. DFID also spent a further half a million pounds on direct support to projects in the Rural Livelihoods sector in Uganda in 2005-06.</p>

	<p pid="b.122W.3/1">Between the financial years of 1996-97 and 2005-06, Zambia received &pound;662.3 million from the UK as bilateral aid. Of this amount, DFID's bilateral programme totalled &pound;309.6 million and included financial aid, technical cooperation, humanitarian assistance and debt relief. General poverty reduction budget support also featured in financial years 2000-01, 2004-05 and 2005-06. Aid from other (non-DFID) UK official sources amounted to &pound;352.7 million and includes CDC Group (originally known as Colonial Development Cooperation) investments, non-DFID debt relief and contributions from the British Council among other items. Table 1 provides further details on UK bilateral aid to Zambia over the past decade.</p>
	<p pid="b.122W.3/2">Between 1996 and 2004, Zambia also received an estimated &pound;128.7 million through UK contributions to multilateral institutions such as the European Commission, United Nations and World Bank.</p>
	<p pid="b.122W.3/3">Zambia has benefited from substantial external debt relief in recent years. Following the attainment of the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Completion Point in April 2005 and implementation of the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI) in 2006, Zambia's external debt stock has declined from US$ 7.1 billion in 2004 to approximately US$ 0.5 billion in nominal terms at year-end 2006. As a result, the net present value of debt to GDP ratio has fallen from around 28 per cent. in 2004 to 4 per cent. following the MDRI. At the end of 2006, domestic debt was estimated at $1.74 billion some 20.2 per cent. as a share of GDP in 2006.</p>
	<p pid="b.122W.3/4">Zambia is currently in the process of drafting a debt management strategy to avoid relapsing into an unsustainable debt situation. The UK strongly welcomes the good progress being made in this area.</p>

	<p pid="b.124W.12/1">Our current planning priority is to see through our commitments in Iraq and Afghanistan. The level of operational deployments is reducing and we judge that it will return to within the level assumed in our planning assumptions. Some of the measures to reduce the burden on personnel include: reducing the level of non-operational tasking; regularly reviewing the scale and mix of personnel deployed; increasing recruitment and training; and providing financial and non-financial incentives for retention.</p>

It is estimated that since this date approximately 16 military personnel have been wounded as a result of land-mines; however, this figure may not be entirely reliable because some very minor injuries may not be reported, and because it is not always possible to ascertain whether an incident is caused by a land-mine or an Improvised Explosive Device (IED).</p>

	<p pid="b.126W.2/1">HM forces in Afghanistan are there as part of a peace-enforcement operation. However, the character of any particular campaign is rarely static and its intensity can vary over time. This requires UK forces to conduct a wide range of military activities concurrently, and transition quickly from one type of operation to another. This is evident in the way in which UK forces are involved in frequent engagements with the Taliban while simultaneously assisting in reconstruction activities. Nevertheless, the aims of the ISAF mission remain to stabilise the security environment so that the Provincial Reconstruction Team and other agencies can operate to extend the Government's authority, to improve the rule of law, and to facilitate reconstruction and development, particularly by supporting capacity-building in the security sector.</p>

	<p pid="b.127W.3/1">Operational reliability is assessed by the numbers of aircraft that are deemed as Fit For Purpose (FFP) against the planned average FFP figure. Aircraft are deemed Fit For Purpose if they are capable of undertaking the required task on a given day. Aircraft are not available for tasking if they are undergoing scheduled maintenance, modification programmes or any unforeseen rectification work that can arise .on a day to day basis. The figures do not reflect the fact that an aircraft assessed as not fit for purpose may be returned to the front line at very short notice to meet the operational need. The planned average FFP for the Tristar aircraft for 2006-07 is 4.8 aircraft per day. As at the end of February 2007 we have achieved a FFP figure of 4.62 aircraft per day for the same period, largely owing to the ongoing programme to fit defensive measures to the Tristar.</p>

The Apache has successfully delivered on the tasks that it has undertaken, and reports from theatre have been very positive about this capability.</p>

This includes Volunteer Reserve Service training and/or mobilisation for the Reserve Forces.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.130W.3/3">During the selection interview, recruiting staff ensure that applicants are fully aware of their service obligations. Applicants with dependant responsibilities and/or those who ask questions on any concerns raised are then given further written guidance detailing their responsibilities with regard to child care arrangements. Once applicants have confirmed they understand their obligations and have demonstrated they have considered child care and would have sufficient cover during period of absence, the selection process is allowed to continue.</p>

	<p pid="b.132W.2/1">Military personnel who sustain a serious physical injury on operations overseas are most commonly received initially at Selly Oak Hospital, part of the University Hospital Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust (UHBFT), which is a Centre of Excellence in the medical care of the types of injuries our people most often sustain. Here we are able to provide patients who need it with the advanced specialist clinical care required in the initial stages of their treatment.</p>
	<p pid="b.132W.2/2">Patients with serious orthopaedic/trauma injuries may be housed on the military-managed ward at Selly Oak, where these injuries can be treated. But those with other injuries (such as burns or neurological trauma) may be housed on other specialist wards where they can receive the first-class care they require. This may be at Selly Oak, or if appropriate another NHS facility such as the Queen Elizabeth hospital.</p>
	<p pid="b.132W.2/3">Patients who either do not require inpatient hospital treatment, or who require further rehabilitation care following initial treatment, may be referred to the Defence Medical Rehabilitation Centre (DMRC) at Headley Court in Surrey. DMRC is the principal medical rehabilitation centre run by the armed forces and contains the Complex Rehabilitation and Amputee Unit (CRAU) and a Regional Rehabilitation Unit (RRU). DMRC provides both physiotherapy and group rehabilitation for complex musculo-skeletal injuries, plus neuro-rehabilitation for brain-injured patients. The CRAU, based within DMRC, provides high quality prosthetics and adaptations, manufactured on site and individually tailored as necessary for the specific patient. Priority is given to the provision of prosthetics to enable Service personnel to resume service duties.</p>
	<p pid="b.132W.2/4">Personnel with less serious musculo-skeletal injuries may also be referred to one of MOD's 15 Regional Rehabilitation Units (RRU) in the UK plus Germany, which provide accessible, regionally-based assessment and treatment, including physiotherapy and group rehabilitation facilities. Each RRU has a Multidisciplinary Injury Assessment Clinic (MIAC) team comprising a doctor with specialist skills in sports medicine, a physiotherapist with enhanced skills and a remedial instructor (physical education instructor trained to deliver individual and group therapy), who together provide an assessment and diagnostic service. This team have rapid access to MRI scan or other imaging if required. They then determine the most appropriate rehabilitation plan for the patient, including rapid access to orthopaedic surgery when clinically indicated.</p>
	<p pid="b.132W.2/5">Very occasionally the most seriously injured patients will require specialised care and treatment that can best be provided outside the NHS or MOD's own facilities. One example is neurological injury, where the best specialist treatment can often be provided by organisations such as the Royal Hospital for Neuro-disability at Putney, which is a national centre of expertise in its particular field.</p>
	<p pid="b.132W.2/6">We also provide treatment for psychological as well as physical injuries. Mental health services in the UK are delivered through a combination of community-based outpatient care and local inpatient treatment through the Priory Group of hospitals. MOD runs its own 15 Departments of Community Mental Health situated around the UK, with others based in Germany, Cyprus and Gibraltar. Their teams comprise psychiatrists, mental health nurses, clinical psychologists and mental health social workers. The full range of psychiatric and psychological treatments is available, including medication, psychological therapies and environmental adjustment where appropriate. The Defence Mental Health Services have particular expertise in psychological treatments for mental health problems in general, and psychological injury in particular, using such treatments as Cognitive Behaviour Therapy (CBT) and Eye Movement Desensitisation and Reprocessing (EMDR).</p>

	<p pid="b.133W.2/1" class="holdinganswer">holding answer <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-19">19 March 2007</phrase></p>
	<p pid="b.133W.2/2">The key factor in the Government's duty of care towards the members of the armed forces is ensuring they receive high-quality medical care, both while deployed on operations and back in the UK. This can range from life-saving surgery&mdash;both in our deployed field hospitals and NHS facilities in the UK&mdash;to treatment of routine ailments on a daily basis.</p>
	<p pid="b.133W.2/3">At a pan-government level the MOD works with the Department of Health and with other UK health departments to agree policy and improvements in communication.</p>
	<p pid="b.133W.2/4">Most primary care of-military personnel is provided at unit level by members of the Defence Medical Services (DMS). For physical illness or injury, MOD has its own rehabilitation facilities, with secondary care in the form of hospital treatment in the UK provided by NHS hospital trusts. This is the most effective way of enabling military patients to benefit from the latest advances in medical treatment and the recent major investments in NHS facilities. Casualties from overseas are referred usually to the University Hospital Birmingham Foundation Trust (UHBFT), which leads the way in the UK for the acute care of patients with complex traumatic injuries of the types suffered by our personnel on operations.</p>
	<p pid="b.133W.2/5">Care for the vast majority of service personnel with mental illness is provided at one of our 15 military Departments of Community Mental Health (DCMH) in the UK and equivalents overseas. This gives our patients access to high quality care, providing regional care within easy reach of unit, base or home. For those few that require inpatient mental health care a contract has been established with the Priory to provide high quality regional care. Close liaison takes place between the Priory and the DCMH. Furthermore the MOD has recently introduced the Reserves Mental Health Programme, which is improving the overall health care we offer to recently demobilised reservists. Information is available by visiting <a href="http://www.armv.mod.uk/rtmc/rmhp.htm">http://www.armv.mod.uk/rtmc/rmhp.htm</a> or concerned individual reservists or their GPs can contact a free phone number.</p>
	<p pid="b.133W.2/6">Wider support to injured personnel and their families is provided by a range of organisations, often at regimental and unit level. The main central provider of hospital welfare services is the Defence Medical Welfare Service (DMWS), which is contracted by the MOD to provide welfare support to service personnel and entitled civilians who are in hospital in the UK, Germany, Cyprus and on deployed operations. Patients are informed about other appropriate welfare agencies. These include the single service welfare services as well as service charities such as SSAFA, St. Dunstan's, Combat Stress, Royal British Legion, etc. and we are graceful for their support.</p>
	<p pid="b.133W.2/7">The single services operate &quot;long-term sick&quot; policies and welfare procedures for patients discharged from hospital. Each of the single services tracks its own patients and coordinates welfare support, which includes drawing on the support provided by service charitable organisations such as SSAFA and individual regimental charities. Families are assigned a visiting officer who acts as the link between the family and the services, and will also direct the family to the most appropriate internal and external welfare agencies for specific areas of support.</p>
	<p pid="b.133W.2/8">There is long-standing policy that the NHS, not MOD, provides care for ex-service personnel. However, the MOD funds courses of care at facilities run by the mental health charity 'Combat Stress', for those whose conditions are due to service and for whom this is an appropriate course. These procedures are under constant review to ensure that the support provided meets the needs of the recipients.</p>
	<p pid="b.133W.2/9">The Department routinely meets the various organisations governmental and non-governmental organisations described above to ensure an integrated approach to care.</p>

	<p pid="b.134W.2/1">Injured Service personnel receive an overall excellent standard of medical care. Serious cases require access to a broad range of skills only available in a NHS specialist trauma centre. This is provided by University Hospital Birmingham Foundation Trust for casualties from overseas. Subsequently, the seriously injured are frequently referred to the Defence Medical Rehabilitation Centre at Headley Court, offering world class rehabilitation care tailored to the specific needs of the patient. Patients with less serious musculoskeletal injuries are normally referred to one of our 15 regional rehabilitation units in the UK and overseas.</p>
	<p pid="b.134W.2/2">Mental health services in the UK are delivered through a combination of military community-based out-patient cafe supporting local in-patient treatment through the Priory Group of hospitals. MOD runs its own 15 Departments of Community Mental Health situated in the UK and overseas. The full range of psychiatric and psychological treatments are available, and where necessary, in-patient facilities are provided by the Priority Group.</p>

	<p pid="b.136W.3/2">If an injury sustained in theatre warrants the immediate removal of a limb, the operation will be conducted under field conditions. Service personnel injured while on operation in Iraq or Afghanistan who require further medical treatment are usually aero-medically evacuated to Selly Oak hospital in Birmingham. Once evacuated to the UK, the patient will undergo detailed assessment by the hospital clinical team and further medical treatment, if required, will be carried out. We are aware of no cases of service personnel contracting an infection while in theatre, in transit, or as a military patient being treated in Birmingham that has subsequently led to a limb amputation.</p>
	<p pid="b.136W.3/3">University Hospital Birmingham (UBB) has robust procedures in place to minimise the risk of infection and counter its affects in both its civilian and military patients. UHB does collect overall infection rates, and in total for all patients, it has had 93 MRSA bacteraemia reports across the Queen Elizabeth and Selly Oak hospital sites from April 2006 to the end of February 2007. This equates to 0.09 per cent. of the around 100,000 (mostly civilian) in-patients and day cases treated in this time period and only 0.02 per cent. of the total 500,000 of all patients treated in this period. UHB's MRSA bacteraemia reports have reduced by 32 per cent. in the last two years.</p>
	<p pid="b.136W.3/4">Neither the UHB nor the Ministry of Defence holds a separate database or a record of military patients who have reported MRSA or other viral infections. Therefore, the precise number of military patients diagnosed with MRSA or viral infections in NHS hospitals is not available centrally. This information could be obtained only by searching through individual medical records with that person's permission, and this could be provided only at disproportionate cost.</p>

	<p pid="b.137W.2/2">Data migration for Army personnel has been a challenge due to the sheer volume concerned and the age and diversity of the legacy systems involved. The current estimate is that the proportion of personnel who will experience a variance in basic pay in the first month of transition will be between 0.5 per cent. and 3 per cent. This incorporates Army and RAF reserves, as well as regular Army. For specialist pay the proportion is expected to be between 4 per cent. and 8 per cent. Work between now and the first live pay run in April is expected to result in the variances being at the lower end of the estimates range. In cases of mismatch of either basic pay or specialist pay the individuals affected will be notified by the Army in advance and where necessary local payments will be made to ensure hardship is not an issue. Action will be taken to inform the May pay run.</p>

	<p pid="b.144W.8/1">In 2004, the Ministry of Defence's office space in central London amounted to a total net internal area of 148,000m<sup>(2)</sup>; of which 55,000m<sup>(2)</sup> was leased and 93,000m<sup>(2)</sup> owned. By 2006 the figures had reduced to a total of 99,000m<sup>(2)</sup>; of which 16,000m<sup>(2)</sup> was leased and 83,000m<sup>(2)</sup> owned.</p>
	<p pid="b.144W.8/2">During 2004, the Main Building redevelopment was completed and the building reoccupied, allowing the closure of a number of buildings used as decant accommodation and an overall reduction in the number of MOD office buildings in central London from seven to three. This reflects the progress the Department has made to reduce the size of the London estate, while maintaining the efficient and effective delivery of defence objectives.</p>

Suggestions are regularly put forward by troops on the ground and progressed up the chain of command, some of which will be progressed as USURs, but many can be met with equipment already available so there is no requirement to progress further. Those which do not progress beyond initial discussions and staffing are not routinely recorded.</p>
	<p pid="b.155W.0/2">It is rare that a USUR be rejected once it leaves theatre, as the level of staffing will normally have ironed out any issues before it is forwarded. There are occasions when staff at the Permanent Joint Headquarters (PJHQ) will return a USUR for further work prior to its approval, but this does not amount to a rejection, as in most cases it will subsequently be accepted.</p>
	<p pid="b.155W.0/3">Information on the number of USURs endorsed by the chain of command for Afghanistan is only held centrally from 2005-06. Information for both theatres for 2006-07 includes USURs endorsed up to <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-05">5 March 2007</phrase>. The following table gives figures for the number of USURs endorsed by PJHQ, the last stage of approval in the chain of command prior to them being issued an Urgent Operational Requirement (UOR) number and becoming a UOR. The figures therefore equate to the number progressed as UORs.</p>

	<p pid="b.156W.5/1">If an injury sustained in theatre warrants the immediate removal of a limb, the operation will be conducted under field conditions. Service personnel injured while on operation in Iraq or Afghanistan who require further medical treatment are usually aero-medically evacuated to Selly Oak hospital in Birmingham. Once evacuated to the UK, the patient will undergo detailed assessment by the hospital clinical team and further medical treatment, if required, will be carried out. We are aware of no cases of service personnel contracting an infection while in theatre, in transit, or as a military patient being treated in Birmingham that has subsequently led to a limb amputation.</p>
	<p pid="b.156W.5/2">University Hospital Birmingham (UBB) has robust procedures in place to minimise the risk of infection and counter its affects in both its civilian and military patients. UHB does collect overall infection rates, and in total for all patients, it has had 93 MRSA bacteraemia reports across the Queen Elizabeth and Selly Oak hospital sites from April 2006 to the end of February 2007. This equates to 0.09 per cent. of the around 100,000 (mostly civilian) in-patients and day cases treated in this time period and only 0.02 per cent. of the total 500,000 of all patients treated in this period. UHB's MRSA bacteraemia reports have reduced by 32 per cent. in the last two years.</p>
	<p pid="b.156W.5/3">Neither the UHB nor the Ministry of Defence holds a separate database or a record of military patients who have reported MRSA or other viral infections. Therefore, the precise number of military patients diagnosed with MRSA or viral infections in NHS hospitals is not available centrally. This information could be obtained only by searching through individual medical records with that person's permission, and this could be provided only at disproportionate cost.</p>

	<p pid="b.163W.0/1">We are improving the capability of the Fleet with the largest warship building programme this country has seen for many years. We have introduced new amphibious assault and support ships that are vastly more capable than the ships they replaced. We are bringing into service the Type 45 Destroyers, which are the most capable air-defence destroyers ever built for the Royal Navy. We plan to replace the present fleet of aircraft carriers with the future aircraft carriers, which will be the largest warships ever to see service with the Royal Navy. The Type 22 Frigates have many years of service ahead of them, and are planned to be replaced in due course by the new and more capable Future Surface Combatant.</p>

There were, however, instances where a device could not be found. In these instances, it was concluded the UXB had either travelled underground to a depth and position where it could not be reached, it had broken up on impact, leaving only fragments, or the report was mistaken and no UXB existed. It was decided that such UXB sites did not represent an immediate danger to the public, and they were added to the Abandoned Bomb Register. These sites would only be further investigated if new evidence arose or a device was unearthed. There are 26 possible UXB sites on the Abandoned Bomb Register for Wales; none of these is in Pembrokeshire.</p>

In addition, in deciding whether or not to make an adverse public interest finding, he will have regard to the Competition Commission's conclusions on the public interest issues.</p>

	<p pid="b.170W.5/1">Digital switchover is expected to have an impact on both transmitter power usage and consumer power usage.</p>
	<p pid="b.170W.5/2">Digital transmission is more efficient than analogue in terms of power usage. Replacing the analogue terrestrial transmission network with a nationwide digital terrestrial television network will lead to a significant net reduction in energy usage by the transmission networks, estimated to be 186 GWh per year.</p>
	<p pid="b.170W.5/3">Consumer power usage is expected to rise as a result of switchover, primarily because of the rapid increase in the take-up of set-top boxes, particularly for second sets, which would not otherwise be converted until replaced. The predicted level of the increase is dependent on a number of assumptions about the usage and design of equipment in the market at the time of switchover. DCMS, DTI and Defra economists have estimated that the increase in consumer energy use of completing digital switchover in 2012 is likely to be between 966GWh and 2,816GWh per annum above that predicted for market take-up in the absence of a set switchover timetable. The central estimate for the total impact of switchover is a net increase of l,705GWh per year. This is equivalent to a 0.34 per cent. increase in domestic electricity consumption. This would be reduced if industry can be encouraged to make more energy-efficient products. Work on this is being taken forward as part of the DTI usability action plan.</p>

(from 249,000 to 233,500) in the three years to the end of 2008 as a possible consequence of globalisation.</p>
	<p pid="b.172W.8/3">However, in recent years the ICT sector has been one of the fastest growing UK employers and its prospects continue to look good. The UK is a leading software producer in Western Europe and, with a long-established reputation for excellence, attracts major multinationals from across the ICT and software sectors worldwide. The UK ICT sector has unique strengths including in the development of innovative software and its world-class capability in the management of complex programmes and in problem-solving and creative thinking.</p>
	<p pid="b.172W.8/4">According to statistics published by the Office for National Statistics, gross value added (at current prices) of the UK Computer and related services sector increased from &pound;7.7 billion to &pound;35.6 billion between 1995 and 2005. It also continues to be an export success story, with exports of computer services increasing from &pound;0.7 billion to &pound;4.6 billion between 1995 and 2005, and the UK trade surplus in computer services rising from &pound;0.4 billion to &pound;2.9 billion over the same period (UK Balance of Payment, 2006 Edition).</p>
	<p pid="b.172W.8/5">However, as markets become increasingly integrated with more international competition (and related opportunities), UK companies need to operate in a way that maximises their competitive advantage, For some, this has meant re-locating some operations to other countries, but the UK is also a major beneficiary of offshoring by overseas companies&mdash;we are the second largest global recipient of Foreign Direct Investment. This increasing movement of labour is the reality of a globalised economy and the Government's role in it is to create the conditions to ensure that the UK remains a competitive place to do business. This includes providing an environment which enables business to move up the value chain where it can.</p>

	<p pid="b.182W.3/1">The statutory recognition procedure applies to GB employers who, together with their associated employers, employ 21 or more workers. It is not possible to estimate precisely how many workers are employed in organisations which fall under this threshold. However, at the start of 2005, the estimated number of employees working in UK enterprises with 19 or fewer employees was 4,764,000. There are no estimates of the number of workers who are excluded from the statutory procedure because of their employment status. However, because the definition of &quot;worker&quot; used for the purpose of the statutory procedure is broad, the number is likely to be relatively low.</p>

	<p pid="b.182W.6/2">This measure, among others, will help us to make funds available to householders until June 2008 when some of our wider measures to support microgeneration should be taking hold.</p>
	<p pid="b.182W.6/3">It is important to note that in the Budget 2007, the Chancellor announced that a further &pound;6 million will be made available to the household stream of the programme, taking the total available to householders to more than &pound;18 million. We are discussing in detail the restructuring of the scheme with industry to ensure we can make the best use of the additional funds, and to address the operational difficulties that have been encountered over recent months. Taking into account the work required to re-shape the scheme, we have taken the necessary step to suspend the scheme for the monthly allocation in April, with a view to restarting the household stream of the programme in May 2007.</p>

	<p pid="b.183W.2/1">While this is a commercial matter, my understanding is that for a number of years, BT has applied a price differential between customers who pay their accounts by direct debit and those who pay by other means. This reflects the increased processing and debt management costs associated with payments not made by direct debit. Such differentials are common practice among communications providers and utility service providers.</p>
	<p pid="b.183W.2/2">From <phrase class="date" code="">1 May 2007</phrase>, BT is changing how it presents this differential from a discount for those customers paying by direct debit, to a charge for those paying by other means. BT has combined this change with an increase of &pound;1.50 a quarter in the charge (from &pound;3 to &pound;4.50).</p>
	<p pid="b.183W.2/3">The Light User Scheme, In Contact and BT Basic will not be affected by the increased charge. These are the special tariff schemes offered to vulnerable customers by BT as a result of the Universal Service Obligation placed on the company.</p>
	<p pid="b.183W.2/4">I have raised the matter with the chief executive officer of the independent regulator, the Office of Communications (Ofcom). Ofcom is considering whether any of the changes BT has recently made raise any regulatory issues and is coming back to me on this in April.</p>

	<p pid="b.189W.2/1">From April 2004 to September 2006, 38,813 children and young people participated in Creative Youth Partnership programmes.</p>
	<p pid="b.189W.2/2">The three-year pilot scheme was due to conclude at the end of March 2007, but funding has been secured to extend the pilot for a further year at existing levels of activity.</p>
	<p pid="b.189W.2/3">DCAL will be bidding for funding for Creative Youth Partnerships in the 2007 Comprehensive Spending Review and the future of the programme will be dependent on the outcome of this.</p>
	<p pid="b.189W.2/4">The programme has been evaluated by the Education and Training Inspectorate and the report on this will be published shortly. Early indications are that good progress has been made in meeting the overall objectives of the Creative Youth Partnerships initiative and that the Inspectorate recommends the continuation of the programme, as it enhances and supports the education of children and young people.</p>

The role of the authority will be to implement the Government's policies for health and social services, to manage performance of the system and to commission services to meet the demands of patients. These roles are not appropriate to a central Government Department. The new, much smaller DHSSPS will be able to focus on assisting the Minister with policy, legislation and strategic planning and resource allocation.

	<p pid="b.197W.8/3" class="indent">You recently asked the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland a parliamentary question regarding, what estimate he has made of the number of vehicles registered in the Republic of Ireland which used roads in Northern Ireland in each of the last six years. As Chief Executive of Roads Service, I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="b.197W.8/4" class="indent">I should explain that Roads Service collects data on the volume of traffic on Northern Ireland's roads to help contribute to the effective management of the road network and to help with the development of future road improvements. This data is collected via some 270 automatic traffic counting sites located on roads across Northern Ireland. This information is published in our annual Traffic and Travel Information Report (a copy of which can be obtained by writing to Mr. Brian Maxwell, Network Traffic Telematics Manager, Traffic information and Control Centre, 1b Airport Road, Belfast, BT3 9DY). The automatic traffic counting sites use loops cut into the road surface to detect vehicles as they pass. They provide details of the number of vehicles broken down into five classes (cars, light vans, articulated lorries etc).</p>
	<p pid="b.197W.8/5" class="indent">The majority of the main ('A' Class) border roads have an automatic counting site, but it is not possible from the information provided by these to determine the country of registration of a vehicle. Therefore it is not possible to make an estimate of the number of vehicles registered in the Republic of Ireland which used roads in Northern Ireland, from this source of information.</p>
	<p pid="b.197W.8/6" class="indent">In order to ascertain the number of vehicles registered in the Republic of Ireland using roads in Northern Ireland each year, it would be necessary to carry out a survey that noted the registration numbers of vehicles passing various points. Roads Service currently does not carry out this type of survey and has no plans to do so.</p>
	<p pid="b.197W.8/7" class="indent">My officials also consulted with other relevant Departments, but it would appear that they do not collect the information you requested either.</p>

	<p pid="b.212W.6/2" class="italic"> Letter from Dr. Malcolm McKibbin<i> ,</i> dated <phrase class="date" code="2007-04-03">3 April 2007</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="b.212W.6/3" class="indent">You recently asked the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland a parliamentary question regarding, what recent assessment has been carried out by his Department of the adequacy of <i> (a)</i> road safety (i) signage and (ii) measures and <i> (b)</i> sightlines at Six Road Ends in Bangor. As this issue falls within my responsibility as Chief Executive of Roads Service, I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="b.212W.6/4" class="indent">As you may be aware, Roads Service commenced a junction improvement scheme at Six Road Ends, Bangor in August 2006. Proposals for this improvement scheme were initiated as a result of the 14 recorded personal injury collisions, including one fatality at this location over the past 10 years. In addition, it was noted that motorists experienced lengthy delays during peak periods as a result of the complicated nature of the junction.</p>
	<p pid="b.212W.6/5" class="indent">The current scheme aims to improve road safety for all road users at the junction, by reducing congestion and driver confusion. It involves the construction of a four leg roundabout with Green Road and Ballycrochan Road realigned to form priority junctions with Gransha Road and Cotton Road respectively. Sightlines, designed in accordance with the requirements of the Design Manual for Roads and Bridges, for the new roundabout scheme have been greatly improved.</p>
	<p pid="b.212W.6/6" class="indent">With regards signage, Roads Service erects traffic signs permitted under the Traffic Signs Regulations (NI) 1997. These signs are designed and erected in accordance with the Traffic Sign Manual and this will be the case with signage at the new roundabout at Six Road Ends.</p>
	<p pid="b.212W.6/7" class="indent">A scheme of this nature is subject to an independent safety audit after completion of each of the preliminary design, detailed design and construction stages. As part of the planning approval process, the scheme received the approval of both Down District and Ards borough councils when presented in detail before both on <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-26">26 July 2005</phrase> and <phrase class="date" code="2005-09-13">13 September 2005</phrase> respectively.

	<p pid="b.216W.3/1">The Chief Executive of Roads Service (Dr. Malcolm McKibbin) has been asked to write to the hon. Lady in response to this question.</p>
	<p pid="b.216W.3/2" class="italic"> Letter from Dr. McKibbin, dated <phrase class="date" code="2007-04-03">3 April 2007</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="b.216W.3/3" class="indent">You recently asked the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland a Parliamentary Question regarding, on which roads in Northern Ireland a 20 mile per hour speed limit is imposed; and what assessment he has made of the effect on road safety at each location of such a limit.</p>
	<p pid="b.216W.3/4" class="indent">As this issue falls within my responsibility as Chief Executive of Roads Service, I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="b.216W.3/5" class="indent">By way of background, I should explain that a 20 mph speed limit is not normally introduced on individual roads. It is more common to introduce 20 mph zones, which are a form of traffic calming in residential areas where an extensive network of streets is involved and where self-enforcing measures can be provided to reduce vehicle speeds to approximately 20mph. Where speeds have been reduced to 20 mph by self-enforcing measures, it is then possible to introduce a mandatory 20 mph limit. However, if the level of traffic calming measures is insufficient to reduce speeds to around 20 mph, then it is unlikely that the Police Service of Northern Ireland would agree to the introduction of a mandatory 20 mph limit.</p>
	<p pid="b.216W.3/6" class="indent">Roads Service has implemented forty-eight 20 mph residential zones, the locations of which are listed in the following table. In addition, Roads Service is currently progressing a 20 mph zone for the Scrabo Estate, in Newtownards, through the approval stage.</p>
	<p pid="b.216W.3/7" class="indent">Roads Service currently monitors the effectiveness of all traffic calming schemes, including 20 mph zones, and this information is published in our annual Road Safety Engineering Report, a copy of which can be obtained from our website at: <a href="http://www.roadsni.gov.uk/Publications/specific/RoadSafetyEngReport0405-0506.pdf">http://www.roadsni.gov.uk/Publications/specific/RoadSafetyEngReport0405-0506.pdf</a> or by writing to Mr Brian Maxwell, Network Traffic Telematics Manager, Traffic Information and Control Centre, 1b Airport Road, Belfast, BT3 9DY. For each scheme, the number of injury collisions occurring over the three year period following introduction of a scheme, is compared with the collision history for a similar period prior to the works.</p>
	<p pid="b.216W.3/8" class="indent">At fourteen of the above forty-eight locations, where full monitoring data is available, there have been 88 fewer collisions involving an injury. This equates to a 32% reduction compared with a similar period before introduction of the 20 mph zones.</p>

	<p pid="b.222W.2/84">It is not possible to define all the reasons for the year-on-year changes in the costs of translations or to supply a comprehensive breakdown of the nature of the services provided. However, it is apparent that the volume of Irish language translations has fallen following the dissolution of the Assembly while EU enlargement and the increased immigrant population has seen a significant increase in the volume of ethnic language translations. The level of Ulster-Scots translations has remained fairly static over the period.</p>

	<p pid="b.231W.3/4" class="indent">In reply to your recent Parliamentary Question about the Child Support Agency, the Secretary of State promised a substantive reply from the Chief Executive.</p>
	<p pid="b.231W.3/5" class="indent">You asked the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, how many <i> (a)</i> old scheme and <i> (b)</i><i> </i>new scheme Child Support Agency cases were cleared in each month of the last two years for which figures are available.</p>
	<p pid="b.231W.3/6" class="indent">The information requested is presented in the attached table.</p>
	<p pid="b.231W.3/7" class="indent">The clearance process includes all work undertaken on applications for child maintenance until one of the following conditions is met: a parent with care has been identified as claiming Good Cause or is subject to a Reduced Benefit Decision; the application is identified as being a change of circumstances on an existing case; the application has been closed; or for old scheme cases a maintenance assessment has been carried out and for new scheme cases, a payment arrangement between the parent with care and the non-resident parent is in place.</p>
	<p pid="b.231W.3/8" class="indent">The Agency holds only a negligible number of completely unprocessed applications. The amount of work required to achieve clearance, and the length of time involved, varies considerably depending on, amongst other things, the circumstances of the parents and how readily they cooperate with the Agency. The work undertaken by the Agency's New Client Teams extends far beyond simply clearing new applications through the computer system. A significant proportion of the work undertaken by the Agency's New Client Teams consists of setting up the first maintenance payments to the parent with care, and retaining responsibility for this growing caseload until the first fully compliant, on time payment is made by the non-resident parent.</p>
	<p pid="b.231W.3/9" class="indent">In addition, under the Operational Improvement Plan, the Agency is committed to reducing the number of uncleared applications. The number of uncleared applications fell by 13 per cent. in the 12 months prior to December 2006, as the Agency made progress in clearing significant numbers of older, more complex cases. These cased often require a great deal more work than other applications and this is reflected in the increasing average age of cleared cases.</p>
	<p pid="b.231W.3/10" class="indent">For future reference, information on the number of new scheme clearances is publicly available in the Child Support Agency Quarterly Summary of Statistics (QSS), a copy of which is available in the House of Commons Library, or on the internet via the following link: <a href="http://www.dwp.gov.uk/asd/asd1/child_support/csa_quarterly_dec06.asp">http//www.dwp.gov.uk/asd/asd1/child_support/csa_quarterly_dec06.asp</a>.</p>

	<p pid="b.234W.0/1">An accurate estimate of the impact on child poverty cannot be given. This is because the employment rate for lone parents with a youngest child aged 11 years or over is currently 69 per cent. The relatively small change involved in raising this to 70 per cent. creates problems of sampling error, preventing accurate estimates of impact.</p>

In particular, this includes our arrangements for gathering information on the effect of our policies and practices on the recruitment, development and retention of our disabled employees and making use of that information.</p>
	<p pid="b.235W.5/7">When we recruit externally, all advertisements contain the &quot;Positive About Disabled People Two Ticks Symbol&quot;, and the Department ensures that all applicants who declare a disability are given reasonable adjustments at each stage of the selection process to ensure they are competing on a level playing field.</p>
	<p pid="b.235W.5/8">When disabled applicants are successful, all relevant adjustments are made, in consultation with the individual and expert advisers where appropriate.

	<p pid="b.245W.2/4" class="indent">The current Jobcentre Plus network in England and Wales consists of 717 Jobcentres providing face to face access for customers. In addition we have 28 Contact Centres, which allow customers to access our services using telephones. There are currently 68 Benefit Delivery Centres in England and Wales which process benefit, and a further two Benefit Delivery Centres, one in Scotland and one in Northern Ireland which also process benefit for customers in London. Within our network we have a number of other feeder sites, some of which have a dual role as front facing offices, still processing benefit. These sites will reduce month on month as they migrate work into the main Benefit Delivery Centres by March 2008.</p>
	<p pid="b.245W.2/5" class="indent">Customers are now using our Jobcentres differently. More of our face-to-face customer contact is on an appointment basis and information on job vacancies is readily available by telephone and the internet.

Jobcentre closures are operational issues. For Jobcentre Plus we are using a six week consultation period. This period has recently been extended from three weeks at the request of Ministers. We think that this allows ample time for the views of stakeholders to be considered.</p>

	<p pid="b.246W.3/35">The discrepancy between the number of NINOs allocated and the increase in the overall numbers of cases in issue is due to the differences in Child Reference Numbers allocated and those changing to NINOs at aged 16 years, which is closely linked to birth rates over a 16-year period.</p>
	<p pid="b.246W.3/36">NINOs are not normally deleted from the Departmental Central Index (DCI) or Customer Information System (CIS). For example, they are retained after a person dies or moves abroad. This is because individuals who move abroad may at some point have a call upon contributions paid whilst in the UK. In the case of deceased individuals, a partner may make a claim for a contributory benefit, which is dependent on the contribution record of the deceased individual. This means that the number of accounts held on the system accrues as NINOs are allocated each year.</p>
	<p pid="b.246W.3/37">A joint data cleansing exercise was carried out in 2000-01 with Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs, who jointly own the NINO. This exercise identified NINOs for which there had been no activity for a considerable period of time and which were not known to the National Insurance Recording System (NIRs). This exercise removed 200,000 NINOs from DCI.</p>

	<p pid="b.256W.5/1">There is strong evidence to suggest that sanctions do drive behaviour. Of those claiming jobseekers allowance (JSA) the vast majority comply with the JSA conditions; only 14 per cent. Are actually referred for a decision and only 4 per cent. Actually have a sanction applied. Research of those that have and have not been sanctioned on JSA found that nearly half of those sanctioned think their own sanction was fair.</p>
	<p pid="b.256W.5/2">80 per cent. Of lone parents attend work focused interviews (WFI). Of the 20 per cent. Who fail to attend the majority, two thirds, go on to attend their subsequent WFI following a sanction or threat of a sanction.</p>
	<p pid="b.256W.5/3">In the pathways pilots only around 1 per cent. Of customers have been sanctioned.</p>
	<p pid="b.256W.5/4">These figures suggest that the overwhelming majority of claimants meet the conditions and understand the need for sanctions when those conditions are not met.</p>
	<p pid="b.256W.5/5">While there is a financial penalty to sanctions the threat of sanctioning is usually enough to deter non-compliance with the rules. But where there is non-compliance and a sanction is applied, it has to be sufficient to drive home the message that benefit is only paid to those who meet the conditions.</p>

State pension and carer's allowance are both income maintenance benefits, and they are not payable in full at the same time because this would involve duplicate provision from public funds. However, where state pension is payable at less than the rate of carer's allowance, an amount of carer's allowance can be paid to make up the difference.</p>

	<p pid="b.265W.9/2">A section on the provision of CCTV on fire appliances has been included in the recently published Fire and Rescue Service Circular, 14/2007 (issued <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-15">15 March 2007</phrase>) 'Tackling Violence at Work: Good Practice Guidance Document for Fire and Rescue Services' The extract from this document that relates to CCTV provides evidence that CCTV reduces attacks on crews and appliances. The guidance points out that the use of CCTV cameras comes under the scope of the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 (RIPA) and the Data Protection Act 1988 (DPA).</p>
	<p pid="b.265W.9/3">The circular outlines the importance of CCTV in providing continuity of evidence needed to meet the requirements of The Police and Criminal Evidence Act (PACE), to support the principles of &quot;prevent and deter&quot; and can provide evidence to catch and convict perpetrators. The circular recommended that authorities should consider the use of CCTV in support of staff that may be exposed to violence at work in identified areas of high risk (Ref 7.1.3).</p>
	<p pid="b.265W.9/4">Reference to the provision of CCTV on fire appliances has also been made in the &quot;Pumping Appliance Output Based Specification and Compliance Statement&quot; that forms part of the &quot;Firebuy&quot; Tender framework agreements for pumping appliances, which stated that a CCTV system with 360 vision and a record facility should be offered as part of any tender.</p>

This makes clear that new development should be located to optimise its carbon performance and make the most of existing and planned opportunities for decentralised, renewable and low-carbon energy supplies. In 2006 the Government amended Part L of the Building Regulations to increase energy efficiency standards.

Housing associations which wish to become Registered Social Landlords (RSLs), registration is dependent on the housing association meeting the Charity Commission and the Housing Corporation's registration criteria.</p>
	<p pid="b.272W.2/2">In addition, RSLs that are charitable Industrial and Provident Act Societies (IPS) have to meet the Housing Corporation and Financial Services Authority's (FSA) registration criteria. The Charity Commission cannot register these bodies. They are registered as legal entities by the FSA with charitable objects (standard model clauses agreed by the Charity Commission, FSA, National Housing Federation and the Housing Corporation). IPS housing associations can apply to the Inland Revenue for recognition as a charity. If recognised they are known as exempt charities. Currently 680 housing associations fall into this category.</p>

	<p pid="b.279W.3/1">No general guidelines have been issued to local authorities in relation to the sale of local authority land. However, local authorities have general and discretionary powers under s.123 of the Local Government Act 1972 to dispose of land in any manner they wish. The Secretary of State's only statutory function is to give or refuse consent to a proposed disposal where the authority will receive less than the best consideration that can reasonably be obtained which is usually the open market value of the site.</p>
	<p pid="b.279W.3/2">The General Disposal Consent issued in August 2003 in ODPM Circular 06/2003 gave local authorities a very wide discretion in relation to their land disposals and enables them to make disposals which will contribute to the promotion or improvement of the economic, social or environmental well-being of an area at less than best consideration provided the undervalue does not exceed &pound;2 million. The circular provides advice on making an application for a disposal that falls outside the terms of the general consent and it also makes it clear that, when disposing of land an undervalue, authorities should remain aware of the need to fulfil their fiduciary duty in a way that is accountable to local people.</p>
	<p pid="b.279W.3/3">If the land is held planning purposes it can be disposed of by means of a specific consent under s.233 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990. Disposal consents have also been issued in relation to housing land under the Housing Act 1985.</p>

Torbay council identified a location at the Yalberton Valley as one of several options for this new community, but my information is that no decision has been taken. As the website says, decisions on whether to develop a new community, and where, are matters for the Local Development Framework, which will be the subject of community involvement and public examination by an independent planning inspector.</p>

	<p pid="b.287W.2/1" class="holdinganswer">holding answer <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-19">19 March 2007</phrase></p>
	<p pid="b.287W.2/2">The decision was informed by the large body of evidence which shows that academies are an effective way of improving performance in underperforming schools and that despite the overall rise in education standards over the last decade there will remain a significant number of schools beyond the initial target of 200 academies which are underperforming and would benefit by becoming an academy.</p>
	<p pid="b.287W.2/3">The percentage of pupils getting five good GCSEs including English and Maths in academies improved last year alone by 6.2 percentage points&mdash;six times better than the national improvement rate of one percentage point&mdash;and all 21 academies which had students who took GCSEs in 2006 are above the floor targets; 18 of the 24 predecessor schools they replaced were below.</p>
	<p pid="b.287W.2/4">Academies are making dramatic improvements at key stage three&mdash;above the national average&mdash;with rises last year of 8.1 percentage points in English, nine percentage points in Maths and 10.5 percentage points in Science compared to previous validated results.</p>
	<p pid="b.287W.2/5">16 academies have had full Ofsted inspections. Key to the future success of the academies is their leadership and management. On this indicator Ofsted has classed two academies as outstanding, 10 as good, three as satisfactory and one as inadequate.</p>
	<p pid="b.287W.2/6">Academies are popular with parents. There were three applications for each academy place in September 2006. Almost all academies were oversubscribed on opening and each year afterwards.</p>
	<p pid="b.287W.2/7">There is growing support from local authorities. For example, Manchester city council has ambitious plans for eight academies across the city&mdash;strategically targeting underperforming schools in disadvantaged communities and forming part of wider programmes of regeneration.</p>
	<p pid="b.287W.2/8">Last year's independent PricewaterhouseCoopers evaluation of academies found strong pupil and teacher support for academies. It included a survey reporting that 81 per cent. of pupils thought their school work had improved since joining the academy and that total attendance in academies had risen and at a faster rate than the national average.</p>
	<p pid="b.287W.2/9">All of the above were factors in the decision to expand the programme to 400. The case has since been reinforced by the positive findings of the NAO report on academies published last month, which found that academies are &quot;on track to deliver good value for money&quot;. The NAO concluded that academies are improving performance compared with predecessor schools, and that the improvement is faster than in comparable schools.</p>

Pupils should be entitled to access all learning relevant to the key stage at the level most appropriate to them. The current tiered curriculum creates an artificial ceiling of expectation for pupils following the foundation tier. The new single programme of study will enable teachers to personalise the curriculum to suit the needs of individual pupils, allowing them to engage with mathematics at all levels.</p>

	<p pid="b.311W.5/3" class="indent">Your recent parliamentary question has been passed to me, as Her Majesty's Chief Inspector, for reply.</p>
	<p pid="b.311W.5/4" class="indent">You asked what assessment is made by Ofsted during its regular inspections of state secondary schools on the provision of field visits.</p>
	<p pid="b.311W.5/5" class="indent">The current school inspection process focuses on the overall effectiveness of the school. It does not specifically require inspectors to make a comment or judgment on the provision of field visits. However, inspectors often make reference to the value of learning outside the classroom in the context of the 'enjoy and achieve' outcome of 'Every Child Matters'. They may also refer to the contribution made by field visits to the curriculum and specifically to the quality and range of enrichment opportunities offered by a school.</p>
	<p pid="b.311W.5/6" class="indent">More detail is obtained from our programme of subject surveys, obtained from visits to a sample of 30 secondary schools each year. During the last year, as part of our geography survey, we have focused on 'the quality of fieldwork'. A report drawing on this evidence will be published later this year, with examples of good practice. Ofsted has also been commissioned by the DFES to carry out a survey inspection in 2007-08 of education outside the classroom.</p>
