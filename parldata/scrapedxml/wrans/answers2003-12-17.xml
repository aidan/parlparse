	<p pid=".902W.0/1">Defra provides grant aid to the flood and coastal defence operating authorities to support their capital schemes to reduce flood risk. These projects must meet specified criteria and an appropriate priority score to attract Defra funding but decisions regarding which projects to promote and their timing rest with these authorities. The principal operating authority for flood risk is the Environment Agency (EA) but local authorities (LAs) and, in areas with special drainage needs, internal drainage boards (IDBs) also carry out works on a much smaller scale overall.</p>
	<p pid=".902W.0/2">Investment in flood defence schemes in Yorkshire and Humber was as set out in the table. For the Agency, this represents their total capital expenditure; for LAs and IDBs the figures represent grant payments from Defra which form a proportion of the total grant eligible cost (25 per cent. (45 per cent. for tidal or sea defence schemes) up to April 2001 and 45 per cent. thereafter). Local authorities are eligible for further support for their balance of grant costs from the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister through its local authority funding mechanism.</p>

	<p pid=".903W.11/4">Under the Water Resources Act it is an offence to remove deposits in watercourses which have accumulated behind a weir, dam or sluice and allow that deposit to be carried away in suspension without consent from the Agency. An example would be lifting a sluice and letting all the silt flow downstream, which might adversely affect the fauna.</p>
	<p pid=".903W.11/5">Other consents or licences that landowners might need include:</p>
	<p pid=".903W.11/6" class="indent">A waste regulation licence, if they intend to backfill the pond;</p>
	<p pid=".903W.11/7" class="indent">A need for a fish rescue consent to transfer fish from the pond;</p>
	<p pid=".903W.11/8" class="indent">An abstraction licence;</p>
	<p pid=".903W.11/9" class="indent">Under some circumstances an Environmental Impact Assessment may also be required.</p>
	<p pid=".903W.11/10">All these would depend on the circumstances. Landowners should therefore consult the relevant operating authority.</p>

	<p pid=".904W.5/1">Through the continued efforts of the member states under EC Regulation 2037/2000 and other Parties to the Montreal Protocol on substances that deplete the ozone layer, there has been a decline in the amount of chlorine in the upper and lower atmosphere. This is a good indicator of when the stratospheric ozone layer will recover. At the present rate the ozone layer is expected to start recovering by the middle of the century.</p>
	<p pid=".904W.5/2">If action had not been taken under EC Regulation 2037/2000 and the Montreal Protocol the ozone layer would have continued to be destroyed, resulting in more ultra violet radiation reaching the ground, which would have had a detrimental affect on plant and animal life.</p>
	<p pid=".904W.5/3">In the UK, the increase in ultra violet radiation could result in increases in skin cancer and eye cataracts as well a damage to marine life, which also form part of the food chain.</p>

	<p pid=".907W.9/1">The Government are committed to sustainable forest management and is playing a leading role in international negotiations on forests in a number of fora, including the Convention on Biological Diversity, and the United Nations Forum on Forests (UNFF). The Government are also playing a major role internationally to combat illegal logging and its associated trade, in addition to seeking to ensure that the import of endangered timber species is in compliance with CITES, the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species.</p>
	<p pid=".907W.9/2">Under EU law, a ban on the import of illegally logged timber can only be imposed at EU level. We are therefore playing an active role within the European Forest Law Enforcement, Governance and Trade (FLEGT) process. On <phrase class="date" code="2003-10-13">13 October</phrase> the EU Council of Ministers adopted Council Conclusions providing a broad endorsement of the FLEGT Action Plan, which addresses development co-operation, trade in timber, public procurement, private sector initiatives, financing and investment safeguards, money laundering and conflict timber</p>
	<p pid=".907W.9/3">The Government are also keen to discourage consumers from purchasing illegally logged timber. For over three years UK central departments and their executive agencies have been required to actively seek to purchase their timber and timber related products from legal and sustainable sources. We believe the UK to be the first country to implement such a policy. The challenge is considerable and implementation has not been without difficulty, but already the effect is being felt in the UK and abroad. The UK Devolved Administrations and many local authorities in England have indicated that they have adopted similar policies or are considering doing so. Additionally, the UK Timber Trade Federation is developing a sustainable timber procurement policy for its members to consider adopting.</p>

	<p pid=".912W.6/1">The proposal to double global aid levels by providing an additional US$50 billion a year through an International Finance Facility is being taken forward in partnership with the international community. The Government continue to push for further international agreement to the initiative. The International Finance Facility will be most effective if all major donor countries are involved.</p>
	<p pid=".912W.6/2">The Facility received wide support from other countries at the Annual Meetings of the World Bank and IMF in September 2003. The Bank and Fund have been mandated to do further work on financing for development options, including the International Finance Facility, reporting back at the Spring and Annual Meetings in 2004.</p>
	<p pid=".912W.6/3">The Annual Meetings also agreed that developing and emerging market countries should be consulted. This process will include a ministerial conference on Financing for Development in spring 2004, chaired by the French Government.</p>
	<p pid=".912W.6/4">The UK Government continue to build the support in civil society necessary to make the initiative a reality. In February, the Treasury will be hosting a conference bringing together the President of the World Bank with representatives from faith groups, media, business, Government and non-governmental organisations from across the UK.</p>

Our bilateral funding has increased seven-fold, from &pound;38 million in 1997&ndash;98 to more than &pound;270 million in 2002&ndash;03. The UK was instrumental in setting up the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, TB and Malaria and has committed US$ 280 million over seven years to ensure it has long term stability of funding.

	<p pid=".915W.5/1">HIV/AIDS in Asia is a critical development issue. With 7.4 million Asians already infected, we are now seeing the epidemic spreading into previously unaffected areas and countries. If current rates of growth continue, there may be as many as 25 million people infected in India and 15 million in China, by 2010. Infections on this scale are of grave concern. If they continue at current rates and meaningful action is not taken, it is likely that by 2020 Asia will overtake Africa as the centre of the epidemic.</p>
	<p pid=".915W.5/2">DFID's strategy in Asia is to focus efforts on preventing the further spread of the epidemic. In most countries the epidemic is still concentrated in vulnerable groups, principally sex workers and their clients, injecting drug users, and men who have sex with men. The challenge is to prevent spread into the general population. We have seen some success in Thailand and Cambodia from which it will be important to learn.</p>
	<p pid=".915W.5/3">In addition to support through mechanisms such as the Global Fund for AIDS, TB and Malaria, and to e.g. vaccine research, DFID supports major HIV/AIDS control initiatives in eight countries in Asia. Current commitments are in excess of &pound;260 million. Our focus at country level is on support to the development and implementation of effective national AIDS strategies and plans, in partnership with governments, civil society, the private sector, and other donors DFID also funds regional cross-border initiatives with vulnerable populations in SE Asia, and advocacy work by the Asia Pacific Leadership Forum on HIV/AIDS.</p>

	<p pid=".916W.5/1">The livelihoods of thousands of Palestinians have been drastically affected by the separation of villages from their agricultural land and water resources. The fence fragments communities and isolates people from vital social support networks. Residents are being cut off from schools, universities and medical care. According to the latest Israeli Government projections approximately 210,000 acres, or 14.5 per cent. of West Bank land, excluding East Jerusalem, will lie between the fence and the Green Line. This land is some of the most fertile in the West Bank and is home to 274,000 people. Of those, some 70,000 do not have Israeli residency permits and, as a consequence, may feel it necessary to move east of the fence in order to retain access to basic services.</p>

	<p pid=".918W.5/1">DFID accounts for expenditure on forestry but does not distinguish between different types of forests. The following figures apply to forests in general and not specifically to rainforests. They relate to bilateral expenditure and are exclusive of spending on research under the Forestry Research Programme, which has averaged about &pound;2.5 million per annum since 1997.</p>
	<p pid=".918W.5/2">In financial year 1997&ndash;98 expenditure was &pound;22.1 million, on 199 projects. In financial year 2002&ndash;03 expenditure was &pound;20.6 million, on 99 projects. Expenditure was fairly constant during this six-year period but there was a steady decline in the number of projects. This is a consequence of a focus on a smaller number of larger projects, more directly in support of poverty reduction. In addition, the last six years has seen the closure of a number of smaller programmes, particularly in Latin America.</p>

	<p pid=".918W.11/3">Accordingly, DFID will continue to channel our growing support to education through our bilateral country programmes in the form of long term, flexible and predictable funding in support of the Government's own development plans. We believe this is the best way to provide flexible financing, improve harmonisation and reduce transaction costs. We will continue to press for closer donor collaboration to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of all external education assistance. The FTI has an important role to play in this.

These areas do not recover their camera-related costs from fine income and therefore there is no obligation on them to inform central Government about camera activity or number of cameras in operation in their areas. We expect all but Durham to be part of the netting off programme by July 2004.</p>

	<p pid=".928W.5/2">The safety of toys is covered by the Toys (Safety) Regulations 1995 which are supported by European harmonised standards. A new part eight to the BSEN 71 series of toy standards, which introduced a maximum saddle height of 600mm for carousels and rocking activity toys, was recently agreed by the European technical committee which develops the standards. The primary intention of this measurement is to identify which toys need to undergo stability testing and it was not intended as a restriction on the maximum height of rocking horses. It has been accepted that an unintentional oversight has occurred and steps are being taken to rectify the matter. In the meantime, the DTI and LACORS (the Local Authorities Co-ordinators of Regulatory Services) have issued advice to local authority enforcement departments and testing laboratories on the current legal situation, emphasising that rocking horses with a saddle height greater than 600mm have not 'become' unsafe as a result of the new standard nor are any already on the market now unsafe for use.</p>
	<p pid=".928W.5/3">Although trampolines are not covered by the standard, it does specify safety requirements for toys incorporating crossbars eg climbing frames and swings.</p>
	<p pid=".928W.5/4">The BSEN 71 series of standards are a means of meeting the essential safety requirements of the toys safety Regulations. Those Regulations apply to all toys supplied on the UK market for use in play by children under 14 years of age.</p>

	<p pid=".930W.5/1">Under the DTI's &pound;20 million First Phase of the Major Photovoltaic Demonstration Programme, the target for Stream 1 (small-scale individual systems 0.5&ndash;5kWp) in 2002&ndash;03 was 300 approvals. This was later revised downwards to 200 approvals to reflect expected demand. This was confirmed by the fact that only 210 applications were actually received, of which 190 were approved. There is no annual target for Stream 2 (group housing and medium/large-scale non-residential buildings 5&ndash;100kWp), but the target for the three-year first phase is 140 projects, of which 45 were approved in the first year. 71 of the 190 approvals under Stream 1 were installed during 2002&ndash;03, but installation tends to lag three to six months behind approval. For Stream 2, no installations were completed in the first year as the time lag here tends to be six to twelve months from approval.</p>

In preparing closure proposals, Post Office Ltd. collect a range of information relevant to the provision of post office services in an area. This includes local authority plans, environmental and transport information, local shopping habits and other local developments and features. Post Office Ltd. is committed to taking full account of this information in preparing an area plan. With the move to area plans, the public consultation period has been extended from four to six weeks during which comments and representations, including new or additional information, can be submitted for consideration by Post Office Ltd. before they reach a final decision.</p>

	<p pid=".931W.2/1">The Department have made no such study. But the Government regards it as most important that people have good access to postal and Government services and is committed to doing all we can to ensure a viable Post Office network for the future. For the rural network the Post Office has made a firm commitment to maintain the network and prevent avoidable closures. The Government have underpinned that with &pound;450 million of funding. We have also made available an additional &pound;2 million fund to support community post office initiatives.</p>
	<p pid=".931W.2/2">The urban reinvention programme is necessary to ensure the long-term viability of that part of the network. In return for Government investment in this programme, the Post Office has guaranteed that at the end of the programme 95 per cent. of people living in urban areas will be within a mile of a post office, and the majority within half a mile. Offices in deprived urban areas can only be closed in exceptional circumstances. In addition special arrangements have been put in place to help post offices in the most deprived wards and where there is no other post office within half a mile. The scheme in England provides grant for capital improvements of up to &pound;50,000. Similar schemes have been set up in Scotland and Wales.</p>

	<p pid=".933W.0/1">The Pile One reactor is considered by international experts to be one of the most challenging decommissioning tasks in the nuclear industry. The key challenges include:</p>
	<p pid=".933W.0/2" class="indent">Limited knowledge of the extent of damage to the fire-affected core;</p>
	<p pid=".933W.0/3" class="indent">Difficult access to some areas of the core;</p>

	<p pid=".933W.0/5" class="indent">Employing suitable remote-controlled machinery to remove hazardous material.</p>
	<p pid=".933W.0/6">Strategies have been adopted for two phases of the decommissioning. Phase One of the project, that of clearing up and sealing the air and water ducts, was successfully completed in 1999. This work ensured that the reactor continues to be maintained in a condition acceptable to the nuclear regulators.</p>
	<p pid=".933W.0/7">Phase Two, the current phase, involves removal of the hazardous materials and the treatment and packaging of the resulting waste. Problems with the initial design concept led to a rigorous technical review of the options for dismantling. This review is ongoing.</p>

	<p pid=".937W.6/1">My noble Friends (Baroness Scotland) and (Lord Filkin) represented the United Kingdom at the Justice and Home Affairs Council in Brussels on 27&ndash;<phrase class="date" code="2003-11-28">28 November</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".937W.6/2">A list of 'A' points approved (with the exception of item 34) at the Council has been placed in the Library (Documents PTS A 63 15256/03 and ADD 1).</p>
	<p pid=".937W.6/3">The Presidency concluded a general approach on the draft Framework Decision on drug trafficking but noted four Parliamentary Reserves and that the European Parliament will be re-consulted.</p>
	<p pid=".937W.6/4">The Presidency also concluded a general approach on the draft Mutual Legal Assistance agreement between the EU and Norway and Iceland and noted two outstanding Parliamentary Reserves. It hoped that the Council Decision authorising the Presidency to sign the Agreement would be adopted on <phrase class="date" code="2003-12-08">8 December</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".937W.6/5">Similarly the proposal for a regulation creating a European Enforcement Order for uncontested civil claims was the subject of a general approach. Lord Filkin noted the UK's Parliamentary Reservation on Article 2. Two other member states had other reservations and the Presidency therefore suggested the remaining difficulties should be discussed at a technical meeting. They hoped to be able to adopt a common position by the end of the year to allow consideration by the European Parliament and adoption of the Regulation in this legislature.</p>
	<p pid=".937W.6/6">The Presidency noted the conclusions of the last meeting of the Police Chiefs' Task Force and the willingness to make more effective use of liaison officers.</p>
	<p pid=".937W.6/7">Draft Council conclusions on strengthening community co-operation in the field of civil protection assistance were adopted and the Commission indicated that in early 2004 it planned to present a Communication building on these.</p>
	<p pid=".937W.6/8">Under Any Other Business four member states, including the UK, confirmed they had passed their domestic legislation implementing the European Arrest Warrant. Six member states indicated that they planned to do so by <phrase class="date" code="2003-12-31">31 December 2003</phrase> deadline but five member states envisaged some slippage.</p>
	<p pid=".937W.6/9">Separately, the Presidency proposed the adoption of a charter on the importance of inter-faith dialogue. Following a meeting in the margins of the council the text of a non-binding statement was agreed but will only be adopted when two member states have lifted their reservations.</p>
	<p pid=".937W.6/10">The Presidency noted the progress made on the Asylum Procedures Directive: they had inherited a measure with 239 reservations on the text but only 37 now remained. Nonetheless given that these related to contentious issues (safe third countries, safe countries of origin, and appeals), the Presidency concluded that discussion should continue under the Irish Presidency, with a view to concluding by the deadline in the Amsterdam Treaty (<phrase class="date" code="2004-05-01">1 May 2004</phrase>).</p>
	<p pid=".937W.6/11">The Commission (Vitorino) reported its work on the proposed minimum common list of safe country of origin to be adopted with the Directive. Work would be taken forward to identify which of the 22 countries that member states had proposed could be included in the list.</p>
	<p pid=".937W.6/12">One member state was not yet in a position to agree the draft Directive on Minimum Standards for the Qualification and Status of Third-Country Nationals and Stateless Persons as Refugees and so the Presidency noted that discussion would continue under the Irish Presidency, which would aim to agree the Directive before <phrase class="date" code="2004-05-01">1 May 2004</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".937W.6/13">The Presidency reported on the outcome of the seminar, &quot;Towards more orderly and managed entry in the EU of persons in need of international protection&quot; which had focused on the merits of an EU resettlement programme and EU-level protected entry procedures. The Presidency's document aimed to guide the work of the Commission in preparing its report to the June 2004 European Council on legal means of entry for refugees to the EU and improvements to the protection capacity of refugees' regions of origin.</p>
	<p pid=".937W.6/14">Given member states differing views on the Council Directive on the conditions of entry and residence of third-country nationals for the purpose of paid and self-employment the Presidency would consider future handling. (The UK has not opted in to this proposal).</p>
	<p pid=".937W.6/15">The Mixed Committee reached a general approach on draft Council Conclusions on the European External Borders Agency, and these were subsequently adopted in the Council itself.</p>
	<p pid=".937W.6/16">Baroness Scotland stressed our desire to participate as fully as possible in the work of the Agency and the benefits this would bring to all. Two other member states supported. Commissioner Vitorino stressed his desire for the UK and Ireland to participate within the framework of the agency. He stressed that, although there might be institutional consequences, these should not be allowed to undermine the work of the Agency. He also urged member states to reach political agreement on what they wanted from the Agency, stating that only then could the participants' legal positions be addressed.</p>
	<p pid=".937W.6/17">A general approach was reached on the Sea Borders Agency Work Programme (which was subsequently adopted by the Council) after one member state withdrew its reservations.</p>
	<p pid=".937W.6/18">The Mixed Committee and the Council agreed a general approach on the Regulations laying down a uniform format for visas and residence permits, and adopted the associated Council Conclusions, which dealt with the need for an additional legal instrument to deal with the storage of biometric visa data.</p>
	<p pid=".937W.6/19">In the margins of the Council on <phrase class="date" code="2003-11-28">28 November</phrase> Baroness Scotland represented the UK at a meeting with Ministers from the countries of the Western Balkans: Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Serbia and Montenegro.</p>
	<p pid=".937W.6/20">The UK welcomed the action they are taking or planning to meet their commitments, made at the London Conference and Thessaloniki summit, to fight organised crime and improve border management. Baroness Scotland underlined the need for implementation of these plans and continued co-operation with the EU, with the International Criminal Tribunal for Yugoslavia (ICTY) in the Hague and within the region.</p>
	<p pid=".937W.6/21">The directors of Europol and Eurojust briefly outlined the work they are doing in the region, although in the latter's case this was at an early stage.</p>
	<p pid=".937W.6/22">In relation to borders the Commission welcomed some of the specific action plans that countries in the region had developed but stressed that these were just a beginning that they would need to be improved.</p>
	<p pid=".937W.6/23">The joint conclusions were adopted and the Netherlands noted they would organise a follow-up ministerial conference during their Presidency to assess progress against commitments made today.</p>

	<p pid=".940W.5/1">In our consultation paper, &quot;Policing: Building Safer Communities Together&quot;, which was published on <phrase class="date" code="2003-11-04">4 November</phrase>, the Home Office sought views on the introduction of a single, three-digit, non-emergency number for accessing local services. This built upon a previous proposal to introduce a single non-emergency number for the police. The closing date for contributions to the consultation is <phrase class="date" code="2004-01-27">27 January 2004</phrase>. Work has begun to look at the possible scope of such a system. There are a number of models worldwide, including the American 311 system. We shall develop the proposal following the consultation feedback and the scoping work.</p>
	<p pid=".940W.5/2">Ofcom (Oftel until <phrase class="date" code="2003-12-29">29 December 2003</phrase>), which administers the UK's National Numbering Scheme, has advised us that it may be possible to allocate a three digit number for this service. That will be subject to a public consultation, run by Ofcom, to establish whether the service, which it is intended should be available through all networks and service providers, is objectively justifiable and whether the change required is proportionate to the benefit. That consultation will commence once we are clearer about the scope of the service.</p>
	<p pid=".940W.5/3">Due to the availability of local dialling within a code area, Ofcom has also advised that the allocation of &quot;888&quot; is not possible without re-numbering all subscribers whose telephone number, minus area code, begins with &quot;8&quot; or &quot;88&quot;. It is likely that the three digit number allocated for use in non-emergency cases will begin with the digit &quot;1&quot;. We have yet to make a decision about the three digit number.</p>

	<p pid=".949W.3/1">The Barker Report suggests that the recent increase in refusals may have resulted from a failure on the part of some housebuilders to respond to the changed policy environment, following recent policy changes, including those set out in Planning Policy Guidance Note 3 (Housing) 2000. It is expected that the rate of refusals will decrease over time, as the policy changes are more widely understood and adopted.</p>

	<p pid=".955W.0/26">In 2003 significant changes were introduced to the assessment of writing at KS1. For the first time marks for spelling contributed to the pupils' overall writing level instead of separate level for spelling being reported. In addition there were changes to the format of the writing test and a new mark scheme was introduced. These new testing arrangements have produced a different distribution of marks and it is difficult to draw conclusions through comparisons with previous years' results. For example a larger proportion of pupils secured the higher levels in writing than in previous years. The percentage of all pupils achieving Level 2B or above in writing rose from 60 per cent. in 2002 to 62 per cent. in 2003; the percentage of boys achieving that level rose from 52 per cent. to 54 per cent. The percentage of all pupils at Level 3 rose from 9 per cent. in 2002 to 16 per cent. in 2003; the percentage of boys achieving that level rose from 7 per cent. to 11 per cent.</p>
	<p pid=".955W.0/27">It remains a point of concern that boys' achievement in writing at KS1, as at all Key Stages, lags behind that of girls, and the Primary Strategy will continue to support teachers in raising standards further. In spring 2004 new support materials will be offered on improving boys' writing. We will also be piloting the development and delivery of a specialist support package for early years practitioners so that they can begin to tackle the challenges faced by disadvantaged children as soon as they enter the Foundation Stage. A particular focus for the specialists will be to improve the speaking, listening and communication skills of these children.</p>

	<p pid=".960W.6/1">The National Literacy Strategy (NLS) has dramatically increased the Key Stage 2 reading results. Since 1998 there has been a 10 percentage point increase in the percentage of pupils achieving the expected level for their age in the Key Stage 2 English tests, with an increase of 10 percentage points in reading. There have also been increases in reading results at Key Stage 1, with a 7 percentage point increase in the percentage of pupils achieving level 2B or above in the Key Stage 1 Reading tests since 1998. The work of the NLS is now being taken forward within the wider context of our Primary Strategy, as set out in &quot;Excellence and Enjoyment&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".960W.6/2">The emphasis that the Primary Strategy places on phonics in teaching children to read has had a direct impact on the reading results at both Key Stage 1 and Key Stage 2. The Primary Strategy adopts the 'Searchlights' model of reading, which advocates that children should be taught to read using synthetic and analytic phonics as well as other strategies such as knowledge of grammar and context. We will continue to support the teaching of phonics, and will be producing a supplement to &quot;Progression in Phonics&quot; next spring through the Primary Strategy.</p>

	<p pid=".964W.2/2">In its strategic area reviews of all post-16 provision the LSC's criteria include that the pattern of provision should:</p>
	<p pid=".964W.2/3" class="indent">meet learner, employment and community needs;</p>
	<p pid=".964W.2/4" class="indent">improve choice of provision, ways of delivery and learner experience including, where appropriate, developing more distinct provision for 16 to 19&ndash;year-olds;</p>
	<p pid=".964W.2/5" class="indent">raise standards and participation;</p>
	<p pid=".964W.2/6" class="indent">enhance responsiveness of the infrastructure and employers' involvement; and</p>
	<p pid=".964W.2/7" class="indent">strengthen collaboration and progression in the 14&ndash;19 phase, the post-19 phase and with HE including supporting the development of foundation degrees.</p>
	<p pid=".964W.2/8">Where such proposals require reorganisation, there is a national framework of criteria for all reorganisation proposals requiring them to extend participation, improve achievement and standards and be affordable. Proposals also have to show that adequate consultation has taken place and that proper consideration has been given to alternatives.</p>
	<p pid=".964W.2/9">When considering proposals for 16&ndash;19 reorganisation the LSC will also have regard to the five key principles that should underpin the organisation of 16&ndash;19 provision agreed by Ministers in September. These are:</p>
	<p pid=".964W.2/10" class="indent">underpinning all consideration of 16&ndash;19 provision should be a requirement that all provision for all learners should be high quality, whatever their chosen pathway;</p>
	<p pid=".964W.2/11" class="indent">distinct 16&ndash;19 provision to meet the particular pastoral, management and learning needs for this age group will be the norm, wherever they learn. All young people should be attached to a 16&ndash;19 base, including those in work-based training when attending college. Popular and successful sixth-form provision&mdash;whether in schools, sixth-form colleges or new distinct sixth-form centres in FE colleges&mdash;will be an important part of the pattern of provision and should be encouraged, particularly where there is little or no such provision;</p>
	<p pid=".964W.2/12" class="indent">there should be diversity to ensure curriculum breadth. Together, providers need to support a wide curriculum offer for all 16&ndash;19 learners in an area. Well-managed collaboration can enable popular and successful small providers, including sixth forms, to remain viable and to share and build on their particular areas of expertise;</p>
	<p pid=".964W.2/13" class="indent">the pattern for 16&ndash;19 provision should respect learner choice. Learning provision for 16 to 19-year-olds will normally be in one or more of the following settings: school sixth forms, sixth-form colleges, distinct sixth-form centres in FE colleges, private or voluntary sector training providers and work-based learning providers;</p>
	<p pid=".964W.2/14" class="indent">plans should offer value for money. Any net costs should be commensurate to the expected improvement in learning opportunities.</p>
	<p pid=".964W.2/15">The LSC has published detailed guidance on these matters and I have asked the LSC to forward to you copies of the relevant circulars, 02/09: Provider Reorganisations, 03/06: Strategic Area Reviews and 03/07: School Sixth Form Reviews.

	<p pid=".966W.2/1">International comparisons of pupil attainment such as the OECD Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) offer insights into how the outcomes of our education system compare with those of other countries. PISA, which in 2000 focused on &quot;reading literacy&quot; of 15-year-olds, allows us to compare pupils at the end of compulsory schooling. Together with PISA, other international comparisons studies, such as the IEA's Progress in International Literacy Study (PIRLS) and Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS), with their different age cohorts and subject content, help give us an objective picture of performance across the primary and secondary sectors in relation to our world partners and competitors, complementing the data coming out of our own national assessments. It seems clear that we are not alone in finding these studies valuable, given the large number of countries routinely taking part in them.</p>

Legislation allows grant to be paid at a rate of up to 100 per cent. in exceptional circumstances, although those circumstances are not defined in the relevant legislation.

	<p pid=".972W.15/1">The Government introduced a new funding system for local authorities in 2003&ndash;04, replacing Standard Spending Assessments with Formula Spending Shares. In order to phase in the distributional changes implied by the Education Formula Spending Shares, the Government introduced floors and ceilings arrangements for both the school and LEA funding blocks. All of the &quot;damping&quot; amounts within the school and LEA Formula Spending Shares are therefore attributable to the education funding changes in 2003&ndash;04. 2003&ndash;04 was the first year of this system within the Schools and LEA Formula Spending Shares and it is not therefore possible to calculate an increase in damping amount for 2003&ndash;04 over previous years.</p>

This advice was intended to equip staff with the factual information they need to provide to customers in order for customers themselves to choose the account which best meets their needs and circumstances. The Post Office card account will not be the best option for them as it cannot receive payments of wages. Post Office Ltd. have also had the opportunity to comment on DWP information material for our customers, including leaflets.</p>

	<p pid=".979W.5/1">The Department holds information about the impact of council tax on older peoples' incomes from a variety of sources.</p>
	<p pid=".979W.5/2">The Family Resources Survey is a large-scale annual survey of private households run by the department which collects detailed information about income and about certain expenses, including council tax.</p>
	<p pid=".979W.5/3">Regularly published information from this survey includes estimates of pensioners1 net incomes after the deduction of taxes, including council tax payments. The Pensioners' Income Series 2001&ndash;02 shows that between 1996&ndash;97 and 2001&ndash;02 the average net income of pensioners before the deduction of housing costs increased by 17 per cent. in real terms, while after housing costs it increased by 23 per cent.</p>
	<p pid=".979W.5/4">Data from administrative sources shows the number of pensioners receiving council tax benefit. In 2002, 2.4 million families over 60 received council tax benefit.</p>
	<p pid=".979W.5/5">The Department also publishes estimates of the level of take-up of council tax benefit, in the annual publication income related benefits: Estimates of take-up.</p>
	<p pid=".979W.5/6">The Department further estimates that with the introduction of pension credit almost 1.9 million pensioner households will be eligible for more help, or help for the first time, with council tax or rent payments.</p>
	<p pid=".979W.5/7">The Department also carries out calculations to establish the level of income at which pensioners are eligible for help with their council tax. From October 2003, a single person over 65 with no entitlement to disability benefits and an income of &pound;116 could be eligible for maximum council tax benefit.</p>
	<p pid=".979W.5/8">The Department also regularly receives research from other organisations.</p>

	<p pid=".980W.0/1">The Department for Work and Pensions has targets set by Cabinet Office to help contribute to a reduction in public sector sickness absence. These involve an average working days lost figure of eight days by March 2006, and an interim target of 10 days by March 2004. The cumulative average working days lost figure for the period April to October 2003 was 12.3.</p>
	<p pid=".980W.0/2">Ministers and senior managers in the Department fully recognise the importance of good attendance. The Department's Executive Team, chaired by the Permanent Secretary, reviews sickness absence on a monthly basis.</p>
	<p pid=".980W.0/3">The remedial work we have in place includes the following:</p>
	<p pid=".980W.0/4">A new Departmental attendance management policy was implemented in February 2003. This aims to encourage good attendance and provide support to enable people to return to work as quickly as possible following an illness. Formal unsatisfactory attendance action can be considered when an absence reaches eight days in a rolling 12 month period. To measure the effectiveness of the policy, an evaluation exercise will start shortly.</p>
	<p pid=".980W.0/5">Each of the businesses within the Department has initiatives in place aimed at getting sickness absence levels down. Jobcentre Plus has an 'Improving Attendance' task force in operation. Its emphasis is on reducing long-term absences (i.e. those over 28 days duration), by either facilitating a return to work, or effecting a termination of an individual's contract. The Department is also participating in the 'Well-being at work' pilots that are being run by the Health and Safety Executive. This initiative is intended to combat workplace stress. In addition, the Department is committed to discharging its responsibilities to disabled people by making reasonable adjustments to the workplace to facilitate an individual's return to work, or to avoid people going off in the first place. A pilot will also commence in January that will involve the early intervention of occupational health nurses in addressing, quickly, those absences that have the potential to become long-term.</p>

	<p pid=".982W.2/1">The administration of Jobcentre Plus is a matter for the Chief Executive of Jobcentre Plus, David Anderson. He will write to the hon. Member.</p>
	<p pid=".982W.2/2" class="letterfrom">Letter from David Anderson to Dr. Jones, dated <phrase class="date" code="2003-12-17">17 December 2003</phrase></p>
	<p pid=".982W.2/3" class="indent">As Jobcentre Plus is an Executive Agency, the Secretary of State has asked me to reply direct to your question on what plans he has to centralise <i>(a)</i> Jobseekers Allowance and <i>(b)</i> Labour Market Appeals; and what the implications of the plans are for (i) appellants and (ii) staff. This is something that falls within the responsibilities delegated to me as Chief Executive of the Agency.</p>
	<p pid=".982W.2/4" class="indent">Jobcentre Plus was formed in 2002 from the Working Age elements of the former Benefits Agency and the Employment Service. Since that time, the organisation has undergone an unprecedented rollout programme, bringing together both parts of the formerly separate operations.</p>
	<p pid=".982W.2/5" class="indent">An internal review recommended that appeals would be delivered more efficiently through teams of appeals staff covering all Jobcentre Plus benefits, and also for appeals teams to be organised on a district basis and accountable to the District Manager. This work is now underway and is being led by the Deputy field Director of East of England, supported by district, regional and national tiers throughout Jobcentre Plus.</p>
	<p pid=".982W.2/6" class="indent">Improvements to Jobcentre Plus decision making and appeals processes are to be further supplemented following recommendations from the recent National Audit Office report &quot;Getting It Right, Putting It Right&mdash;Improving Decision Making and Appeals In Social Security Benefits&quot;. It was their view that the centralisation of appeals work, reconsiderations and complex decision making, would achieve financial savings for the organisation and lead to improved standards, better communications and better customer service.</p>
	<p pid=".982W.2/7" class="indent">Pressures on staff to achieve demanding targets will be relieved as more resource is freed when these plans are implemented. Centralisation and a more defined management, training apd communications structure will also lead to improved skills of and support to those staff employed to process complex decisions, handle reconsiderations and write appeals. This will provide a better service for Jobcentre Plus customers.</p>
	<p pid=".982W.2/8" class="indent">I hope this is helpful.</p>

	<p pid=".985W.6/1">Remploy owns a significant majority of its factory sites and this will continue to be the case following the modernisation plans the Company currently considers necessary over the next few years. In the long-term, if Remploy were to carry out all potential relocation plans, they would have a total of 50 sites owned and 31 leased. In every case Remploy will consider upgrading the existing site, purchasing or building at a new site or leasing a site. Remploy has only entered into agreements to lease factory sites where it has made business sense.</p>
	<p pid=".985W.6/2">Leased premises tend to be acquired for a minimum of 15 years and occasionally for longer periods. This is normal commercial practice and recognises that, because business requirements evolve over time, there must therefore be a corresponding ability to evolve the estates strategy to ensure that the facilities match business and learning objectives.</p>
	<p pid=".985W.6/3">The Company's approach to providing better and more modern facilities in Remploy locations is primarily to improve business opportunities that will in turn lead to more opportunities for growth in employment levels.</p>
	<p pid=".985W.6/4">Since 2000, Remploy has invested in new or improved sites in Acton, Barnsley, Bradford, Gateshead, Lanarkshire, and North Staffordshire. There are also plans, some of which are already under way to replace existing facilities in Abertillery, Bristol, Holloway, Preston and St. Helens. All these sites are leased.</p>
	<p pid=".985W.6/5">The above sites produced proceeds of sale of &pound;5.7 million. At the same time, the Company invested &pound;5.9 million on fitting out the replacement sites; consequently that has been a net outflow of investment. The majority of the sales proceeds arose from the sales of Acton and Bristol (&pound;3.5 million of the &pound;5.7 million) where there were opportunities to take advantage of site development potential. In other cases, the proceeds were very modest, reflecting the individual constraints of the existing site.</p>
	<p pid=".985W.6/6">The Company's growth and investment plans are discussed with the Government on a regular basis. It should be noted that Remploy cannot sell a factory without securing the Government's approval. The Government will only agree to the sale where a case is presented which demonstrates the business sense of the proposal.</p>

	<p pid=".988W.5/1">Increasing patient choice will require a change in culture for national health service staff and indeed, for patients. Staff and patients are broadly supportive of the principle of extending patient choice. However, we need to work closely with staff and patients on the detailed implementation of our patient choice policies to ensure that we retain that support. The new financial framework, Payment by Results, will provide new incentives to providers to attract patients. Our plurality policies will help secure the capacity needed to deliver the improved waiting times patients expect, and will allow a greater range of choices for patients. The biggest safeguard against any institutional resistance, however, is likely to be the attitude of the patients themselves. The experience from London and other choice pilots is that once offered choice over where and when their treatment is provided, many patients exercise these new opportunities.</p>

We are exploring options for primary care trusts to provide greater support for patients living in more isolated rural communities. These could include peripatetic patient care advisers, the use of mobile service, for example, the mobile cataract surgery service being introduced in many areas from the spring of 2004. We will be including rural representatives of patients, patient groups and local authorities in these discussions, so that they are able to influence the Department's final policy guidance on choice at referral.</p>

	<p pid=".990W.11/1">The diabetes national service framework (NSF) states that 'the NHS will need to ensure that all health professionals involved in the diagnosis and care of people with diabetes receive continuing training to ensure that they are appropriately skilled in the diagnosis and management of diabetes' (page 29 of the &quot;Diabetes National Service Framework for Diabetes: Standards document&quot;). Curriculum content for pre-registration education and training programmes for healthcare professionals is determined by individual higher education institutions (HEIs) in the light of recommendations from the relevant regulatory bodies. Post registration training needs for all national health service healthcare staff is determined locally through skills auditing of teams against priority local needs and through the appraisal process. In addition there are a number of central initiatives to increase healthcare professionals' access to knowledge, such as the development of the National Electronic Library for Health's specialist 'branch' library for diabetes and 'Diabetes NSF Zone' and the Department of Health's commitment to establishing a National Knowledge Service.</p>
	<p pid=".990W.11/2">Structured patient education is an integral part of the diabetes NSF and its provision is a key intervention for Standard 3 of the NSF that is concerned with patient empowerment. All people with diabetes will receive a service that encourages partnership in decision-making and supports them in managing their diabetes. This is reflected in the &quot;Planning and Priorities Framework for the NHS 2003&ndash;06&quot;, that includes targets for the diabetes NSF. One such target states the need for primary care trusts to update practice-based registers for people with diabetes by March 2006. This will help to ensure that they receive systematic treatment regimens and advice, including the provision of information, education and psychological support, to help them in managing their own condition.</p>

	<p pid=".992W.5/1">In February 2003, we published an action plan for epilepsy services which addresses the key recommendations in the National Clinical Audit of Epilepsy Related Deaths audit and the Chief Medical Officer's 2001 Annual Report on epilepsy. This will be complemented by two key initiatives, which are planned for publication next year. The National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) is developing a clinical guideline for the diagnosis, management and treatment of epilepsy, which it plans to publish next July. It is also looking at the clinical and cost effectiveness of new anti-epilepsy drugs in children and adults and plans to publish an appraisal in the new year. These will help address any variations in clinical practice and contribute to the improvement of services. We are developing the national service framework (NSF) for long-term conditions, which will focus on improving the standard of general neurology care across England for people with conditions such as epilepsy. The NSF will address a range of key issues, for example: the need for equitable access to a range of services; good quality information and support, for patients and carers; the ability to see a specialist and get the right investigations and diagnosis as quickly as possible; and, maintaining independence and quality of life. We currently plan to publish the NSF late next year for implementation over 10 years from 2005.</p>

	<p pid=".993W.5/1">All of the acute hospitals in Birmingham provide some degree of epilepsy services as part of their neurology services.</p>
	<p pid=".993W.5/2">University Hospital Birmingham National Health Service Trust has 32 dedicated in-patient neurology beds which are used by epilepsy patients. There are currently no in-patient beds within Birmingham specifically designated for epilepsy. Patients requiring such beds are referred to the National Society for Epilepsy in London.</p>
	<p pid=".993W.5/3">Out-patient services are provided for the whole of the West Midlands region at the Queen Elizabeth Psychiatric Hospital for around 1,500 patients a year. Around 40 per cent. of patients are referred from Birmingham.

	<p pid=".993W.8/1">There are a number of commercially available computer systems that general practitioners may decide on their own initiative to use in assisting their choice of what medicine to prescribe for a patient. Any system used by a GP must meet a core set of Requirements for Accreditation (RFA). RFA was introduced in April 1993 to ensure general medical practice computer systems provided an agreed level of core functionality and conformed to national standards.</p>
	<p pid=".993W.8/2">All generic medicines licensed for national health service use must meet the strict requirements of the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) and must be equivalent to, and have the same therapeutic effect as, the branded formulation. Some manufacturers of generic medicines may choose to market their product by using a brand name. In other instances, for example in the case of modified release generic medicines, the MHRA may require that these medicines are prescribed by a brand name so as to avoid any problems concerning bio-availability. However these products must also be licensed by the MHRA.</p>
	<p pid=".993W.8/3">On receiving a script from a patient, a pharmacist is obliged to dispense the branded product if one has been specified by a GP. If, however, a GP has prescribed a generic medicine then a pharmacist is free to chose from amongst a range of licensed generic medicines.</p>
	<p pid=".993W.8/4">When officials recently became aware that a major pharmaceutical company ad sought to change GP databases to default to their formulation of a medicine, action was taken to ensure that GPs were aware and prepared to over-ride their systems to select their preferred medicine.</p>
	<p pid=".993W.8/5">These arrangements should be sufficient to prevent a pharmacist from dispensing any NHS generic medicine that has a different formulation from that prescribed by a GP&mdash;whether or not a GP used a computer system in making that decision. The forthcoming renegotiations of the 1999 Pharmaceutical Price Regulation Scheme will be used to consider the need for even stronger controls in this area.</p>

These rules are concerned with striking the right balance as between the protection of information submitted by applicants and the public interest in the disclosure of that information.

Health spending is to grow on average by 7.2 per cent. per annum in the United .Kingdom in real terms over next five years&mdash;from &pound;68.1 billion to &pound;109.4 billion in 2007&ndash;08.</p>

	<p pid=".1002W.5/1">Data are not collected centrally on waiting times for a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan. The length of time that a patient may have to wait for any scan is dependent on their clinical condition. Emergency cases need to be seen immediately. Other cases will be carried out as quickly as possible, dependent on the clinical priority of all patients waiting to be scanned.</p>
	<p pid=".1002W.5/2">Where a MRI scan forms part of the diagnostic process for a patient urgently referred with suspected cancer, this will be covered by the target of a maximum two month wait from urgent referral to first treatment, which is currently in place for breast cancer patients, and will be in place for all cancers by the end of 2005.</p>
	<p pid=".1002W.5/3">To increase capacity of diagnostic services, funding has been made available for the provision of new and replacement scanners. To date, new and replacement equipment provided through central programmes includes, as of <phrase class="date" code="2003-12-15">15 December 2003</phrase>, 51 new MRI scanners, 69 linear accelerators, 148 computed tomography scanners and over 600 items of breast screening equipment, all delivered since April 2000.</p>
