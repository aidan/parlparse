The fire crews will use a number of temporary stations across counties but the deployment of fire fighters will be based on the assessment by the military in consultation with others such as the police of how best to respond to an emergency in the quickest time possible. The extent to which retained firefighters continue to work will also be taken into account in determining how best to deploy military fire crews.</p>

	<p pid=".689W.6/1">This information is set out in the regional governance White Paper XYour Region, Your Choice&quot; (Cm 5511) as part of the rationale for the Government's proposals to give each English region the opportunity to choose whether to have an elected assembly. Elected regional assemblies will have real power and funding to improve the quality of life of people in their region&mdash;particularly by improving regional economic performance.</p>
	<p pid=".689W.6/2">Assemblies will have powers to make a difference in key areas such as jobs, transport, housing, culture and environment. And their block grant will give them much greater freedom to allocate spending according to regional priorities. This offers the prospect of tailored regional solutions to regional problems. It strikes a balance between those issues that are best dealt with at a regional level and those that are best dealt with at a national or a local level. Our proposals for elected assemblies in the English regions will bring decision-making closer to the people and make government more efficient, more effective and more accountable.</p>
	<p pid=".689W.6/3">The evidence base includes the information presented in XRegional Government in England: a preliminary review of literature and research findings&quot; (published by the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions in 2000). Other relevant documentation is included in the White Paper's bibliography (annex J). The Government's approach to determining which powers and functions should become the responsibility of elected regional assemblies is described in chapter 4 of the White Paper.

	<p pid=".693W.2/2">No estimate has been made of the total weight of aggregate brought across the border from the Republic of Ireland to Northern Ireland without payment of aggregates levy since April. Aggregates levy is due at the point of first commercial exploitation in the UK and not at the point of import. Where it cannot be demonstrated that aggregate is from a levy-paid source, Customs will use their powers to recover the revenue due and impose penalties, where appropriate. The resources allocated to administering the levy in Northern Ireland take account of issues associated with the land boundary, and this resourcing will be subject to regular review.</p>
	<p pid=".693W.2/3">The revenue forecast for the aggregates levy is made for the UK as a whole, and is not available by devolved region; therefore, data on the aggregates levy revenue raised in Northern Ireland are not available. In total, the levy is forecast to raise #0.2 billion during 2002&ndash;03.</p>

	<p pid=".694W.5/1">Tobacco smuggling grew very rapidly in the late 1990s until, by 2000&ndash;01, over 20 per cent. of the cigarette market was illicit. The cost of that tobacco smuggling to UK taxpayers was #3.5 billion. A further 6 per cent. of the market was legally non-tax paid product bought abroad and brought back for own use.</p>
	<p pid=".694W.5/2">The great majority of cigarette smuggling is undertaken by serious and organised criminals who conceal large volumes of cigarettes in excess of 1 million at a time in freight consignments. In 2000 a smaller proportion was smuggled by cross-channel passengers. However in that year the total cost of such passenger excise smuggling was still #1.7 billion.</p>
	<p pid=".694W.5/3">Had no action been taken over the past two years Customs and Excise estimate that the illicit share of the cigarette market would have reached 31 per cent. by the end of March 2002.</p>
	<p pid=".694W.5/4">Since the launch of the Tackling Tobacco Strategy in March 2000, Customs and Excise have been successful in containing growth in the illicit cigarette market, disrupted over 100 organised crime gangs responsible for the vast majority of the smuggling, and have had dramatic success in cutting losses from cross-channel passenger smuggling by almost three-quarters. Figures for 2001&ndash;02, the second year of this strategy, will be published at the time of the pre-Budget report and I anticipate they will show that the strategy remains on track. In the same period consumer expenditure on legitimate cross-border shopping for alcohol and tobacco has grown by 10 per cent.</p>
	<p pid=".694W.5/5">In 2000&ndash;01 Customs seized 2.8 billion cigarettes. Of these, 0.9 billion were seized overseas through the work of the Customs Overseas Liaison Officer network, a further 1.2 billion were seized in freight consignments, 400 million were seized inland and 55 million were seized at the ports from cross-channel passenger smugglers.</p>
	<p pid=".694W.5/6">The sole focus of Customs excise enforcement activity in respect of cross-channel passenger traffic is to tackle those who smuggle tobacco or alcohol, having received or intending to receive money or money's worth for those goods. The Government have consistently made clear that people are entitled to bring into the UK without liability to tax as much EU tax-paid tobacco or alcohol as they wish for their own use. Customs literature also makes this clear.</p>
	<p pid=".694W.5/7">Just one-tenth of 1 per cent. of those who have crossed the channel in the past two years have had tobacco or alcohol seized by Customs. Since the start of the strategy, the average quantity seized by Customs from cross-channel passenger smugglers was approximately 4,900 cigarettes and 15 kilos of hand rolling tobacco (equivalent to at least 18,000 cigarettes).</p>
	<p pid=".694W.5/8">Of the 0.1 per cent. of cross-channel passengers who had tobacco or alcohol seized in the years 2000&ndash;01 and 2001&ndash;02 over 75 per cent. chose not to make any sort of appeal against that seizure. Of those that did appeal, magistrates courts overwhelmingly backed the judgments made by Customs, and found against Customs in less than 0.1 per cent. of cases, and only 1 per cent. of cases were either overturned or restored by a Customs review officer or by an independent tribunal.</p>
	<p pid=".694W.5/9">Building on the success of the Budget 2000 anti-smuggling measures, I am today announcing the next stage of the Tackling Tobacco Strategy. Despite cross-channel tobacco smuggling having been cut by around three-quarters in the past two years, smugglers are becoming increasingly sophisticated in their attempts to blend in with honest shoppers. So the measures I am announcing today will help make the distinction between smugglers and honest shoppers even clearer. The measures make clear that Customs activity is legal and fair but tough upon those who attempt to smuggle. It comprises the following components:</p>
	<p pid=".694W.5/10" class="indent">Regulations will be laid before Parliament today to abolish the 1992 Personal Reliefs Order and replace it with new provisions that:</p>
	<p pid=".694W.5/11" class="indent">effectively define shopping and smuggling, specify the factors Customs will take into account in distinguishing one from the other and place the onus for that decision upon Customs;</p>
	<p pid=".694W.5/12" class="indent">reaffirm that all Customs stops are lawful and those for excise specific purposes based on reasonable grounds for suspicion;</p>
	<p pid=".694W.5/13" class="indent">increase the Indicative Levels for tobacco from 800 to 3,200 cigarettes and from 1 to 3kgs of hand rolling tobacco, representing around six-months supply for an average smoker. Those bringing back larger quantities of tobacco must expect, if asked, to explain how it is that such goods are for their own use. Customs will continue to seize quantities below these levels as well as above them where they are satisfied that those goods are intended for resale or other exchange for money or money's worth.</p>
	<p pid=".694W.5/14" class="indent">In addition, the announcements I am making today will confirm that:</p>
	<p pid=".694W.5/15" class="indent">Vehicles used to smuggle tobacco or alcohol will continue to be liable to seizure but for small first offences Customs will offer restoration of the vehicle for the value of the attempted revenue evasion. Those who use vehicles to smuggle on a large scale or a repeat basis will not be offered such an opportunity and must expect to lose their vehicles.</p>
	<p pid=".694W.5/16" class="indent">A new clearer guide to appealing/complaining is being published by Customs today and will be given to all those who have goods seized or wish to complain about Customs behaviour towards them.</p>
	<p pid=".694W.5/17" class="indent">I have asked Customs to undertake, in conjunction with the Lord Chancellor's Department, a review of the present appeals structure and to present proposals for streamlining and simplifying these arrangements to me by the end of January 2003. The Terms of Reference will be available today in the Library of the House and on the Customs website (), together with details for submitting contributions.</p>
	<p pid=".694W.5/18" class="indent">Having brought cross-channel passenger smuggling under control the Government is determined that it should remain so. To this end, Customs expect to conduct an increased number of prosecutions against large scale and serial cross-channel passenger smugglers.</p>
	<p pid=".694W.5/19" class="indent">Violence against Customs officers in the course of carrying out their duties will not be tolerated under any circumstances. Customs will toughen their policy and prosecute anyone who perpetrates serious assaults on staff.</p>
	<p pid=".694W.5/20" class="indent">This set of measures provides the public with a clear guide to their right to shop for alcohol or tobacco for their own use within the EU and to the consequences for those who attempt to evade tax in bringing in such goods having received or intending to receive money or money's worth for some or all of them. It will also enable Customs to continue to prevent the smuggling of tobacco or alcohol and the disorder which accompanies such smuggling from ruining the enjoyment of honest cross-border shoppers. It will also enable Customs to prevent the smugglers from undermining the UK economy in alcohol or tobacco products and from depriving our public services of essential tax revenues. Customs will act fairly and in accordance with the law but they will also act firmly and with the full weight of sanctions against those who break the law.</p>

Friend the then Minister of State for the Armed Forces, Dr. Reid, examined this matter in great detail and with deep care and concern. There are considerable legal difficulties in considering pardons, particularly the lack of evidence available today, and all these points were explained in my right hon. Friend's statement to this House on <phrase class="date" code="1998-07-24">24 July 1998</phrase>, <phrase class="offrep" id="debates/1998-07-24.1372"><i>Official Report</i>, columns 1372&ndash;86</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".703W.6/3">While there are, I am afraid, no grounds to reconsider this matter, it is important that we do not overlook the very important steps that have been taken to recognise these men as victims of the war, and to draw them and their families into the nation's consciousness and remembrance. The public commemoration of these men in the new memorial in National Memorial Arboretum is very fitting.</p>

We are also investing in information processing applications that will enhance our capability to collate, analyse and control the distribution of information within the network. As part of the New Chapter we announced a number of early capability enhancements that will help improve situational awareness, for example, an extra Mission Console for the E3-D and advancing the WATCHKEEPER Surveillance UAV programme.</p>

The formal consultations took place between March 2001 and July 2001, although they were informally extended to October 2001 to admit some late replies. In parallel, discussion groups took place at Service units throughout the country and discussions were also held with ex-Service organisations, such as the Royal British Legion and Forces Pension Society. The final proposals are currently being staffed for final approval by Ministers. These proposals have taken account of the comments received during the consultation process, the recommendations of the House of Commons Defence Committee, and discussions with the ex-Service community. Subject to approval around the turn of the year, the final details of the schemes and a report on the consultations will be published early next year.</p>

	<p pid=".707W.5/2">The ex-Republic of South Africa Air Puma helicopters were procured to supplement the existing Ministry of Defence Puma fleet. Because the aircraft had not flown for over five years, and their previous usage spectrum was unknown, it was essential to ensure that the airworthiness and structural integrity of the aircraft could be adequately assured. Options for effecting the refurbishment of the aircraft to the same standard as the existing fleet were evaluated. It was assessed that Eurocopter, the design authority for the Puma, was the only company with the necessary knowledge of, and competences in, the structural load paths of the Puma to be able to act as a prime contractor. As a result, an entry was placed in the MOD Contracts Bulletin notifying that the work would be placed with Eurocopter, while encouraging Eurocopter to maximise sub-contractor opportunities.</p>

	<p pid=".708W.2/2">A formal evaluation to validate the revised structure is currently being undertaken. However, the latest available figures indicate that there will be a reduction of around 180 posts across PTC (140 civilian (non-industrial) posts and 40 service posts). We estimate that civilian reductions at RAF Innsworth will be in the region of 50, with the remainder 90 occurring at other PTC stations. We intend that all manpower reductions will be effected through natural wastage.</p>

While it is premature to discuss what the United Kingdom's precise contribution will be, the UK strongly supports the NRF concept as a means of optimising the utility of the NATO Force Structure across the range of missions. We can therefore anticipate that the UK led Headquarters of the Allied Command Europe Rapid Reaction Corps, the United Kingdom Maritime Force and our contribution to NATO Readiness Forces (Air), will form the basis of our participation in the NRF.</p>

	<p pid=".708W.11/2">Regular and reserve forces personnel are offered immunisations as part of an established vaccination programme. Members of the regular forces are given routine vaccinations, with immunity being maintained by the administration of regular boosters. Reservists at high readiness for deployment also have their immunity maintained at a similar level by routine booster immunisations. All other reserve forces personnel receive a lesser number of routine immunisations with additional vaccinations, and any necessary boosters, being administered upon an increase to a high readiness state. In advance of overseas deployment, any personnel deploying to areas with a specific health hazard, and those in special occupational risk groups (such as medical personnel), may also be given additional vaccinations before deployment. It is the responsibility of Commanding Officers to ensure that personnel are up to date with the appropriate immunisations. Units should also carry out pre deployment checks of vaccination states. Immunisation also forms part of the package of capabilities which protects our troops from, and enables them to respond effectively to, the threat of biological warfare. Since May 2001, personnel deploying on operations to the Gulf and in specialist NEC units have been included in our programme of voluntary immunisation against anthrax. We have since expanded this programme; I refer the hon. Member to the answer my right hon.

	<p pid=".709W.3/1">There were 7,438,964 pupils between 4 and 18 in maintained schools in local education authorities recorded in the most recent annual schools census. It is not possible to identify the funding allocated to each school under the options set out in the consultation paper on Local Government Finance issued on <phrase class="date" code="2002-07-08">8 July</phrase>: that would depend on decisions to be taken by LEAs on their formulae for distributing funding to their schools. The amounts of funding distributed for additional educational needs, and within that for ethnicity and English as an additional language (EAL), under each of the four consultation options is set out in the table below:</p>
	<table>
		<thead>
			<tr pid=".709W.3/4"> <th>Funding for 2002&ndash;03</th> <th>Option 1</th> <th>Option 2</th> <th>Option 3</th> <th>Option4</th> </tr>
		</thead>
		<tbody>
			<tr pid=".709W.3/7"> <td>Deprivation Funding (#m)</td> <td>4,880</td> <td>4,118</td> <td>4,940</td> <td>4,006</td> </tr>
			<tr pid=".709W.3/8"> <td>Ethnicity/EAL Funding (#m)</td> <td>600</td> <td>421</td> <td>600</td> <td>431</td> </tr>
		</tbody>
	</table>
	<p pid=".709W.3/11">The levels of funding in these options are based on research from PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC). If an alternative method of funding AEN were used, it would be necessary to consider how it could fit with the evidence from the PwC study, which associated substantial costs with the incidence of EAL.</p>

The Fund can meet accommodation, books, travel and where necessary tuition fees. We expect the costs falling to the Fund to be small.</p>

	<p pid=".711W.9/1">Renewal of beacon status is dependent on a school being able to show that it has had an impact as a beacon and that it has maintained or improved its own performance in its three years as a beacon . Schools are advised to provide evidence of any factors that may have an effect on the school's performance, such as the number of pupils with statements of special education needs, so that these can be taken into account at the time of the assessment.</p>

	<p pid=".711W.12/1">There are three main types of panel or tribunal relating to educational provision for children: SEN and Disability Tribunals (SENDIST), Admission Appeal Panels, and Exclusion Appeal Panels.</p>
	<p pid=".711W.12/2">SENDIST consider disputes between parents and LEAs about statementing of children with Special Educational Needs. They also consider complaints of disability discrimination made by parents against individual schools or LEAs.</p>
	<p pid=".711W.12/3">At the end of June the Special Educational Needs Tribunal had 51 legal chairmen and 97 specialist members. The Secretary of State appointed 39 new specialist members in July. The Lord Chancellor has appointed 11 new chairmen.</p>
	<p pid=".711W.12/4">By the end of June, 21 SEN Tribunal chairmen and 40 specialist members had received one and a half day's training on disability discrimination legislation. The training included theoretical and practical sessions that covered all the relevant provisions of the Disability Discrimination Act, including the implications for school exclusions. The President of the Tribunal arranged training for tribunal members at three conferences, in June, July and September. The SEN Tribunal became SENDIST from September. Tribunal panels are likely to hear the first claims under the new legislation in the new year.</p>
	<p pid=".711W.12/5">Independent Admission Appeal Panels consider parents' appeals against refusal of admission of their children to particular schools. Responsibility for setting up a panel, and recruitment and training of panel members lies with the school's Xadmission authority&quot; (in the case of voluntary aided and foundation schools this is the school's governing body, for community and controlled schools it is the local education authority). Although admission authorities themselves are responsible for the training of panel members, Information for School and College Governors (ISCG), who are one of a number of organisations delivering practitioner training, produced a training pack which is available free of charge to schools and LEAs. The revised Admission Appeals Code (to be laid before Parliament soon) contains guidance on the Disability Discrimination Act, and refers readers to other appropriate sources of help.</p>
	<p pid=".711W.12/6">Exclusion Appeal Panels consider appeals made by parents whose children have been excluded from a school, and the exclusion upheld by the school governing body. The panels are set up by LEAs, who are responsible for appointing and training members. The Department is currently revising its guidance in the XExclusion Appeal Panels Training Pack&quot;, with regard to the Disabilities Discrimination Act. This revised guidance will be issued shortly.</p>
	<p pid=".711W.12/7">The Department does not collect data on admission or exclusion appeal panel members or information on the training they receive.</p>
	<p pid=".711W.12/8">The Council of Tribunals (which operates under the Tribunals and Inquiries Act 1992) advises and supervises the procedures and working of tribunals. The Council, and the Judicial Studies Board, has a significant interest in the training of panel members. The Council of Tribunals publication XMaking Tribunals Accessible to Disabled People: Guidance on Applying the Disability Discrimination Act&quot; is available to both panel members and those responsible for their training.</p>

Over the next couple of months the Department is meeting with all LEAs individually to discuss these plans and the further support they need to meet the challenging targets for 2004. The National Literacy and Numeracy Strategies will continue to help LEAs improve their results, in particular by focusing low attaining and underperforming schools, improving leadership and intervention programmes for pupils who are not achieving their potential. We are allocating an additional #11 million this year to support schools make improvements in 2003.</p>

From 2002&ndash;03 it is providing over #1 million in recurrent funding to mobilise NHS support for research at the schools. In addition, researchers at all medical schools and faculties of medicine are eligible to apply to the Medical Research Council for research funds.

	<p pid=".725W.2/1">We are committed to raising standards significantly in secondary schools. That is why we have set challenging targets for raising pupil attainment at 14 and 16. The GCE results for Wandsworth are currently not available, though we know nationally that over 51 per cent of 16-year olds-have achieved five or more GCSEs or GNVQ equivalent. This is an increase of 4.9 percentage point from when targets were first introduced in 1997/98.</p>
	<p pid=".725W.2/2">In the case of 14-year-olds, there has been an improvement nationally of 1 percentage point in English and mathematics, while in science the large gains made last year have been consolidated. Provisional data for Wandsworth suggest that the number of 14 year olds achieving the standard expected at the end of Key Stage 3 has risen by 4 percentage points in English, and 2 percentage points in maths and science. This is good news, and suggests that our Key Stage 3 strategy has made an early impact on raising pupil standards in the early years of secondary education.</p>

	<p pid=".727W.6/2">The Government are fully committed to the promotion of breastfeeding, which is accepted as the best form of nutrition for infants. Under the NHS Plan, we have a commitment for Xincreased support for breastfeeding&quot;. As part of the Government's commitment to reduce health inequalities and increase breastfeeding rates, particularly among disadvantaged groups, a target has been set to increase breastfeeding initiation rates by 2 percentage points through the NHS priorities and planning framework.</p>
	<p pid=".727W.6/3">The Department has undertaken several strands of work in promoting breastfeeding and will be further developed in the context of the children's national service framework. A total of 79 Xbest breastfeeding practice&quot; projects have been funded across all regions. The aim is to increase the rates of breastfeeding, both initiation and duration among the disadvantaged groups. This is a goal shared by all sure start initiatives and several health action zone programmes.</p>
	<p pid=".727W.6/4">Other related Department activities include support for an annual National Breastfeeding Awareness Week, that aims to raise the awareness of breastfeeding through the NHS. The Department also has close links with the four main voluntary organisations involved in the promotion of breastfeeding and the UNICEF/World Health Organisation baby friendly initiative. The Department also conducts research into breastfeeding through quinquennial infant feeding surveys.</p>
	<p pid=".727W.6/5">Since 1981, the United Kingdom has publicly endorsed the International Code of Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes and all the relevant resolutions passed at the World Health Assembly. The Infant Formula and Follow-on-Formula regulations came into force on <phrase class="date" code="1995-03-01">1 March 1995</phrase> and they implement the EC Directive 91/321/EEC, which embraces the principles of the WHO Code of Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes 1981. The regulations place statutory restrictions on the composition, labelling, advertising and export of infant formulae. By implementing the Directive, the Government have taken seriously their responsibility to protect infant health and are at present revising the policy lines on infant feeding. We will be giving full consideration to the United Nations Committee's recommendations on promoting breastfeeding.</p>

	<p pid=".730W.2/3">The monitoring of progress in tackling fuel poverty will be taken forward in two ways. Firstly the actual number of households in fuel poverty will be monitored, in particular for vulnerable groups such as pensioner households and households with children. Secondly, progress on the factors that affect fuel poverty (income, fuel prices and housing) will be monitored. These factors are referred to as indicators of fuel poverty and they include background information on issues relevant to those in fuel poverty. Together these two approaches should enable progress on tackling fuel poverty to be monitored.</p>
	<p pid=".730W.2/4">In England, the monitoring of the actual number of households in fuel poverty will be carried out using information collected through the English House Condition Survey.

	<p pid=".731W.5/4">The main achievements/findings of EDMAR are as follows:</p>
	<p pid=".731W.5/5" class="indent">the development of new methods for detecting endocrine disruption in marine fish and invertebrates;</p>
	<p pid=".731W.5/6" class="indent">evidence of a slight decrease in one biomarker of endocrine disruption (egg protein production in male flounder fish) at some sites;</p>
	<p pid=".731W.5/7" class="indent">signs of oestrogenic (feminising) endocrine disruption in blenny fish in some estuaries;</p>
	<p pid=".731W.5/8" class="indent">very slight effects on migratory trout and salmon, suggesting that endocrine disruption from exposure to oestrogenic contamination in estuaries is not widespread in these species; and</p>
	<p pid=".731W.5/9" class="indent">identification of natural and synthetic causal substances, the most important being natural and synthetic steroid hormones.</p>
	<p pid=".731W.5/10">DEFRA will be discussing with other Government Departments and Agencies how to take forward the recommendations for further research resulting from the EDMAR programme.</p>

	<p pid=".732W.3/2">The Department has been in close touch with the USDA since the submission last year of an application for a determination that UKROFS' standards meet the requirements of the NOP. The USDA has now written to UKROFS to confirm that it accepts the UKROFS control system as sufficient to secure conformity with the NOP. This means that the UK organic inspection bodies are able to certify product for the purposes of the NOP but it does not affect the standards required to be met by products sold as organic in the UK. The Department has also been in close touch with organic certifiers in the US to ensure that the introduction of the NOP does not invalidate authorisations previously issued to import US organic produce into the UK. Discussions are also taking place between the European Commission and the USDA to ensure that disruption to trade between the Community and the US is kept to a minimum. We have received a number of representations about the introduction of the NOP from the UK organic inspection bodies and from companies concerned about the effect of the NOP on their ability to export to the US.</p>

	<p pid=".734W.5/1">It is not possible to give meaningful estimates of these figures, for two reasons. First, it is difficult to distinguish expenditure on research that is relevant to one particular tumour site from research on other or all cancers. Second, over 75 per cent. of the Department's total expenditure on research, including that on cancer, are devolved to national health service and details of these figures are not collected centrally.</p>
	<p pid=".734W.5/2">We are tackling both of these difficulties. The National Cancer Research Institute (NCRI) is developing a database of research funded by NCRI members. Research projects are being classified according to the &quot;Common Scientific Outline&quot; system drawn up by the National Cancer Institute in the United States of America. This will enable all NCRI members to use the same system for distinguishing expenditure on research that is relevant to one particular tumour site from research on other or all cancers.</p>
	<p pid=".734W.5/3">The modernisation of the NHS research and development funding system should enable a significant proportion of funds that are currently devolved to the NHS to be entered on to the NCRI database and analysed in a similar way.</p>

	<p pid=".742W.2/1">Following initial advice from the Committee on Safety of Medicines in December 2001 as to public health risk associated with medicines containing Kava-kava, a voluntary agreement between the Medicines Control Agency (MCA) and the herbal sector to withdraw from sale medicinal products containing Kava-kava took effect at the beginning of 2002. In July the Committee on Safety of Medicines (CSM) gave further advice, that there was evidence that in rare cases Kava-kava was associated with hepatotoxicity, which may be serious in nature. The CSM made the provisional recommendation that use of the plant should be prohibited in unlicensed medicines. The Government considered that advice and asked the Medicines Control Agency to consult on proposals to prohibit the sale, supply or importation of unlicensed medicinal products consisting of, or containing, Kava-kava except those for external use only. The proposals were set out in consultation letter MIX 286.</p>
	<p pid=".742W.2/2">The consultation period has now ended and the Government have requested further advice on this issue, taking account of the responses to consultation, from the independent advisory committee, the Committee on Safety of Medicines. In addition, in accordance with the statutory procedure under section 62 of the Medicines Act 1968, the consultation responses have been referred to the Medicines Commission, who will report their findings and conclusions to Ministers. The Government will make an announcement once it has considered this advice and the Commission's report.</p>
	<p pid=".742W.2/3">During the consultation period around 50 responses were received, with a majority of those commenting supporting the proposal. A number of the responses from the herbal sector advocated alternative options, in particular the continued availability of Kava-kava with voluntary inclusion of warning information for the purchaser or the continued availability of Kava but subject to restrictions, for example as to strength.</p>
	<p pid=".742W.2/4">Over 20 representative organisations in the herbal sector or individual companies have at various stages notified the MCA of their participation in the voluntary agreement. In the period preceding the CSM's further advice in July, the MCA was aware that one company had withdrawn from the agreement on the basis of its view that there was insufficient evidence of risk to the public from Kava-kava to justify the withdrawal of the product, although it subsequently resumed participation. The current position is that the MCA is not aware of any relevant representative groups or organisations that have advised their members not to participate in the agreement. However, the national association of health stores notified the MCA at the end of July of their position that it was a matter for individual shops to check with their insurance companies to establish whether cover would remain in force.</p>
	<p pid=".742W.2/5">The MCA has received a wide range of oral or written representations and views from the herbal sector relating to the voluntary agreement. The main points made by various parties have included: support for the agreement pending a decision on the future regulatory status of Kava-kava; disagreement or doubt that the strength of evidence of risk justified the agreement or its continuation; requests for an early decision about any regulatory action in order to resolve the position; and concerns over whether all parties were implementing or abiding by the agreement.</p>
	<p pid=".742W.2/6">As herbal remedies may be supplied under section 12 of the Medicines Act 1968 without a marketing authorisation or any other form of notification to the MCA, a comprehensive record of Kava-kava products on the United Kingdom's market is not available. The MCA therefore requested information from the herbal sector about unlicensed remedies containing Kava-kava which had been on the market prior to the voluntary agreement. The information provided was insufficiently comprehensive to enable a detailed comparison with products on the German market. However, products listed by the herbal sector included ones similar to those sold in Germany, such as standardised extracts providing a daily dose of between 120 and 210 mg of kavalactones.</p>
	<p pid=".742W.2/7">In relation to the position on food, since December 2001 the Food Standards Agency (FSA) has been advising against consumption of foods containing Kava-kava and encouraging industry to voluntarily withdraw these products from the market. In July 2002, acting on the advice of the chairman of the committee on toxicity of chemicals in food, consumer products and the environment (COT), the FSA initiated a consultation on proposals which would prohibit the use and import of Kava-kava in foods. The consultation period has now ended and the FSA is considering the responses. Around 30 written responses have been received from a range of interested parties with roughly equal numbers supporting and opposing the proposals.</p>
	<p pid=".742W.2/8">My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Health has had no discussions with the FSA on this matter. The FSA has no additional information to that outlined above on compliance with the voluntary withdrawal. The FSA does not hold information on the range of food products containing Kava-kava available on the German market.</p>

	<p pid=".751W.3/1">The UK arms trade with Israel is tiny. All relevant export licence applications are rigorously assessed on a case by case basis against the consolidated EU and national arms export licensing criteria, taking account of the circumstances prevailing at the time and other relevant announced Government policies. Our criteria clearly set out our commitment to take account of the risk that exports might be used for internal repression or external aggression. The outbreak of the intifada, continued Israeli incursions in the occupied territories and the Israeli breach of its assurance that UK originated equipment would not be used in the occupied territories have all been factored in to the Government's current export licensing policy.</p>

	<p pid=".757W.2/2">Torture is inflicted on men, women and children in almost half the countries of the world. The UK believes that torture has no place in the 21st century and is therefore committed to combating torture everywhere. In October 1998 the UK launched an initiative to tackle torture throughout the world. Phase 3 of this initiative was launched in June this year. Over the four years of the anti-torture initiative the UK has established the reputation of having one of the strongest anti-torture stances in Europe. As part of the initiative the UK has been lobbying countries worldwide to ratify the UN Convention against Torture. Since our campaign was launched, 20 new states have ratified, bringing the total to 130.

	<p pid=".757W.8/1">Since 1996 the FCO have published travel advice on the FCO website. The advice is accessed regularly by the travel industry and members of the public. Many regular users arrange to receive automatic updates when travel advice changes, by using the &quot;automatic update facility&quot; on the FCO site.</p>
	<p pid=".757W.8/2">In addition to this service, those seeking travel advice can contact the Travel Advice Unit during working hours by fax or telephone. A further 30 organisations receive daily faxed updates from the Travel Advice Unit. Travel advice, covering countries and areas to which the FCO either advise against all travel or all non-essential travel, are also published on CEEFAX (page 474). Significant changes in travel advice are also announced via press statements. CEEFAX (page 471) gives contact information for the Travel Advice Unit, and the website address, from which comprehensive travel advice may be obtained. Our posts overseas have discretion to issue local advisories, with information and advice of particular interest to the expatriate community. This is disseminated in a variety of ways, depending upon local circumstances. In countries where we have a warden network we ask wardens to pass on significant changes in travel advice.</p>
	<p pid=".757W.8/3">The FCO has gone to great lengths to improve and to maximise awareness of our travel advice. The Know Before You Go (KBYG) campaign, launched in June 2001, is a market transformation campaign made up of three main strands: the FCO website, strategic partnerships and PR. The key campaign message is simple and applies to everyone: know before you go&mdash;get travel insurance and check the FCO travel advice before you go.</p>

	<p pid=".761W.6/1">There is currently no criminal offence of trafficking. Criminal statistics which might give an indication of how many children have been trafficked into the UK in each of the past five years, and from where they came, are not therefore available. The Nationality and Immigration and Asylum Bill currently before the House will introduce a new offence of trafficking for the purposes of controlling an individual in prostitution.</p>
	<p pid=".761W.6/2">Forming an accurate estimate of the levels of trafficking in people is problematic given the reluctance of the victims of trafficking to report to the police. There is currently no accurate, reliable data in existence within the UK or the European Union.</p>
	<p pid=".761W.6/3">A Home Office research study 'Stopping Traffic' (Police Research Series 125, published in 2000) indicated that there was intelligence to suggest that some women and children are trafficked into the UK for the purposes of sexual exploitation. This was estimated at between 140 and 1,400 per year but it was impossible to make a more accurate assessment of numbers. The report concluded that there was no evidence to suggest that this was on a large scale compared with other European countries.</p>

Today we are presenting to Parliament an Order to enact that proposal. The Order will come into force on <phrase class="date" code="2002-12-16">16 December 2002</phrase>, subject to the approval of both Houses. Eligible prisoners serving between eight months and under four years who pass a risk assessment will be released on Home Detention Curfew (HDC) to spend the latter part of their sentence at home for a period of up to 90 days depending on sentence length. There will be no change in the maximum curfew length for prisoners serving between three months and under eight months. They will continue to serve between 15 and up to 60 days on curfew. In all cases offenders not statutory excluded will be subject to a risk assessment and released on HDC only where it is safe to do so.</p>
	<p pid=".762W.6/2">Under the HDC scheme prisoners serve the remainder of their custody period at home under electronic curfew usually from 7pm and 7am. At any one time we expect this measure will remove up to 600 prisoners from prison accommodation in addition to the 2,400 who are already on the scheme. The impact of these arrangements will be kept under close review.</p>

	<p pid=".764W.5/1">None. Since 1999, no sums have been realised by any of the criminal justice agencies from confiscation orders relating to corruption in developing countries. The Assets Recovery Agency, the body established under the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 to investigate and recover unlawfully held assets, will not commence operations until early in the new year.</p>
	<p pid=".764W.5/2">I should add that the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 also brings forward the point at which assets may be restrained to the start of a criminal investigation. At present, restraint is only possible when proceedings have or are about to be instituted which may be too late to prevent assets from being dissipated. The international co-operation provisions of Part 11 of the Act will also enable co-operation to be provided without</p>
	<p pid=".764W.5/3">the need to designate overseas authorities for assistance, enabling assistance to be given much more readily when cases arise.</p>
	<p pid=".764W.5/4">In this context I should also note two new provisions which should assist in combating corruption in developing countries. Section 108 of the Anti-Terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001 ensures that foreign agents are covered by the law on bribery and corruption. Section 109 extends UK jurisdiction in respect of acts committed abroad by UK nationals and bodies incorporated under UK law which would amount to corruption offences if committed here. These provisions were brought into force on <phrase class="date" code="2002-02-14">14 February 2002</phrase>. The confiscation provisions in the Proceeds of Crime Act will apply to these offences, following conviction of an offender where the offender has benefited from his conduct.</p>
	<p pid=".764W.5/5">Arrangements exist for the UK to share sums realised on behalf of another jurisdiction following enforcement of an overseas confiscation order. As a general rule the maximum amount which can be shared with a requesting country is 50 per cent. of the sum realised once enforcement costs have been deducted. However, the UK is prepared in principle to return 100 per cent. (following deduction of recovery costs) of any assets that are the proceeds of corruption, and have been the subject of a confiscation order enforced in the UK courts.</p>
	<p pid=".764W.5/6">In May 2002 a Department for International Development (DFID) conference was held to advise developing countries as to how they could seek assistance from the UK in investigating, freezing and confiscating assets of criminal origin which are believed to be located in the UK.</p>
	<p pid=".764W.5/7">The UN Corruption Convention, currently under negotiation in Vienna, will also require all UN member states to address the issue of returning the proceeds of corruption to the country of origin. The UK Government is actively proposing, including in EU Common Position, that the UN Corruption Convention should favour the return of assets plundered from state funds by corrupt leaders.</p>

	<p pid=".773W.8/1">Doorstep sales are used in a number of markets, including gas and electricity supply. Since the introduction of domestic gas and electricity supply competition, such sales have been a useful way of bringing the benefits of competition, particularly access to lower prices, to the attention of customers. Consumers are protected under the Doorstep Selling Regulations, which were enhanced in 1998, and are enforced by local Trading Standards departments. At present, the Government have no plans to introduce further regulation. Gas and electricity consumers are further protected by specific regulations in supply licences, which are the responsibility of the Office of Gas and Electricity Markets (OFGEM). Where appropriate, OFGEM takes investigative and enforcement action against suppliers that breach these conditions.</p>

This was placed in the Libraries of the House.</p>
	<p pid=".778W.2/2">The research was conducted by the Small Business Research Centre at Kingston University. Overall this research showed that confidence levels of small employers about their knowledge of individual rights were low even though awareness of those rights was generally high.</p>

We have set up an Employment Information Advice and Guidance project in partnership with ACAS, and the Small Business Service. Starting with the changes introduced in the Employment Act 2002 the project will improve the ways that the information advice and guidance on employment rights is provided to employers and employees with a particular emphasis on the needs of small businesses. The work of the project benefits from the advice of a user group of representatives of employers and employees including representatives of the Small Business Council, the Federation of Small Business and the private business forum and representatives of the main advisory networks.</p>

	<p pid=".786W.0/1">We introduced reforms in 2000 so that entitlement to Maternity Allowance no longer depends on the payment of national insurance contributions. Qualifying conditions for both Statutory Maternity Pay and Maternity Allowance are based instead on a woman's recent employment and earnings history.</p>
	<p pid=".786W.0/2">Maternity Allowance is now paid to women earning at least #30 a week, but below the lower earnings limit for national insurance contributions (currently #75 a week). As a result, up to 16,000 more low paid women a year can receive improved financial help during their pregnancy.</p>
	<p pid=".786W.0/3">Sure Start Maternity Grants, worth #500, are also available to help those mothers on low income in greatest need.</p>

	<p pid=".786W.6/1">Bereavement Allowance and Widowed Parents Allowance are available to both men and women of working age who are widowed. The predecessor benefits, Widow's Pension and Widowed Mother's Allowance, were available to women only up to a maximum age of 65. Entitlement to these benefits ends if a widow or widower remarries. This is because they are intended to provide financial support in widowhood and are designed to help the widowed spouse maintain him or herself and any dependant children in the absence of the deceased spouse's income.</p>
	<p pid=".786W.6/2">If a widow or widower remarries they are treated, for benefit purposes, in the same way as members of any other married couple. Other social security benefits or tax credits may be available to help support the new family depending on their circumstances.</p>
