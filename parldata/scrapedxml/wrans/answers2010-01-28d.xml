	<p pid="d.989W.6/1">Dartford station will be receiving &#163;1 million under the National Stations Improvement Programme: a &#163;150 million scheme to enhance around 150 medium sized stations up to 2014. It is anticipated that this will be supplemented by some &#163;6 million third party funding.</p>

	<p pid="d.990W.0/1">The Highways Agency uses statutory powers to acquire property in connection with the operation, construction and maintenance of the Trunk Road and Motorway network. The Agency receives Blight Notices under the Town and Country Planning Acts which provide protection for property owners who cannot sell their properties because of planned road improvement schemes. When these notices are accepted, they require the Agency to purchase property in advance of its operational requirements. These properties are held while the scheme is in the programme and the route is protected from development. In some cases this can be for a number of years.</p>
	<p pid="d.990W.0/2">Where possible, properties are let until they are required for operational purposes or can be sold and their management is contracted out to a private letting and management agent.</p>
	<p pid="d.990W.0/3">Properties which are not cost effective to repair, but which are repairable, are maintained in their present condition because a future sale may take place. These properties are described as being beyond economic repair. Derelict properties that present a safety risk or will have an enhanced value by having planning permission for rebuild/development may be demolished if it is cost effective to do so.</p>
	<p pid="d.990W.0/4">The 13 properties beyond economic repair being held by the Highways Agency are detailed in the table. This shows their addresses, how long they have been vacant, and how much council tax has been paid in respect of each property for the financial year 2008-09.</p>
	<p pid="d.990W.0/5">The road schemes that affected Woodview and Park Hill Lodge are now complete. These properties did not need to be demolished and are now at the beginning of the Agency's disposal process. The other 11 properties are not available for sale.</p>
	<p pid="d.990W.0/6">The Agency obtains appropriate professional advice about valuation, method of sale and planning potential in respect of all its surplus properties. The Agency has not yet obtained that advice in respect of Woodview and Park Hill Lodge.</p>

The costs for 2008-09 relate to the first-year order comprising of a total of 159 salt spreaders, all equipped with snow ploughs, and a further 40 additional snow ploughs. The vehicles used by Highways Agency Traffic Officers are leased. The figures quoted are the total cost of the vehicle leasing contracts for each of the two years. Leasing payments cover the cost of the vehicles, servicing, maintenance, tyres and windscreens, etc. Most vehicles are leased for 18 months, or 150,000 miles.

As well as the seminar that is being arranged for June 2010, members from some representative groups, for example, Mobilise, are participating in steering groups. Regular newsletters are issued to all stakeholders and officials continue to meet regularly with other representative groups, for example, the Disabled Persons Transport Advisory Committee, as well as with the Joint Committee on Mobility for Disable People.</p>

	<p pid="d.1012W.5/2">As set out in the HM Treasury guidance 'The Green Book-Appraisal and Evaluation in Central Government', the ability to judge how effectively Government resources have been expended is essential to their strategic long-term management. We have therefore commissioned a full, robust and independent evaluation of the &#163;140 million Free Swimming Programme. This includes a detailed online survey of swimmers and non-swimmers to supplement questions placed on the Active People Survey, as well as case studies of participating and non-participating local authorities. The cost of the PricewaterhouseCoopers contract for the evaluation of the Free Swimming Programme is &#163;379,000, less than 0.3 per cent. of the total cost of the programme. The contract is managed by Sport England on behalf of the Department for Culture, Media and Sport.</p>

	<p pid="d.1013W.5/1">VisitBritain are responsible for marketing Britain overseas as a tourist destination, and VisitEngland are responsible for marketing England to British residents. Some of the recent initiatives that have been undertaken to attract tourists to Britain include the 'Value for Money' campaign for which VisitBritain and VisitEngland invested &#163;6.5 million over the spring and summer 2009.</p>
	<p pid="d.1013W.5/2">The overseas 'Value for Money' campaign involved an investment of &#163;3.5 million and reached 18 markets in 21 languages and was undertaken in close co-operation with the airlines Easyjet and British Airways. VisitBritain's office in the USA also launched a campaign with Virgin Atlantic to stimulate travel to the UK which involved an investment of US$1 million.</p>
	<p pid="d.1013W.5/3">The domestic 'Value for Money' campaign involved an investment of &#163;3million in VisitEngland's 'Enjoy Every Minute, Enjoy England' campaign, which was designed to stimulate more day visits, short breaks and holidays in England. In the first nine months of 2009 visits by UK residents in England increased by 6 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="d.1013W.5/4">In July 2009 England secured the Rugby League World Cup in 2013 and the Rugby Union World Cup in 2015. These sporting events will present many tourism opportunities, as will the recent announcement that there will be an additional Bank holiday during the Queen's Diamond Jubilee celebrations in 2012. British tourism will also benefit from the launch last July of a competition to find the nation's first 'City of Culture'. 14 bids are now being considered. Becoming Britain's 'City of Culture' in 2013 will stimulate the city's visitor economy.</p>
	<p pid="d.1013W.5/5">2012 also provides a powerful opportunity to promote tourism and we are working to ensure that we use the 2012 games to maximise the economic benefits for the British tourism industry.</p>
	<p pid="d.1013W.5/6">In addition, the overall level of public sector investment in tourism from local, regional and national sources is likely to exceed &#163;2 billion in the current spending review period. The Government believe this public investment is a good and reasonable investment in support for the tourism and hospitality industry.</p>

	<p pid="d.1014W.3/1">Non-consolidated performance payments are an integral element of the reward package for staff. These payments are used to drive high performance and form part of the pay award for members of staff who demonstrate exceptional performance, for example by exceeding targets set or meeting challenging objectives. They have to be re-earned each year and do not add to future pay bill costs, e.g. pensions. A close and effective link between pay and performance and increased use of variable pay is a key element of the reward arrangements for the civil service and the senior civil service (SCS) in particular.</p>
	<p pid="d.1014W.3/2">Reward arrangements, including the criteria for non-consolidated performance pay, below the SCS, are delegated to individual Departments and agencies. For the SCS, Departments and agencies are responsible for their own reward arrangements within a framework set by Cabinet Office. The percentage of the pay bill set aside for performance-related awards for the SCS is based on recommendations from the independent Senior Salaries Review Body.</p>
	<p pid="d.1014W.3/3">Tables covering the specific information requested have been deposited in the Library of the House. These tables detail as far as we are able to ascertain from our records the number of people who were eligible for and received a non-consolidated variable pay award, the average and maximum payment for a non-consolidated variable pay award, by civil service band, and the total amount of non-consolidated variable pay awards paid in each of the five most recent performance years for which the relevant payments have been published in the Department's accounts.</p>

	<p pid="d.1022W.5/1">Many of the policy initiatives announced since Budget 2007 have not yet shown up in the child poverty figures. Although we do not have an estimate for January 2012, measures announced since Budget 2007, including the pre-Budget report 2009, are estimated to reduce the number of children in poverty by around 550,000.</p>

	<p pid="d.1028W.0/1">Over 70 per cent. of land in England and Wales, including most urban land, is now registered with Land Registry in about 21 million registered titles. The registered area has increased from 45 per cent. in 2004, when data on geographic coverage first became available. This growth is principally attributable to Land Registry's strategy of persuading landowners of the benefits of voluntary first registration. A large percentage of the land that remains unregistered is in rural areas or includes large estates or public landholdings.</p>

Such claims are only settled on the basis of strong legal advice from Prison Service's appointed solicitors and/or barristers. Taking indefensible cases through to court only results in more expense to the public purse. Therefore, NOMS loses very few prisoner cases at court and this accounts for the difference in the figures between court awards and out of court settlements. Details of claims against individual probation boards/trusts are not recorded centrally and to provide the information would require looking through the records of each individual board or trust which would entail disproportionate costs.</p>

	<p pid="d.1032W.5/1">The National Offender Management Service has a broad based prisoner suicide prevention and self-harm management strategy that seeks to reduce the distress of all those in prison. This requires identifying prisoners at risk of suicide and self-harm. Reducing access to potential means of suicide or self-harm at all prisons, including New Hall, forms part of the care of people considered to be at risk. This includes, where necessary, the removal of any personal possessions and furniture in cells which may be used in an act of self-harm.</p>
	<p pid="d.1032W.5/2">In addition, most prisons contain safer cells, which are designed to make the act of suicide or self-harm by use of ligature difficult. This is achieved primarily by reducing ligature points as far as possible. Anti-ligature furniture and fittings are installed as an integral part of the cell fabric.</p>

	<p pid="d.1032W.8/1">The National Offender Management Service has a broad based prisoner suicide prevention and self-harm management strategy that seeks to reduce the distress of all those in prison. This requires identifying prisoners at risk of suicide and self-harm. Reducing access to potential means of suicide or self-harm at all prisons, including HMP The Mount, forms part of the care of people considered to be at risk.</p>
	<p pid="d.1032W.8/2">Potential ligature points in the shower units in cells at HMP The Mount have been negated by the installation of UPVC panels. In more recent accommodation of a similar type in other prisons, velcro curtains have been fitted to a collapsible rail in shower units.</p>
	<p pid="d.1032W.8/3">Decisions whether or not to redesign shower cubicles, are taken locally by individual governors. A central record is not held of prisons which have had this type of modification and these details can be obtained only by contacting each individual establishment at disproportionate cost.</p>

	<p pid="d.1036W.3/2">Available information on the number of persons proceeded against at magistrates courts and found guilty at all courts for the sale of alcohol to a drunk person, under section 141 of the Licensing Act 2003, by police force area, for 2006 and 2007 (latest available) is given in table 1.</p>
	<p pid="d.1036W.3/3">The statistics relate to persons for whom these offences were the principal offence for which they were dealt with. For example, when a defendant has been found guilty of two or more offences the principal offence is the offence for which the heaviest penalty is imposed. Where the same disposal is imposed for two or more offences, the offence selected is the offence for which the statutory maximum penalty is the most severe.</p>
	<p pid="d.1036W.3/4">A penalty notice for disorder (PND) of &#163;80 may also be issued by the police for certain alcohol related offences such as the sale of alcohol to a person who is drunk. The numbers of persons issued with a PND for this offence, which was added to the scheme in April 2005, by police force area, from 2005 to 2007 are shown in table 2.</p>
	<p pid="d.1036W.3/5">Data for 2008 will be available very soon.</p>

However we are aware that a small number of local areas (including Bournemouth, Torbay, Brighton and Hove and Thanet) have used part of their 2009-10 Home Office alcohol partnership funding for safebus/safe space initiatives. This &#163;1.5million programme is targeted at our 50 alcohol priority areas. These local areas can bid for funding for initiatives after identifying how to tackle alcohol related harm in the means most appropriate to the area and the problem.</p>

	<p pid="d.1042W.8/1">Offender Management Caseload Statistics 2008 records that 4,429 offenders were received into prison in 2008 following breach of a community order and 5,769 following breach of a suspended sentence order. However, these data cannot be broken down by type of requirement to identify the number of offenders imprisoned following breach of a drug rehabilitation requirement (DRR).<sup>(1)</sup></p>
	<p pid="d.1042W.8/2">The imposition of a custodial sentence is one of a range of options available to the courts if they are satisfied that an offender has failed to comply with any requirements of a community order or a suspended sentence order without a reasonable excuse. The Criminal Justice Act 2003 specifies that a court may only impose a custodial sentence following breach of a community order with a DRR where the offender has wilfully and persistently failed to comply with the requirements of the order.</p>
	<p pid="d.1042W.8/3">The National Offender Management Service does not collect data on the offenders who have been imprisoned following breach of a DRR. However, the proportion of offenders successfully completing these orders has risen significantly from 28 per cent. in 2003 to 47 per cent. in 2008-09.</p>
	<p pid="d.1042W.8/4">While all drug treatment delivered through the criminal justice system aims ultimately for abstinence, drug misuse can lead to chronic relapsing behaviour which may take years to address successfully and often beyond the duration of a sentence or order. No central record is kept of the number of those completing DRRs free from drug misuse. A recent research study<sup>(2)</sup> carried out in the community showed that sustaining heroin and crack cocaine users in treatment is effective at reducing misuse and in a significant proportion of cases leads to abstinence.</p>
	<p pid="d.1042W.8/5">Figures from 2007-08 show 85 per cent. of offenders on a DRR being retained in treatment for more than 12 weeks, which is the minimum treatment period reported by the National Treatment Agency and the Drug Interventions Programme as having some impact on drug use and offending.</p>
	<p pid="d.1042W.8/6" class="indent"><sup>(1)</sup> These figures have been drawn from administrative data systems. Although care is taken when processing and analysing the returns, the detail collected is subject to the inaccuracies inherent in any large scale recording system.</p>

	<p pid="d.1044W.2/1">Since June 2008, the Government have committed over &#163;12 million to the Tackling Knives Action Programme, initially to tackle teenage knife crime, and since, March 2009, to tackle knife crime and tackle the minority of young people who commit serious violence, regardless of the weapon involved. Our comprehensive approach to tackling serious youth violence ranges from enforcement action, which shows young people that there are clear consequences to violent behaviour, through to prevention work, which brings about long-term change. One aspect of this has been to provide police forces with additional search equipment. We have provided 1,150 extra search arches and wands to police forces to take knives off the streets and reassure the public. As a result of on-going activity, police forces tell us that there are encouraging signs that knife carrying is reducing among young people.</p>

	<p pid="d.1064W.6/1">The estimated number of households in fuel poverty in the UK was around 2 million in 2003. The latest figures available show that there were around 4 million fuel poor households in the UK in 2007.</p>
	<p pid="d.1064W.6/2">The most recently available sub-regional split of fuel poverty relates to 2006, and shows that there were around 7,600 fuel poor households in the Torbay constituency. In 2003 there were around 2,800 fuel poor households in the Torbay constituency. The methodology used for the 2006 work differs from that previously used, so care should be taken in comparing the fuel poverty levels in one area between 2003 and 2006.</p>

At pre-Budget report 2009, it was announced that the relocations programme has moved nearly 21,000 civil service posts out of London and the south-east-nearly a year ahead of schedule.

	<p pid="d.1071W.3/1">Since the theoretical risk of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (vCJD) transmission through blood was first identified as a possibility in 1996, a series of precautionary measures have been implemented to protect the blood supply and products made by fractionating plasma, including:</p>
	<p pid="d.1071W.3/2" class="italic"> Applicable to all blood/blood products</p>
	<p pid="d.1071W.3/3" class="indent">From December 1997, blood components, plasma products or tissues obtained from any individual who later develops vCJD, have been withdrawn/recalled to prevent their use;</p>
	<p pid="d.1071W.3/4" class="indent">From October 1999, white blood cells (which may carry a risk of transmitting vCJD) have been reduced in all blood used for transfusion, a process known as leucodepletion or leucoreduction;</p>
	<p pid="d.1071W.3/5" class="indent">Following the report of the first possible case of transmission of vCJD by blood transfusion in December 2003, individuals who had themselves received a transfusion of blood components since January 1980 were excluded from donating blood. This took effect from April 2004;</p>
	<p pid="d.1071W.3/6" class="indent">In July 2004, this exclusion criterion for blood donation was extended to include two new groups, who had received transfusions of blood components since 1980:</p>
	<p pid="d.1071W.3/7" class="indent">Previously transfused platelet donors,</p>
	<p pid="d.1071W.3/8" class="indent">Donors who were unsure if they had previously had a blood transfusion. This now applies to donors who have been transfused anywhere in the world;</p>
	<p pid="d.1071W.3/9" class="indent">In July 2005, the Department announced further precautionary measures for around 100 individuals who donated blood to three people who later developed vCJD. The notified people have been asked not to donate blood, tissues or organs and to inform health care professionals so extra precautions can be taken when they have surgery or other invasive procedures; and</p>
	<p pid="d.1071W.3/10" class="indent">In November 2005, the Department announced an extension of the July 2005 notification exercise. A further 50 people who had received blood from some of the 100 or so donors notified since July 2005 were traced and notified of their potential exposure to vCJD, and asked to take similar precautions.</p>

	<p pid="d.1071W.3/12" class="indent">Since 1999, plasma for the manufacture of fractionated plasma products, such as clotting factors, has been obtained from non-UK sources;</p>

	<p pid="d.1071W.3/15" class="indent">The national health service has been instructed to purchase imported solvent detergent-treated pooled plasma for adult patients with thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura; and</p>

	<p pid="d.1071W.3/18" class="indent">To reduce donor exposure, the Advisory Committee on the Safety of Blood, Tissues and Organs in 2009 reiterated its predecessor committee's advice on increasing the percentage of platelets collected by apheresis to at least 80 per cent.</p>

	<p pid="d.1071W.3/20" class="indent">Cryoprecipitate produced from methylene blue treated-plasma imported from the USA is being implemented for children up to the age of 16. The Advisory Committee on the Safety of Blood, Tissues and Organs is reviewing use of cryoprecipitate in older patients.</p>
	<p pid="d.1071W.3/21">All of these recommendations were recommended or endorsed by the Advisory Committee on the Safety of Blood, Tissues and Organs (which first met in January 2008), or its predecessor committees.</p>
	<p pid="d.1071W.3/22">Because of the apparently lengthy incubation period of vCJD and the small number of clinical cases observed to date, it is not possible to make a definitive assessment of the contribution each measure makes to the overall risk reduction.</p>

	<p pid="d.1082W.2/1">The Government have put in place a programme of national health service investment and reform since 1997 to improve service delivery in all parts of the United Kingdom. 93 per cent. of people nationally now rate the NHS as good or excellent. The NHS Constitution contains 25 rights and 14 pledges for patients and the public including new rights to be treated within 18 weeks, or be seen by a cancer specialist within two weeks and a NHS Health Check every five years for those aged 40-74 years.</p>
	<p pid="d.1082W.2/2">There is significant evidence that these policies have yielded considerable benefits for the Streatham constituency. For example:</p>
	<p pid="d.1082W.2/3" class="italic"> Figures for November 2009 show that in Lambeth primary care trust (PCT):</p>
	<p pid="d.1082W.2/4">91 per cent. of patients whose treatment involved admission to hospital started their treatment within 18 weeks.</p>
	<p pid="d.1082W.2/5">97 per cent. of patients whose treatment did not involve admission to hospital started their treatment within 18 weeks.</p>
	<p pid="d.1082W.2/6">Between September 2001 and September 2008 the number of general practitioners (GPs) per 100,000 within Lambeth PCT has increased from 67.9 to 91.9.</p>
	<p pid="d.1082W.2/7">Lambeth PCT opened one of London's first polyclinics-Gracefield Gardens Health and Social Care Centre in Streatham-in June 2008. From April 1 2009, Gracefield Gardens has offered extended opening hours, meaning that any member of the public will be able to see a GP or nurse between 8 am and 8 pm, seven days a week, 365 days a year.</p>
	<p pid="d.1082W.2/8" class="italic"> Guy'<i> s</i><i> and St. Thomas'</i><i> NHS Foundation Trust</i> :</p>
	<p pid="d.1082W.2/9">In September 2009, at Guy's and St. Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust, 98.3 per cent. of patients spent less than four hours in accident and emergency (A&amp;E) from arrival to admission, transfer or discharge.</p>
	<p pid="d.1082W.2/10">Between September 1997 and September 2008 the number of consultants at Guy's and St. Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust has increased from 339 to 432. Between September 1997 and September 2008 the estimated number of nurses has increased from 2,158 to 3,597.</p>
	<p pid="d.1082W.2/11">95.9 per cent. of urgent GP referrals to Guy's and St. Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust with suspected cancer are seen by a specialist within two weeks of the referral.</p>
	<p pid="d.1082W.2/12" class="italic"> King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust:</p>
	<p pid="d.1082W.2/13">In September 2009, at King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, 98.4 per cent. of patients spent less than four hours in A&amp;E from arrival to admission, transfer or discharge.</p>
	<p pid="d.1082W.2/14">Between September 1997 and September 2008 the number of consultants at King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust has increased from 140 to 408. Between September 1997 and September 2008 the estimated number of nurses has increased from 1,595 to 2,507.</p>
	<p pid="d.1082W.2/15">92.7 per cent. of urgent GP referrals to King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust with suspected cancer are seen by a specialist within two weeks of the referral.</p>
	<p pid="d.1082W.2/16" class="italic"> The Lewisham Hospital NHS Trust:</p>
	<p pid="d.1082W.2/17">In September 2009, at King's The Lewisham Hospital NHS Trust, 98.9 per cent. of patients spent less than four hours in A&amp;E from arrival to admission, transfer or discharge.</p>
	<p pid="d.1082W.2/18">Between September 1997 and September 2008 the number of consultants at The Lewisham Hospital NHS Trust has increased from 68 to 103. Between September 1997 and September 2008 the estimated number of nurses has increased from 848 to 1,320.</p>

	<p pid="d.1082W.2/20">Although statistical information is not available at a local level, Streatham will have also benefited from national policies in other areas. For example:</p>
	<p pid="d.1082W.2/21">Since 1997, gross current expenditure on personal social services has increased by around 70 per cent. in real terms with around 105,000 households now receiving intensive home care and 3,076 new extra care housing units-exceeding the original target of 1,500 new extra care units.</p>
	<p pid="d.1082W.2/22">Other strategies currently being implemented are:</p>
	<p pid="d.1082W.2/23" class="indent">Subject to Parliamentary approval, the Personal Care at Home Bill will guarantee free personal care for 280,000 people with the highest needs and help around 130,000 people who need home care for the first time to regain their independence;</p>
	<p pid="d.1082W.2/24" class="indent">&quot;Shaping the Future of Care Together&quot; Green Paper, published in July 2009, sets out a vision for a National Care Service for all adults in England which is fair, simple and affordable.

	<p pid="d.1082W.2/29">Since 1998, there are now 2.4 million fewer smokers in England as a result of the Government's comprehensive tobacco control strategy which has a measurable impact on reducing smoking prevalence.</p>
	<p pid="d.1082W.2/30">Child obesity levels are reducing due to the efforts of families across England, supported by the Government's obesity strategy. In 2008, 13.9 per cent. of children (aged two to 10) in England were classified as obese, compared with 17.3 per cent. in 2005.</p>

	<p pid="d.1088W.3/1">The principle of subsidiarity is not a mechanism for &quot;returning powers&quot; to the member states, but for determining whether or not Community action should be set in motion.</p>
	<p pid="d.1088W.3/2">The member states, through the EU treaties, set the EU certain tasks and give it the powers to achieve those tasks. Article 5 of the treaty establishing the European Community states that, in areas which do not fall within its exclusive competence, the Community shall take action, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, only if and in so far as the objectives of the proposed action cannot be sufficiently achieved by the member states and can therefore, by reason of the scale or effects of the proposed action, be better achieved by the Community.</p>
	<p pid="d.1088W.3/3">Further guidelines for assessing whether these requirements are met are laid down by the Protocol on the application of the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality. The Protocol also requires the Commission to justify the relevance of any of its legislative proposals with regard to the principle of subsidiarity.</p>
	<p pid="d.1088W.3/4">The Lisbon Treaty strengthens the role of national parliaments in EU decision-making, so that for the first time national parliaments could challenge draft EU legislation on subsidiarity grounds. It is for Parliament to decide how to exercise its rights under these procedures.</p>
	<p pid="d.1088W.3/5">The Lisbon Treaty also, for the first time, empowered member states to withdraw from the European Union.</p>

Any issues relating to &quot;the berm&quot; will need to be resolved and considered in that context.</p>
	<p pid="d.1089W.2/5">With regard to part <i> (d)</i> of the question we continue to believe that greater openness and transparency on human rights by all the parties to the dispute would create a significantly better environment for political dialogue. Both sides have imperfect records on human rights. Morocco's record in Western Sahara has improved in recent years, but more needs to be done to provide equality of opportunity for the people of the territory. We welcome the efforts of the parties, in partnership with MINURSO and NGOs, to reduce the threat posed by mines and unexploded ordnance in the region of the berm. We also support the UN Secretary-General's Personal Envoy to Western Sahara, Christopher Ross, in his efforts to build confidence between the parties, including encouragement to cooperate with the UN High Commissioner for Refugees towards establishing family visits by land.</p>

The &quot;Solutions for Business&quot; portfolio includes: business finance, improving innovation and efficiency, business start-up, advice on international trade, work force training, and sector development through regional cluster organisations. The primary access point is Business Link who provides companies with information, diagnostics and brokerage to specific types of support. In a direct response to the downturn Business Link can respond to emergencies within 24 hours and utilise the region's &quot;rapid response team&quot; if required. The agency and Business Link have also been working with partners such as chambers of commerce and local authorities to promote business support services and share intelligence on companies and sectors which have been impacted by the downturn. The NWDA has also worked with the banks and doubled its investment in business finance in 2009/10. The NWDA is tackling short-term economic problems whilst also taking a long-term view in line with the Government's New Industry, New Jobs policy which promotes investment in growth sectors to compete in the global economy.</p>

We are working with other mainstream providers of advice and support to businesses-both inside and outside Government-to ensure that these guides reach as wide an audience as possible; and to guarantee that practical support and guidance on employee engagement remains readily available to employers in the future. More generally, the Department's support for SMEs will continue longer term through the guidance and tools on the Business Link.gov website, the Solutions for Business portfolio of business support products and its National Skills strategy.</p>
