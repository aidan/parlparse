	<p pid="a.478W.8/1">Provisional 2005 results show that the percentage of pupils achieving A*-C grades in maths GCSE increased by 2 percentage points to 52 percent.&mdash;the biggest increase since 1997. That means that around 53,000 more pupils are now achieving a good pass in maths than did so in 1997.</p>
	<p pid="a.478W.8/2">These results represent excellent progress. But we recognise there is further to go and that is why we are continuing to push for even higher standards in the basics.</p>

	<p pid="a.483W.2/2">The main role of PRUs is to ensure that pupils continue to receive an education while not attending mainstream or special schools. PRUs offer their pupils additional support and motivation in order to prepare them for reintegration to mainstream schooling. However, pupils will only be readmitted into mainstream settings when they are ready to benefit from it without disrupting the learning of other pupils. Pupils who need to remain in PRUs for longer periods are offered an education which is appropriate to their age, ability, aptitude and to any specific needs they may have.</p>

	<p pid="a.485W.9/1">Fire and Rescue Authorities do not keep separate figures for their total spending on control centres: the CIPFA statistics cover control room staffing costs only. Therefore the FiReControl project had to commission detailed work on current and forecast costs as a basis for the FiReControl Business Case in 2004. The current version of the business case includes an average forecast cost of &pound;75.6 million per annum as total cost of providing control services from 2004&ndash;05 to 2006&ndash;07, at 2004 prices.</p>

	<p pid="a.486W.2/1">Initial estimates of the cost of establishing nine regional control centres were provided in the Strategic Outline Business Case, which was based on the report by Mott MacDonald 'The Future of Fire and Rescue Service Control Rooms in England and Wales: Update 2003'. Mott MacDonald calculated that over a 10 year period, at 2004 prices, the regional control option would deliver a total net saving of &pound;155 million. It estimated project costs at &pound;100 million, comprising project management costs, technology costs, accommodation costs and redundancy. The Outline Business Case (available on <a href="http://www.firecontrol.odpm.gov.uk">www.firecontrol.odpm.gov.uk</a>) was based on more detailed work and different assumptions, so the costs shown in that cannot be directly compared with the Mott MacDonald costs.</p>

	<p pid="a.494W.2/1">The Treasury's Two-Year Review of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (FSMA), the outcome of which was announced in December 2004, included a reduction in Financial Services Authority (FSA) consultation burdens and reforms making the FSA handbook of rules easier to use. The FSA has subsequently launched other initiatives to simplify its handbook of rules further. The administrative burden associated with requirements to report information to the FSA is currently being assessed by independent consultants as part of the Government's initiative to assess all such burdens generated by all Government bodies and regulators. In parallel the FSA has commissioned independent consultants to assess the cumulative burden of all forms of financial regulation in three business sectors. A person dissatisfied with the FSA's response to a complaint may approach the Office of the Complaints Commissioner, which publishes an annual report. In light of these reports there are no current plans to review the FSA's complaints procedures.</p>

	<p pid="a.496W.2/1">Tax and national insurance have different structures. Many of the differences between the two systems result from the fact that they serve different purposes. Income tax is designed to raise revenue for public spending while NICs are directly linked to entitlement to contributory benefits. Since Martin Taylor's report on work incentives in 1998, the Government have been pursuing a policy of alignment as far as is possible, for example replacing the multiple employer rates with a single rate of national insurance for employers, and aligning the starting point for paying both employers' and employees NICs with the income tax personal allowance. HMRC continues to work with employer representatives and others to look for opportunities to align the tax and NICs rules at a practical level, while having regard to the individuals' benefit entitlements.</p>

The terms and conditions under which they are operated is therefore a matter for the owner and operator of the car park, not the Government.

	<p pid="a.513W.5/1">DFID monitors the evolving food-security situation across Africa through our network of country offices, our humanitarian advisers, and a wide range of specialist partners, including NGOs, the UN and Red Cross agencies. The Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations (FAO)'s report is an important source of information, based primarily on food production. DFID takes this into account in making an overall assessment of the humanitarian situation, while also looking at vulnerability, access to food, coping mechanisms, nutritional status and other indicators.</p>
	<p pid="a.513W.5/2">In Southern Africa (including Malawi, Swaziland and Zimbabwe), DFID has invested heavily in the vulnerability assessment committees (VACs), the main tool used by all partners, including national governments, to assess food emergencies. Based on the latest VAC assessments and other partners' surveys, DFID generally concurs with the broad findings in the FAO report. However, rather than</p>
	<p pid="a.513W.5/3" class="indent">&quot;12 million people in need of emergency food assistance&quot;,</p>
	<p pid="a.513W.5/4">we judge that there are 10.7 million people in the region facing food shortages. Many of these people will require emergency food aid, but some will manage until the next harvest using their own coping strategies and other non-food assistance. In Southern Africa, in response to our assessments, DFID has allocated a total of &pound;56 million for humanitarian assistance and will continue to monitor the situation closely.</p>
	<p pid="a.513W.5/5">In West Africa, DFID has just undertaken its third humanitarian assessment mission since June, to the Sahel (including Burkina, Mali, Mauritania, and Niger). Based on these findings, and those of other partners, we concur with the FAO's September analysis. More recently we have judged agricultural production from the ongoing Sahel harvest to be high, bringing relief and recovery to many areas, but with pockets of continuing need due to localised shortages or the continuing consequences of the recent crisis. In the Mano river countries (including Cote d'Ivoire, Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone), insecurity and population movements have certainly undermined food security, as also suggested by FAO. In both sub-regions, DFID has delivered more than &pound;9 million of humanitarian assistance this year to help address these concerns.</p>
	<p pid="a.513W.5/6">In East Africa., DFID has undertaken humanitarian assessments in Ethiopia and Eritrea. Humanitarian advisers based in Sudan constantly monitor the humanitarian situation there, including emerging food crises. The UK is spending &pound;70 million on its humanitarian assistance in Sudan this year. In Ethiopia, DFID is contributing &pound;43 million to a national safety nets programme providing food and cash to poor families. Eritrea continues to be affected by serious food shortages. It is however, becoming increasingly difficult for relief agencies to operate in the country, affecting the quality of data and the options for humanitarian assistance. The situation in Somalia is also of great concern as increasing insecurity in the grain producing areas of the south reduces the availability of food. Uganda and Tanzania have had good harvests. Civilians displaced by conflict in the north of Uganda, and refugees from Burundi and the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) in Tanzania, are unable to support themselves and require continuing assistance, for which DFID is providing support.</p>
	<p pid="a.513W.5/7">In Central Africa, DFID assessments have been undertaken in the DRC and Burundi. We agree with the FAO's assessment that while production has generally been at or above average, serious food shortages remain among some groups, notably displaced people in the DRC. The Republic of Congo normally produces little food, being reliant on imports. The Central African Republic had a good harvest last year, but the basic indicators remain very poor. In addition insecurity in the north has led to difficulties for the population there, and has resulted in people seeking refuge in southern Chad. Chad also experienced an average year in terms of food production, but refugees there from Darfur, and Central African Republic are not able to produce or purchase their own food. DFID has an assessment team in Chad looking at whether additional support is required over and above the &pound;5 million already provided by DFID this year.</p>

DFID is also supporting projects which will help to improve governance and the capacity of the Government to implement their budget effectively. These include support for public service reform, public financial management, improved revenue mobilisation, anti-corruption institutions and Uganda's transition to multi-party politics.

	<p pid="a.518W.11/1">Literacy and numeracy assessments in the armed services are conducted in either the recruiting process or at an early stage of initial training. Additionally, all Ministry of Defence personnel have the opportunity to undertake an assessment of their literacy and numeracy abilities at an electronic learning centre. We recognise that literacy and numeracy weaknesses exist across the Department and we are addressing these as a high priority.</p>
	<p pid="a.518W.11/2">The Army is currently assisting DfES to develop its new literacy and numeracy initial assessment tools and when this becomes available all armed services will adopt this for use in the recruiting stage. The tool will also be used more widely to support the Department's intention to establish a baseline of its literacy and numeracy abilities across the whole of the armed services between April 2006 and March 2007. We are examining in parallel, the potential use of the new DfES initial assessment tool for new entrants to the MOD civil service.</p>

	<p pid="a.526W.11/1">The Independent Licensing Fees Review Panel, chaired by Sir Les Elton, was established in summer 2005. The panel will consider whether the licensing fees, set by central Government, enable licensing authorities to recover fully their legitimate administration, inspection and enforcement costs, while at the same time achieve arrangements which are fair to business, non commercial organisations and to other individuals seeking licences. Over the last few months, the panel has commissioned evidence from around 70 stakeholder organisations touched by the new fees regime. The panel will deliver an interim report shortly, followed by a final report in autumn 2006 detailing findings and where appropriate making recommendations for the development of the licensing fees regime.</p>

	<p pid="a.529W.9/2">Swimming also has a significant role to play within the national strategy for PE, school sport and club links, delivered jointly with the Department for Education and Skills. We have recently carried out a pilot programme which tested out how best to support those children who reach the end of key stage 2 and are not able to swim 25metres. We intend to implement this programme nationally from April 2006 and over &pound;5 million of funding has been allocated to support the scheme in 2006&ndash;07 and 2007&ndash;08. A further &pound;485,000 is being invested in 2005&ndash;06 with the ASA through the school to community programmes; club links and step into sport (SiS), which are aimed at sustaining participation outside school hours.</p>

	<p pid="a.532W.7/1">Such a scheme would place a considerable administrative burden on the police and would be disproportionate in terms of its effect on legitimate users when measured against the benefits in reducing crime. We have, however, included various measures in the Violent Crime Reduction Bill which will further tighten existing controls on air weapons, including a requirement for them to be sold through registered firearms dealers. The majority of air weapons have no serial number or identification mark making them very difficult to record for the purposes of a licensing scheme.</p>
	<p pid="a.532W.7/2">Possession of an air weapon is not an offence and so a general amnesty as such would not be appropriate. Individual police forces can, and do, encourage people to hand in unwanted air weapons, particularly when there is a problem of misuse in their force area</p>

	<p pid="a.533W.14/2">Following their establishment in summer 2004, a survey of the original 12 antisocial behaviour response courts was undertaken in autumn 2005. This survey took the form of court visits and meetings with representatives from the courts and other local agencies. The evidence gathered was used in the development of the antisocial behaviour response court model and in the production of a good practice guide.</p>
	<p pid="a.533W.14/3">Since the roll out of the model across England and Wales and the establishment of 154 antisocial behaviour response courts, further surveys have been undertaken. Areas have been required to complete a written self-assessment, outlining how they have implemented the framework. Interviews have been conducted with local Crown Prosecution Service representatives to provide an independent view of progress. A multi-agency conference on the courts and antisocial behaviour last week provided a further opportunity for feedback on the performance of the antisocial behaviour response courts.</p>

	<p pid="a.535W.2/1">The Government believe that the European Union has an important role to play in the fight against terrorism. While the prime responsibility for protection of citizens remains a national one, effective co-operation by EU member states, supported by appropriate EU bodies, is a key part of our response to this threat.</p>
	<p pid="a.535W.2/2">Following the attacks in Madrid on <phrase class="date" code="2004-03-11">11 March 2004</phrase>, the EU drafted an Action Plan to combat terrorism. This contained a list of measures for implementation at both an EU and national level. In the wake of the London bombings the <phrase class="date" code="">13 July</phrase> Extraordinary JHA Council committed to accelerate delivery of outstanding proposals in the plan. This is a priority for the current UK presidency and we are on course to achieve a great deal. However, there is still much to do and the current Action Plan is due for replacement by the end of December.</p>
	<p pid="a.535W.2/3">We aim to deliver a revised and refreshed plan, together with a strategic framework that would give a greater sense of direction to EU counter-terrorism co-operation. The EU will continue to build on current achievements to maximise the effectiveness of its efforts.</p>

	<p pid="a.540W.5/2">The prolific and other priority offenders (PPO) strategy is at the heart of the Government's efforts to reduce crime and disorder. This strategy, which was launched by my right hon. friend the Prime Minister in March 2004, targets not only existing prolific offenders but also those young people who are on the cusp of a prolific offending lifestyle. The strategy has three strands: prevent and deter&mdash;to stop young people becoming prolific offenders; catch and convict&mdash;tackling those who are already prolific offenders; and rehabilitate and resettle&mdash;working to increase the number of offenders who stop offending by offering a range of supportive interventions.</p>
	<p pid="a.540W.5/3">This multi-agency approach to offender management built on, and replaced, the previous persistent offender scheme. Since September 2004 PPO schemes have been established in each Crime and Disorder Reduction Partnership area in England and each Community Safety Partnership in Wales. These schemes allow local partners, such as the police, prisons, probation and the local authority to concentrate their joint efforts on monitoring and rehabilitating the relatively small number of people who have been identified locally as causing most harm to their communities.</p>
	<p pid="a.540W.5/4">Over 10,000 existing prolific offenders have been identified by schemes across England and Wales. In addition, about 4,000 young people are likely to be identified as suitable for support as part of the prevent and deter strand. An initial impact evaluation for the strategy is currently underway. Guidance for all three strands, as well as monthly performance management framework reports, can be found on the website <a href="http://www.crimereduction.gov.uk/ppominisite01.htm">http://www.crimereduction.gov.uk/ppominisite01.htm</a>.</p>

	<p pid="a.549W.11/1">Section 10(4) of the Representation of the People Act 1983 provides that the form electoral registration officers must use for the annual canvass is to be that provided in regulations, or a form to the same effect. In England and Wales, the current form is prescribed in the Representation of the People (Form of Canvass) (England and Wales) Regulations 2004.</p>
	<p pid="a.549W.11/2">There is no prescribed form in relation to applications for registration outside of the annual canvass, but such 'rolling registration' applications must provide the information set out in regulation 26 of the Representation of the People (England and Wales) Regulations 2001.</p>
	<p pid="a.549W.11/3">My Department is currently undertaking a project to evaluate the extent to which an improved prescribed canvass form might make the registration process simpler for electors, and whether other electoral forms might also benefit from greater standardisation. Any regulations arising from this project are likely to be made during 2006.</p>

The research identified that the majority of non-registrants in 2000 came from three groups; those living with their parents (particularly attainers), people who have moved within the six months prior to the qualifying date, and people renting from a private landlord. The research highlighted the importance of people's individual and household situation and attitudes towards politics and voting. There was also a link between the presence and actions of the head of the household and non-registration.</p>

	<p pid="a.552W.14/1">Child abuse certificates are not identified separately in the Legal Services Commission's computerised records. The Commission can provide figures calculated from its records of specific, identified group actions only, where a number of parties wish to bring very similar actions against a single person. The cost of stand-alone, individual cases cannot be calculated.</p>
	<p pid="a.552W.14/2">Net expenditure on identified group actions related to child abuse for the financial years 2000&ndash;01 to 2004&ndash;05 were as follows:</p>

	<p pid="a.554W.2/1">The Government currently has no plans to implement the collection of national insurance numbers in voter registration outside of Northern Ireland. This is in line with recommendations made by the Electoral Commission and in the joint Office of the Deputy Prime Minister and Constitutional Affairs Select Committee report, &quot;Electoral Registration&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.554W.2/2">The Electoral Administration Bill, currently before Parliament, provides for the piloting and possible subsequent national rollout of the collection of 'personal identifiers' at the point at which a person registers to vote. These identifiers are specified at clause 14 as a signature, date of birth and such other information relating to an individual as is prescribed. Although this power to prescribe further identifiers is wide enough to provide for the collection of national insurance numbers, the Government does not intend to move forward in this way.</p>
