	<p pid="b.1072W.6/1">BCMS receives around 49,000 applications each week for cattle passports. Passports are produced provided there is reasonable evidence to show that farmers submitted applications in good time or were prevented from doing so by factors outside their control. These factors include known postal strikes.</p>
	<p pid="b.1072W.6/2">If applications were not submitted in reasonable time then a passport would be refused and farmers would be unable to move the animal from their holding. 0.35 per cent. of all applications received are normally refused, subject to appeal because they are late. The figures from the last postal strike show that 0.45 per cent. of applications were initially refused. Three quarters of these appealed against the decision and were successful because of the postal strike delays. This compares with 55 per cent. of such appeals during a similar period the previous year.</p>

	<p pid="b.1073W.6/1">Earlier this year, DEFRA commissioned Ipsos MORI to gauge awareness of the Public Sector Food Procurement Initiative (PSFPI) in schools and local authorities. The survey included questions on the proportion of tenders from small and local producers, including meat producers. The results were positive with:</p>
	<p pid="b.1073W.6/2" class="indent">three in five schools (59 per cent.) and four in five local authorities stating that they encourage tenders from small and local producers;</p>
	<p pid="b.1073W.6/3" class="indent">almost seven in 10 local authorities (69 per cent.) stating that at least half the food supplied to schools in their area is from small and local producers;</p>

	<p pid="b.1074W.2/1">There are no plans to compensate auction markets who suffered closure owing to foot and mouth measures, or farmers who were unable to enter their stock for sale in such auction markets.</p>
	<p pid="b.1074W.2/2">Under the Animal Health Act 1981, compensation is paid for animals that are compulsorily slaughtered to prevent the spread of disease. For foot and mouth disease (FMD), the Act requires that compensation is paid at the full market value before the animal became infected. This is determined by an approved valuer at the time of slaughter. Compensation is also paid for other items, such as farm equipment and feed, where these are seized because they are considered to be contaminated; this includes such things as milk. However, it is a long established principle that the Government do not meet the costs of consequential losses, which must be borne by the industry. Government seek to minimise the risk of market impacts, particularly by encouraging public understanding of the issues.</p>
	<p pid="b.1074W.2/3">We are taking a risk-based and staged approach to easing movement restrictions when the evidence indicates that it is appropriate to do so. This is the best way to facilitate the return to normal working for the industry. We are working in partnership with the industry, but eradication of foot and mouth disease remains our priority.</p>

	<p pid="b.1080W.0/2">The BBC has responsibility for the administration of the television licensing system and the maintenance of television licence records. I understand from the BBC, however, that they are not able to provide a breakdown by constituency or TV region of the number of TV licences issued, as there is no operational need for the BBC to hold the information in this way. The information is recorded at individual address level and aggregated to national level for reporting purposes.</p>

	<p pid="b.1088W.8/1">We remain concerned about the treatment of religious minorities in Iran. The Baha'i faith is not formally recognised under the Iranian Constitution and as a result Baha'is routinely face persecution and discrimination. In recent years Baha'is have been subject to arbitrary arrests, confiscation of property and restrictions on employment. Denial of access to higher education has been a long-term problem for Baha'i students.</p>
	<p pid="b.1088W.8/2">After the religious identifier was removed from the national university entrance examination in 2006, a number of Baha'i students sat the exam for last academic year (2006-07). Over 250 Baha'i students were admitted to campuses across Iran, but 120 were expelled throughout the year as the universities discovered their religion. This year, students applying to study at technical and vocational institutes were required to complete a form stating their religion. The options did not include the Baha'i religion, so Baha'i students were once again effectively excluded from applying to these institutions. We do not yet know the situation facing Baha'i university students this academic year, but we remain concerned that more Baha'is may be prevented from applying to university or expelled in the future.</p>
	<p pid="b.1088W.8/3">We continue to monitor the situation and raise concerns about the treatment of the Baha'is with the Iranian authorities, bilaterally and through the EU. The EU presidency raised specific concerns about the issue of Baha'i access to higher education in meetings with the Iranian Ministry of Foreign Affairs on <phrase class="date" code="">1 September</phrase> and <phrase class="date" code="">10 October</phrase>.</p>

	<p pid="b.1093W.0/1">From April 2006, older and disabled people have been guaranteed free off-peak local bus travel within their local authority area.

	<p pid="b.1093W.0/2">Formula Grant is an unhypothecated block grant i.e. authorities are free to spend the money on any service.

The Department has recently published a consultation paper on the formula basis for distribution of the special grant. This new consultation supersedes the Department for Communities and Local Government's consultation on the formula grant options for concessionary fares. Local authorities have been asked to respond to the special grant consultation by <phrase class="date" code="">23 November</phrase>.</p>

	<p pid="b.1095W.4/1">The administration of the Child Support Agency is a matter for the Chief Executive. He will write to the hon. Member with the information requested.</p>
	<p pid="b.1095W.4/2" class="italic"> Letter from Stephen Geraghty, dated <phrase class="date" code="2007-10-17">17 October 2007</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="b.1095W.4/3" class="indent">In reply to your recent Parliamentary Questions regarding the Child Support Agency the Secretary of State promised a substantive reply from the Chief Executive.</p>
	<p pid="b.1095W.4/4" class="indent">You asked the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, how many liability orders the Child Support Agency has applied for in each month since January 2003; how many of these were inaccurate in any particular; and how many were (a) withdrawn and (b) dismissed. (146178)</p>
	<p pid="b.1095W.4/5" class="indent">Such information as is available is set out in the attached table. The Agency holds information on; the number of liability orders it has applied for, the numbers subsequently granted as well as information on the numbers of applications withdrawn by the Agency pre and post hearing and the numbers of cases dismissed by the Courts. This information is recorded and validated on a yearly basis only. The Agency currently does not hold management information on the accuracy of individual elements of child maintenance cases such as the liability order process.</p>
	<p pid="b.1095W.4/6" class="indent">Information on a range of enforcement actions is routinely published in the Quarterly Summary of Statistics (QSS). A copy of this is available in the House of Commons Library and is also available on the Internet via the following link:</p>
	<p pid="b.1095W.4/7" class="indent"><a href="http://www.dwp.gov.uk/asd/asd1/child_support/csa_quarterly_jun07.asp">www.dwp.gov.uk/asd/asd1/child_support/csa_quarterly_jun07.asp</a></p>
	<p pid="b.1095W.4/8" class="indent">The Agency seeks liability orders in cases where the non-resident parent is failing to meet their responsibilities to maintain their children. In many cases, as the non-resident parent may not have co-operated fully in the assessment and calculation of their maintenance liability, the Agency will proceed on the basis of the information available. As the Agency will continue to correspond with the non-resident parent throughout the time taken for a liability order to be granted, the non-resident parent can at any time supply information which may lead to a review of the maintenance assessment, or indeed make payments to comply with the maintenance liability. In addition, in some cases the parent with care can request that any maintenance owed directly to them not be recovered, the Agency will then consider withdrawing the liability order application prior to the court hearing.</p>
	<p pid="b.1095W.4/9" class="indent">Once a liability order is being actively considered by the Court, the non-resident parent can make representations for the Court to dismiss the liability order. The Courts currently dismiss less than one per cent of applications. The Agency believes that this is a good indication of the robustness of the checking regime currently in place. Finally, once a liability order has been awarded, the non-resident parent can again bring forward additional information, or indeed settle their arrears and the Agency may again consider whether it is appropriate to proceed with the application.</p>
	<p pid="b.1095W.4/10" class="indent">It should therefore be noted that there are many reasons that the Agency may withdraw a liability order application, however the Agency currently does not record individual reasons an application may be withdrawn. The most relevant measure of the accuracy of the Agency's process is therefore the low numbers of cases dismissed by the Courts, following representations from the non-resident parent.</p>

Through the Child Maintenance and Other Payments Bill we intend to strengthen the range of enforcement and debt management powers that will be at the disposal of the Commission. The Bill proposes new and streamlined enforcement provisions such as administrative liability orders, disqualification from holding or obtaining a travel authorisation, collection of maintenance directly from accounts held by financial institutions, enforcing the surrender of a non-resident parent's passport and imposing a curfew.</p>
	<p pid="b.1098W.5/5">New debt management powers, such as the ability to accept part payment of arrears in full and final settlement, will, where appropriate, take account of the wishes of the parent with care. These powers will help the Commission manage debt, including interim maintenance assessment debt. The new debt management and enforcement measures will be used both to encourage ongoing compliance to prevent the new debt building up, and to enable more of the accumulated debt to be recovered.</p>

	<p pid="b.1108W.0/1">The Government are determined to ratify the Convention as soon as we can but are determined to get the arrangements right before doing so. We need to be compliant with the Convention before formal ratification. Some of the other signatories to the Convention have legal systems that allow or require ratification before implementation&mdash;ours does not. The UK is already largely compliant with the Convention but some amendments to primary/secondary legislation will be required, as will the development of guidance and the institution of new processes. A dedicated project team within the Border and Immigration Agency is leading delivery of the changes needed to comply with the Convention and is reporting regularly to a cross-government official project board and Ministerial Group. Action against trafficking is continuing and is not on hold pending ratification. During the ongoing, police-led anti-trafficking operation, Pentameter 2 we are piloting an identification process and a 30-day reflection period, as required by Article 10 and 13 of the Convention.</p>

	<p pid="b.1110W.2/1">We do not distribute grant to police authorities purely on the basis of population. The police funding formula uses a range of socio- demographic data to reflect the relative needs of each authority. Grant allocations also take into account the relative resources of each authority. Grant allocations are stabilised by damping changes to limit year-on-year variations. Devon and Cornwall actually receives &pound;1.9 million more than it would on a strict application of the funding formula.</p>

	<p pid="b.1119W.6/1">During financial year 2004-05, a total of 379 training events were scheduled in the Defence exercise programme (DXP) of which 79 (20 per cent.) were cancelled. While specific reasons for cancellation are not available in many cases, and could be provided only at disproportionate cost, the programme was affected by competing operational priorities. Since that time, improved data capture has enabled a more detailed review of the DXP.</p>
	<p pid="b.1119W.6/2">During financial year 2005-06, a total of 533 training events were scheduled in the DXP of which 58 (10.8 per cent.) were cancelled. 30 exercises were cancelled due to operational commitments, 13 were removed as savings measures and 10 were cancelled by other nations. The remaining five events were cancelled in response to changing priorities or rescheduling.</p>
	<p pid="b.1119W.6/3">In financial year 2006-07, a total of 699 training events were scheduled in the DXP of which 69 (9.8 per cent.) were cancelled. 35 exercises were cancelled due to operational commitments, five were removed as savings measures and 14 were cancelled by other nations. The remaining 15 events were cancelled in response to changing priorities or rescheduling.</p>

	<p pid="b.1124W.2/1">The NATO Response Force is a high-readiness reaction force which comprises four elements (maritime, land, air and special forces) to which allies contribute forces on a six-month rotating basis. The UK is providing the Maritime Component Command for the current rotation of the NATO Response Force (July 2007 to January 2008). The UK forces supporting the Maritime Component Command are drawn, as required, from the Joint Rapid Reaction Force and comprise a carrier group with associated air and surface assets, amphibious forces, naval mine counter measures units, and auxiliary support vessels. In addition, the UK is making some air-to-air refuelling and in-theatre lift assets available to the Air Component Command.</p>

	<p pid="b.1128W.0/1">DFID's strategy &quot;Working Together for Better Health&quot;, published in June 2007 sets out our approach to support developing countries to improve the health of their people and reaching the Millennium Development Goals. This is to deliver more resources for health; to expand access to basic health services; to improve the effectiveness of international funding for health; and to demonstrate results and build the evidence base of what works.</p>
	<p pid="b.1128W.0/2">Our spending on health has doubled since 2002-03. About 15 per cent. of our aid goes to health, a total of &pound;800 million in 2006-07. Overall, the UK is the second largest donor to health. Most of this help is directed through our country programmes. For example, in Bangladesh, DFID is the largest supporter of the health sector donor pooled fund. Immunisation coverage has reached 80 per cent. for the five vaccine-preventable diseases and infant mortality is down from 116 to 88 (1994-2004).</p>
	<p pid="b.1128W.0/3">The International Health Partnership, launched by the Prime Minister on <phrase class="date" code="">5 September</phrase>, will help ensure that increasing resources are used more effectively to strengthen health systems and deliver better care and services. In bringing together international agencies, major donors and partner countries, it will work to make sure health services better meet individual country needs.</p>

	<p pid="b.1128W.3/1">DFID's policy on Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR)<sup>(1)</sup> is to support measures to prevent and mitigate the impact of natural disasters at the global, country and community level. At the global level, DFID is supporting DRR programmes through the Geneva-based UN International Strategy for DRR, the World Bank, the ProVention Consortium of Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs) and the International Federation of Red Cross Societies. DFID is also supporting the community-level DRR work of five NGOs.</p>
	<p pid="b.1128W.3/2">DFID's support for DRR through its regional programmes includes the Chars Livelihoods Programme in Bangladesh, which has helped raise 32,700 households on plinths above the flood level; the Caribbean Catastrophic Risk Insurance Facility, to enable Governments to jump-start recovery efforts after disasters; and an NGO Consortium for DRR in Niger, which aims to strengthen vulnerable communities. Following the Government's commitment to allocate up to 10 per cent. of each emergency response to a natural disaster to DRR, where appropriate, DFID is supporting DRR in Indonesia; the Indian Ocean Early Warning System; UN capacity-building in climate adaptation; and the World Health Organisation Disease Early Warning System and institutional capacity-building in Pakistan.</p>

	<p pid="b.1133W.2/2">Outline assessments during the bid phase were conducted on the basis of providing the overlay required to stage shooting events at the National Shooting Centre at Bisley. However, during the bidding phase, the International Olympic Committee commented on the distance between Bisley and the Olympic Park. On the basis of this feedback, and following consultation with the International Shooting Federation, the Royal Artillery Barracks was selected as the shooting venue, due to its iconic location and its close proximity to the Olympic Park and Village. These factors will improve the athlete and spectator experience by limiting travel and making it easier to attend other Games events on the same day in the Olympic Park.</p>

The Act imposes specific requirements for prior shareholder authorisation in areas likely to give rise to conflicts of interest, such as loans by the company to a director or long-term service contracts for directors. Chapters 4 and 6 of part 15 of the Act also impose disclosure requirements in respect of directors' remuneration, directors' service contracts, and advances, credit and guarantees to directors.</p>

	<p pid="b.1154W.5/1">Guidance on the discharge of public authorities' functions is provided in a code of practice under section 45 of the Act, which is laid before Parliament by the Secretary of State and Lord Chancellor. This guidance sets the procedure for dealing with complaints, referred to as internal reviews. Any request for an internal review must be dealt with in accordance with the code of practice. It contains no specific guidance on time limits for requesters to ask for internal reviews. In response to FOI requests received by the Ministry of Justice, the requester is informed via a letter that they may ask for an internal review within two calendar months from the date of that letter. This is consistent with the time limit set out in the Environmental Information Regulations under Regulation 11(2) of 40 days to issue a complaint. Public authorities are free to decide, on a case by case basis, whether they will carry out an internal review requested after this period has elapsed.</p>

	<p pid="b.1156W.0/1">It is not known how many applications have been made to Land Registry in each of the last three years that have resulted in a fraudulent registration, whether in respect of the ownership of land or of a mortgage on land. This is because, firstly, there may be cases that have not come to light, and, secondly, Land Registry does not presently keep a central record of all frauds that affect the register of title. Land Registry does keep a central record of all cases where it pays statutory compensation, including those which result from fraud. It is also in the process of developing a more comprehensive method of recording fraud, whether or not it results in the payment of compensation.</p>
	<p pid="b.1156W.0/2">Any owner of land who suffers loss as a result of the registration of a forged transfer or mortgage through no fault of their own is entitled to be compensated for that loss by Land Registry.</p>
	<p pid="b.1156W.0/3">Land Registry paid statutory compensation as a result of fraud on a total of 15 claims in 2004-05, 31 claims in 2005-06 and 24 claims in 2006-07. To put this into context, there are currently more than 21 million registered titles and, in each of the last three years, Land Registry received around 4 million applications to register transfers for value and mortgages.</p>

	<p pid="b.1159W.5/1">The fixed fee schemes being introduced for civil, family, immigration and criminal legally aided work set fees for particular tasks or groups of tasks. Thus the fees are graduated according to the requirements of work. This move from remuneration for each hour worked to payment for each job done is an essential part of our strategy for reform of legal aid.</p>

	<p pid="b.1159W.8/1">Since the Mental Capacity Act 2005 received Royal Assent we have held a series of public consultations seeking views as we have developed the code of practice and secondary legislation to support the implementation of the Act. In addition to the formal responses to consultation we have on occasion received representations on the Act from members of the public via their Members of Parliament. Since April 2007 we have received 43 such communications asking questions or commenting on the Act's provisions.</p>
	<p pid="b.1159W.8/2">There have been two minor changes to the Mental Capacity Act 2005 to date, both of which were introduced by the Mental Health Act 2007. The first made a minor amendment to section 20(11)(a) of the Mental Capacity Act 2005 to correct a drafting error by replacing the word &quot;or&quot; with &quot;and&quot;. The second amended section 49 of the Act to clarify the occasions when it is not necessary to appoint an Independent Mental Capacity Advocate.</p>
	<p pid="b.1159W.8/3">In addition the Mental Health Act 2007 contains provisions that will amend the Mental Capacity Act 2005 to introduce new safeguards to address the issues raised in the European Court of Human Rights judgment on <phrase class="date" code="2004-10-05">5 October 2004</phrase> in the case of HL <i> v</i>. the United Kingdom.</p>
	<p pid="b.1159W.8/4">A number of pieces of secondary legislation that prescribe the detail of how the Act will operate have been laid before Parliament and have come into force as of <phrase class="date" code="2007-10-01">1 October 2007</phrase>. In addition the Office of the Public Guardian has produced a wide range of forms, guidance and other information related to the operation of the Act. The Department's Mental Capacity Implementation Programme and the Office of the Public Guardian have also regularly informed stakeholders and customers of progress implementing the Act via update newsletters.</p>
	<p pid="b.1159W.8/5">I have laid a table in the House Library today providing a list of the main secondary legislation, forms and guidance and newsletters produced by the Department to support the implementation of the Act. Further information may be produced in the next 12 months as required.</p>

	<p pid="b.1165W.5/1">Mirena is an intrauterine device (IUD) that releases a medicine, levonorgestrel, directly into the uterus. It is authorised for contraception, reduction of heavy menstrual bleeding (menorrhagia) and protection from endometrial hyperplasia during oestrogen replacement therapy. Since Mirena first became available in the United Kingdom women have been able to obtain it through the national health service.</p>
	<p pid="b.1165W.5/2">The Medicines and Healthcare product Regulatory Agency (MHRA), together with independent expert advice for the Commission on Human Medicines is responsible for ensuring that medicines, including Mirena, have met appropriate standards of efficacy, safety and quality before they are granted a marketing authorisation and for ensuring that the benefits of treatment continue to outweigh the risks post authorisation, as further evidence emerges.</p>
	<p pid="b.1165W.5/3">In addition to efficacy studies conducted by the marketing authorisation holder, Schering Health, prior to grant of a marketing authorisation, the Department has funded a number of studies to evaluate the effectiveness of Mirena (mainly in the indication of menstrual bleeding). These include the ongoing ECLIPSE randomised controlled trial in 1,200 women with menorrhagia.</p>
	<p pid="b.1165W.5/4">The MHRA monitors the safety of all medicines, including Mirena, by evaluating data including adverse reaction reports received through the Yellow Card Scheme, published data, company studies and safety reviews, and information from other regulatory authorities. The benefits associated with Mirena are currently considered to outweigh the risks in its licensed indications.</p>
	<p pid="b.1165W.5/5">The safety of Mirena was recently subject to European review and this has lead to a recommendation to clarify advice about the recognised risks of ectopic pregnancy and uterine perforation. As a precautionary measure, Mirena will be contraindicated in women with progesterone-dependent cancers. The product information for health professionals is being updated to reflect this advice.</p>
	<p pid="b.1165W.5/6">The marketing authorisation holder is planning two studies: one to compare the risk of breast cancer in Mirena users with the risk in copper IUD users and users of other hormonal contraceptives and the other to compare the risk of uterine perforation in Mirena users with that in copper IUD users.</p>

	<p pid="b.1166W.5/1">The Department does not hold detailed records of laptops, mobile telephones and personal digital assistant (PDA) devices provided specifically to Ministers since 1997. However, the policy is to provide Ministers with one laptop, one mobile telephone, and one PDA each, where they have declared a requirement for such equipment. This equipment is usually new but may be re-allocated equipment depending on age and condition of the device. When a Minister leaves the Department the equipment is returned for re-allocation.</p>
	<p pid="b.1166W.5/2">Following this year's Cabinet reshuffle, the six current Ministers have been allocated a total of five laptops, one mobile phone and four Blackberry devices which have dual mobile phone and PDA functionality. The team of Ministers before the reshuffle were allocated four laptops, five mobile phones and four Blackberry devices.</p>

	<p pid="b.1169W.2/1">The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) has so far received applications for traditional herbal registration in relation to 29 products from a total of nine different companies. Five registrations have been granted and the other 24 applications are under assessment. In the light of discussions with individual companies, the MHRA expects steady growth in the number of applications received and registrations granted. The rate of build up of the scheme is reflective of the extent to which many companies needed to acquire expertise, for example in the manufacture of herbal medicines to systematic quality standards, before they could be in a position to submit applications.</p>
	<p pid="b.1169W.2/2">Under provisions in Directive 2004/24 /EC, unlicensed herbal medicines legally on the United Kingdom market at <phrase class="date" code="2004-04-30">30 April 2004</phrase> under section 12(2) of the Medicines Act 1968 received transitional protection until <phrase class="date" code="">30 April 2011</phrase>. Following discussions with industry and the former Better Regulation Task Force the MHRA decided not to require companies to notify the agency of products for which transitional protection was claimed. Accordingly, there is no estimate of the number of products on the UK market being sold legally under section 12(2) but which cannot legally be placed on the market after <phrase class="date" code="">30 April 2011</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.1169W.2/3">We do not believe it is realistic to specify a date by which applications need to be made in order to secure continuity of supply. Time taken by the MHRA to assess applications depends on a number of factors including the quality of the application and how quickly the applicant responds to queries raised by the MHRA. The MHRA is giving extensive help to the industry through individual company meetings. Guidance to industry has stressed the importance of companies progressing their applications now if they wish to ensure continuity of supply.</p>

	<p pid="b.1170W.8/1">Many pharmaceutical interventions that would be used in an influenza pandemic (such as antiviral drugs and antibiotics) are also used for other purposes, and research conducted for such purposes would inform our response in an influenza pandemic. Research on seasonal influenza vaccines is also relevant to the development and use of vaccines for use in pandemic influenza.</p>
	<p pid="b.1170W.8/2">Over the last 10 years, the main part of the Department's total expenditure on health research has been devolved to and managed by national health service organisations.

In December 2005, the Medical Research Council announced a &pound;13.5 million initiative for research relevant to pandemic influenza. A number of other publicly funded bodies also support research relevant to pandemic influenza.</p>
