	<p pid="a.744W.2/1">Hydraulic fracturing has long been used to increase the productivity of oil and gas fields and, more recently, of shale gas reservoirs, where the rock has low natural permeability. The Department has no objection to the use of this technique so long as all of the relevant environmental and planning assessments have been carried out and permissions granted. I have had no discussions with my EU counterparts on the regulation of the use of hydraulic fracturing.</p>

Declining UK crude oil production will lead to an increase in the overall UK stockholding obligation.

	<p pid="a.752W.5/1">The spending review recognises the importance of social care in protecting most vulnerable in society. In recognition of the pressures on the social care system in a challenging local government settlement, the coalition Government have allocated an additional &#163;2 billion by 2014-15 to support the delivery of social care. This means, with an ambitious programme of efficiency, that there is enough funding available both to protect people's access to services and deliver new approaches to improve quality and outcomes.</p>
	<p pid="a.752W.5/2">We have achieved this in two ways:</p>
	<p pid="a.752W.5/3" class="indent">The national health service will transfer some funding from the health capital budget to health revenue, to be spent on measures that support social care, which also benefits health. This funding will rise to &#163;1 billion in 2014-15, and will promote improved joint working between the health and social care systems. The new NHS Operating Framework will set out specific primary care trust (PCT) allocations that they will transfer to local authorities for spending on social care services to benefit health, and to improve overall health gain. PCTs and local authorities will need to work together to agree jointly appropriate areas for social care investment, with a shared analysis of need and a common agreement on the outcomes to be met. Next year, this funding will be worth &#163;15.4 million to Birmingham city council.</p>
	<p pid="a.752W.5/4" class="indent">Additional grant funding, rising to &#163;1 billion by 2014-15, will be made available for social care. This funding will be allocated in addition to the Department's existing social care grants, which will rise in line with inflation. Total grant funding from the Department for social care will reach &#163;2.4 billion by 2014-15. In order to support local flexibility and to reduce administrative burdens, this funding will go to authorities through the Revenue Support Grant.</p>
	<p pid="a.752W.5/5">Decisions on funding for adult social care are a matter for Birmingham city council, and will depend on local needs and priorities.</p>

	<p pid="a.754W.3/1">My right hon. Friend, the Foreign Secretary, Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) Ministers and officials receive representations on human rights violations overseas on a regular basis. Where possible the Foreign Secretary, Ministers and officials meet with those making the representations. For example, the Foreign Secretary met with Amnesty International in October. Most recently he met with his new Human Rights Advisory Group where they discussed a wide range of human rights issues relating to conflict, counter-terrorism, and religious freedom, as well as specific countries of concern and broader strategic trends. As Minister with responsibility for human rights policy, I met with Open Doors earlier this month to receive a petition against the UN Defamation of Religions Resolution.</p>
	<p pid="a.754W.3/2">The FCO's overseas missions receive information on human rights, including allegations of abuse, from a wide variety of sources. These include local non-governmental organisations, human rights defenders and local media. Our missions use this information in their assessment of the local human rights situation, and raise allegations of human rights abuses with host governments on a case-by-case basis. We do not centrally hold information on all representations received on human rights violations. To provide this information an FCO-wide search would be required which would incur disproportionate cost.</p>
	<p pid="a.754W.3/3">Human rights reporting is key to our work to promote and protect human rights around the world. The FCO will publish a command paper in spring 2011 which will detail our human rights work around the world and our assessment of the human rights situation in a number of countries.</p>

The IDF do not publish records prior to 2002. Since then a total of 11,293 rockets have been fired at Israel, of which 7,778 have been since 2005. The IDF note that at current levels 2010 is set to be the year with the lowest number of rocket attacks since 2002. This is small comfort to those at the receiving end and we continue to condemn all rocket attacks. Such acts of terrorism are indiscriminate and frequently target civilian populations.

The remainder was available to support short term projects led by Israeli and Palestinian non-governmental organisations.

Unallocated funds for the remainder of the year are currently being reviewed. No new spending will be allocated until after the full implications of the review are known.

	<p pid="a.770W.5/4">In conjunction with other development partners, the UK also helped the Government of Bangladesh develop a Country Investment Plan for agriculture, food security and nutrition. This provides a coherent set of priority investment programmes, including on adapting to climate change. The report can be accessed at:</p>

	<p pid="a.771W.2/1">The Department for International Development (DFID) has spent &#163;11,917,185 on climate change adaptation in Bangladesh over the last five years through a number of programmes. One major programme, the Comprehensive Disaster Management programme, has helped local communities develop disaster risk reduction action plans and provided funds to implement them. It has also provided support for national early warning systems that provide information on cyclone and flood risks to the general population. These activities directly benefit smallholder farmers as well as other vulnerable people, including the extreme poor and landless.</p>
	<p pid="a.771W.2/2">DFID does not keep separate records of amounts spent on climate change adaptation for smallholder farmers in Bangladesh.

	<p pid="a.771W.5/1">The Department for International Development monitors the food security situation in Bangladesh closely, drawing on our own analysis as well as external sources (e.g. the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations and the Bangladesh Food Policy Monitoring Unit). Our current assessment is that rice production in 2010 will be around 3% higher than in 2009 and that there is no general shortage of food in the country. However, food prices continue to rise faster than general inflation and around 20% of the population continue to suffer from food insecurity. Although not heavily dependent on food imports, Bangladesh also remains vulnerable to fluctuations in global food prices, particularly for rice and wheat.</p>
	<p pid="a.771W.5/2">Food insecurity is particularly acute in the southern areas of Bangladesh, which were affected by cyclone Aila in 2009. Through the World Food Programme, the UK is providing additional food and nutritional supplements to 13,000 families who continue to live on embankments more than one year after the cyclone.</p>

	<p pid="a.775W.2/1">The UK is working actively to prevent conflict and build peace in Sudan. We are a strong supporter of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement and we are working intensively with partners to ensure a peaceful and credible Southern Sudan referendum in January 2011, whose outcome is respected by all and which lays the basis for peaceful relations between North and South. I visited Sudan in November to press for progress and the Foreign Secretary chaired a special Security Council session on Sudan on <phrase class="date" code="2010-11-16">16 November</phrase> under our presidency to build international consensus. The UK also continues to support efforts for a comprehensive and inclusive settlement which ends the conflict in Darfur.</p>
	<p pid="a.775W.2/2">The UK also funds a number of programmes focusing on peacebuilding in Sudan. For example, our three year support to the Southern Sudan Peacebuilding Fund implemented by Pact Sudan, an international NGO, is helping over 100 local organisations of elders, youth, and women's groups in Southern Sudan to take early steps to prevent conflict, or intervene and mediate when conflicts erupt. Our &#163;5 million contribution to the multi-donor Darfur Community Peace and Stability Fund has helped reduce tension between pastoralists and farmers. In its next phase, the Darfur Community Peace and Stability Fund will support the building of 60 new water systems to provide fairer access to water which will reduce conflict between communities.</p>

	<p pid="a.777W.5/1">The total costs incurred by the Crown Prosecution Servicer (CPS) in respect of translation/interpretation in the extradition proceedings of Dr Ejup Ganic amounted to &#163;1,600.</p>
	<p pid="a.777W.5/2">The CPS assigned a Serbo-Croat-speaking member of staff to liaise with the Serbian authorities to minimise interpretation and translation costs. The Serbian authorities appointed an English speaker to liaise with the CPS and counsel. All documentation provided in support of the request was translated prior to submission into English by the Serbian authorities, although on one occasion a document was translated into English by a translator paid by the CPS so that it could be given urgent consideration by counsel in advance of the official translation being submitted. The CPS also paid the costs of an interpreter attending the extradition hearing for one of its witnesses.</p>

Since May 2010, the Government have published and responded to the Bloody Sunday and Billy Wright Inquiry reports, and made a full statement in response to the police ombudsman's report into the Claudy bombings.</p>

However, in November 2009 HMRC initiated a further review of its estate in Liverpool and is now considering a number of options arising from that review. Vacating the building at Queens Dock is the option that offers the greatest benefits to HMRC as well as substantial cost savings.</p>

HMRC will now consider how to gain best value from all of its buildings in Liverpool ensuring that the needs of taxpayers are at the forefront of its considerations. Where opportunities arise, HMRC will also work with other Government Departments to develop sharing of buildings. Like other Departments, HMRC is considering the impact of the comprehensive spending review and expects to be able to announce the final decision about Liverpool in spring 2011.</p>

This cooperation need not be restricted to neighbouring partnerships and will be particularly important where partnerships share a common interest. We will not be prescriptive how this cooperation is achieved; local enterprise partnerships are not Government bodies and are being developed from the bottom up.</p>

	<p pid="a.802W.2/1">The costs to Government of student loans are borne by the Department of Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS), rather than the Student Loans Company (SLC), and so the borrowing capacity of SLC is not significant.</p>
	<p pid="a.802W.2/2">Raising the cap on graduate contributions will increase the value of loans that Government makes to students and thereby increase Government's initial cash outlay. In the spending review period the full-time student tuition fee loan outlay is estimated to be &#163;3.5 billion in 2012-13, &#163;5 billion in 2013-14 and &#163;6 billion in 2014-15.</p>
	<p pid="a.802W.2/3">The cash outlay does not represent a cost to Government as it is provided to students in the form of loans which will be repaid, therefore the long term costs of student loans are shared between high-earning graduates who can afford to repay them and the Exchequer.</p>
	<p pid="a.802W.2/4">The effect of the proposed Higher Education reforms are included in an interim Impact Assessment, which has been published and is available on BIS's website:</p>

	<p pid="a.802W.5/2"><i> </i>Our proposals for a fairer and more progressive higher education funding system will mean that the most successful and popular institutions should be able to flourish in the new environment. Colleges of music and conservatoires offer courses which are very popular with students and so we expect them to be in a strong position to be able to attract the fee income to offset any reductions in grants from the Funding Council. Many of these institutions receive additional funding from the Funding Council to account for their small size or specialist nature, which are not recognised through the mainstream funding formula. While it is for the Funding Council to make decisions on grant allocations the Government will set out their priorities for continuing grant in the forthcoming grant letter to HEFCE and the higher education White Paper. It will be our priority that in putting the new funding system in place we do not weaken those institutions with a world class reputation for the arts and music.</p>

This is an improvement of 2.2 weeks on academic year 2009/10.

	<p pid="a.813W.3/1">This Government are satisfied that the current legislation achieves the right balance between the rights and obligations of landlords and tenants. The previous Administration had extensive plans for the further regulation of private sector landlords, including a proposal to introduce a national register for landlords. The Government have no plans to implement those proposals as imposing new regulatory requirements on private landlords would be likely to lead to a reduction in the numbers of properties to rent, which would not help tenants or landlords. Of course, local authorities already have access to a comprehensive package of powers to deal with houses in multiple occupation and tackle the minority of rogue landlords that provide a poor service to tenants.</p>
	<p pid="a.813W.3/2">The new Government have also made it easier for landlords letting larger properties by removing the blanket requirement introduced by the previous Administration for planning permission to change use from a family house to a small house in multiple occupation. Such changes of use can now take place freely without the need for planning applications unless there are local concerns about such development. In such cases, local planning authorities can use existing powers to remove this freedom of movement and require planning applications for such changes of use should they consider this appropriate for their areas.</p>
	<p pid="a.813W.3/3">The Government do, however, believe that more can be done to raise the energy efficiency of the existing stock and recently announced measures through the Green Deal which will help raise housing standards in this respect. Further information with regard to this announcement can be viewed on the Department for Climate Change website.</p>

Our proposals for neighbourhood planning will enable local communities to permit developments without the need for planning applications subject to a limited number of conditions and exceptions. These are set out respectively in Schedules 4B and 9 of the Localism Bill. The effect of these is that neighbourhood planning will not be able to permit certain developments, including wind farms with a generating capacity more than 50 megawatts, nationally significant highways within the meaning of the Planning Act 2008 and incinerators.</p>

	<p pid="a.818W.6/1">The Ministry of Defence (MOD) manages its surplus staff by using the redeployment pool (RDP). This service enables those who are or who will become surplus to be given priority consideration for vacancies. Staff in the RDP usually continue working in their last directorate or are redeployed to cover short-term tasks. On average, staff spend six months in the RDP before finding a post or leaving the Department. The RDP is also used by staff returning from overseas postings, including civilians supporting the armed forces in operational theatres. The MOD is currently subject to a freeze on external recruitment and the RDP helps us to fill vacancies from within existing staff resources.</p>

	<p pid="a.819W.2/1">The strategic defence and security review identified new non-front line savings of at least &#163;4.3 billion over the spending review period, to remedy the financial position inherited from the previous Government. The key areas are:</p>
	<p pid="a.819W.2/2" class="indent">reductions in the civilian work force and non-front line service personnel</p>
	<p pid="a.819W.2/3" class="indent">rationalisation of the Defence Estate including the sale of surplus land and buildings and associated running cost reductions and running cost savings across the estate of up to &#163;350 million per year including a revised approach to the way in which we manage and deliver infrastructure services across the estate</p>
	<p pid="a.819W.2/4" class="indent">sales of assets such as the Defence Support Group and the Marchwood Sea Mounting Centre and the Defence stake in the telecommunications spectrum should generate in excess of &#163;500 million over the spending review period</p>
	<p pid="a.819W.2/5" class="indent">efficiencies and improvements in military training including the increased use of simulators for air-crew and Army live firing</p>
	<p pid="a.819W.2/6" class="indent">saving significant amounts from contract re-negotiations with Defence industry</p>
	<p pid="a.819W.2/7" class="indent">cutting over &#163;300 million per year by 2014-15 of service and civilian personnel allowances</p>
	<p pid="a.819W.2/8" class="indent">reductions in our spend on commodities including substantial savings on food, energy and professional services</p>
	<p pid="a.819W.2/9" class="indent">reductions in spend on media and communications.</p>
	<p pid="a.819W.2/10">Overall, this represents a 25% reduction in non-frontline organisations such as headquarters, support roles, and organisations such as Defence Equipment and Support saving at least &#163;2 billion per year by 2014-15.</p>
	<p pid="a.819W.2/11">Final options and savings figures will depend on detailed implementation, which will generally be subject to full consultation with all relevant parties, including the trade unions and the devolved Administrations, as well as the results of mandatory assessments on the impact that the measures will have on sustainability, equality and diversity and health and safety. The Ministry of Defence is therefore not prepared to release more detailed information at this time.</p>

	<p pid="a.820W.2/1">The Ministry of Defence has one EU directive pending transposition into domestic legislation, namely the Defence and Security Directive (2009/81/EC) which sets out new procurement rules for contracting authorities/entities which purchase military equipment, sensitive equipment, and related goods, works or services. It also provides rules where contracting authorities/entities purchase works and services for specifically military purposes or works or services for security purposes which involve, require or contain classified information. The purpose of the rules is to meet the concerns of member states about the sensitive nature of procurements in the defence and security sectors. Currently, all public sector procurements (civil and defence), unless they are exempt, are governed by the rules set out in the Public Procurement Directive (2004/18/EC) or the Utilities Directive (2004/17/EC). The standard rules in the 2004 directives do not always permit the acquisition of military or security capability as effectively as they could, or deal explicitly with key requirements for acquisition such as security of information.</p>
	<p pid="a.820W.2/2">The directive was agreed by the British Government when it was adopted by the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union on <phrase class="date" code="2009-07-13">13 July 2009</phrase>.</p>

	<p pid="a.825W.3/1">Aviation security search measures apply equally to all (passengers, airport staff and aircrew including pilots) regardless of gender, race, age and occupation, with only a very limited number of exemptions, for example in respect of Heads of State. The more people we exempt from search, the greater the risk this creates.</p>
	<p pid="a.825W.3/2">We would be wary of creating a two tier screening system that may increase the likelihood of people becoming targets for coercion. Even professional pilots with the highest levels of integrity and honesty can find themselves the subject of coercion or blackmail from those who might seek to force them to carry prohibited items into a critical part of an airport.</p>

	<p pid="a.832W.0/1">The Highways Agency is considering the design of Active Traffic Management (ATM) in view of the experience gained from operating the pilot section on the M42. This includes what reduction can be made in the provision of gantries, signing, emergency refuge areas and signalling which will reduce costs but maintains the level of safety.</p>
	<p pid="a.832W.0/2">The M42 ATM pilot operation of a Managed Motorway has shown that opening the hard shoulder to peak time traffic, with speed limit controls in place, improves reliability and reduces the number of accidents. The Highways Agency has demonstrated that Managed Motorways can deliver a substantial proportion of the benefits of conventional road-widening solutions, while securing cost savings of 40%, and the agency is aiming to increase these savings still further by driving efficiencies in how it specifies and deliver projects, encouraging the introduction of standardised solutions.</p>
	<p pid="a.832W.0/3">The evidence base drawn together so far through the experience gained from operating the M42 pilot and sections on the Birmingham Box, has enabled more cost-effective designs to be introduced for future schemes. The agency has shown that it can operate hard shoulder running at 60 mph, and extend the distances between gantries and emergency refuge areas, without adversely affecting the operation of the road or the safety of the road user.</p>

	<p pid="a.835W.3/1" class="holdinganswer">holding answer <phrase class="date" code="2010-12-06">6 December 2010</phrase></p>
	<p pid="a.835W.3/2">The independent review on winter resilience led by David Quarmby CBE published its report in October 2010. The report made a number of recommendations both for the Government, local highway authorities and others.</p>
	<p pid="a.835W.3/3">One of the recommendations was for a benchmark of 12 days (48 runs) pre-season salt stockholding to be adopted for local highway authorities. It was recognised by the Review that some authorities would not be able to implement this recommendation in the short term, but in these cases they should carefully review their salt usage history and consider further action if necessary, such as increasing capacity or mutual aid arrangements with neighbouring authorities.</p>
	<p pid="a.835W.3/4">To bolster national resilience, for the first time the Highways Agency is putting in place a 250,000 tonne national strategic reserve of last resort, available to support local authority operators as necessary, along with a further 60,000 tonnes as its own reserve. So overall, we are better prepared than last year should the recent bad weather re-occur.</p>
	<p pid="a.835W.3/5">However, we are not complacent. The Department has arrangements in place for regular monitoring of salt stocks, so that we can identify risks early on and take any further action, including initiating Salt Cell should the need arise.</p>
	<p pid="a.835W.3/6">Given that much of the country has been hit unusually early this winter by severe weather, the Secretary of State has asked David Quarmby to take the opportunity to conduct an urgent audit of highway authorities' and transport operators' recent performance in England, their progress in implementing his recommendations and any further steps that need to be taken.</p>

A copy of the consultation document, &quot;Disability Living Allowance reform&quot; (Cm 7984), has been placed in the Library.</p>

One of the key features of universal credit is that it will be paid in and out of work and that the hours rules will disappear to smooth the transition into work and ensure work pays.

	<p pid="a.848W.2/20">The table presents data on employment and support allowance claims up to the end of August 2009 where the person claiming has completed assessment, been found Fit for Work, subsequently appeal the Department's decision and had the appeal heard by the Tribunals Service by the end of July 2010. July 2010 is the latest data we have from the Tribunals Service.</p>
	<p pid="a.848W.2/21">Due to the time it takes for appeals to be submitted and heard by the Tribunals Service, it is likely that there are more appeals that have not yet been heard, particularly for the most recent cohorts of ESA claims. The percentage of people found Fit for Work who appeal (column 6) therefore appears to decrease as the date of claim becomes more recent, but this may not in fact reflect a decline in appeals against a Fit for Work decision as a number of appeals may have been submitted but not yet heard. These figures should therefore be treated as emerging findings and not as final at this stage.</p>

	<p pid="a.849W.5/1">Revised life expectancy projections mean that by 2026 men aged 66 are expected to live an extra 1.5 years and women an extra 1.6 years, on average, than the 2004 projections used to set the current state pension age increases. No responsible Government can ignore these increases in life expectancy and the pressure they place on the state pension system. Our new timetable will reduce pressures on public finances by around &#163;30 billion between 2016-17 and 2025-26.</p>
	<p pid="a.849W.5/2">The effect on the level of income is complex and will vary significantly between individuals. We estimate that those people affected by the changes to state pension age will lose state pensions of, on average, <i> (a)</i> men approximately &#163;7,600 and <i> (b)</i> women nearly &#163;7,250 (in 2010-11 prices).</p>
	<p pid="a.849W.5/3">About 40% of those affected are expected to remain in employment when they reach age 65; earning and saving longer for retirement.</p>
	<p pid="a.849W.5/4">However the Government will support those who will not be able to continue working by providing working age benefits.</p>

Data on the actual size of property occupied by social sector tenants is not yet collected as part of DWP administration and the data collected for private sector tenants is not of sufficient quality to undertake detailed analysis of the accommodation they occupy. This is because this information is not required for the housing benefit calculation. Existing survey data does not permit large enough sample sizes for detailed analysis.</p>
