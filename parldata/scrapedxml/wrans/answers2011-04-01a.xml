	<p pid="a.513W.9/1">Under the terms of their contract with the national health service, general practitioners (GPs) are required to provide certain, prescribed, medical certificates free of charge-such as those to prove incapacity to work. Outside of these arrangements, GPs also provide a variety of other services which successive governments have regarded as private matters between the patient and the doctor providing the service. The doctor is free to make a charge for these non-NHS services if he or she wishes.</p>
	<p pid="a.513W.9/2">The fees for the provision of services by GPs outside those contracted for under GP contractual arrangements are not set by the Department nor are they a matter for Government. As independent contractors, this is something for the individual practice to determine. The Professional Fees Committee of the British Medical Association (BMA) suggests fees for such services to help doctors set their own professional fees. However, these fees are guidelines only, not recommendations, and a doctor is not obliged to charge the rates suggested. Where doctors intend to charge for services to patients, the BMA advises them to forewarn patients, at the earliest opportunity, of the likely level of fees.</p>

In 2010 the national average stipend for incumbents and incumbent status parochial clergy was &#163;22,570. The projected figure for 2011 is &#163;23,050 (based on responses from 36 dioceses).</p>

	<p pid="a.519W.5/2"><i> (a)</i> The June 2010 Budget announced the requirement for lone parents to prepare for and seek work as a condition of receiving benefits would be extended from those with a youngest child aged seven or over, to those with a youngest child aged five or over. We estimated in the recent impact assessment, &quot;Conditionality Measures in the 2011 Welfare Reform Bill&quot; that the change will help 20,000 to 25,000 extra lone parents into work in steady state-with around an extra 10,000 lone parents in work after the first full year; around an extra 20,000 after the second year; and up to 25,000 in steady state.</p>
	<p pid="a.519W.5/3"><i> (b)</i> There are a number of flexibilities for lone parents regarding job search requirements that can reflect different personal circumstances affecting availability for work. For example, lone parents may limit the hours they are available for work to a minimum of 16 hours a week subject to their childcare arrangements. They may also restrict their availability for work to their children's normal school hours if any of their children are aged 12 or under.</p>
	<p pid="a.519W.5/4">We expect that lone parents will base their working pattern around their personal circumstances and child care arrangements. For this impact assessment, we assumed that the majority of lone parents entering work as a result of the policy change will enter work at part-time around an average of 18 hours a week; with less than a third of lone parents entering work at full-time around an average of 38 hours a week. This assumption was made based on evidence from the Household Annual Population Survey.</p>
	<p pid="a.519W.5/5">Universal credit from 2013-14 will carry forward the same conditionality arrangements for lone parents. The above does not take account of behavioural effects arising from other aspects of universal credit, for example from the operation of the disregard and taper.</p>

	<p pid="a.523W.2/1">The International Atomic Energy Agency integrated regulatory review service-IRRS-recently noted that the UK has a mature and transparent regulatory system, an advanced review process, and highly trained, expert and experienced nuclear inspectors. Nevertheless, we take the recent unprecedented events in Japan extremely seriously, and the Secretary of State has asked the chief nuclear inspector, Dr Mike Weightman, to provide a report to the Government on the implications and the lessons to be learned for the UK nuclear industry.</p>
	<p pid="a.523W.2/2">The coalition Government's plans clearly envisage an important role for nuclear and unless Dr Weightman's report gives us any particular reason to reassess that, I see no reason why that should not remain our view. We aim to bring the first new nuclear on stream for 2018. When people visit the departmental website, they can access a pathways model called &quot;My2050&quot;, which allows them to see the effort that would have to be made if we did not have nuclear. We would have to make enormously greater efforts on both renewables and carbon capture and storage. That is physically possible, but the costs would be very substantial.</p>

	<p pid="a.524W.5/1">At the time of the spending review in 2010 we said that the first review of the feed-in tariffs (FITs) scheme would take place as planned in 2012, taking effect in April 2013, unless higher than expected deployment triggered an early review. Since then feedback from industry has indicated that solar PV system costs are now 30% lower than assumed in the original modelling undertaken before the start of the scheme and that there would be higher than expected deployment of larger scale solar PV. This has resulted in the risk that the FITs budget would be exceeded and triggers an early review.</p>
	<p pid="a.524W.5/2">The decision to begin a comprehensive review early allows us to deal with issues such as the fast falling cost of solar PV; enabling us to safeguard FITs funding for small scale installations for domestic customers, schools, community groups and small businesses.</p>

	<p pid="a.529W.9/3">-explained the bidding process that will be put in place to identify a second wave of enterprise zones.</p>
	<p pid="a.529W.9/4">Local enterprise partnerships interested in bidding for an enterprise zone are being asked to submit short expressions of interest during April. Once those expressions of interest have been received, the Government will write to all interested local enterprise partnerships with the criteria against which detailed bids will be assessed. Final bids will be expected by the end of June. Those local authorities and businesses not currently covered by a local enterprise partnership will be able to bid to host an enterprise zone if their proposals to form a local enterprise partnership are approved before the deadline for bids. The prospectus already provides partnerships with an indication of the sorts of issues that they will want to consider in compiling a bid.</p>

Section 9 of this Act states that unless consent has been obtained, data collected under the Act that may identify an individual unit may only be made available to Government Departments in possession of a 'direction from the Minister'. The legislation states that the data may be released to the Government Department for the performance of any of its functions. Under this Act, those Government Departments without a 'ministerial direction' are not allowed access.</p>
	<p pid="a.535W.10/8" class="indent">The Statistics and Registration Service Act, 2007, allows for increased sharing of data between ONS and other Government Departments, subject to agreement by Parliament on a case by case basis. The Act ensures that ONS can still use the existing gateways for access to ASHE microdata. It also promotes further statistical research by the addition of an additional gateway - Approved Researcher.</p>
	<p pid="a.535W.10/9" class="indent">The Approved Researcher is the only gateway available for those without a ministerial direction to access ASHE microdata. Approved Researcher status is for named individuals only and applies to a specific project. It does not open a gateway to all data for any purpose. Currently Approved Researchers can only gain access to ASHE data at ONS sites. This is likely to be extended in the near future so that Approved Researchers can access ASHE from a Secure Data Centre, at university buildings via secure computer terminals.</p>
	<p pid="a.535W.10/10" class="indent">The production of a redacted version of the data would render them unsuitable for the purposes stated. Given the nature of the information provided under trust to ONS, it would be necessary to use a coarse recoding methodology to prevent the identification, or self-identification, of an individual from a public use data set. The methodology employed in the area cost adjustment calculations requires detailed individual record information that would be lost as a consequence of the recoding required to prevent disclosure.</p>
	<p pid="a.535W.10/11" class="indent">Answer to question two</p>
	<p pid="a.535W.10/12" class="indent">The Statistics and Registration Service Act requires that the criteria for becoming an Approved Researcher are published. The criteria and assessment procedure can be found on the 'Access to Data' pages of the Office for National Statistics website:</p>
	<p pid="a.535W.10/13" class="indent"><a href="http://www.ons.gov.uk/about/who-we-are/our-services/unpublished-data/access-to-ons-data-service/index.html">www.ons.gov.uk/about/who-we-are/our-services/unpublished-data/access-to-ons-data-service/index.html</a></p>
	<p pid="a.535W.10/14" class="indent">Only the information in the application is used for the decision to make an applicant an Approved Researcher, although for less experienced applicants a reference may be sought from their PhD supervisor. Any individual can become an Approved Researcher provided they meet both the criteria for personal competence to use confidential data securely, and the criteria for statistical research purposes.</p>
	<p pid="a.535W.10/15" class="indent">In the last 24 months 32 statistical researchers have met the criteria and have been made Approved Researchers for access to the confidential Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings dataset. The researchers are working on 19 statistical research inquiries. All of these statistical researchers have used the ASHE dataset within a statistical research laboratory facility on an ONS site. No statistical researcher that has submitted an application has been rejected.</p>

Those obligations include requirements covering a number of areas such as curriculum and assessment, admissions and exclusions. The Secretary of State is responsible for ensuring that the terms of an academy's funding agreement are met. That includes considering complaints from parents about matters covered within the funding agreement to decide whether there has been a breach of the funding agreement by the academy. At the moment, the YPLA considers those complaints on behalf of the Secretary of State. When the YPLA is abolished, the responsibility for handling complaints will return to the Department for Education, either within the relevant policy directorate or a future executive agency.</p>

	<p pid="a.542W.2/1">On academy funding in 2011/12, the Department consulted interested parties via the Academy Funding Sub-Group of the School Funding Implementation Group. The aim of the review was to consider the methodology for the future funding of academies for academic year 2011/12 and to identify any issues that needed to be considered for the academic year 2012/13 and beyond. The consultation was intended to inform Ministers and was reflected in the School Funding Settlement announced in December 2010.</p>
	<p pid="a.542W.2/2">The group considered whether funding for children with special educational needs (SEN) should still be part of the local authority central spend equivalent grant. Furthermore, the Government have listened to the concerns expressed by groups which support children with SEN. Therefore we will not be recovering funding for SEN support services in relation to academies from local authorities in the 2011-12 financial year. We wrote to local authorities on <phrase class="date" code="2011-02-09">9 February 2011</phrase> to confirm that they do not need to reduce funding for these services as a result of schools converting to academy status. Funding for the individually assigned resources specified in a child's statement will continue to be paid directly from local authorities to academies.</p>

	<p pid="a.544W.0/3">We have made clear that priority for education expenditure would be on front line services in schools; funding for EBPs does not come within that category. In future, it will be for schools to decide whether or not to buy in services from education business partnership organisations (EBPOs) locally. EBPOs will need to ensure they are offering a high quality service if schools are going to be persuaded to buy their services, and having the Award for Education Business Excellence will signify that.</p>

	<p pid="a.544W.9/2">All schools should teach pupils about the effects of drugs (including alcohol, tobacco, volatile substances and medicines) through the non-statutory framework for Personal, Social, Health and Economic education (PSHE) and as part of the statutory National Curriculum for Science. The Department's guidance, 'Drugs: Guidance for Schools (DfES 2004)', makes clear that drug education should start in primary schools and outlines the issues that should be covered in all key stages, having regard to the age and maturity of the pupils concerned. As part of their drug education, pupils should learn how to make informed choices about their health, how to resist pressure to do wrong and to take more responsibility for their actions. The guidance is available at:</p>

For this reason, we do not promote, endorse or supply any educational materials to be used. We believe it is important that schools have the flexibility to use their professional judgment in such matters so that they can take account of the views of parents and the needs of pupils, as well as of the ethos of the school.</p>

	<p pid="a.545W.5/1">Professor Wolf concluded in her recent report on the &quot;Review of Vocational Education&quot; that providing 16 to 18-year-olds with work opportunities was a priority, and she questioned the value of much of the work experience that young people at Key Stage 4 undertake. We therefore have no plans to increase the number of students at Key Stage 4 in secondary schools participating in high quality work experience. This is consistent with our Schools White Paper, &quot;The Importance of Teaching&quot;, where we set out our aim to trust frontline professionals in schools, rather than constrain them by central plans. Secondary schools are best placed to work with local employers to determine how to provide high quality work experience for their Key Stage 4 pupils.</p>

	<p pid="a.546W.2/3">Our priority has been to protect the core education programmes offered by schools and colleges that equip young people with the knowledge and skills they need to progress and succeed. We have also increased the funding available to target disadvantage by more than one third (in 2011/12 the total funding will be &#163;770 million) to help support those students who face the greatest barriers to participation in 16-19 education. We also recognise tutorial provision for all is important and that is why we have protected that within the entitlement reduction so that all full time students can have access to a tutorial programme.</p>
	<p pid="a.546W.2/4">In light of these priorities and the state of the public finances inherited from the previous Government, the entitlement was reduced because the evidence to support the claim that the enrichment activity within the entitlement provided value for money was weak.</p>
	<p pid="a.546W.2/5">That is not to say that the Government regard the other activities that might be funded from the public purse as additional enrichment activities as unimportant. However, at a time when we are experiencing a welcome increase in participation, alongside a need to respond to extremely difficult economic circumstances, providing an entitlement to those activities to all full-time students cannot be a priority.</p>

	<p pid="a.548W.3/2">The Minister of State for Security and Counter-terrorism (Baroness Neville-Jones) discussed the operation of the European Arrest Warrant with the Polish Justice Minister, Mr Krzysztof Kwiatkowski, on <phrase class="date" code="2011-03-10">10 March 2011</phrase>. The Minister underlined the UK's view that proportionality should be carefully considered by requesting member states before they issue a European Arrest Warrant. The issue of proportionality and the European arrest warrant has also been discussed by officials during bi-lateral discussions in October 2008 and September 2010. Further official-led discussions are envisaged for later in 2011.</p>

	<p pid="a.548W.6/2">The UK's connection date to the Schengen Information System II (SIS II) has been revised following the announcement last June of the Commission's revised operational timetable, giving a new entry into operation date for the central EU system of early 2013. The UK's SIS II Programme has also been the subject of a major project review conducted by HM Treasury and the Office for Government Commerce. This assessed that the programme is in a good position to deliver its objectives but in the light of the announcement of the delay to the central system, it recommended that the UK's connection date be moved back until 2015. In reality a UK go live date of 2015 means that we will need to connect for testing purposes in 2014, shortly after the central system is due to be ready and the member states migrating from SIS I have bedded down their new systems Further assessments of the number of European Arrest Warrants on the SIS II system and their likely impact on the United Kingdom will be made nearer the UK go live date.</p>

	<p pid="a.560W.9/2">The Serious Organised Crime Agency (SOCA) and the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service for Scotland are the designated UK authorities responsible for processing European arrest warrants (EAWs).</p>
	<p pid="a.560W.9/3">It is not possible to provide the figures for the number of EAWs issued to the UK broken down by offence type prior to April 2009. This would require a manual examination of all case files. A new recording system was introduced in April 2009 and the figures for EAWs issued to the UK broken down by offence type are available for the 2009-10 financial year. This is set out in the following table.</p>
	<p pid="a.560W.9/4">It is not possible to provide the figures for the number of EAWs issued to the UK in respect of serious organised crime specifically as this is not one of the recording categories used. To provide this figure a manual review of all files would have to be undertaken.</p>
	<p pid="a.560W.9/5">It is worth noting that the majority of European arrest warrants ('EAWs') issued by EU member states are circulated to other EU member states on the Schengen Information System ('SIS'). As the UK is not party to the SIS, we rely on the bi-lateral transmission of the EAWs. A significant proportion of the EAWs circulated will therefore prove to have no connection to the UK although they are registered as having been &quot;received&quot; by SOCA. This includes, for example, the 40 EAWs issued in April 2009 for alleged war crimes. We understand that those sought have no connection to the UK.</p>
