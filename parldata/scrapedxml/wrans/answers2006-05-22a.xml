	<p pid="a.1257W.6/2">For example: the report highlighted how UN agencies handled co-ordination in each sector.

	<p pid="a.1258W.6/1">The increasing violence and communal tension is a major barrier to recovery in the north and east. In the southern districts, not contested by the LTTE and not directly affected by the fighting, recovery is proceeding swiftly, and is expected to be completed by the end of 2007.</p>
	<p pid="a.1258W.6/2">The increase in direct fighting between the Sri Lankan military, the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) and militia's associated with each side has been accompanied by an increase in communal tension. Development agencies and non governmental organisations have evacuated staff for their security and protection and recovery programmes have been suspended. In addition, regular economic activities and recovery work undertaken in communities without external assistance has also been affected by military activity. Able bodied men are being mobilised for LTTE service, and people are being displaced by fighting, or the fear of fighting.</p>
	<p pid="a.1258W.6/3">The situation continues to deteriorate, as evidenced by the recent suicide bombing in Colombo and the subsequent air strikes and naval shelling in the east. Without a considerable improvement in the security situation it is unlikely that much recovery can be undertaken. The international community, including the United Kingdom, are working hard to encourage the Government and the (LTTE) to curtail violence and to return to the negotiating table. Once the security environment improves we will renew efforts to help ensure delivery of development assistance to communities.</p>

	<p pid="a.1259W.2/1">The UK Government's approach to promoting reproductive health is set out in the DFID position paper, &quot;Sexual and Reproductive Health and Rights&quot;. Our approach to achieving the fifth Millennium Development Goal of improving maternal health is outlined in the DFID strategy paper, &quot;Reducing Maternal Deaths: Evidence and Action&quot;. Both were published in 2004 after extensive consultation with a broad range of stakeholders, including the research community, NGOs, parliamentarians and civil society groups. A web-based consultation was also held as part of this process.</p>
	<p pid="a.1259W.2/2">Our understanding of the so-called &quot;Mexico City Policy&quot; is that it requires non-US NGOs to agree that they will not perform or actively promote abortion as a method of family planning in order to receive US funding. This means, for example, that non-US NGOs who accept US funding are not allowed to use their own funds to provide information or counselling for abortion care, or to promote awareness of the benefits of legal reform. As the International Planned Parenthood Federation (IPPF) &quot;Death and Denial: Unsafe Abortion and Poverty&quot; report makes clear, the policy forces NGOs to choose between carrying on work to protect the health and rights of women or lose funds. No reproductive or maternal health NGOs affected by the policy work to &quot;promote abortion as a method of family planning&quot;, and indeed this would be contrary to the global consensus reached at the International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD). What they try to do is to provide a comprehensive range of information and services that can help save women's lives, and reduce the need for abortion. The US policy means that the work of such organisations is compromised, and that is why my Department is opposed to it.</p>

	<p pid="a.1259W.5/1">The Government of Iraq, supported by the UK and other donors, has made significant progress with reconstruction since 2003. But there is still a long way to go. Once a relatively wealthy country with high levels of education and health care, by 2003 Iraq had suffered more than 20 years of conflict, mismanagement and chronic under-investment from a brutal regime. Continued violence, especially sabotage directed at key infrastructure, and low (but growing) levels of management capacity in Iraq's national and local government have slowed progress. The UK and international community are committed to helping the new Iraqi Government tackle these challenges.</p>
	<p pid="a.1259W.5/2">One challenge is the lack of data, especially at the regional and provincial level. The following information therefore covers the progress that has been made across Iraq, including regional detail only where this is available.</p>
	<p pid="a.1259W.5/3">Electricity generation is more equitably distributed across Iraq than before 2003. Nearly 5,000 megawatts (MW) have been added to the national grid since 2003, but Iraq's average electricity generation has not improved over that period. This is because at the same time as capacity is being added through reconstruction projects, breakdowns of the pre-existing dilapidated systems, shortages of fuel supplies and sabotage are reducing capacity. So Iraqis are not getting the full benefit of those extra megawatts. Demand for electricity also continues to rise dramatically, as the economy grows and more people own and use electrical goods such as fridges and air-conditioning units. The new Iraqi Government will be starting work on a long-term power sector strategy, with DFID's support.</p>
	<p pid="a.1259W.5/4">In the south, average electricity generation levels have increased from approximately 750 MW in January 2004 to over 1,000 MW in December 2005. The south now receives its fair share of national power&mdash;whereas under Saddam's regime, power was often diverted from the south to Baghdad.</p>
	<p pid="a.1259W.5/5">To improve power supply in the south, DFID has:</p>
	<p pid="a.1259W.5/6" class="indent">Repaired transmission lines from Hartha power station to Basra city&mdash;securing electricity supplies for 1.5 million residents;</p>
	<p pid="a.1259W.5/7" class="indent">Improved power distribution to 13 areas of Basra.</p>
	<p pid="a.1259W.5/8">By the end of 2006, we will have:</p>
	<p pid="a.1259W.5/9" class="indent">Established point power generators to provide 15 MW of back-up supplies in Dhi Qar and Maysan;</p>
	<p pid="a.1259W.5/10" class="indent">Added or secured a further 190 MW of electricity in the south, through our &pound;40 million Iraq Infrastructure and Services Programme.</p>
	<p pid="a.1259W.5/11">Water supplies have improved across the south since the end of the conflict, and sewage systems and water treatment plants are now operating again. Before the conflict, no major sewage systems were operating. Immediate post-conflict work improved efficiency of water treatment plants and pumping stations. DFID has:</p>
	<p pid="a.1259W.5/12" class="indent">provided technical advice for a major sewage installation in Al Amarah, providing up to half the city's population with access to a piped system and replacing open sewage channels;</p>
	<p pid="a.1259W.5/13" class="indent">improved the water supply to 60,000 people in Al Amtahiyah;</p>
	<p pid="a.1259W.5/14" class="indent">started construction of reservoirs and water towers to benefit a further 200,000 people;</p>
	<p pid="a.1259W.5/15" class="indent">constructed a water training centre which will train water engineers from Maysan, Muthanna, Basra and Dhi Qar provinces.</p>
	<p pid="a.1259W.5/16">Health services are gradually being restored throughout Iraq. Hundreds of health care facilities have been rehabilitated and 240 hospitals and 1,200 primary health centres are now functioning. Through extensive disease control programmes, there has been a decline in the prevalence of leishmaniasis, malaria, measles, mumps, and polio. Japan and the US have rehabilitated a number of health care facilities in the south, as well as supplying essential equipment, ambulances and drugs. The US is constructing a new paediatric hospital in Basra, which will offer improved treatment to children with acute conditions across the south.</p>
	<p pid="a.1259W.5/17">5,168 schools have been rehabilitated throughout Iraq, with a further 450 in progress. By the end of 2006, more than 133,000 primary school teachers and 47,500 secondary school teachers and administrators will have received training and technical support. In southern Iraq, the UN has rehabilitated schools and supplied textbooks, and is also rehabilitating vocational training institutes. Japan has provided textbooks to all primary schools in Muthanna. There are 465 schools operating in Maysan, and 348 in Muthanna.</p>

	<p pid="a.1262W.0/1">DFID is the only major bilateral donor to already have a specific strategy focusing on maternal health: &quot;Reducing maternal deaths: evidence and action&quot;, which was launched in 2004. We have disseminated this comprehensive maternal health strategy throughout the international system, with other donors, the UN, and most importantly, with the developing partners we support.</p>
	<p pid="a.1262W.0/2">The strategy provides the basis for DFID support to improve maternal health at country level, which we do through a combination of programmes to strengthen health services and improve overall reproductive and child health, along with specific maternal health programmes and HIV interventions. Long-term support for maternal health in Nepal, for example, is demonstrating significant increases in women's access to emergency obstetric care in remote areas and in a fragile state. This work highlights the importance of support for community level action to overcome cultural and socio-economic barriers to accessing care, as well as the importance of addressing infrastructure (roads, bridges) and communications issues to ensure an effective referral system. In Malawi, DFID is supporting an Emergency Human Resource Programme to address the acute shortages of health workers, an issue which has been compounded by the AIDS epidemic. Overall investments for maternal health (including reproductive health services) have increased by over 40 per cent. over the past three years, to &pound;242.9 million in 2004-05.</p>
	<p pid="a.1262W.0/3">The maternal health strategy also provides the platform for DFID's regular policy discussions with other donors, such as the EU, G8 and the UN, on the actions needed to improve maternal health in developing countries and the importance of doing more on maternal health. We are seeking to highlight the importance of maternal health within the current G8 process, although the prime health theme at present is infectious disease. We are also working to ensure that the new Partnership for Maternal, Neonatal and Child Health can play a useful role in advocating for more action on maternal health, and to improve the way UN agencies work together on this issue.</p>
	<p pid="a.1262W.0/4">Importantly, good advocacy is based upon good data. Getting reliable information on maternal deaths is difficult in most developing countries where maternal deaths are not recorded and where more than half of all births take place at home, without a skilled attendant but either with relatives or alone. This is why DFID, along with the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and the Gates Foundation, supports IMMPACT, the only global research initiative which is successfully identifying effective ways in which maternal deaths can be measured and the statistics used for high level advocacy. DFID further supports a recent global partnership, Health Metrics Network, which aims to provide country level support to governments to get better data.</p>

	<p pid="a.1263W.0/3">Indigenous peoples (holders of traditional knowledge) play an important role in the World Intellectual Property Organisation Inter-Governmental Committee on Traditional Knowledge, Folklore and Genetic Resources (IGC) where these matters are discussed. A voluntary fund has recently been set up to help ensure their participation and attendance to this committee. The IGC has done important work on traditional knowledge databases and also on amending the international classification system for patents to include traditional knowledge and hence make it easier for holders of traditional knowledge to access patent applications based on traditional knowledge.</p>
	<p pid="a.1263W.0/4">The assessment of intellectual property applications is done by patent examiners and trademark examiners in the relevant country or jurisdiction. In the UK anyone can file observations on patentability with regard to patent applications, including the holders of traditional knowledge. This will then be taken into account when the patent is examined. In a similar manner, anyone can make observations about the registrability of a trademark. Further, trademarks applications can be opposed or subsequently invalidated if the mark designates a characteristic of those goods or services, or is otherwise non-distinctive. Similar arrangements are in place in most countries and jurisdictions.</p>

	<p pid="a.1263W.3/1">The Government supports the principle of developing countries' demands to disclose country of origin or source of genetic material within patent applications. This could assist these countries to keep track of patent applications linked to the use of their resources and check whether appropriate benefit sharing agreements are in place. The Government therefore supported the EU proposal submitted to the World Intellectual Property Organisation (WIPO) Intergovernmental Committee (IGC) in December 2004 which suggests that disclosure of country of origin or source in patent applications could be introduced on a global basis in national, regional and international patent applicants. We judged that this proposal strikes a good balance between achieving the objective of supporting developing countries' request to include disclosure of origin provisions into international patent law whilst ensuring that patents are not undermined and patent applicants are not overly burdened.</p>
	<p pid="a.1263W.3/2">We must however, ensure that the system is workable in practice and achieves the desired outcome (i.e. benefits are generated and shared appropriately). Therefore, we have so far focused our efforts on discussions in the WIPO IGC, where the technical expertise resides.</p>

	<p pid="a.1265W.5/1">DFID provides Trade Related Capacity Building (TRCB) support to sub-Saharan African countries through its bilateral programmes and multilateral institutions. It does not have a stand alone TRCB Fund to which sub-Saharan African countries can bid. Therefore, we are unable to provide information on bids and their success.</p>
	<p pid="a.1265W.5/2">Our support for Trade Related Capacity Building for sub-Saharan African countries is allocated according to their TRCB needs as identified in their Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers or national development plans and in fulfilment of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) criteria for TRCB.</p>
	<p pid="a.1265W.5/3">For the period 1997-2005, DFID's financial records show that countries in sub-Saharan Africa received &pound;16.2 million in support for trade and investment activities, through bilateral programmes and DFID supported multilateral institutions. Trade and investment activities are one aspect only of DFID's complete TRCB programme which includes private sector development, agricultural development, compliance with standards etc. Therefore, DFID's overall support to TRCB in sub-Saharan Africa is larger than the figure given. The difficulty in isolating the TRCB elements within large economic growth or regional programmes prevents us from providing further financial details on TRCB expenditure. Annex A provides details per sub-Saharan African country of the DFID trade and investment expenditure for the period 1997-2005.</p>
	<p pid="a.1265W.5/4">In terms of specific TRCB programmes in sub-Saharan Africa, DFID currently runs an &pound;11 million Regional Trade Facilitation Programme. The programme supports two regional economic communities, the Southern African Development Community and Common Market of Eastern and Southern Africa, and their members in negotiations with the WTO and European Commission and implementing regional integration.</p>

We are financing the Government's public service reform programme which is improving the Government effectiveness, and the public financial management and accountability programme which is strengthening public financial management systems in both central and local government.

	<p pid="a.1266W.5/1">In December 2004, my right hon. Friend, the Secretary of State for International Development, proposed a package of six key reforms to improve the effectiveness of emergency response, with a particular focus on the UN as the global lead. The six reforms are:</p>
	<p pid="a.1266W.5/2" class="indent">Establishment of a new global humanitarian fund;</p>
	<p pid="a.1266W.5/3" class="indent">Strengthen the UN Humanitarian Coordinator system;</p>
	<p pid="a.1266W.5/4" class="indent">Common donor funding for the Humanitarian Coordinator to deploy on the most urgent unmet needs;</p>
	<p pid="a.1266W.5/5" class="indent">Development of global benchmarks to measure humanitarian response performance;</p>
	<p pid="a.1266W.5/6" class="indent">Increased donor focus on &quot;forgotten&quot;, or under-funded, emergencies;</p>
	<p pid="a.1266W.5/7" class="indent">Increased donor funding for Disaster Risk Reduction, and the UN International Strategy for Disaster Reduction.</p>
	<p pid="a.1266W.5/8">The United Nations is taking forward these reforms with the support and participation of the wider donor community, including DFID, NGOs and the Red Cross movement. In December 2005, a new UN Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) was approved by the UN General Assembly. It was launched on <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-09">9 March 2006</phrase> with $254 million from 38 donors, including $70 million from DFID. Under the direction of the UN's Emergency Relief Coordinator, the CERF is now enabling UN humanitarian agencies to respond rapidly to sudden disasters, such as earthquakes; time-critical responses in slow-onset disasters, such as drought; and essential life-saving actions in ongoing but under-funded crises such as in the Democratic Republic of Congo and Chad.</p>
	<p pid="a.1266W.5/9">A number of proposals for strengthening the UN Humanitarian Co-ordinator system are being taken forward, including developing a pool of suitable candidates and associated training. Currently there are 21 trained humanitarian co-ordinators, including some from NGO or Red Cross backgrounds. Alongside this, DFID is leading seven other donors in piloting pooled country level funding, to be used as directed by the resident humanitarian co-ordinator, in Sudan and the Democratic Republic of Congo during 2006. DFID is also providing support to the World Health Organisation (WHO) and the UN Children's Fund (UNICEF) in developing performance benchmarks for mortality, nutrition, and health. DFID has supported progress over the last 12 months in reforming the UN International Strategy for Disaster Reduction and in March this year we launched our new Disaster Risk Reduction Strategy.</p>
	<p pid="a.1266W.5/10">In September 2005, the UN Inter-Agency Standing Committee, which deals with humanitarian issues, established a new 'cluster' system to deliver more accountable and predictable humanitarian responses. Named agencies have responsibility for coordinating responses in key sectors such as water and sanitation (UNICEF), protection (the United Nations High Commissioner fro Refugees (UNHCR), Logistics (the World Food Programme (WFP), and Health (the WHO), and developing networks or clusters of other agencies and NGOs to work together to improve capacity, performance, and effectiveness. DFID is currently considering, along with other donors, how best to support this initiative.</p>
	<p pid="a.1266W.5/11">In January 2006, my right hon. Friend, the Secretary of State for International Development, called for further reform of the international humanitarian system by improving the quality and focus of UN Flash Appeals. This involves developing agreements for the use of military assets; and for better accountability in humanitarian funding, performance, and outcomes for beneficiary communities. We are working along with other donors, the UN, and other humanitarian organisations to develop these initiatives.</p>

	<p pid="a.1268W.5/1">In 2005, DFID committed over &pound;1.2 million of humanitarian assistance to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK). &pound;1 million was channelled through UNICEF for water, sanitation and health care, and a further &pound;200,000 through the International Federation of the Red Cross for disaster risk deduction.</p>
	<p pid="a.1268W.5/2">In late 2005, the DPRK said that it would no longer accept international humanitarian assistance. Furthermore, it has increased the already significant restrictions it places on the humanitarian community, with the consequence that DFID can no longer feel confident that programmes of assistance are appropriate and are reaching those who most need it most. All World Food Programme (WFP) operations are funded solely from voluntary contributions and the UK is not contributing to the one in the DPRK.</p>
	<p pid="a.1268W.5/3">The UK has no plans to conduct a survey of malnutrition in the DPRK. Obtaining nutritional information is hampered by the constraints placed on the operations of international humanitarian agencies. The last international survey was carried out in 2004.</p>

	<p pid="a.1269W.0/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-16">16 March 2006</phrase> there were wide-spread changes to the civil aeronautical route structure over the West of England and Wales.</p>
	<p pid="a.1269W.0/2">Prior to <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-16">16 March 2006</phrase> the air route in the vicinity of West Somerset and Sedgmoor was Airway N864 with an axis 190&deg;/010&deg;, a lateral extent of 10 nautical miles and with the centreline approximately over Blue Anchor Bay. The vertical limits of the route extend from FL55 (5,500 feet above mean sea level) to the north of the coastline and FL65 (6,500 feet amsl) over land to an upper limit of FL245 (24,500 feet amsl). The volume of airspace within the airway is defined as controlled airspace. Above FL245 is the Upper Airspace Control Area, which covers the whole of the United Kingdom. Within the Upper Airspace Control Area above West Somerset and Sedgmoor existed the routes UN864, UN862, UM140, UM17 and UW501.</p>
	<p pid="a.1269W.0/3">The changes on <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-16">16 March</phrase> did not affect N864, UN864, UM140, UM17 and UW501. However, a new route called N90 was introduced to the east of N864 for use between Friday evenings and Monday mornings. The lateral extent of the new controlled airspace is 12 nautical miles from the eastern boundary of N864 and with a lower limit of FL105 (10,500 feet amsl). In the Upper Control Area UN90 was introduced above N90 and UN862 was moved two nautical miles to the east to be above N862. A new Upper Air Route called UN22 was introduced parallel to and 12 nautical miles west of UN864.</p>
	<p pid="a.1269W.0/4">Additionally, there are proposed changes to controlled airspace associated with Bristol and Cardiff airports, which are intended to introduce new controlled airspace over part of West Somerset and Sedgmoor. It should be noted that aircraft operations associated with these airports occur today and the proposed new controlled airspace is designed to provide additional protection to these flights. The proposals have been the subject of public consultation, which included Members of Parliament, local authorities, AONB representatives and other interested parties within the areas affected. These changes are currently subject to regulatory consideration by the CAA.</p>

	<p pid="a.1275W.0/2">However, in the absence of a regulatory regime, DSA developed an agreed set of minimum core competencies for drivers of emergency vehicles. These were published in 2001 as the &quot;Blue Light Users Working Party Expectations Document&quot;. DSA had worked together with the ambulance and fire services, police and the Ministry of Defence to develop this document. It was agreed that each service should tailor any training based on these competencies to the needs of their own drivers and vehicles. The expectation document is available on the DSA website:</p>

	<p pid="a.1276W.5/1">Section 161 of the Highways Act 1980 deals with penalties for causing certain kinds of danger or annoyance to users of the highway. If a person without lawful authority or excuse deposits anything whatsoever on a highway in consequence of which a user of the highway is injured or endangered, that person is guilty of an offence and liable to a fine.</p>
	<p pid="a.1276W.5/2">In the last 12 months the Department has dealt with two representations from members of the public concerning this section.</p>
	<p pid="a.1276W.5/3">The Highways Act 1980 contains more than 300 sections and 25 schedules. A large number of amendments have been made to the Highways Act in the last 26 years and the cost of collating a list would be disproportionate. As there is no central record of representations received by the Department that would enable officials to identify those about the operation of the whole Act, it would also incur disproportionate cost to do so.</p>
	<p pid="a.1276W.5/4">However, section 161 sub sections (1), (3) and (4) of the Highways Act 1980 were amended by sections 38 and 46 of the Criminal Justice Act 1982. These amendments raised the level of the fines. Section 161 sub section (2) was substituted by the Highways (Amendment) Act 1986 and relates to creating criminal offences in relation to lighting fires or discharging firearms or fireworks in the vicinity of the highway.</p>

	<p pid="a.1282W.2/1">The Government already support the use of bioethanol as a transport fuel by means of a 20 pence per litre fuel duty incentive. Since this was introduced in January 2005, sales of bioethanol in the UK have increased from zero to a monthly average of some 7 million litres. We have also announced that we will introduce a Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation in 2008, which will require all transport fuel suppliers to ensure that biofuels account for a certain percentage of their total fuel sales. In 2010, the level of the Obligation will reach 5 per cent., which should mean that annual sales of bioethanol reach over a billion litres a year.</p>
	<p pid="a.1282W.2/2">European Union fuel quality standards currently allow 5 per cent. ethanol to be blended into petrol, and all petrol vehicles are already capable of running on these blends. Above that level, a number of technical modifications are required to vehicles and to refuelling points. We introduced a new grant programme in 2005 to support the installation of alternative refuelling infrastructure, and through this we are supporting the installation of a small number of high level ethanol pumps. In addition, the Chancellor of the Exchequer announced in the March 2006 Budget that cars manufactured to run on high level ethanol blends will qualify for the reduced rate of Vehicle Excise Duty for alternatively fuelled cars. Beyond that, the Government have no current plans for other incentives.</p>

	<p pid="a.1291W.0/1">I have received veterinary advice that ventilation shutdown (VSD) is unlikely to deliver welfare standards equal to other recognised culling methods available.</p>
	<p pid="a.1291W.0/2">The use of ventilation shutdown would therefore only be authorised as a last resort where no other method, as outlined in Schedule 9 of the Welfare of Animals (Slaughter or Killing) Regulations 1995, could be practicably employed for the killing of large numbers of birds on a specific farm for disease control purposes.</p>
	<p pid="a.1291W.0/3">The priority in dealing with a notifiable animal disease is to ensure that public health and safety of poultry workers is protected, particularly where, like with some strains of the avian influenza virus, there is a risk of human infection. Disease outbreaks must be dealt with quickly and effectively to reduce the likelihood of further spread of disease and it remains our intention to kill birds by the most humane method possible.</p>
	<p pid="a.1291W.0/4">We must however be prepared for all eventualities including extreme circumstances where catchers are unavailable, logistical capabilities are stretched and where a grave threat to public health exists. The risk of that may be very small but it is right that we provide for it.</p>
	<p pid="a.1291W.0/5">To enhance our capability to kill large numbers of birds through humane means, we have developed, and continue to develop, the use of gas or gas mixtures. Such techniques have been endorsed by the Humane Slaughter Association and were used successfully in the recent disease incidence in Norfolk. We expect that such techniques will be useable in the great majority of circumstances where an outbreak occurs.</p>

	<p pid="a.1291W.3/1">Since September 2005 approximately 5,000 blood samples, from 435 domestic poultry premises, have been tested. In October, samples taken from a number of geese on a premises in Somerset tested positive for antibodies to H5N2 and H5N7. Movement restrictions were served on the premises and a veterinary inquiry was initiated. Clinical examination revealed that the geese were healthy. Further sampling and laboratory tests did not isolate avian influenza viruses. The presence of infection with avian influenza viruses was ruled out. It is likely that the positive antibody result was due to previous exposure to low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) viruses. Disease was not confirmed on the premises.</p>
	<p pid="a.1291W.3/2">In April 2006, H5N1 avian influenza was confirmed in a sample from the partially decomposed body of a swan found in Cellardyke, Fife, Scotland. Movement restrictions were put in place and a 2,500 sq km wild bird risk area was established. No further cases of highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 where found, restrictions in the wild bird surveillance zone were lifted on <phrase class="date" code="2006-05-01">1 May</phrase> and the wild bird risk area was ended.</p>
	<p pid="a.1291W.3/3">H7N3 low pathogenicity avian influenza was confirmed on three poultry farms near Dereham, Norfolk in late April 2006. A low pathogenic avian influenza restricted zone with a radius of 1km was imposed around the infected premises. Movement restrictions were served on the premises and the three flocks were culled. Surveillance and testing was carried out on all additional premises belonging to the owner of the infected premises.</p>

	<p pid="a.1298W.2/1">To help address the legacy of land contamination, the Government brought into force part IIA (&quot;contaminated land&quot;) of the Environmental Protection Act 1990. This places local authorities under a statutory duty to inspect their areas to identify contaminated land as defined in the Act, and to secure its remediation, in accordance with the detailed provisions of the regime. They are required to take a strategic and prioritised approach to the duty of inspection. A local authority must designate contaminated land as a &quot;special site&quot; if it meets specific legal definitions. Where a local authority designates a site as a special site, the Environment Agency will become the enforcing authority for the site. In broad terms, the regime addresses unacceptable risk arising from land contamination in situations where other statutory regimes cannot be applied.</p>

Assumptions for a long haul flight refer to a 5,000 km journey on a typical 450 seat capacity aircraft, with a 70 per cent. load factor. Assumptions for a short haul flight refer to a 500 km journey on a typical 128-seat capacity aircraft, with a 65 per cent. load factor.</p>

Work done for the Environment Agency suggested the figure could be as high as 94 per cent.

An estimate of the level of diversion will also be made and published at that time, taking account of the survey and other quantitative evidence.</p>

	<p pid="a.1313W.8/1">The Government examined the effects of metering in its review of water charging in 1997-99. The findings informed the development of the Water Industry Act 1999, which provides domestic customers with the option of a measured water bill or to remain on an unmeasured charging basis for water used only for normal household purposes in their present home.</p>
	<p pid="a.1313W.8/2">DEFRA is currently leading work on metering in the context of the Water Saving Group. This involves targeted action to increase metering in water stressed areas, and to improve the understanding and delivery of metering generally. As part of this work, DEFRA is assessing how the balance between company discretion and customer choice should be struck.</p>

In the south, authority and the rule of law have yet to be firmly established and, at present, insurgents, drug traffickers and a range of illegally armed groups all pose a threat to security, as they did in January 2006. As anticipated, there has been an increase in attacks in the south as the numbers and profile of NATO troops has increased with the deployment of forces for stage 3. We remain committed to the expansion of the international security assistance force (ISAF) across all of Afghanistan.</p>

	<p pid="a.1329W.2/3">Operational medical support required by UK troops deployed on operations is designed to be the most appropriate and robust to enable the commander to complete his mission. This is determined by a rigorous medical estimate of the military tasks to be undertaken. DMS manning requirements are regularly assessed with the aim of ensuring that we have sufficient medical staff to meet these key military requirements.</p>
	<p pid="a.1329W.2/4">Manning levels in the DMS vary across different specialities and Services. In some areas we are very well manned, whilst in others we are experiencing shortfalls. However, there is no question of British forces being deployed on military operations without appropriate medical support. Manning shortfalls are being continually addressed through a package of remunerative and non-remunerative measures.</p>

	<p pid="a.1329W.8/1">The UK is fully committed to its obligations under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, including those on disarmament under Article VI, and has made significant disarmament steps since 1992. For example, the UK has given up both the nuclear Lance missile and artillery roles we undertook previously with US nuclear weapons held under dual-key arrangements, along with our maritime tactical nuclear capability, so that Royal Navy surface ships no longer have any capability to carry or deploy nuclear weapons. In 1998, the UK withdrew and dismantled the last air-launched nuclear weapon, the Royal Air Force's WE117 nuclear bombs. The dismantlement of the last remaining Chevaline (Polaris) warheads occurred in April 2002, so that Trident is now our only nuclear weapons system;</p>
	<p pid="a.1329W.8/2">In all, there has been a reduction of the UK's operationally available stockpile of nuclear weapons to fewer than 200 warheads, representing a reduction of more than 70 per cent. in the potential explosive power of our nuclear forces since the end of the cold war. Only one Trident submarine is on deterrent patrol at any one time and that submarine is normally on several days 'notice to fire' and its missiles are not targeted at any specific country.</p>
	<p pid="a.1329W.8/3">In addition, the UK announced in 1995 that we had stopped the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices, and we continually press for negotiations to begin on a fissile material cut-off treaty at the conference on disarmament in Geneva. We have also been more transparent about our nuclear and fissile material stockpiles, publishing an historical account of plutonium stockpiles, along with an account of our highly enriched uranium earlier this year.</p>
	<p pid="a.1329W.8/4">We are the only nuclear power that has so far been prepared to take such important steps on the route to nuclear disarmament.</p>

	<p pid="a.1331W.8/1">The United Kingdom Government would be prepared to use nuclear weapons only in extreme circumstances of self-defence. We would not use our weapons, whether conventional or nuclear, contrary to international law.</p>
	<p pid="a.1331W.8/2">A policy of no first use of nuclear weapons would be incompatible with our and NATO's doctrine of deterrence. We have made clear, as have our NATO allies, that the circumstances in which any use of nuclear weapons might have to be contemplated are extremely remote. Our overall strategy is to ensure uncertainty in the mind of any aggressor about the exact nature of our response, and thus to maintain effective deterrence.</p>

The Ministry of Defence has no plans to change that policy.</p>
	<p pid="a.1332W.0/2">The armed forces occupational pension schemes pay death benefits regardless of whether the death was caused by service. This standard level of widows pension is not reduced by any common law compensation award.</p>

Where the cause of death was on or before <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-05">5 April 2005</phrase>, this would be by way of a War Widow's Pension under the War Pensions Scheme (WPS). This pension is paid in full. In addition, an enhanced rate of widows pension under the occupational pension scheme may be paid, which includes an element for loss of earnings and support. It is only this final element that may be affected by a common law compensation settlement, where that settlement also includes an element for loss of earnings and support.</p>

Because the AFCS benefits will normally be paid before any common law compensation settlement, arrangements are in place to reduce the common law compensation instead of seeking to claw back the AFCS benefit that would already be in payment.</p>

Bills will be set in line with average domestic bills in England and Wales. Charges will be phased in over a three-year period which means that the average domestic water and sewerage bill in April 2007 will be just over &pound;100.</p>
