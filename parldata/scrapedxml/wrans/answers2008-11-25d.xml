	<p pid="d.1165W.4/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="d.1165W.4/2">My Department funds research on melting of the Arctic sea ice and Greenland ice sheet through the Integrated Climate Programme, which is undertaken by the Met Office Hadley Centre (MOHC). This programme is jointly funded with the MOD. We also liaise with other research groups in the UK on these topics.</p>
	<p pid="d.1165W.4/3">With regard to the implications of sea ice melt for the Greenland ice sheet, a MOHC study has examined the impacts of long-term deglaciation of the Greenland ice sheet using a greenhouse gas concentration scenario where the Arctic becomes free of sea ice during the summer. This experiment incorporated a model of sea ice so that interactions between sea ice and Greenland land ice melt were included.</p>
	<p pid="d.1165W.4/4">The results showed a maximum contribution from the melting Greenland ice sheet to sea level rise of 5 mm per year, which is within the uncertainty range already considered in projections of sea level rise around the UK coastline. However processes involving rapid movement of ice within the ice sheets are not included in this, or other current ice sheet models, as the dynamics are still poorly understood. Further work is needed to improve these models and thus estimates of sea level rise.</p>
	<p pid="d.1165W.4/5">The UK also monitors changes in the Greenland ice sheet directly. Observational measurements of the rate of change of its volume have been carried out by UK research groups over the last 15 years, using satellite radar remote sensing. Recently scientists at the British Antarctic Survey (BAS), part of the Natural Environment Research Council, have developed a new, more accurate technique for determining ice cap changes, using satellite laser technology. Significant research on the fundamental physics of glaciers and ice sheets is being carried out by BAS and other UK research groups, often in Antarctica.</p>

	<p pid="d.1172W.9/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="d.1172W.9/2">We currently have no legislation dealing directly with the overseas operations of UK-based private military and security companies (PMSCs). Options for regulation were considered in a Green Paper published in 2002 entitled 'Private Military Companies: Options for Regulation.' A follow-up review in 2005 explored a number of options for ways in which the industry could be regulated, including self-regulation, licensing of individual contracts and licensing of companies from a register of Government approved companies. This review highlighted the complexity of the issues, especially the definition of what activities should be regulated and how any regulations would be enforced&mdash;all of which continue to be the subject of ministerial and official consultation. The Government have undertaken to keep Parliament fully informed of their proposals in this area. If it is agreed that some form of regulation is appropriate, the Government will put the proposals to public consultation.</p>
	<p pid="d.1172W.9/3">However, apart from the national law of the countries in which they are operating, PMSCs are also subject to certain UK legislation. For example, there is legislation penalising grave breaches of the Geneva conventions, as well as torture, genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity, which applies to acts committed by United Kingdom nationals overseas. We have also considered international regulation based on common international values and norms. We have supported the Swiss Initiative to promote respect for international humanitarian law and human rights law on the part of PMSCs operating in situations of armed conflict or post-conflict.</p>

Foreign and Commonwealth Office Travel Advice advises against all travel to eastern and north eastern DRC including North Kivu. Those British nationals in the effected areas are likely to be working with international aid agencies and UN agencies. These organisations have their own security systems in place for the evacuation of staff and take advice from the UN mission in the DRC locally. Our embassy in Kinshasa is able to provide limited consular assistance to British nationals in need of emergency assistance. We have a diplomat based in Goma, who as part of their role is to offer consular advice and assistance.</p>

The programme includes a strong police reform component focussing on improving command and control procedures and supporting special units within the police to deal with sexual violence. We fund medical and psychosocial care for victims through our contribution to the UN Humanitarian Pooled Fund (&pound;35 million). With EU partners we are supporting a justice rehabilitation programme in Eastern DRC, Restoration of the Judicial System in Eastern Congo (REJUSCO), which includes a component providing legal support and accompaniment for victims through the criminal process.

The employee or a representative for them may appeal by putting arguments against dismissal in writing, and those arguments will be considered by Post Management. The employee may contact Local Staff Management Unit (HRD-LSPS) in the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, but should be aware that there is no formal appeal channel to London. The employee should feel able to involve the local staff association, and no staff association representative will be penalised in any way for becoming involved. If the employee is unsatisfied with the outcome of this process or of any appeal, then they may have recourse to the local courts (subject to the possible application of local Iraqi laws, including Coalition Provisional Authority Orders in this regard).</p>

However, through the tri-departmental (Foreign and Commonwealth Office, Department for International Development and Ministry of Defence) Conflict Prevention Pool the UK provides direct funding support to a range of projects aimed at tackling gender-based violence and building capacity for female participation in conflict resolution. We will continue to identify projects that promote the recommendations of UN Security Council Resolution 1325 and ensure that all HMG funded projects take into account gender issues. UK training to troop contributing countries prior to deployment in UN missions includes guidance on the protection of women and children.</p>
	<p pid="d.1207W.0/2">In the last three years we have given the UN Development Fund for Women (UNIFEM) around &pound;9 million in core funding, including &pound;3.4 million for its project on &quot;Women's engagement in Peacebuilding and Preventing Sexual Violence in Conflict Project&quot;. Other projects include funding research into the problem of violence against women in Afghanistan, and &pound;2 million of funding for Pakistan's Gender Justice and Protection Fund which supports national approaches to combat violence against women. In South Africa we provide support to NGOs aimed at empowering women, men and youth to demand and protect women's rights, reducing the vulnerability of women and girls to gender based violence and HTV/AIDs.</p>

The programme will assess people's risk of coronary heart disease, stroke, diabetes and kidney disease.

However, the survey and the report does not differentiate between different elements of IT expenditure, for example on hardware, software or Cerner related costs.</p>

However, this figure under-represents the true incidence of stroke for two reasons. Firstly, HES data only includes those who were admitted to hospital with a diagnosis of stroke but not all stroke patients currently attend hospital. Secondly, the count of admissions does not represent the total number of patients as a person may be admitted more than once in the year. HES data cannot answer the question in the form requested. Academic estimates suggest there are around 110,000 strokes in England per annum.</p>

	<p pid="d.1234W.3/2">Many factors influence trends in the use of animals under the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986, including the economic climate, global trends in scientific endeavour and strategic decisions by funding bodies. The increase in the use of genetically altered strains seen over recent years has also had an impact as advances in genetics open up new and promising avenues of medical research.</p>
	<p pid="d.1234W.3/3">The licensing system under the 1986 Act is demand-led and we have no control over the number of project licence applications we receive. The Act limits such animal use to where there is a clear benefit to people, animals or the environment when there is no means of obtaining these benefits without animal use, or at a lesser animal welfare cost. All scientists and researchers undertaking animal research in the UK are required to take into account the '3Rs' (measures to replace, reduce, and refine animal use) when devising their programmes of research proposals.</p>
	<p pid="d.1234W.3/4">In 2004, the Government established the National Centre for the 3Rs to provide a focal point and resources for such activities. The NC3Rs drives advances in the 3Rs by taking a robust scientific approach, and bringing together expertise from a diverse range of areas, including academia, industry, Government and regulatory bodies.</p>

	<p pid="d.1236W.5/1">Since 2003-04, the Home Office has made &pound;34.4 million available in each year specifically and solely to tackle antisocial behaviour in England and Wales. This includes funding for the Respect programme, which is now the responsibility of the Department for Children, Schools and Families, and a grant for antisocial behaviour co-ordinators.</p>
	<p pid="d.1236W.5/2">As with all other Crime and Disorder Reduction Partnerships (CDRPs), Dacorum, which includes Hemel Hempstead, was allocated &pound;25,000 a year from 2003-04 as a contribution towards funding an ASB co-ordinator post. In 2005-06, in England the antisocial co-ordinators grant was pooled within the safer and stronger communities fund. This pooled budget supports the delivery of outcomes and indicators relating to antisocial behaviour in local area agreements (LAAs).</p>
	<p pid="d.1236W.5/3">Respect programmes in Hertfordshire also have an impact on antisocial behaviour. These programmes were designed to kick start a change in the way the area worked to tackle antisocial behaviour. There are many funding streams that impact on antisocial behaviour. A more detailed account can be found in the report by the National Audit Office 'Tackling Anti-Social Behaviour' (HC99 2006-07, December 2006). Other Home Office-led activities also act to tackle antisocial behaviour, for example the introduction of community support officers, but a monetary value cannot be assigned to that contribution.</p>

	<p pid="d.1236W.8/1">The available information is given in the following tables. Figures for the number of assaults without injury on a constable are taken from the police recorded crime statistics collected by the Home Office and relate to offences recorded by the police. These figures are on a financial year basis. Assaults without injury are categories which apply specifically to the recorded crime data. If an assault on a police officer results in injury then the offence will be recorded under the appropriate wounding classification (i.e. more or less serious wounding).</p>
	<p pid="d.1236W.8/2">Prosecutions data come from the Office for Criminal Justice Reform and relate to defendants. These figures are on a calendar year basis. The data refer to prosecutions for assault on a constable which may include cases where an officer receives an injury (unlike the recorded crime data). Because of this and the fact that one dataset looks at offences and the other at defendants, the figures in the two tables are not directly comparable.</p>
	<p pid="d.1236W.8/3">Prosecutions data are not available for London boroughs but figures for England are given in Table 3.</p>

	<p pid="d.1250W.0/1">The number and proportion of recorded crimes detected in which a DNA match was available is shown in table 1. Data on the number of crimes detected with a DNA match are not collected on a monthly basis; and the figures are therefore presented by year. The figures provided are for the years 2002-03 to 2007-08, as the recorded crime figures before and after 2002-03 are not directly comparable.</p>
	<p pid="d.1250W.0/2">The figures for the number of crimes detected in which a DNA match was available only include crimes detected in which a DNA match was reported by the National DNA Database (NDNAD). They do not include DNA matches which arise through case work in serious crime, which usually involve comparing DNA profiles in a forensic laboratory; this data is not collected centrally. It is also important to note that the detections are achieved through integrated criminal investigation, not through DNA alone.</p>
	<p pid="d.1250W.0/3">The presentation of crimes detected with DNA as a proportion of total recorded crime undervalues the relative contribution of DNA to the crime detection rate. It should be noted that the majority of recorded crimes do not have a crime scene (for example, minor assault, drugs offences, theft, fraud etc.) and do not have a crime scene examination. In 2007-08, just over 854,000 crimes had a crime scene examination (17 per cent. of recorded crimes). In those crimes which have a crime scene examination, some do not yield any forensic material (DNA or fingerprints). In 2007-08, potential DNA material was collected at 102,400 crimes; and of these, 41,800 crimes yielded DNA crime scene samples of sufficient quantity and quality for profiling and loading to the NDNAD. Of the 41,800 crimes in which a crime scene sample profile was loaded, a match was generated in 37,375 crimes (this represents 89 per cent. of crimes where DNA material was loaded to the NDNAD).</p>
	<p pid="d.1250W.0/4">The proportion of 'crimes detected in which a DNA match was available', of those, 'crimes where potential DNA material was collected' is shown in table 2.</p>

This was the first year that these figures were available and will in future provide information on trends for these offences. These figures are not broken down by age group.</p>
	<p pid="d.1258W.2/4">We take knife crime extremely seriously and have announced a programme of action, based on the successful Tackling Gangs Action Programme model, to combat this issue. The action includes increased enforcement activity including the use of search equipment, prevention through educational initiatives such as Be Safe, development of the knife referral project to ensure that young people who are convicted of carrying knives but who do not receive a custodial sentence are required to attend a weapons awareness programme. We have also launched a &pound;3 million three-year publicity campaign designed by young people focusing on the risks and consequences of knife carrying. This is being delivered via a social networking site, radio advertisements, posters and viral video clips.</p>

	<p pid="d.1267W.8/1">Decisions about the use of land which is designated as green belt, or whether land should be designated as green belt, must be taken in accordance with the policy in Planning Policy Guidance Note 2 on green belts. This policy has performed an important role in preventing urban sprawl and protecting the countryside for 50 years. There is a presumption against inappropriate development in green belt but the policy allows for some development there, such as to support agriculture or forestry or as limited infill in existing villages. Development that is inappropriate may be permitted only where the benefits clearly outweigh any harm to the green belt and where very special circumstances are also demonstrated. The Government remain committed to current green belt policy and have no intention of making changes to it.</p>
	<p pid="d.1267W.8/2">Detailed information of the designated 1996 green belt boundary is not centrally held. Information on designated green belt boundaries is held for only 1997 and 2007. Land use change statistics on the green belt are now based on the 2007 designated boundary, but as the question specifically excludes additions to the green belt since 1996, in this case the 1997 designated boundary has been used.</p>

Member may be referring to section 54A of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990, which was repealed and replaced by section 38(6) of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004. This requires determinations under the planning Acts to be made in accordance with the development plan unless material considerations indicate otherwise. The effect of proposed development on a listed building, conservation area or other heritage asset could constitute a material consideration. The provision ensures that heritage assets are given due consideration when planning applications are being determined.</p>

	<p pid="d.1298W.2/1">In August 2008 the Ministry published research on the early findings of the impact of the Domestic Violence, Crime and Victims Act 2004. Key findings were:</p>
	<p pid="d.1298W.2/2" class="indent">there had been a positive impact since common assault became an arrestable offence (as are all criminal offences now)&mdash;strengthening and clarifying police powers and the positive arrest policy. Early findings indicated an increased use of common assault provisions;</p>
	<p pid="d.1298W.2/3" class="indent">the impact of making breach of non-molestation orders a criminal offence was less clear-cut among professionals. Victims and advocates generally welcomed the measure, in the hope that better enforcement and heavier sanctions would result; and</p>
	<p pid="d.1298W.2/4" class="indent">it was not possible to conclude that the drop in family court injunctions was wholly as a result of implementation of section 1 of the Act.</p>
	<p pid="d.1298W.2/5">Given the relatively short time since the change in the law on <phrase class="date" code="2007-07-01">1 July 2007</phrase>, it is not possible to conclude that the drop in family court injunction applications and orders is a direct result of the change in legislation, or whether it represents a consolidation of previous trends as the number of family court injunction orders (non-molestation and occupation orders) has fallen gradually. It is apparent that there are variations between geographical areas and changes in volumes of non-molestation and occupation orders being made.</p>
	<p pid="d.1298W.2/6">The number of applications to the county courts for domestic violence remedies decreased by 7 per cent. in 2007 compared with 2006. Compared with 2003 they have fallen by 19 per cent<sup>(1)</sup>.</p>

	<p pid="d.1298W.2/27">In the year the Domestic Violence, Crime and Victims Act was passed (2004), the criminal courts dealt with 34,839 cases involving domestic violence<sup>(2)</sup>. By 2007, this figure rose to 63,819. More victims are choosing to report incidents to the police to take the criminal court route.</p>
	<p pid="d.1298W.2/28">Furthermore, the charge to conviction rate in the final quarter of 2007-08 was to 70.7 per cent., exceeding the CPS's April 2008 target of 70 per cent. This is a significant improvement against the background of the 59.7 per cent. conviction rate four years ago. The national average for all domestic violence prosecutions was 72 per cent. in July-September 2008, meeting the 2008-09 target ahead of time.</p>
	<p pid="d.1298W.2/29">The key message is that both family and criminal court jurisdictions helped 22,975 more victims in 2007 than in 2004.</p>
	<p pid="d.1298W.2/30">The Ministry will continue to monitor the levels of applications and orders for non-molestation orders and is working with the judiciary and stakeholders to improve the family and criminal justice systems response to victims of domestic violence.</p>
	<p pid="d.1298W.2/31">While there are no specific plans to review the way non-molestation orders or ex parte applications are processed through the courts, a new Allocation and Transfer of Proceedings Order will come into effect on <phrase class="date" code="2008-11-25">25 November 2008</phrase>. The objective is to ensure that proceedings are heard at the appropriate level of court and that the capacity of magistrates courts is properly utilised. This may mean that more cases under the Family Law Act 1996 will be dealt in the Family Proceedings Courts, as opposed to the county courts.</p>

	<p pid="d.1305W.5/1">The Prison Service understands the benefits in providing productive employment in prisons for prisoners and there is a constant process of developing and improving work for prisoners.</p>
	<p pid="d.1305W.5/2">Significant numbers of prisoners are meaningfully employed on a daily basis in a range of activities. This includes essential work producing a variety of goods for internal consumption and providing in-house services such as catering, cleaning and laundries. This activity not only provides constructive employment but also reduces the cost of imprisonment and has an element of restitution. Prisoner employment in prison also acts as an aid to good order and control and aids resettlement through skills and qualifications.</p>
	<p pid="d.1305W.5/3">In addition there are a number of employer partnerships with the private sector that not only provide real employment and training but also the possibility of employment on release. The Prison Service is keen to grow these initiatives so that increasing number of prisoners and society can benefit. In addition to those working in individual prisons and probation areas there is also an existing Corporate Alliance with employers from the private, public and third sectors which informs strategy and delivery.</p>

	<p pid="d.1306W.2/1">The Ministry of Justice has commissioned the 'Surveying Prisoner Crime Reduction Survey' which will examine the nature of prisoners' work and training in prison and the associations of this with the take up of employment after release and the nature of such employment. When these data are linked with re-offending data from the Police National Computer it will be possible to examine the statistical associations between prison work/training and re-offending. The post-release employment data will be available in the summer of 2009 while the re-offending data will be available in 2010.</p>
	<p pid="d.1306W.2/2">In respect of previous findings, a review by the then Department for Education and Skills<sup>(1)</sup> concluded that prison-based employment interventions were effective in helping offenders gain and retain employment.</p>
	<p pid="d.1306W.2/3">There is recognition of the role of employment agencies and employers in helping to secure employment for ex-prisoners in England and Wales. The emerging evidence on basic skills training in prison suggests that these courses can improve prisoners' skills<sup>(2)</sup>.</p>
	<p pid="d.1306W.2/4">In terms of international evidence, a United States study examined evaluations of programmes that attempt to augment the educational, vocational, and job skills of adult offenders in both prison and community settings and found that on average, these programmes do reduce re-offending<sup>(3)</sup>. Another study evaluated the impact of prison work and vocational and apprenticeship training on post-prison rates of employment and offending among a study group and a comparison sample matched on a range of factors predictive of participation in the scheme and other demographic and background variables. The study group was 35 per cent. less likely to breach the terms of their supervision or be re-arrested during the first 12 months following release. The study group was also 14 per cent. more likely to be employed<sup>(4)</sup>.</p>

	<p pid="d.1314W.2/2">Looking forward, it has been clear since the publication of MoJ's CSR07 settlement that the Department and its constituent bodies would have to reduce previously planned budgets. The MoJ will be taking all necessary steps to reduce overheads, remove duplication and increase efficiencies in order to prioritise front line services.</p>
	<p pid="d.1314W.2/3">The efficiency savings plan for MoJ for 2008-09 is underway. We are developing over the next few months the performance and efficiency plan for MoJ and its constituent bodies to cover 2009-10 and 2010-11. When that plan is agreed for 2009-10 and 2010-11, we will be in a position to inform Parliament of the impact on MoJ.</p>

	<p pid="d.1314W.5/2">The civil procedure rules state that all claims for the repossession of land must be commenced in the district in which the land is situated. However, county courts jurisdictions are not coterminous with borough or constituency boundaries. Therefore the above figures are likely to count possession orders relating to properties in a number of other constituencies besides Chipping Barnet.</p>
	<p pid="d.1314W.5/3">These figures do not indicate how many homes have actually been repossessed. Repossessions can occur without a court order being made while not all court orders result in repossession. Figures showing the number of repossessions of mortgaged homes are published separately by the Council of Mortgage Lenders and the Financial Services Authority. However, these are not available at regional or constituency level.</p>

	<p pid="d.1318W.3/1">The need to ensure our projects deliver lasting benefits is central to the design of all projects, including in Iraq and Afghanistan. Particular attention is given in project design to ensure that our partner organisations (in particular governments) have the resources (money and capacities) to continue to provide the benefits the project was designed to deliver. Project implementation progress is closely monitored through formal annual reviews&mdash;and once complete, a thorough Project Completion Report (PCR) is undertaken to assess future impact and lessons learned. Thereafter, ongoing operation of completed individual projects lies with the recipient partner. To the extent of our knowledge, all the completed projects in both Iraq and Afghanistan are still delivering the expected benefits.</p>

These evaluations are mandatory for all countries where DFID has major involvement and are timed to fit into the country planning cycle so that lessons learned are incorporated into future interventions. An evaluation of the Afghanistan country programme is currently ongoing.</p>

	<p pid="d.1319W.5/4">Recent progress includes the adoption of UN Security Council Resolution 1820 in June this year, focussing on longer-term measures to tackle sexual violence in conflict, and a Security Council Open Debate on 'Women, Peace and Security' which reiterated the need to strengthen the participation of women in conflict prevention, conflict resolution and peacebuilding. The UK played a major role in this debate and drafted a presidential statement that was adopted by the Council on <phrase class="date" code="2008-10-29">29 October</phrase>. This called on the Secretary-General to appoint more women to senior operational UN positions and to provide the Security Council with a report and recommendations on this issue. By working closely with the UN's Department of Peacekeeping Operations (DPKO), the UK is also making good progress on its aim to ensure that planning for Peace Support Operations includes gender components, and that they recruit more female military and police personnel.</p>

	<p pid="d.1320W.3/1">The Stabilisation Unit seeks continually to learn lessons from the UK's experience in Afghanistan and Iraq, as well as from other partners and theatres. Its understanding of stabilisation is summarised in two documents. In June 2008, the Stabilisation Unit produced its &quot;Stabilisation Task Matrix&quot;, which describes a menu of tasks which might be required to achieve stability and suggests who would need to take lead responsibility (the military, the police or civilians) for each task in &quot;non-permissive&quot; and &quot;permissive&quot; environments. The primary purpose of the Matrix is to enable the UK to further develop its capability to meet future challenges. The Matrix will be reviewed by spring 2009. Later this month, the Stabilisation Unit will also publish the &quot;UK Approach to Stabilisation&quot;, which will describe emerging UK experience and best practice.</p>
	<p pid="d.1320W.3/2">Both documents will be available on the Stabilisation Unit's web-site:</p>

	<p pid="d.1321W.5/1">The UK Government have made significant progress in the past year, to ensure that key enablers (transport, accommodation, communications, and close protection) are in place in Afghanistan and Iraq.</p>
	<p pid="d.1321W.5/2">In Afghanistan, the UK Government have leased a Beechcraft to provide a 'shuttle run' between Kabul and Lashkar Gah and to increase our reach elsewhere in the country. We expect to increase this capability in this next year. Access to rotary assets has improved but remains perhaps the greatest constraint on civilian movement. There are now sufficient vehicles in theatre (or on order) to meet the requirement. The construction of permanent office and personal accommodation for civilian teams in Sangin, Musa Qala, Gereshk and Garmsir has enabled the UK Government to dramatically improve their engagement with communities to deliver the UK strategy in Helmand.</p>

	<p pid="d.1322W.2/1">The Stabilisation Unit primarily delivers through the civilian experts it deploys. It is taking a number of steps to improve its ability to provide high quality experts on as sustainable basis, to Afghanistan, Iraq and other theatres. There are two principal initiatives.</p>
	<p pid="d.1322W.2/2">First, in August it started a nine month process to improve the quality of its database of civilian experts by turning it from a list of 900 people where most experts have only been subject to a basic paper sift to one where all experts will have been assessed face-to-face against professional and behavioural requirements. This greater understanding will enable the Unit to improve its ability to respond to demands for experts.</p>
	<p pid="d.1322W.2/3">Second, civilian experts need to be properly prepared to work and live in what can be professionally challenging and austere conditions. The unit is improving its existing training prior to their deployment. By December the unit will complete the design of a more extensive structured, tailored development programme for deploying experts to Afghanistan with implementation on a pilot basis starting in January 2009.</p>

We are encouraging other donors who have not yet done so to make a contribution. We are also working with WFP on the ground to review ways of ensuring that the current supply of food aid is used to maximum effect. Donor contributions so far have ensured that WFP operations are fully funded until January 2009.</p>

	<p pid="d.1328W.8/2">This information is given in the following tables.</p>
	<p pid="d.1328W.8/3">The Households Below Average Income publication uses equivalised household disposable incomes before and after housing costs as a proxy for material living standards. Both before and after housing cost incomes are net of income tax, national insurance contributions, council tax/domestic rates, pension contributions, maintenance/child support payments and parental contributions to students.</p>
	<p pid="d.1328W.8/4">Negative before housing costs incomes are possible if a loss is made from self-employment, however any such incomes are set to zero as part of the Households Below Average Income methodology. This means that all before housing costs income are zero or greater. After housing cost incomes can be negative if housing costs exceed the before housing cost incomes. All incomes excluding benefit income can be negative, as no further adjustment beyond removing benefit income is made.</p>
	<p pid="d.1328W.8/5">Benefits (particularly state pension, pension credit and disability benefits) are key elements of pensioner incomes. Incomes excluding such benefits are based mainly on earnings, investment income, self-employed earnings, private pension and other miscellaneous sources, will frequently be very small or negative, and will therefore not reflect the standard of living for a household.</p>
	<p pid="d.1328W.8/6">Distributions by equivalised income decile below are based on a three-year average to help take account of small sample sizes in certain deciles and statistical variation across the years. Decile boundaries are presented in 2006-07 prices.</p>

	<p pid="d.1334W.8/2">In Creative Britain&mdash;New Talents for the New Economy, we committed to launching a world creative business conference. The final cost of the event will depend on a number of factors, including the number of attendees. However, DCMS has allocated approximately &pound;3 million to the delivery of this, now called the Creativity and Business International Network (C&amp;binet) between 2008 and 2011. The approximate cost of C&amp;binet's inaugural meeting, bringing together 20 leading international figures from the creative industries on <phrase class="date" code="2008-11-20">20 November</phrase> in Liverpool, is &pound;47,600 not including travel costs.</p>

	<p pid="d.1340W.3/1">The Gambling Commission has advised that in just over a third of mystery shopper tests, deficiencies have been identified that could, in some circumstances, allow under 18s to gamble.</p>
	<p pid="d.1340W.3/2">However, the majority of mystery shopper tests conducted showed that policies and procedures to prevent children from gambling on remote gambling sites are effectively in place, and all of the licensed operators identified as having questions over their procedures in a pilot study undertaken in 2007 were found to have effective measures in place in more recent testing.</p>
	<p pid="d.1340W.3/3">Further details of the number of operators with deficiencies will be published in the Gambling Commission's 2008-09 Annual Report.</p>

	<p pid="d.1343W.0/1">The latest results from the reformed 2008 Anholt GFK Brand Index Survey (under the new methodology) reveal that the UK has moved up one place, from fourth in 2007 to third in 2008, in terms of 'holistic nation brand', behind Germany and France. This broadly reconfirms that the UK is still one of the leading visitor destinations in the world.</p>

When certain support activities funded by ONS including funding for the disseminations of outputs, initial local authority follow-up studies and the ongoing census support such as customer services are added, the overall cost of the 2001 Census in England and Wales equates to &pound;214 million.</p>

	<p pid="d.1344W.6/6" class="indent">In order to compare these figures, inflation, population growth and technical innovations must be taken into account.

	<p pid="d.1369W.2/7" class="indent">The Child Support (Collection and Enforcement) Regulations 1992 were amended in 2006 to remove the six-year limitation period for applying to the court for a liability order in England and Wales. The effect of the amended legislation which came into force on <phrase class="date" code="2006-07-12">12 July 2006</phrase> is that debts of child support that have accrued since <phrase class="date" code="2000-07-12">12 July 2000</phrase> can be pursued through the courts.</p>

	<p pid="d.1369W.2/9" class="indent">The Child Maintenance and Other Payments Act 2008 provides that in future the Commission may issue its own liability orders, without application to the court. These administrative liability orders may be made in respect of arrears that accrued before <phrase class="date" code="2000-07-12">12 July 2000</phrase> and will enable the Commission to pursue payment through the courts. The 2008 Act also provides powers for the Commission to make orders to deduct money from non-resident parents' bank accounts. Deduction orders will be made without application to the court and there is no time limitation on the arrears to which they may apply.</p>

However, the Agency does check a sample of around 6,000 cases each year to assess the accuracy of the maintenance calculations assessment to the nearest penny. This information is routinely published in Table 17 of the Child Support Agency's Quarterly Summary of Statistics. The latest version is available in the House of Commons library or online at the following link:</p>

A proportion of applications can not be allocated to a parliamentary constituency or region. Such examples are where the parent with care's residential postcode is not recorded. In some of these cases, the Agency holds a residential address without a postcode; a &quot;contact&quot; address; or a business address. Many applications have not yet reached the stage in the process where the postcode information has been confirmed.

	<p pid="d.1376W.0/6" class="indent">What processes are in place at the Child Support Agency in Birkenhead to prevent the incorrect issuing of liability orders.</p>
	<p pid="d.1376W.0/7" class="indent">The information you requested on the number of Liability Orders that have been re-issued incorrectly is not available as this information is not routinely recorded.</p>
	<p pid="d.1376W.0/8" class="indent">The Child Support Agency has processes in place to ensure Liability Orders are administered correctly and consistently in all of its offices including the Birkenhead site. Experienced senior case officers are responsible for preparing all applications to the courts for liability orders in respect of the non-resident parent's child maintenance arrears. The case officer will check the details on the case are correct; checking contact details, maintenance payments paid, preparing a full accounts breakdown to ensure the arrears are correct and ensuring an arrears warning letter has been sent to the non-resident parent.</p>
	<p pid="d.1376W.0/9" class="indent">If the non-resident parent has in the past considered that the maintenance calculation itself is incorrect, they will have had an opportunity to appeal the assessment through the independent Tribunals Service. Once a liability order is being actively considered by the Court, the non-resident parent can make representations for the Court to dismiss the liability order. The Courts currently dismiss less than one per cent of applications. The Agency believes that this is a good indication of the robustness of the checking regime currently in place. Finally, once a liability order has been awarded, the non-resident parent can again bring forward additional information, or indeed settle their arrears and the Agency may again consider whether it is appropriate to proceed with the application.</p>

	<p pid="d.1385W.11/1">Pension credit helps millions of older people. It ensures no pensioner aged 60 or over should have to live on less than &pound;124.05 per week for a single person and &pound;189.35 for a couple in 2008-09. Pension credit also rewards those aged 65 or over who have made modest provision for their retirement, up to &pound;19.71 for a single person and &pound;26.13 for a couple. Since pension credit was introduced in 2003 the number of pensioners in relative poverty has fallen by around 500,000 (after housing costs).</p>
	<p pid="d.1385W.11/2">Pension credit expenditure was &pound;5,971 m in 2004-05, &pound;6,426 million in 2005-06 and &pound;6,689 million in 2006-07. Information on the expenditure on pension credit by equivalised household income quintiles and deciles on an after housing cost basis is set out in the following table for available years. Estimates of pension credit expenditure by equivalised income quintile and deciles below are based on a three year average to help take account of small sample sizes in certain quintiles and deciles and statistical variation in expenditure by quintile across the years.</p>

	<p pid="d.1385W.11/33">Pension credit recipients within the top two quintiles would generally be expected to either have severe disabilities or be living within a wider household, such as that of a family member, in these circumstances the pensioner's income is assessed independently of the household to establish entitlement to pension credit.</p>
	<p pid="d.1385W.11/34">The relatively low level of expenditure in the bottom decile is partly explained by pensioners in these deciles not taking up their benefit entitlement. We continue to strive to ensure people are aware of and claim their entitlement. The Pensions Disability and Carers Service use data matching to identify those likely to be entitled to pension credit and encourage them to make a claim.</p>
	<p pid="d.1385W.11/35">The claim process is being made much simpler and more automatic and from October 2008 we are proposing to introduce a measure which will enable pensioners to claim housing benefit and council tax benefit with pension credit entirely over the phone without having to fill in and sign a claim form.</p>
	<p pid="d.1385W.11/36">Each week the Pensions Disability and Carers Service is carrying out around 13,000 visits to help the more vulnerable pensioners with benefits. Since the introduction of pension credit the number of pensioners in relative poverty (measured by 60 per cent. of contemporary median income after housing costs) has fallen by around 500,000.</p>
	<p pid="d.1385W.11/37" class="indentitalic"> Notes:</p>
	<p pid="d.1385W.11/38" class="indent">1. Pension credit was introduced in October 2003. This means data is only available for 2004-05, 2005-06 and 2006-07.</p>

	<p pid="d.1389W.2/1">Specific information regarding low income for the United Kingdom is available in &quot;Households Below Average Income 1994-95 to 2006-07&quot;. This annual report, which is a National Statistics publication, includes the numbers and proportions of pensioners with incomes below 50 per cent, 60 per cent and 70 per cent of median income and by quintile of the income distribution.</p>
	<p pid="d.1389W.2/2">Information on the median equivalised income of pensioners in each household income quintile and decile over the period 2004-05 to 2006-07 is shown in the tables below. Median equivalised incomes are given rather than mean equivalised incomes as these are less influenced by extreme values. The Households Below Average Income publication also uses median rather than mean equivalised incomes. Distributions by equivalised income decile are based on a three year average to help take account of small sample sizes in certain deciles and statistical variation across the years.</p>
	<p pid="d.1389W.2/3">These figures are based on sampling and estimates. Movements in data over short periods may be due to sampling error but over a longer period trends are useful. Incomes in 1996-99 are therefore included for reference. Particular caution is required when looking at the incomes of the lowest deciles as those households stating the lowest incomes to the Family Resources Survey may not actually have the lowest living standards. Many people who report very low incomes appear to have high spending.</p>
	<p pid="d.1389W.2/4">Median equivalised income of pensioners in the bottom quintile increased by 36 per cent. between 1996-99 and 2004-07. Measures introduced by the Government since 1997 to help those on the lowest incomes include the introduction of the Minimum Income Guarantee and its successor Pension Credit and Winter Fuel Payments for those aged 60 and over. For 2009, we will raise the standard minimum guarantee to &pound;130.00&mdash;an above indexation increase of &pound;5.95. We will be making an additional payment for winter 2008-09 of &pound;50 for households with someone aged 60-79 and &pound;100 for those with someone aged 80 or over. And in addition to this the Government will make a payment in the new year of &pound;60 for each pensioner, equivalent to bringing forward uprating of the basic State Pension from April to January.</p>

	<p pid="d.1396W.2/1">The Office of e-Envoy had policy responsibility for The Home Computing Initiative (HCI) between 1999 and 2004. Responsibility for HCI Policy was transferred to this Department in January 2004.</p>
	<p pid="d.1396W.2/2">From 2004 and up to the removal of the 1999 tax break in 2006, the Department met regularly with HMT, OFT and the HCI Alliance (BT, Intel and Microsoft) to monitor progress. A core part of this Department's contribution to the project was the production of an information pack which made the guidance material easier to understand for employers and employees wishing to take part in the scheme.</p>
	<p pid="d.1396W.2/3">Our assessment indicated that the Home Computer Initiative had been successful in reaching those in employment. However, it was not reaching those who were not working and Government wanted to refocus its resources to support groups with the poorest access to technology such as the unemployed, elderly, disabled and low-income groups. Consequently the tax exemption was removed.</p>
	<p pid="d.1396W.2/4">Since the demise of 1999 Tax exemption, Government have launched the Home Access Programme&mdash;The programme aims to ensure that every learner in England (five to 19 years old and in maintained education) has access to increased educational opportunities via ICT resources at home. The programme is led by the Home Access Taskforce and chaired by Jim Knight.</p>
	<p pid="d.1396W.2/5">Paul Murphy SoS for Wales and Minister for Digital Inclusion recently launched the cross Government consultation paper &quot;Delivering Digital Inclusion&mdash;An Action Plan for Consultation&quot;. The action plan seeks to provide a framework for achieving greater digital equality within the UK, through both immediate actions and a number of proposals put forward for wider consultation.</p>

	<p pid="d.1407W.8/1">The Learning and Skills Council's (LSC) remit is to provide funding for England only. The Welsh Assembly is responsible for Learning and Skills in Wales. Under section 12 of the Further Education and Training Act 2007, the LSC may take part in arrangements in relation to Wales and Scotland to assist in the training for employment opportunities, subject to the consent of the Secretary of State and the Welsh Ministers. This has allowed Wales to participate in the Career Development Loan Scheme. Approximately 4 per cent. of the Career Development Loans scheme is allocated to Wales, this equates to &pound;947,000. No figures are available for Gwent.</p>

	<p pid="d.1408W.0/1">As announced through the Government's Grant Letter to the Learning and Skills Council (LSC) on <phrase class="date" code="2008-11-18">18 November</phrase>, funding for adult learning will be &pound;3.3 billion in 2009-10, an increase of 4.2 per cent. compared with 2008-09.</p>
	<p pid="d.1408W.0/2">Colleges and providers are given indicative budgets based on the expected delivery of an overall volume of learning; the actual funding paid will depend on the choice of learning area made by employers and learners. As funding is not allocated at an individual course level, details of the amount made available to support these specific qualifications are not held centrally in the Department.</p>
	<p pid="d.1408W.0/3">However, the LSC are able to provide a breakdown of funds directed towards specific qualifications in past years. I have asked Mark Haysom, chief executive of the LSC, to write out detailing how much was spent on NVQs in horse riding and horse care in 2006-07 and 2007-08. A copy of his reply will be placed in the House Library. It is not possible, however, for any estimate to be given of future funding, since investment from the LSC in specific qualifications comes only in response to demand from learners and employers.</p>
	<p pid="d.1408W.0/4">All the sector skills councils (Lantra, for equine studies) are working to develop sector qualifications strategies. These identify the training and skills needs of their sector, and the qualifications that best meet these needs. Public funding for vocational qualifications will increasingly be focused on those qualifications that are deemed a priority for and by particular sectors.</p>

	<p pid="d.1409W.3/1">All qualifications that receive public funding through the Learning and Skills Council (LSC), including NVQ level 3 qualifications, are funded at a national rate. This rate is based on the number of hours required to complete the course and a national fee assumption of the amount that either the learner or employer will contribute to the cost of the course, where full fee remission does not apply. For 2008-09, the national fee assumption is 42.5 per cent.</p>

	<p pid="d.1411W.2/1">The estimates of numbers Not in Education, Employment or Training (NEET) and NEET rates for 16-24 year olds presented in the following tables are taken from the Labour Force Survey (LFS) for Quarter 4 1997 and Quarter 4 2007 as in the previous reply. In order to ensure that the estimates are reasonably robust the tables shown here are for all England given the nature of the breakdowns requested. Despite the condensed nature of the groups shown in the tables some of the estimates are based on small samples and should be treated with caution.</p>
	<p pid="d.1411W.2/2">The &quot;socio-economic group&quot; or National Statistics Socio-Economic Classification (NS-SEC) of a respondent to the Labour Force Survey is based on their own current or past occupation. Consequently such a breakdown is not well suited to young people as it will merely reflect their own most recent occupation rather than their family background. Nevertheless information on two broad groupings of NS-SEC are shown below for Quarter 4 2007. Comparable information by NS-SEC is not available for 1997.</p>

	<p pid="d.1415W.2/1">Academies are funded on an academic year rather than a financial year basis. We aim to provide academies with funding for running costs that is equivalent to other state-funded schools in similar circumstances in their local authority. This requires us to make certain adjustments, for example, to reflect a phased intake of pupils, or VAT status. In addition, academies are funded to buy services that local authorities would normally provide to other schools free of charge, such as education welfare services.</p>
	<p pid="d.1415W.2/2">As The Open Academy, Norwich, only opened in September 2008, it did not receive any recurrent funding in 2007-08. For academic year 2008-09, The Open Academy received &pound;5,200 per pupil, based on the academy's forecast of 538 pupils and calculated using the figures for other schools in the local authority. This excludes the extra money paid to cover for increased costs to replicate additional local authority central expenditure on services such as education welfare offices, HR and legal fees; and also a one-off start-up grant to cover items such as new uniforms and materials. These additional elements totalled &pound;1,531,269.</p>

	<p pid="d.1415W.2/12">The actual number of pupils at The Open Academy has been counted in the autumn term Schools Census but the data are not yet available.

	<p pid="d.1417W.2/4" class="indent">In 2008, Ofsted is carrying out a survey of creativity across the school curriculum and this involves a sample of primary and secondary schools. As of <phrase class="date" code="2008-11-05">5 November 2008</phrase>, 33 schools have been inspected. We intend to inspect a further 10 schools before inspection retrieval and analysis are undertaken and report writing begins. The intention is to publish the report in late summer 2009.</p>
	<p pid="d.1417W.2/5" class="indent">The focus of the survey is the impact of creative learning on the achievement and personal development of pupils. It will consider how schools assess the quality and development of creative learning across the curriculum.</p>
	<p pid="d.1417W.2/6" class="indent">A copy of this reply has been sent to Rt Hon Jim Knight MP, Minister of State for Schools and Learners and will be placed in the library of both Houses.</p>

Data published by the Department as SFR 23/2008: Children looked after in England (including adoption and care leavers) year ending <phrase class="date" code="2008-03-31">31 March 2008</phrase>, show 47,600 children aged between five and 19 as being looked after as at <phrase class="date" code="2008-03-31">31 March 2008</phrase>. The school census does not cover all looked after children; information is not collected for pupils in alternative provision, including pupil referral units, FE colleges, voluntary provision and those not in education or training. These differences in coverage will explain the different counts to an extent, but it is possible that the school census undercounts the number of looked after children in primary, secondary and special schools.</p>

	<p pid="d.1428W.0/18">The revenue per pupil figures shown in the following table are taken from the dedicated schools grant (DSG) which was introduced in April 2006. They are not comparable with those for the years 1997-98 to 2005-06 because the introduction of the DSG in 2006-07 fundamentally changed how local authorities are funded.</p>
	<p pid="d.1428W.0/19">The 1997-98 to 2005-06 figures are based on Education Formula Spending (EFS) which formed the education part of the Local Government Finance Settlement, plus various grants. This was an assessment of what local authorities needed to fund education rather than what they spent. The DSG is based largely on an authority's previous spending. In addition, the DSG has a different coverage to EFS. EFS comprised a schools block and an LEA block (to cover LEA central functions) whereas DSG only covers the school block. LEA block items are still funded through DCLG's Local Government Finance Settlement but education items cannot be separately identified. Consequently, there is a break in the Department's time series as the two sets of data are not comparable.</p>
	<p pid="d.1428W.0/20">To provide a comparison for 2006-07 DSG, the Department have isolated the schools block equivalent funding in 2005-06; as described above this does not represent the totality of 'education' funding in that year.</p>
	<p pid="d.1428W.0/21">The total and per pupil revenue funding figures for years 2005-06 to 2008-09 for Sefton local authority are provided in the following table. The following figures are for all funded pupils aged 3-19 and are in real terms:</p>

	<p pid="d.1434W.2/1">The Department relies on the accuracy of local authority forecasts when allocating basic need capital funding for additional pupil places. Accordingly, and to ensure that local authorities can plan strategically, the &pound;1.2 billion budget for basic need funding was allocated to London and other authorities at the beginning of the spending review period covering the years 2008-09 to 2010-11 . This can be used, at local authorities' discretion, to expand primary or secondary schools. In addition, the Department is allocating some &pound;1.9 billion to London and other authorities through its primary capital programme during this period, subject to local authorities agreeing their primary capital programmes for change with the Department.</p>
	<p pid="d.1434W.2/2">The Department does not hold back funds for later distribution on the basis that primary school pupil forecasts may be inaccurate. Accordingly, where new figures show that original forecasts were too low, local authorities have the flexibility to use their modernisation allocations to fund primary school expansion. They may also have access to other local resources.</p>

	<p pid="d.1434W.5/3" class="indent">Your recent parliamentary question has been passed to me, as Her Majesty's Chief Inspector, for a response.</p>
	<p pid="d.1434W.5/4" class="indent">Since the introduction of the current school inspection framework (section 5) in September 2005, routine school inspections have not included specific inspection of subjects. However, under this framework, a sample of lessons will be visited during each inspection and these may include history and geography.</p>
	<p pid="d.1434W.5/5" class="indent">As well as routine inspections of schools, Ofsted conducts annual surveys of each subject in the curriculum, inspecting a sample of schools to provide evidence for the survey report. This annual sample includes thirty primary schools where geography is inspected and thirty where history is inspected. Every three years Ofsted will then produce survey reports on history and geography. Most recently, &quot;Geography in schools &mdash; changing practice&quot; was published on <phrase class="date" code="2008-01-17">17 January 2008</phrase> and &quot;History in the balance&quot; was published on <phrase class="date" code="2007-07-20">20 July 2007</phrase>. Both are available on the Ofsted website <a href="http://www.ofsted.gov.uk">www.ofsted.gov.uk</a></p>

	<p pid="d.1436W.8/1">Our Every Child a Reader programme provides a 'layered' approach to early literacy intervention based on providing Reading Recovery teaching to the very lowest attaining children; supporting other adults to provide less intensive interventions for children whose difficulties are not so severe; and working with colleagues to support improved everyday class teaching of literacy. The less intensive interventions include Better Reading Partnership which trains, among others, volunteers to read 1-to-1 with children using techniques from Reading Recovery. These layers will apply equally to children who do not require Reading Recovery or those who have previously been through Reading Recovery and require some follow up support.</p>
	<p pid="d.1436W.8/2">In 2007, Greg Brooks, of Sheffield university, produced an updated version &quot;What Works for Children with Literacy Difficulties? The Effectiveness of Intervention Schemes&quot;. The review synthesised evidence on partnership approaches to improving reading: partners included older pupils, teachers, and adult volunteers. Brooks concluded that</p>
	<p pid="d.1436W.8/3" class="indent">&quot;where resources are limited, and partners are available and can be given appropriate training and ongoing support, reading partnership approaches deserve close consideration&quot; (p29).</p>
	<p pid="d.1436W.8/4">The interventions reviewed by Brooks which specifically used adult volunteers were Better Reading Partnerships, ENABLE One-To- One and Time for Reading. There was some evidence that these interventions had a positive effect on pupil outcomes, although in some cases the findings were more mixed, and it is important to remember that the interventions often involved components other than the adult volunteers, which makes it hard to identify the specific effect of the volunteers.</p>
	<p pid="d.1436W.8/5">Separate to this Torgerson, King and Sowden (2002) conducted a systematic review of randomised controlled trials of adult volunteer reading schemes. Overall, volunteering appeared to have a small positive effect on pupil outcomes, but the evidence base was not sufficient to draw firm conclusions.</p>
	<p pid="d.1436W.8/6">The Government are committed to ensuring every child learns to read. For most this will mean good systematic phonics through the early years and beginning of primary school. For others, extra provision will be necessary&mdash;primarily through school based interventions and our Every Child a Reader programme. We continue to fund local authorities and schools to strike the appropriate balance between specific intervention programmes with trained teachers for those children that need it; and other less expensive approaches using other members of the workforce and volunteers in other circumstances when they are known to work.</p>

	<p pid="d.1438W.5/1">Current policy on collective worship is set out in Circular 1/94. All maintained schools must provide a daily act of collective worship, for all registered pupils. In schools without a religious character, this must be wholly or mainly of a broadly Christian nature; while in schools with a religious character, collective worship may be in accordance with the tenets and practices of the religious designation of the school. This requirement was established in the Education Act 1944 and has been re-enacted in subsequent educational legislation. It is the duty of the head teacher to secure a daily act of collective worship. Duties are also placed on local authorities and governing bodies to exercise their functions with a view to securing the provision of collective worship.</p>
	<p pid="d.1438W.5/2">There are no requirements for further education establishments to hold a daily act of collective worship.</p>

The information supplied by Enfield indicated that it had built six new schools, four of which were additional schools, and had rebuilt over 50 per cent. of the floor area of a further three schools.</p>

	<p pid="d.1441W.3/1">All new school buildings must comply with the acoustic standards in Building Bulletin 93, &quot;Acoustic Design of Schools&quot;, 2003, which are quoted in Approved Document Part E in support of the Building Regulations. Building Control Bodies ensure that these standards are met. Section 6 of BB93 &quot;Acoustic design and equipment for pupils with special hearing requirements&quot; gives further guidance for children with hearing impairments. The Disability Discrimination Act 1995 requires local authorities and governing bodies to make reasonable adjustments to schools to cater for the special needs of particular children. Therefore, for any new school, the local authority or governing body must assess the expected level of special needs of the children who will be attending the school and determine if any adjustments to the BB93 standards are required. This may require consultation with educational audiologists and acousticians. In particular, a lower reverberation time may be needed in rooms where the hearing impaired are taught. There is a special needs appeal process and if the designs are not adequate for any particular children who will be attending the school then acoustic treatment may be required post construction.</p>

	<p pid="d.1441W.6/1">We expect all schools to offer access to extended services by 2010. Currently over 14,400 schools (65 per cent.) are providing access to extended services.</p>
	<p pid="d.1441W.6/2">Extended schools provide a range of services and activities, often beyond the school day, to help meet the needs of children, their families and the wider community. What extended service provision looks like in practice will vary according to the needs of each community, based on consultation by schools.</p>
	<p pid="d.1441W.6/3">Extended schools are working with their local authorities to open up their facilities including playing fields and sports facilities in response to an assessment of local demand.</p>
	<p pid="d.1441W.6/4">Local authorities are a major partner in helping and supporting extended schools to provide services and facilities, and will be able to help take a strategic view of local needs and gaps in provision. Working with their partners in Children's Trusts they have a critical role in coordinating, commissioning and brokering services, and championing the needs of children, young people and parents. They must ensure that local extended service provision is joined up and meets the needs of the local community</p>

	<p pid="d.1442W.2/1">Schools are well placed to contribute to road safety training and education by encouraging the development of risk assessment skills and of positive attitudes to road safety. Road safety is currently included in the non-statutory framework for personal, social, health and economic education (PSHE) at key stages 1 and 2, and at key stage 3 pupils should be taught &quot;to use knowledge and understanding to make informed choices about safety, health and well-being&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="d.1442W.2/2">The Department has asked head teacher Sir Alasdair Macdonald to conduct an independent review into how our intention to make PSHE education statutory can be taken forward in a practicable way.</p>

	<p pid="d.1449W.5/1">There has been no specific development work done on a general diploma. The 14-19 Education and Skills White Paper in 2005, envisaged introducing a general (GCSE) diploma to recognise the achievement of 5 A*-C GCSEs including English and mathematics. It was anticipated that this would be introduced for those starting GCSE programmes in September 2009.</p>
	<p pid="d.1449W.5/2">However, we anticipate that the expansion of the Diploma programme which was announced last October will offer a more comprehensive alternative to recognise the broad achievement of young people at that level.

	<p pid="d.1456W.2/1">Empowering all young people to have genuine influence over local activities is crucial to increasing their participation. The commitments in Aiming High for Young People are designed to support all young people but with extra focus for those who need it most, such as those with disabilities, so that all can participate in a meaningful way.</p>
	<p pid="d.1456W.2/2">Commitments include the continuation of the Youth Opportunity and Capital Funds, through which young people make decisions about new provision, until at least 2011. A recently published evaluation of the Funds over their first two years, 2006-08, concluded that local authorities had generally been successful in engaging young people with disabilities, both as decision makers and applicants.</p>
	<p pid="d.1456W.2/3">This drive to increase participation is being complemented by the transformation of short break provision signalled in Aiming High for Disabled Children. &pound;269 million is being provided by DCSF to local authorities in England over the 2008-11 period to improve radically access for children and young people to breaks&mdash;including those which promote personal and social development through positive activities.</p>

	<p pid="d.1458W.2/1">Estimated UK carbon dioxide emissions by year over this period are published as National Statistics. The latest year for which data are available is 2006.

	<p pid="d.1458W.2/2" class="indent"><i> (a)</i> Two breakdowns are published for each year: by source and by end-user. The former breakdown is based on the sector where the emissions actually occurred; the latter breakdown reallocates these same emissions in accordance with where the end-use actually occurred. This effectively re-allocates emissions from energy supply to, for example, household and business energy usage.</p>
	<p pid="d.1458W.2/3">The tables provide both breakdowns over the period in question, based on National Communications sectors, which are the basis for UK Government reporting.</p>

	<p pid="d.1458W.2/5">Emissions from international aviation and shipping can only be estimated from refuelling from bunkers at UK airports and ports, whether by UK or non-UK operators. These are recorded as memo items in the UK's Greenhouse Gas Inventory, as reported by DEFRA to the UNFCCC, but do not count towards national totals. This is because there is no agreement on how, or whether, to allocate emissions from these sources to individual countries.</p>

	<p pid="d.1465W.5/1">The Government's overall budget for the Energy Demand Research Project is &pound;9.75 million. The amount spent each year is not fixed but is dependent on the rate of progress of the project and claims for contributions from the participating energy suppliers. It is expected that expenditure on the project will end during the financial year 2010-11. The Government's contributions to participating suppliers are being matched by the suppliers, taking the overall budget for the project to over &pound;19.5 million.</p>

	<p pid="d.1469W.5/3">The supply of LPG is subject to UK competition law under the Competition Act 1998, and the appropriate bodies act to regulate the sector. As a result of concerns about competition in the market for domestic bulk LPG, the Office of Fair Trading (OFT) made a market investigation reference to the Competition Commission (CC) in July 2004. In June 2006 the CC published a report which stated that difficulties in switching supplier have inhibited competition. The CC has arrived at a package of remedies which is intended to make it easier to switch supplier, and will provide greater transparency of pricing, providing information on which consumers will be able to take this decision. It is expected that the increased ability of consumers to switch supplier will increase competition in the market and put downward pressure on prices.</p>

CERT doubles the previous level of obligation on energy suppliers which, together with the 20 per cent. increase in target announced by the Prime Minister on <phrase class="date" code="2008-09-11">11 September</phrase>, means a similar number of households will benefit from energy saving measures such as cavity wall insulation, loft insulation and tank insulation in the next three years.</p>

	<p pid="d.1478W.2/1">Energy from Waste (&quot;EfW&quot;) plants constructed since 2006 are Allington, Kent and Lakeside, Heathrow. Neither of these plants is fully commissioned.</p>
	<p pid="d.1478W.2/2">Detailed data concerning expected energy outputs from plants not yet completed are not available. Energy values will vary according to several parameters including the technology type and its associated energetic efficiency, waste quantity and waste calorific content. Not all of these can be forecast with precision.</p>
	<p pid="d.1478W.2/3">Energy from waste plants, with and without CHP capability, along with other non-combustion technologies are included on a list of known approved or pipeline waste projects applying for PFI credits. These projects are due for completion in the period 2011-15, subject to planning consent and the outcome of competitive procurement processes.</p>
	<p pid="d.1478W.2/4">Based on conservative average energy yields and expected waste tonnages it has been estimated that energy outputs from these could be in the region of 17-18 million GJ per year.</p>
	<p pid="d.1478W.2/5">There are currently four operating CHP plants in England. These are located at Sheffield, Coventry, Tyseley, and Isles of Scilly. All round four waste PFI projects where combustion is likely to be involved have been asked by DEFRA to include CHP proposals. The outline business cases for these projects are currently being assessed.</p>

	<p pid="d.1478W.5/1">We do not hold information on this because decisions on whether plant remains operational are made by individual generators&mdash;factors such as operational costs, fuel costs, availability, electricity prices and overall supply and demand are likely to influence those decisions.</p>
	<p pid="d.1478W.5/2">There is no direct relationship between the opening of a new power station and the closure of existing power stations, but each megawatt of electricity generated from renewable sources reduces an equal amount of generation from conventional sources.</p>
	<p pid="d.1478W.5/3">It is Government policy to increase the deployment of renewable energy&mdash;including wind power&mdash;as part of our energy mix, in order to meet the twin challenges of climate change and security of supply. We will still need to maintain sufficient backup generation from conventional sources in order to maintain network reliability.</p>
