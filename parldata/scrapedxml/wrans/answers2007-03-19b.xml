However, I have asked the Highways Agency to continue to progress the orders on a timetable that would keep open the possibilities of building M1 J11a early and accelerating the whole of the link road, should the necessary resources become available at an earlier stage.</p>

Also, the current estimate has taken into account further work by the contractor on survey, design and buildability.</p>

Performance since then has been an operational matter for London Underground who are best placed to answer direct. London Underground does not record investment broken down by lines. However the total figures to 2002-03 are shown in the following table. In April 2000, London Underground adopted new accounting treatment for its investment expenditure which removed the category 'investment renewals': the majority of this expenditure was reclassified as capital, although some (&pound;90 million) became resource expenditure. Therefore the figures before and after April 2000 are not directly comparable and are presented in two separate tables with the years 1990-91 to 1999-2000 on one consistent basis and those for a restated 1999-2000 to 2005-06 are on another. It is normal accounting practice when a change in accounting treatment occurs to restate the previous year's figures on the same basis in the accounts, so that a true comparison can be made.</p>

	<p pid="b.582W.0/1">In 2005, the latest year for which comprehensive data are currently available, a total of around 209,000 hectares was estimated to be used in England for crops purpose-grown for use as industrial materials and bio-energy. Of this total, oilseed rape for biofuel use accounted for nearly 93,000 hectares. This figure relates only to plantings under the Energy Aid Scheme as the end-use for crops not receiving this aid is not known. Energy crops for use in the generation of heat and electricity accounted for around 600 hectares. Plantings of energy crops have increased significantly since 2005, with over 4,500 hectares now in the ground. Biomass also comes from non purpose-grown sources such as straw and woodfuel from forestry operations.</p>
	<p pid="b.582W.0/2">To meet the 5 per cent. transport biofuel target entirely from UK sources would require between 1 to 1.5 million hectares of crops. However, we anticipate that biofuels in the UK will come from a mixture of home-grown and imported crops, recycled vegetable oils and tallow. In the longer term, as technology improves, straw and wood could be used for bioethanol production, so reducing pressure on land.</p>

	<p pid="b.582W.3/2">The main crops which can be grown in England to produce biofuels are oilseed rape, wheat and sugar beet, however we have not carried out research into the availability or suitability of land for growing these crops at county level.</p>
	<p pid="b.582W.3/3">In Cumbria, based on the June 2005 Agriculture and Horticulture Census for England, the Region, Counties/Unitary Authorities, approximately 471 hectares of oilseed rape and 5,855 hectares of wheat were grown. Some sugar beet was also grown, however, in order to protect the identity of individual holdings, detailed figures are not included. The survey does not provide information on end use, so it is not possible to determine what proportion of these crops may have been grown for biofuel production.</p>

	<p pid="b.583W.0/2">The Business Resource Efficiency and Waste (BREW) Programme is returning &pound;284 million raised from the landfill tax escalator back to business between 2005 and 2008 to improve their resource efficiency and to minimise the levels of waste that are unnecessarily sent to landfill. A Steering Group, consisting of various interested organisations including businesses, advises on the development of the programme.</p>
	<p pid="b.583W.0/3">The Programme provides assistance to all business sectors in England. Funding must provide a potential benefit to those sectors paying landfill tax and, where possible, address those sectors most affected by landfill tax increases. However, information on the sectoral uptake of assistance by English businesses is not stored centrally.</p>
	<p pid="b.583W.0/4">Evaluation results for 2005-06, which are conservative, indicate that BREW saved businesses nearly &pound;88 million and increased their sales by over &pound;14 million. There were also reductions in water use, waste sent to landfill and the amounts of raw materials used by businesses. Many of the benefits will be seen beyond 2005-06. Work is currently under way to assess the impact of Programme spending in the current year, 2006-07.</p>

	<p pid="b.584W.3/1">Figures published by the Department show that total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions fell by 3.1 million tonnes of carbon dioxide (CO2) equivalents between 2004-05. CO2 emissions fell by 0.4 million tonnes during this period, that is, 0.1 million tonnes Carbon (MtC). Savings by individual end-use sectors are not yet available but DEFRA hopes to publish details later this month.</p>
	<p pid="b.584W.3/2">2005 was the first year of the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS). Under the EU ETS, UK companies are able to buy emissions allowances from other EU countries. Purchase of these allowances is to be taken into account when determining whether the Kyoto target and 2010 domestic goal have been met.</p>
	<p pid="b.584W.3/3">UK installations covered by the scheme emitted 242 million tonnes of CO2 in 2005, which was 27 million tonnes more than their allocations for that year. The electricity supply industry emitted 36.5 million tonnes more than its allocation; other sectors emitted 9.5 million tonnes less. Adjusted for emissions trading, UK CO2 emissions in 2005 were about 527 million tonnes&mdash;approximately 11 per cent. lower than 1990 levels.</p>
	<p pid="b.584W.3/4">Projections of emissions, and hence savings, are not provided on a year by year basis, but at five-yearly intervals. Furthermore, projections are made only for the whole of the public sector, not for individual parts. Using the latest published figures (UK climate change programme 2006) for actual 2004 emissions and for projected emissions for 2010 (The Energy Challenge, Annex H&mdash;which updated those used in the above climate change programme), projected savings in 2010 relative to 1990 for these sectors are:</p>
	<p pid="b.584W.3/5" class="indent">Households&mdash;22.0 MtCO2 (6.0 MtC)</p>
	<p pid="b.584W.3/6" class="indent">Business&mdash;37.9 MtCO2 (10.35 MtC)</p>
	<p pid="b.584W.3/7" class="indent">Public sector&mdash;7.5 MtCO2 (2.05 MtC)</p>
	<p pid="b.584W.3/8">DEFRA will publish an updated appraisal of the impact of policies and measures included in the 2006 climate change programme later this year. This report will look at the progress of individual policies and measures, and provide a revised projection, if necessary, of the projected saving each policy and measure will deliver in 2010, based on latest available information.</p>

	<p pid="b.586W.2/1">A Regulatory Impact Assessment carried out before the introduction of the Detergents Regulations 2005 estimated that the total one-off compliance costs would be between &pound;8.4 million and &pound;14 million based on compliance testing of 2,800 surfactants. Given the long lead in for these regulations, the costs of additional labelling requirements fell within normal business running costs which were assisted by a six month transition period after the regulations came into force.</p>
	<p pid="b.586W.2/2">As there is relatively little industry development of new surfactants for use in the detergents industry, recurring compliance testing costs are nominal. There are no one-off or recurring administrative costs and no costs to the regulators. These regulations ensure that detergents degrade quickly ensuring high standards of environmental protection.</p>

To calculate emissions from the Naval shipping industry one would have to look at such things as the steel and other materials used, the electricity used etc. and work out what the carbon cost of those are. The UK Greenhouse Gas Emissions Inventory, which is required by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, does not collect emissions data on this basis.</p>

	<p pid="b.590W.6/7">It should also be noted that the differences between assessments are almost entirely due to changes in data and analysis techniques as opposed to the actual flood risk, for example the number of properties within the floodplain for which no result is available has fallen dramatically from 265,000 in 2004 to 28,000 in 2006. This represents an improvement in the analysis but leads to a commensurate increase in the number of properties in each risk band</p>

Further details can be found at <a href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/environ/fcd/policy/strategy/ha2.htm">http://www.defra.gov.uk/environ/fcd/policy/strategy/ha2.htm</a> The projects, made possible by &pound;1.7 million of funding from DEFRA, will test new approaches to reduce the risk of urban drainage flooding, both from sewers and stormwater.</p>
	<p pid="b.592W.2/2">While the pilot projects will not directly fund capital improvements, they should bring greater clarity on responsibilities for funding urban drainage management between water companies, local authorities, the Environment Agency, Internal Drainage Boards and the Highways Agency. Following completion of the pilot projects in spring 2008, DEFRA will produce new guidance on effective partnership working to deliver integrated drainage solutions in high risk urban catchments and prepare a regulatory impact assessment for any proposed legislative changes.</p>

	<p pid="b.594W.2/1">DEFRA recognises that reed beds can usefully form part of Sustainable Drainage Systems (SUDS) and part of the process for treating foul sewage.</p>
	<p pid="b.594W.2/2">DEFRA is working closely with Communities and Local Government (CLG) in the development of surface water management planning as part of revised Planning Policy Statement (PPS) 25. The production of surface water management plans is being trialled by some of the partnerships within DEFRA's Integrated Urban Drainage Pilot Projects. The 15 pilots across England, made possible by &pound;1.7 million of funding from DEFRA, will test new approaches to reduce the risk of urban drainage flooding.</p>
	<p pid="b.594W.2/3">DEFRA is a key member of the National SUDS Working Group (NSWG), of which representatives of water companies, Water UK, the Local Government Association, the Environment Agency, developers and other organisations such as CABE are also members. DEFRA has a current work stream to examine options for resolving the combined issue of SUDS adoption, maintenance and funding and has recently consulted with the NSWG on this matter. We expect to carry out wider consultation in this regard later this year.</p>
	<p pid="b.594W.2/4">In respect of foul sewage treatment, the owner/operator of a sewage treatment plant is required to comply with the relevant discharge consent. The appropriate process and techniques for achieving compliance vary from location to location and are essentially decided by the owner/operator of the treatment works. Reed beds are acknowledged to be a suitable technology and are used in many situations, including at works managed by water companies (instead of, or in addition to other processes). As we look at making development more sustainable, by reducing carbon inputs, reed beds may be one of the techniques that facilitate this.</p>

Neither the Council of Ministers nor the Commission exercises Community competence over whaling issues and there is no common EU line on whaling matters. Not all EU member states are even members of the International Whaling Commission. As such, negotiations with third countries on fisheries and trade matters are unaffected by those countries' stance on whaling. While the European Commission joined the recent demarche against Iceland over its resumption of commercial whaling, it did so on its own behalf, rather than on behalf of member states.</p>

	<p pid="b.595W.7/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="b.595W.7/2">The UK is spending &pound;270 million over three years to support the Government of Afghanistan's (GoA) National Drug Control Strategy. We have helped the GoA create a Counter Narcotics Trust Fund to mobilise international donor support and develop Afghan counter narcotics planning and capacity. DFID plays a key role by promoting alternative, legal livelihoods to help revitalise the Afghan economy. Legal livelihoods can be regulated and taxed by the government, and form the basis for long-term, sustainable economic growth. DFID's Livelihoods Programme, worth nearly &pound;150 million between 2006-09, is supporting GoA National Priority Programmes to develop legal livelihood opportunities as alternatives to poppy farming. Examples include our &pound;18 million support for the National Rural Access Programme (NRAP) and our &pound;20 million contribution over three years to the Micro-finance Investment Support Facility of Afghanistan (MISFA). NRAP has built essential infrastructure such as roads, bridges and irrigation schemes, and has generated over 15 million days of labour for Afghans. MISFA has so far provided small loans to over 230,000 Afghan families. This has enabled poor people who would otherwise not have access to credit to successfully invest in income-generating activities.</p>
	<p pid="b.595W.7/3">DFID is also contributing &pound;9 million to the GoA to help boost legal private sector activity by reducing red tape and improving the business environment, and supporting the mining sector and encouraging foreign investment. Of this, &pound;1 million has been channelled through a World Bank-managed Trust Fund which provides risk guarantees to attract foreign investors. In the past year, this Trust Fund has supported three projects which are expected to trigger over $26 million of investment, stimulate the cotton and pharmaceutical sector, and expand access to credit. This will help to further enhance private sector opportunities and revitalise the legal Afghan economy.</p>

We are providing &pound;30 million over three years to the Helmand Agriculture and Rural Development Programme (HARDP), from 2006 to 2009. This programme is increasing alternative livelihood opportunities for the rural poor of Helmand by supporting the Government of Afghanistan's implementation of its National Priority Programmes. These include the National Solidarity Programme, National Rural Access Programme, Micro-Finance Investment and Support Facility in Afghanistan, and Water and Sanitation Programme. They are providing longer-term improvements in water and sanitation, essential small-scale rural infrastructure, and access to small loans, as well as improved roads, access to markets, agricultural inputs and training.</p>
	<p pid="b.596W.2/3">DFID is also funding the &pound;3 million Research into Alternative Livelihoods Fund (RALF). This supports work on alternative livelihoods in Helmand, for example through the Restorative Agriculture and Rural Economy Research Project, which explores the export feasibility of numerous crops including grapes, tomatoes, mushrooms, eggplants and okra. The project is evaluating different small-scale agri-processing industries, and producing case studies of value-added alternative livelihood options, for example tomato paste.</p>
	<p pid="b.596W.2/4">We are funding 114 Quick Impact Projects (QIPs) in Helmand. These are not all alternative livelihoods projects, but they do support a range of income-generating activities for poor people. These include furniture-making, construction, carpet-weaving and the provision of tractors for farming.</p>

	<p pid="b.603W.5/1">UK service personnel will characteristically take part in a wide range of physical activities during the course of their service. These will include not only supervised activities related to their training, but also many unsupervised physical activities, physical training and sport undertaken at their own volition. For this reason, it is often not possible to attribute with confidence a specific chronic overuse injury to any single, supervised, physical training activity.</p>
	<p pid="b.603W.5/2">However, the nature and occurrence of the most common lower limb injuries (LLI) have formed the focus for many research papers, and LLI have been shown to be common to military populations throughout NATO. When all factors have been considered, the single most commonly-cited physical activity during which the majority of overuse lower limb injuries have been reported is running.</p>
	<p pid="b.603W.5/3">MOD undertakes research to understand the underlying factors which may explain the relatively high incidence (compared with age and gender-matched, non-military populations) of LLIs among service personnel. Research has been conducted (both by the UK and throughout NATO) on a regular basis since the 1970s. Recent research funded by MOD's Human Capability scientific research programme has included studies of the pathogenesis of stress fractures; bone health; musculoskeletal injuries; and a Physical Training shoe project.</p>

	<p pid="b.605W.8/1">A free packet scheme was first introduced on <phrase class="date" code="2003-04-17">17 April 2003</phrase>, as a temporary measure unique to Iraq, at a time when service personnel did not have access to the welfare facilities that are now available in both Iraq and Afghanistan.

	<p pid="b.614W.3/10">Looking forward, the Government of Afghanistan has committed to approving a comprehensive land policy by April 2007. This will provide guidance on dealing with crucial issues such as land grabbing, informal development, and the allocation and management of land. The Government has also committed to drafting the legislation needed to clarify and then improve the land tenure security of urban residents by April 2007. Finally, the Government has renewed its commitment to reform the system for settlement of land disputes, and improve registration of rural land by the end of 2007.</p>

	<p pid="b.615W.5/1">As part of its commitment to promoting good governance, DFID works to strengthen the parliaments of developing countries. What we do is different in different countries, depending on our assessment of what the priorities are. In some places we will focus more on the legislative function of parliaments, for instance, while in others our efforts will be channelled more towards strengthening oversight of the executive.</p>
	<p pid="b.615W.5/2">Representation is of course a core function of parliaments everywhere, and DFID recognises that a representative parliament has a head start on this.</p>
	<p pid="b.615W.5/3">One of the initiatives DFID has supported recently to improve representativeness is the High Level Committee on Reservations which has developed recommendations for affirmative action for women and dalits in the political structures of Nepal. Another group we have supported is the Forum des Femmes Rwandaises Parliamentaires (FFRP). The FFRP comprises all the women members of the Rwandan Parliament&mdash;and at 48.8 per cent. Rwanda has the highest female representation in the world. Our most recent support to the FFRP funded a conference on 22 and <phrase class="date" code="2007-02-23">23 February</phrase> that celebrated the progress made towards gender equality in Rwanda. It also produced the &quot;Kigali Declaration&quot;, that will add vitality to the efforts of other African countries to get more women into Parliament&mdash;following Rwanda's example.</p>
	<p pid="b.615W.5/4">As we increase our focus on accountable, responsive governance, DFID will support more groups like Nepal's Reservations Committee and the FFRP&mdash;not only to get disadvantaged groups into parliaments, but to ensure they function effectively once there.</p>

	<p pid="b.617W.3/1">At a global level the World Bank Institute estimates that US$1 trillion plus or minus 40 per cent. is paid in bribes every year, representing 3 per cent. of the world's gross domestic product. No firm estimates exist on how this issue affects UK business specifically. The obstacles to measuring corruption scientifically have led to the measurement of perceptions.</p>
	<p pid="b.617W.3/2">Transparency International's Bribe-payers Index (BPI) aims to evaluate the supply side of corruption by asking business experts in emerging economies for their impressions of the likelihood that companies from the listed countries pay or offer bribes in their business activities. The highest ranked country is the one whose companies are seen as least likely to pay bribes. The UK is ranked 6<sup>(th)</sup> out of 30 countries, the 2<sup>(nd)</sup> G7 country and 3<sup>(rd )</sup>EU country in the table. But the UK is not complacent because, as the UK White Paper on Eliminating World Poverty recognises, 'Corruption undermines the accountability of political leaders and officials to their citizens. When politicians are 'bought' by powerful people or businesses through bribery, or when leaders themselves use personal or public funds to buy support, they become representatives of the few and not the many. In short, corruption is both a cause and a symptom of bad governance.' Any such impact will undermine work to promote good governance and reduce poverty in developing countries.</p>

	<p pid="b.618W.5/13">Where developing country Governments do not have the capacity to provide good quality infrastructure and services for their people, PPIAF helps them to develop sound policies, regulations and institutions. PPIAF does this by providing developing country Governments with technical assistance which they can use to tap the full potential of public private partnerships in infrastructure. PPIAF also identifies, communicates and promotes best practice on matters relating to public private partnerships in infrastructure. It is also recognised as a leading resource for training and best practice in the role of public private partnerships in infrastructure service delivery.</p>
	<p pid="b.618W.5/14">There are may examples of PPIAF's success. For example Kenya PPIAF provided technical assistance and training to enable micro-credit banks to lend to small water providers to provide clean water to rural and semi-urban communities. This has led to 21 micro-credit investments and an output based grant which will result in 60,000 people gaining access to clean water.</p>
	<p pid="b.618W.5/15">Also in Ghana, PPIAF supported the Ghana Community Water and Sanitation Agency with regulatory and legal reform to improve small town water services. This has allowed local water operators to provide clean water to communities for the first time. Communities themselves were involved in the selection of the water providers. This has been successfully implemented in three towns and will be extended to 300 small towns across the country.</p>
	<p pid="b.618W.5/16">After the war in 2002, the Government of Afghanistan recognised that they needed to expand telecommunications access and improve service delivery. They encouraged private mobile phone operators into their market, and asked the PPIAF to help them develop the initial regulatory framework and build the Government's own capacity and understanding of technical, commercial and regulatory issues. Today, where once there were only two telephones for every 1,000 people, there are now more than 1 million mobile phone subscribers with national and global access, and prices have declined by 70 per cent. through competition. This allows a journalist in Kabul to host a phone-in radio programme providing counselling to women, and helps small scale businesses like carpet merchants, brick sellers and mechanics to manage their businesses effectively and successfully.</p>
	<p pid="b.618W.5/17">An independent strategic review of PPIAF in 2004 and internal DFID reviews have concluded that PPIAF is successful in what it does. Specifically, it has helped developing country Governments' capacity to improve their policies, laws, regulations and procedures that have resulted in better infrastructure and better services for their people. The PPIAF has also been recognised as a centre of excellence for advice to developing countries on public private partnerships, and there is high demand for PPIAF's services.</p>
	<p pid="b.618W.5/18">Further information about the PPIAF and its successes can be found in the document entitled 'Public Private Infrastructure Advisory Facility (PPIAF): Helping developing countries to eliminate poverty and achieve sustainable development through Public-Private Partnerships in Infrastructure', copies of which have been placed in the Libraries of the House.</p>

Individuals who require a work permit may be employed in the civil service, but only in exceptional circumstances. Under TUPE terms staff from the 42 former Magistrates Courts Committees, each of which has separate terms and conditions, are exempt from civil service nationality rules. Information on how many work permits have been applied for in each of the last five years is not held centrally.

	<p pid="b.625W.5/2">In the UK, over 99.9 per cent. of households are connected to a broadband enabled exchange.</p>
	<p pid="b.625W.5/3">However, not all of these households will necessarily be able to get broadband and there are two main reasons for this:</p>
	<p pid="b.625W.5/4" class="indent">1. there could be fibre in the network between the exchange and the household</p>
	<p pid="b.625W.5/5" class="indent">2. the telephone line could be too long to support broadband.</p>
	<p pid="b.625W.5/6">It is difficult to be precise about the number of UK households that are able to receive a broadband service over the telephone line, but the figure of 99 per cent. probably represents a lower bound.</p>
	<p pid="b.625W.5/7">It is not possible to provide data of this sort at a more local level.</p>
	<p pid="b.625W.5/8">The definition of broadband that Ofcom uses in its economic market assessments is that it must have the following three characteristics:</p>
	<p pid="b.625W.5/9" class="indent">the service is always on, i.e. no dial up is required. This feature allows the user to maintain a permanent connection to the network so allowing real-time delivery of services such as email;</p>
	<p pid="b.625W.5/10" class="indent">it is possible to use both voice and data services simultaneously, whether they are provided together, for example over the same access route, or separately, perhaps using more than one access route; and</p>
	<p pid="b.625W.5/11" class="indent">it has a faster downstream speed than a dial-up connection (essentially &gt;128kbit/s).</p>

	<p pid="b.626W.0/1">While BT has rolled out broadband to over 99 per cent. of UK households, cable and Local Loop Unbundling operators have so far only rolled out broadband in certain parts of the UK. Thus, different areas in the UK are supplied by a different 'mix' of wholesale providers. The latest figures available to Ofcom are as follows:</p>
	<p pid="b.626W.0/2" class="indent">Percentage of UK households with only one (BT) wholesale broadband provider&mdash;42 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="b.626W.0/3" class="indent">Percentage of UK households with only two wholesale broadband providers&mdash;12 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="b.626W.0/4" class="indent">Percentage of UK households with only three wholesale broadband providers&mdash;7 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="b.626W.0/5" class="indent">Percentage of UK households with four or more wholesale broadband providers&mdash;37 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="b.626W.0/6">It should be noted that broadband rollout, particularly based on LLU, is currently ongoing and therefore the coverage numbers presented here should be seen as a snap shot in time. This is a dynamic market and it is likely to look very different in a year from now.</p>

	<p pid="b.628W.12/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="b.628W.12/2" class="indent">(i) The cost to business of implementing the Control of Substances Hazardous to Health (Amendment) Regulations 2004 was estimated to be &pound;29 million over 10 years with an additional &pound;16.2 million to &pound;69 million one-off costs in the first year of compliance.</p>

While total benefits could not be quantified, the value of the expected reduction in allergic contact dermatitis because of chromium VI restrictions was estimated at &pound;18 million to &pound;53 million over 10 years.</p>
	<p pid="b.628W.12/4" class="indent">(ii) Costs to the health and safety regulators were not quantified but were considered to be small, with the majority of costs being incurred in the development of guidance and being balanced out by savings in enforcement. The information in this reply was drawn from the final Regulatory Impact Assessment for the legislation that is available in the Library or on the HSE website at <a href="http://www.hse.gov.uk/ria/index.htm">http://www.hse.gov.uk/ria/index.htm</a></p>
	<p pid="b.628W.12/5">The Government and the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) are committed to meeting the Better Regulations challenge. HSE is constantly reviewing what can be done better to ensure that the right balance is struck between protecting people at work and avoiding unnecessary burdens on business. Reviewing and improving the guidance to help employers comply with COSHH is one of the aims in HSE's simplification plan.</p>

	<p pid="b.637W.0/1">The renewables obligation (RO) was introduced in 2002 to replace the previous support scheme, the Non Fossil Fuels Obligation (NFFO), which was a form of a feed in tariff. It was introduced as a means of encouraging greater deployment of renewables, providing investor confidence, and increasing value for money for the consumer. A review of the RO, carried out in 2005-06, confirmed that the RO was a more successful mechanism. Since its introduction eligible renewable electricity generated under the scheme has increased to 4.0 per cent of total electricity sales to UK consumers in 2005 up from 1.8 per cent. in 2002, compared with an increase under the NFFO from 0.2 per cent. of electricity sales in 1992 to 1.8 per cent. in 2002.</p>

	<p pid="b.642W.2/1">Between them, the mandatory new deal programmes have been successful in helping more than 965,000 people into work. New deal streamlining measures were announced in the Chancellor's 2003 budget statement. Spending on both new deal for young people and new deal 25-plus decreased partly because of these changes, which started in 2004-05 but were more fully implemented in 2005-06. The most substantial change was to reduce the minimum period of time participants would spend on the options stage of the programme from 26 to 13 weeks.</p>
	<p pid="b.642W.2/2">Evidence indicates that two thirds of all mandatory new deal job outcomes occur before the options stage, and most outcomes that do occur during options are achieved during the first 13 weeks. The programmes continue to ensure that participants who need additional help to get into work receive it, for example by spending more than 13 weeks on the options stage of the programme.</p>
	<p pid="b.642W.2/3">Budgeted expenditure for 2006-07 is &pound;225 million for new deal for young people and &pound;157 million for new deal 25-plus.</p>

	<p pid="b.647W.3/3" class="indent">The Secretary of State has asked me to reply to your questions asking whether there are targets in place for the length of time taken to process an application to the Social Fund via the Social Fund hotline, for the length of time taken to process an application for a community care grant, and whether applications made to the Social Fund can be fast tracked under exceptional circumstances. This is something which falls within the responsibilities delegated to me as Chief Executive of Jobcentre Plus.</p>
	<p pid="b.647W.3/4" class="indent">Jobcentre Plus has a number of targets that are agreed with the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, supported by a suite of Key Management Indicators (KMI) that set the expected standards of delivery.</p>

Where the application is for living expenses however this must, wherever possible, be dealt with on the day that the application is made. For Community Care Grants, the KMI specifies that applications be processed within an actual average clearance time of nine days.</p>
	<p pid="b.647W.3/6" class="indent">All applications to the Social Fund are dealt with as quickly as possible.

	<p pid="b.655W.5/1">My Department has allocated &pound;47.2 million to local authorities to help them tackle and prevent homelessness in their area for 2007-08. They may choose to use a proportion of this money to fund Sanctuary Schemes. However work in the London borough of Barnet has shown that in one year the installation of 40 sanctuaries, which cost approximately &pound;68,000, led to an estimated saving of approximately &pound;600,000. We anticipate significant savings for local authorities on this basis, due to the reduction in costs associated with homelessness within communities.</p>

	<p pid="b.655W.8/1">The Regional Spatial Strategy (RSS) provides the long term spatial planning framework for a region for a 15 to 20 year period, with the objective of contributing to the achievement of sustainable development. In considering climate change and the long term sustainability of development, the costs of flood defences are taken into account alongside other matters, including the availability of resources.</p>
	<p pid="b.655W.8/2">We have recently consulted on a draft Planning Policy Statement (PPS) 'Planning and Climate Change'. This sets out our proposals on how planning should contribute to stabilising climate change and take into account the unavoidable consequences. Regional Planning Bodies will be expected to prepare and deliver RSSs for their regions that secure new development and shape places resilient to the effects of climate change in ways consistent with social cohesion and inclusion. These RSSs should be informed by sustainability appraisals which integrate social, environmental and economic considerations from the start of the plan-making process.</p>
	<p pid="b.655W.8/3">Regions will be expected to consider their vulnerability to climate change; the desirability of avoiding new development in those areas with likely increased vulnerability to climate change, particularly where it is not viable to manage likely risks through suitable measures to provide resilience; and, bring forward adaptation options for existing development in likely vulnerable areas.</p>
	<p pid="b.655W.8/4">The draft PPS builds on our policies in PPS25 'Development and Flood Risk' which sets out the detailed considerations applicable to taking flood risk into account in determining strategic planning considerations in the RSS for a region.</p>

However, the Advisory Council of Misuse of Drugs in their report 'Hidden Harm' estimated that in the UK there were between 250,000 and 350,000 children of problem drug users in 2003. Since the publication of that report changes have been made to several monitoring systems to improve the information available, which will allow us to produce an updated estimate in the future. In particular the core dataset for the National Drug Treatment Monitoring System for England was updated from April 2006 and all treatment service providers are now required to record information on whether users in treatment have dependent children and whether the child(ren) are living with the person in treatment or with others.</p>

Its aim is to minimise the availability of potentially illegal internet content, specifically child abuse images hosted anywhere in the world; criminally obscene content hosted in the UK; and incitement to racial hatred content hosted in the UK.

Where the industry is advised that content it hosts contravenes UK legislation, it will remove it. In addition, internet service providers (ISPs) also have contracts with their customers concerning what may be hosted on their servers called acceptable use policies (AUPs), which allow them to remove offensive or objectionable material, even if it is not illegal. Anyone concerned about the contents of a website should approach the relevant ISP hosting the site and ask it to consider whether it breaches its AUP.</p>

	<p pid="b.673W.0/1">Under the provisions for police injury benefits, which are not dependent on pension scheme membership, a special or augmented pension of up to half the officer's pensionable pay is payable to a surviving spouse or civil partner where the officer dies as a result of an injury received without their own default in the execution of their duty as a constable. Under the Police Pension Scheme 1987 (old scheme) an ordinary pension of up to one third the officer's pensionable pay is payable to a surviving spouse or civil partner where the officer dies in service, whether or not they were on duty at the time.</p>
	<p pid="b.673W.0/2">Police pensions and police injury benefits are administrated locally by the police authority for the force concerned and details of the number of surviving spouses and civil partners of officers who died while on duty and of the cost of their pensions are not held centrally. However, it is estimated that in the region of 400 surviving spouses are in receipt of a special or augmented pension in the UK. About half of this number are in respect of police officers who died in Northern Ireland. No separate estimate has been made of the number of surviving civil partners in receipt of such a pension but the estimate given for spouses can still be taken to include civil partners in view of the relatively short time since the start of civil partnerships.</p>
	<p pid="b.673W.0/3">The Government Actuary's Department has estimated that the capitalised extra cost of making these pensions life-long to be between &pound;10 million and &pound;20 million. This estimate is indicative only since it is subject to a considerable degree of uncertainty. The capital cost would manifest itself in additional cash expenditure over a period of decades peaking in 10 to 20 years' time. This cost only relates to survivor pensions currently in payment. There would also be additional costs relating to pensions to spouses and civil partners of police officers who die in the future as result of an injury received in the execution of their duty. The cost does not include the reinstatement of any pension that has already ceased on remarriage, formation of a civil partnership or cohabitation, or the backdating of any such restored pension.</p>
	<p pid="b.673W.0/4">The Government Actuary's Department has also estimated the capitalised extra cost of making all survivor pensions life-long where they are payable upon an officer's death in service (i.e. ordinary pensions as well as special and augmented pensions) to be between &pound;50 million to &pound;100 million.</p>

	<p pid="b.679W.3/2">These data are not held in the form specified. The data collected measure those who complete all elements required of the particular framework undertaken. However, since 2001 separately assessed underpinning knowledge has been a compulsory part of apprenticeship frameworks. Up to 2005 this had to take the form of a technical certificate, even where there was duplication of content between qualifications. Therefore all apprentices completing in this period would have passed a technical certificate in order to complete the full framework. Since 2005 and following consultation, sector bodies have had the flexibility to deliver underpinning knowledge through an NVQ where it can be demonstrated to the Apprenticeship Approvals Group that this will remove duplication. So far the two major frameworks to integrate underpinning knowledge into the NVQ are in accountancy and hairdressing. Most of their learners will not yet have completed under the new arrangements.</p>

In light of this the Department has considered and reviewed all the HR policies and processes that were in place prior to the implementation of the Employment Equality (Age) Regulations 2006. That review led to us introducing, from <phrase class="date" code="2006-10-01">1 October 2006</phrase>, a policy where we have no maximum retirement age for people outside the senior civil service, and procedures where there is no mention of a date of birth on applications, for example, for recruitment or promotion.</p>

	<p pid="b.686W.2/1">The Department spent &pound;42,000 on <i> The Guardian</i> Supplement covering the 14 to 19 reform programme. The 14 to 19 reforms will impact on a range of stakeholders and through the supplement we were able to inform head teachers, teachers and lecturers in schools and colleges, HE professionals, and the wider public about the reforms. We believe that this is good value for money as we were able to reach a large section of our target audience. As the 14 to 19 programme will require schools and colleges to collaborate in the future, and teaching of the diplomas will start from September 2008 we increasingly need to inform our target audiences about the reforms and the impact that they will have on them. We will therefore continue to promote the 14 to 19 reform programme across a range of news media over the next few months.</p>
	<p pid="b.686W.2/2">Although civil servants within the 14 to 19 reform group briefed <i> The Guardian</i> on the 14 to 19 reforms, the content of the supplement was written by<i> Guardian</i> journalists. As with most supplements of this nature officials from within the Department and across our partners were given the opportunity to correct factual errors within the final document. Final editorial control for the article was retained by <i> The Guardian</i>.</p>

Children's development at age five is measured by the Foundation Stage Profile which replaced statutory baseline assessment on entry to primary school. This involves a continuous observational assessment during the academic year in which a child reaches the age of five. There are no pass or fail marks but, for the purposes of the national PSA target on improving young children's outcomes, a 'good level of development' at the Foundation Stage is defined as achieving a score of at least six points on a Foundation Stage Profile Scale. A child achieving a good level of development can be deemed to be 'working securely' within the Early Learning Goals.</p>

	<p pid="b.696W.9/21">Care should be exercised in comparing the results year on year. Assessment against the Foundation Stage Profile is not yet universally well established and ongoing improvements in assessment and moderation have contributed to a general downward shift in the scores, including the percentage of children working securely within the Early Learning Goals. The downward shift is apparent across most authorities but to varying degrees. While the downward shift in the figures between 2005 and 2006 reflects these improvements to moderation and assessment, the precise extent of the impact is uncertain. While many local authorities may now have settled in respect of assessment, it is possible that there will be further impact in some authorities for some time although the effects on the results are likely to reduce over time as the survey becomes more embedded.</p>
	<p pid="b.696W.9/22">The latest national figures on the Foundation Stage Profile for 2006 were published in a Statistical First Release 'Foundation Stage Profile 2006 (03/2007)' in January.

	<p pid="b.699W.8/2">The Government are committed to extending the early education entitlement to 15 hours free provision that can be taken more flexibly. This extension will be rolled-out nationally from 2007, starting in 20 pathfinder local authorities. To enable the funding system to support the extended entitlement, the Schools, Early Years and 14-16 consultation document sets out a range of potential changes that could be made to the early years funding system at local level. These options are designed to bring the funding systems for maintained and private, voluntary and independent provision into closer alignment, enabling local authorities to respond to parental demand for more flexible early years provision. The consultation also invites views on proposals to increase the role and effectiveness of the early years sector in local decision making on funding issues.</p>
	<p pid="b.699W.8/3">Decisions on the funding arrangements for 2008-11 will be taken in summer 2007 in the light of responses to the consultation and the outcome of the Comprehensive Spending Review 2007.</p>

This is because local authorities, voluntary aided organisations, and individual schools are responsible for fire prevention and for taking out appropriate fire insurance. The Department expects financial provision to be made and planning undertaken locally for unforeseen events, including the rebuilding costs of schools damaged by fire, net of insurance.</p>

	<p pid="b.703W.2/3">It showed that English domiciled full-time students graduating in academic year 2004/05 anticipated, on average, a total debt of &pound;7,918.

	<p pid="b.703W.2/4">A generous package of support is now available to students. The Government have re-introduced non-repayable grants of up to &pound;2,700 for full-time students. In 2006/07 around half of new full-time entrants were eligible for a full or partial grant. Non re-payable bursaries, typically worth &pound;1,000, are available from universities and colleges to those from low income backgrounds. Additional help is available to students facing financial hardship from the Access to Learning Fund administered by individual higher education institutions.</p>
	<p pid="b.703W.2/5">Student loans are available for tuition fees, as well as living costs, so no student has to find their fees before or during their studies. These loans are repayable only after a student has left their course and only then when their annual income reaches &pound;15,000. The rates of interest are well below that of commercial credit and students only pay back in real terms the amount they originally borrow.</p>

	<p pid="b.706W.11/1">During 2005-06 HMRC undertook a review of its intelligence activity and structure. As a result of that review, the Maritime and Aviation Intelligence Team's functions were reorganised into national hubs of expertise. Intelligence activity is now undertaken nationally by specialist operational teams who link with operational staff across the country. In this way, intelligence continues to support front line activity in HMRC and in other law enforcement agencies. No assessment has yet been made of the changes effected less than 12 months ago.</p>

The main National Statistics on household income distribution, such as Households Below Average Income (HBAI) and The Effects of Taxes and Benefits on Household Income, do not use definitions of income which include imputed rent for owner-occupiers. HBAI presents statistics using two definitions of income: 'before housing costs' and 'after housing costs'.

	<p pid="b.711W.2/5" class="indent">Comparisons of income distributions between countries are particularly affected by structural differences between housing markets. Therefore in statistics for international comparison, the treatment of housing is particularly important.

	<p pid="b.712W.0/4" class="indent">The ONS analysis 'The effects of taxes and benefits on household income' provides information about the income distribution and the characteristics of households in different parts of the income distribution. The latest analysis for 2004/05 was published on the National Statistics website on 12th May 2006 at <a href="http://www.statistics.gov.uk/taxesbenefits">http://www.statistics.gov.uk/taxesbenefits</a>, while that for 2005/06 will be published on <phrase class="date" code="2007-05-17">17 May 2007</phrase>. This annual analysis is based on data from the Expenditure and Food Survey, which is a sample survey covering approximately 7,000 households in the UK. Tables 15 and 15A provide information on household characteristics by income decile group.</p>
	<p pid="b.712W.0/5" class="indent">The table below, based on the same underlying data as that appearing in Tables 15 and 15A, shows the mean and median age of the household reference person by household income decile.</p>
	<p pid="b.712W.0/6" class="indent">The household reference person is the person in the household who owns the accommodation or is responsible for paying rent. If this ownership or responsibility for paying rent is held jointly, then the household reference person is the person with the highest income. A fuller definition is provided in the background notes.</p>
	<p pid="b.712W.0/7" class="indent">The income decile groups are determined by ranking households according to their equivalised disposable income. The table below also shows the equivalised income boundary points which separate households into decile groups.</p>
	<p pid="b.712W.0/8" class="indent">Equivalised incomes are standardised to take into account different sizes and compositions of households. The standard household is deemed to be a two adult household with no children, and so these equivalised incomes can be interpreted as indicating a standard of living that would be achieved by a standard household with that income.</p>
	<p pid="b.712W.0/9" class="indent">The figures shown in the table below are based on a sample survey and are not necessarily accurate to the nearest single year of age, but nevertheless provide a good indication of how the age of the household reference person changes across the income distribution.</p>

	<p pid="b.714W.2/2" class="italic"> Letter from Karen Dunnell, dated <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-19">19 March 2007</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="b.714W.2/3" class="indent">As National Statistician, I have been asked to reply to your recent Parliamentary Question asking what the (a) diagnosis and (b) mortality rate was for (i) melanoma skin cancer and (ii) non-melanoma skin cancer in (A) Taunton constituency and (B) the UK in each year since 1996, broken down by age group.</p>
	<p pid="b.714W.2/4" class="indent">The latest available figures for newly diagnosed cases of cancer (incidence) are for the years 2005 (Wales), 2004 (England, Northern Ireland) and 2003 (Scotland). The latest available figures for deaths are for the year 2005.</p>
	<p pid="b.714W.2/5" class="indent">For the UK, age-specific incidence and mortality rates of respectively, melanoma and non-melanoma skin cancer, from 1996, are given in Tables 1 and 3 below.</p>
	<p pid="b.714W.2/6" class="indent">For Taunton Deane LA, numbers of newly registered cases of, and deaths from, respectively, melanoma and non-melanoma skin cancer, from 1996, are given in Tables 2 and 4 below. Only a broad breakdown by age (0-59, 60+) is possible because of the small number of cases in some years.</p>
	<p pid="b.714W.2/7" class="indent">Numbers for both melanoma and non-melanoma skin cancer, for Taunton Deane LA, particularly those for deaths, are too small to produce reliable age-specific rates even on the broad age ranges provided. Numbers for the UK are provided in Tables 5 and 6.</p>

	<p pid="b.723W.5/5" class="indent">It is difficult to make international comparisons on perinatal mortality because of different definitions used for compiling perinatal mortality statistics. These are due to differences in the legal criteria used for birth registration and inclusion criteria used for recording birth information on other data collection systems. According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), the perinatal period commences at 22 completed weeks (154 days) of gestation (when birthweight is normally 500 grams) and ends 7 completed days afterbirth<sup>(1)</sup>.</p>
	<p pid="b.723W.5/6" class="indent">In England and Wales, perinatal mortality statistics (since 1992) are based on the legal definition of stillbirths registered at 24 or more weeks gestation, which are collected by the vital registration system, and includes deaths at ages up to 6 completed days of life (whatever the gestational age at live birth). Scotland, Northern Ireland and Ireland use the same stillbirth definition as England and Wales, hence perinatal mortality statistics are comparable between these countries.</p>
	<p pid="b.723W.5/7" class="indent">Countries such as Austria, Germany, Luxembourg and Portugal collect information on births using the WHO criteria and hence perinatal mortality statistics for these countries are comparable<sup>(2)</sup>. But in countries such as Denmark, Spain and Sweden, only fetal deaths after 28 or more completed weeks of gestation are registered as stillbirths, and in countries which use no such criteria, regulations about stillbirth registration can affect decisions about whether an event is a late miscarriage or should be registered as a birth. Furthermore, under-reporting can be a problem, particularly where data collection systems are not statutory.</p>
	<p pid="b.723W.5/8" class="indent">Therefore, the PERISTAT project funded by the European Union was charged with developing a set of indicators for monitoring and describing perinatal health in Europe.</p>
	<p pid="b.723W.5/9" class="indent">With the PERISTAT indicator set, the aim is to facilitate the surveillance of perinatal health in the EU by harmonizing indicator definitions and encouraging the collection of comparable data for the following purposes:</p>
	<p pid="b.723W.5/10" class="indent">To assess maternal and infant mortality and morbidity associated with events in the perinatal period.</p>
	<p pid="b.723W.5/11" class="indent">To describe the evolution of risk factors for perinatal health outcomes in the population of childbearing women, including demographic, socio-economic and behavioural characteristics.</p>
	<p pid="b.723W.5/12" class="indent">To monitor the use and consequences of medical technology in the care of women and infants during pregnancy, delivery and the postpartum period.</p>
	<p pid="b.723W.5/13" class="indent">ONS has been providing data for England and Wales for the PERISTAT indicators, where possible.</p>

	<p pid="b.733W.2/1">No improvement notices have been issued yet. The Health Act 2006 gave the Healthcare Commission the power to issue improvement notices if it considers that a national health service organisation is not observing the provisions of the Code of Practice in any material respect. The Act, however, includes various other matters that the commission needs to take into account before this power is exercised. The commission is currently reviewing the arrangements in all 41 trusts whose annual health check and rating published in October 2006 gave rise to concern with respect to health care associated infection. This programme will be completed by the end of March. The commission has assured me that if this work reveals evidence of any material failures to observe the provision of the code the issue of formal improvement notices will be likely to follow.</p>
	<p pid="b.733W.2/2">In addition, trusts are being required to make a specific declaration by <phrase class="date" code="2007-05-01">1 May</phrase> regarding their observance of the code as part of the next annual health check cycle. The Healthcare Commission will follow up these declarations as part of a programme to review the application of the code in trusts where there may be risks of inadequate performance. The issuing of improvement notices is an important power to help secure the safety of patients and the commission will use this new power when it is appropriate.</p>

	<p pid="b.734W.2/2">The Department and the Food Standards Agency have not commissioned or supported research on this topic. The composition of infant formula is harmonised at European Union-level (EU), and for fluoride reflects the recommendation of the EU Scientific Committee for Food that, on safety and nutritional grounds, no minimum level, but a maximum level of 100 micrograms of fluoride per 100 kcal, should be set. This advice recognises the potential fluoride intakes of infants from supplements and/or water used to make up the formula.</p>

	<p pid="b.738W.11/2">This is a local matter. However, the trust is currently working towards the completion of detailed plans to reopen the service during April. The service has been subject to an external review by the national breast screening service quality assurance team. The implementation of all the recommendations arising from the review continues to form a key part of the planning process. The trust will be able to confirm the precise arrangements for resuming the service after the review team has completed its work and is expected to have happened by the end of March.</p>
	<p pid="b.738W.11/3">Plans for clearing the backlog are currently being developed as part of the overall planning process to reopen the service. Preliminary contacts have been made with other breast screening units in London to assess the potential for contracting additional capacity from other providers to assist with clearing the backlog.</p>
	<p pid="b.738W.11/4">A full action plan is currently being drawn up for the recommencement of screening services. This will be completed and implemented once the outcome of the external review is known. The full plan is expected to be in place by the end of March.</p>
	<p pid="b.738W.11/5">Patients currently wait an average of three years to be screened in line with national standards. All women currently due for an appointment will have to wait an additional three months due to the temporary closure of the unit.</p>
	<p pid="b.738W.11/6">A number of new procedures are being introduced to ensure the efficient and safe running of the unit in the future, including:</p>
	<p pid="b.738W.11/7" class="indent">implementation of a comprehensive framework for the management of quality in the breast screening service.</p>
	<p pid="b.738W.11/8" class="indent">right results guidelines&mdash;this deals with the initial suspension issue of ensuring women who have had a normal mammogram are re-invited for an appointment when they mention other possible symptoms during their appointment.</p>
	<p pid="b.738W.11/9">It is important to note that the temporary suspension of the service was not due to financial considerations. However, the additional financial costs for resuming the service will depend on the outcome and recommendations of the quality assurance review. It is therefore not possible to make an estimate of the costs at this time.</p>
	<p pid="b.738W.11/10">The primary care trusts and the trust are in ongoing discussion as to how the costs will be shared between the organisations.</p>

	<p pid="b.739W.2/2">The national health service provides a contribution to the cost of continuing education and training for professions whose income derives in part from providing NHS services. Under deregulatory changes approved by Parliament in 1986, the NHS provides optical vouchers to certain eligible groups to assist in buying glasses or contact lenses, but the dispensing of glasses is carried out on a private basis. The Department considers that these arrangements work well in promoting choice and access to services and that it would be anomalous to use public funds to make continuing education and training payments to health care professionals who do not provide services under contract to the NHS.</p>
