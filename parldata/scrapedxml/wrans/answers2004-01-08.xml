	<p pid=".427W.0/1">Activities designed to counter tax evasion are a normal and continuing part of the Inland Revenue's business. Important measures introduced since 1997 include the implementation of the&mdash;'Grabiner' recommendations; Proceeds of Crime Act; Savings Directive; Money Laundering provisions and Production Powers for use in criminal cases. Additionally, specifically funded compliance and enforcement packages have been put in place to tackle fraud and protect the Exchequer from non-payment of tax and other duties. In the 2003 Budget the Chancellor announced additional funding of &pound;66 million over three years for such a package.</p>
	<p pid=".427W.0/2">Typically, new measures to counter tax evasion are designed to work within the wider compliance regime and in concert with other measures. Consequently, often no meaningful estimates can be made of additional sums collected as a result of particular measures in isolation. Figures of total estimated additional liability flowing from the Inland Revenue's work tackling non-compliance are shown each year in their Annual Reports, copies of which are available in the House of Commons Library.</p>

	<p pid=".431W.3/1">The consultation paper issued by the Driving Standards Agency in April 2003 contained a draft Regulatory Impact Assessment of the costs of introducing hazard perception testing into the standards supervision arrangements for existing approved driving instructors. The letter issued by the Agency in December that announced our decision contained an Assessment which had been amended in the light of consultation.</p>
	<p pid=".431W.3/2">The direct costs to instructors who prepared thoroughly for the new assessment should be minimal. No fee will be charged for the first attempt at the test and training and information support have been supplied free. An instructor will have up to 12 months to take the test at a nationwide network of centres. An instructor who was unsuccessful on the first attempt would be charged &pound;50 for a re-test.</p>

	<p pid=".432W.6/1">Many measures have been taken to prevent overheight vehicles striking bridges, including improved signing and conspicuity of low bridges, and regulations requiring that the vehicle's height be displayed in the cab. Despite these measures bridges continue to be struck. Such strikes can cause disruption to road and rail traffic, even for minor incidents, and a serious incident could cause injury and damage. The Department let a research contract last year to investigate the causes and possible prevention of bridge strikes, with the aim of identifying which available measures are likely to be worth pursuing so that drivers follow a route that is appropriate for their vehicle. My officials will be discussing the research findings and possible future steps with a wide range of stakeholders who meet with the Department in the Bridge Strike Prevention Group.</p>

	<p pid=".433W.6/2">For the detailed references to congestion in the RIA, calculations represent estimated time lost in seconds per kilometre travelled for different vehicle types compared with speeds obtained in periods of light traffic flow . In urban areas light flow speeds are usually speeds achieved at night time and would incorporate the effects of traffic signals, pedestrian crossings and other unavoidable constraints on vehicle movement.</p>
	<p pid=".433W.6/3">In 2000, the average time lost per vehicle kilometres as a result of congestion was 24.8 seconds on roads in large urban areas and 3.2 seconds on strategic inter-urban roads.</p>
	<p pid=".433W.6/4">The Highways Agency estimates that the introduction of Regional Control Centres and Traffic Officers will lead to a reduction in congestion on motorways of up to 5 per cent. We expect that measures outside of the scope of the Bill, such as additional capacity at key points on the strategic road network, many of which will be implemented alongside, will also lead to reductions in congestion on trunk roads.</p>
	<p pid=".433W.6/5">The new duties and powers in the Bill provide an incentive and a means for local authorities to reduce congestion on their roads, and for utilities to work with less disruption, especially in urban areas. The level of reduction will depend on the local circumstances and the performance of individual utilities and authorities, including the use that the latter make of the new powers.</p>

	<p pid=".434W.5/2">Installing traffic calming on local roads is the responsibility of the local highway authorities which fund them from block allocations provided by the Department in support of their Local Transport Plans or equivalents. The Department has, however, given local authorities grants totalling &pound;4.6 million in 2002&ndash;03 and &pound;5.5 million in 2003&ndash;04 for specific local transport schemes that include traffic calming measures.</p>
	<p pid=".434W.5/3">Measures that may be described as traffic calming would generally form part of the Highways Agency's programme of small safety schemes on trunk roads. The Highways Agency's opening budgets for safety schemes over the last three years, as published in the Business Plan, are as follows: 2001&ndash;02&mdash;&pound;47 million, 2002&ndash;03&mdash;&pound;45 million and 2003&ndash;04&mdash;&pound;41 million.</p>

Such an assessment should be given appropriate weight alongside other material considerations by local planning authorities in determining applications. A high risk of groundwater flooding or failure to provide an assessment of flood risk that is appropriate to the scale and nature of the development and the risks involved can be reasons for refusal of permission.</p>

	<p pid=".437W.2/1">All plants entering the UK from third countries must be accompanied by a phytosanitary certificate and are subject to inspection at import. For a wide range of known hosts of the sudden oak death fungus (<i>Phytophthora ramorum</i> is its scientific name), specific measures must be followed before the authorities in the exporting country can issue the certificate. For trade within the EU, specific disease control measures are applied at the place of production to rhododendrons and viburnums, the two types of plant which have been most often found to be infected in Europe. Plant passports are then issued that travel with consignments allowing their free movement between member states.</p>
	<p pid=".437W.2/2">Findings of <i>P ramorum</i> in imported and UK origin plants are of concern and inspections at UK nurseries and ports of entry are to be stepped up to ensure that all consignments of plants moved into and within the UK are free from <i>P ramorum</i> and meet plant passport requirements. Any consignment found to be infected, or not to have the correct documentation, will, as now, be destroyed. The UK will support extension of specific measures against <i>P ramorum</i> to additional types of plant when these are shown to present a significant risk.</p>

	<p pid=".437W.5/1">Defra's 75 Plant Health and Seeds Inspectors (PHSI) are already employed for around 20 per cent. of their time on inspection and surveillance duties related to Phytophthora ramorum, which is known in the USA as sudden oak death. However, in response to the increasing number of findings of this pathogen in England and Wales, the plant health service is to employ at least 20 additional staff to cover the increased rate of inspections at production nurseries, wild planting areas and ports of entry. This is part of a package of measures announced on <phrase class="date" code="">4 December</phrase>. Wherever possible, suitably qualified field staff will be transferred from elsewhere in the Department. These will be supplemented by recruitment of a small number of staff with appropriate experience and qualifications (e.g. ex-PHSI staff). Transfer and recruitment will start in January.</p>
	<p pid=".437W.5/2">Defra are also funding a substantial increase in sample diagnoses undertaken by the Central Science Laboratory (CSL) which is estimated to cost in excess of &pound;750,000 to the end of 2004&ndash;05. CSL are also involved in on-going research into Phytophthora ramorum to the value of &pound;370,000.</p>
	<p pid=".437W.5/3">The Forestry Commission has redirected about 23 staff onto a woodland survey in England and Wales, to be completed by April 2004, which will help us to assess whether Phytophthora ramorum is present in the wider environment. Resource has also been redirected within the Forest Research Agency into projects designed to help us better understand the disease.</p>

	<p pid=".439W.2/1">I have had no specific discussions with my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer on gender budgeting, however I have jointly sponsored, with my right hon. Friend the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, a pilot project on gender analysis of expenditure.</p>
	<p pid=".439W.2/2">I believe gender analysis of expenditure can be an extremely useful tool in both policy development and evaluation. My officials in WEU have worked closely with HMT during the pilot project, with DTI being one of two Departments taking part. Lessons from this project will be used to inform further work in this area.</p>

	<p pid=".439W.5/1">Within the recent Skills Strategy, 21st Century Skills, Realising our Potential, we have highlighted the challenge in making real improvements in raising the skills level of our workforce. We know that the majority of working women are concentrated in just five occupational groups which are often low paid and low skilled. For example 89 per cent. of hairdressers and beauticians are women and in a survey their average pay was found to be the second lowest of all occupations <sup>1</sup> .</p>
	<p pid=".439W.5/2">Some sectors identified as having significant skill weaknesses, such as Construction and Transport and Communications, have extreme occupational segregation. Only 9 per cent. of the workforce in Construction are women and 24 per cent. in Transport and Communications.</p>
	<p pid=".439W.5/3">While we cannot entirely influence women's career choices, both the Skills Strategy and our recent Innovation Report identifies some of the levers to improve skills levels and for the UK to have a highly educated workforce with a culture of lifelong learning. To do this we have made a commitment to provide better information, advice and guidance on skills, training and qualifications so that people know what is available to them.</p>
	<p pid=".439W.5/4">We have identified that our young people need to be properly prepared for the world of work. That is why we have commissioned a Working Group, chaired by Mike Tomlinson to advise on the development of more coherent vocational programmes for 14&ndash;19 year olds to ensure they have the necessary skills for employment and adult life. We want both girls and boys to make informed choices about their vocational routes and our Modern Apprenticeships will help support young people in their career choices and to improve their workplace skills, particularly at craft, supervisory and technician level.</p>
	<p pid=".439W.5/5">Our Employer Training Pilots, introduced in September 2002, is designed to increase the demand for training by reducing barriers and providing training in more responsive ways. Over 20,000 learners and over 5,000 employers are now engaged. Trends show that overall there is a high proportion of female learners involved in pilots from all sectors, with a large majority concentrated in education and health and social work which is in line with the national average.</p>

	<p pid=".440W.2/1">The Government are taking forward a range of policies to tackle the gender pay gap. These include a new questionnaire procedure for use in equal pay cases, and measures to simplify and speed up equal pay tribunal procedures. The Government have led by example in committing all Civil Service departments and agencies to review their pay systems and produce action plans to close any equal pay gaps. The Government have provided funding for the EOC to develop equal pay tool kits so all organisations can carry out equal pay reviews. Measures to help parents maintain links with the world of work and better balance their work and home lives will contribute to a reduction of the pay gap. The Government also welcomes the EOC's investigation into modern apprenticeships and the concentration of men and women in different professions.</p>

	<p pid=".442W.2/1">The Communications Act 2003 has strengthened the requirements for subtitling on television. The Act sets subtitling targets of 90 per cent. of programmes on Channels 3 and 4, and 80 per cent. of programmes on all other channels, by the tenth anniversary of the start of the service. The Act also introduces a fixed, five-year interim target of 60 per cent. for subtitling, to accelerate progress during the early years. Under the Act, these requirements have been extended to digital cable and satellite broadcasters for the first time.</p>

	<p pid=".442W.12/1">The Government believe that much added value can be gained from Regional Development Agencies (RDAs) sharing best practice. One of the measures of RDA performance is an assessment of how effective each RDA has been in working with other RDAs across regional boundaries and sharing innovation and best practice with each other.</p>
	<p pid=".442W.12/2">Examples of the sharing of best practice include regular meetings between RDA Chairs. In addition, the RDAs nominated as &quot;in the lead&quot; for particular issues are also important catalysts for sharing best practice.

	<p pid=".444W.2/1">During the recent review of the Employment Relations Act 1999, the Government looked closely at the operation of protections from dismissal for employees taking lawfully organised official industrial action. The conclusion of that review, as set out in the response to consultation published last month, is that the 8-week rule should be retained and that the Employment Relations Bill will introduce improvements to the existing protections. These changes are designed to ensure, firstly, that days where employees are 'locked-out' during official industrial action are disregarded in calculating the 8-week period; and secondly that the procedural steps employers and employees must take under the statute to attempt to resolve a dispute are clear.</p>

	<p pid=".444W.11/1">We have long known that users' trust and confidence in the internet would impact on its uptake. This was recognised in the September 1999 report from the Performance and Innovation Unit, &quot;e-commerce@its.best.uk&quot; which identified trust as one of the three pillars which would support the adoption of the internet in the UK. Studies into consumer behaviour in 2001 and 2002 (&quot;Informing Consumers About e-commerce&quot; and &quot;Internet and Cross Border Shopping&quot;) showed that the perception of credit card fraud was a significant concern to on-line consumers. That said, on-line shopping represented 6 per cent. of all UK retail in 2002, and was set to grow to &pound;14 billion in 2003 as part of a continuing growth in use of the internet throughout the economy. Our latest study&mdash;the &quot;International Benchmarking Study&quot; published by DTI in November 2003&mdash;showed that the impact of a lack of confidence on internet usage appears to be receding. It was also noted that security and trust were seen as less of a barrier to internet usage by UK business than was the case in previous benchmarking studies.</p>

	<p pid=".446W.0/1">In recent months, I and members of my Department, have had several meetings with representatives of the RCVS, the BVA and other professional bodies. We have listened carefully to the views of the profession particularly in relation to animal health and welfare. These discussions have been helpful and productive and identified opportunities to reduce the potential need for legislation by addressing many of Competition Commission recommendations within the industry's own professional code of practice.</p>
	<p pid=".446W.0/2">A consultation document together with a draft impact assessment and the draft legislation we consider is necessary to implement these recommendations is currently being finalised in discussion with DEFRA. This will be issued shortly and will provide all interested parties with a further opportunity to comment on how best to carry forward the Commission's recommendations. Reflecting the Government's better regulation agenda, the DTI would look closely at proposals from the profession to take forward some or all of them within the industry's own professional rules.</p>

	<p pid=".447W.3/1">The most recent information available on violent crime victimisation of people over the age of 60 is from the 2000 British Crime Survey, which measures crime in 1999 (Home Office Statistical Bulletin 08/02, Chivite-Matthews and Maggs, 2002). This showed that 0.9 per cent. of women aged 60 and over and 1.1 per cent. of men in this age group were victims of at least one incident of violence in England and Wales that year. There were approximately 132,000 incidents of violence against older people in 1999, however some people may have experienced more than one incident in the year. People aged 60 and over had a lower risk of experiencing violent crime than other age groups, and were also less likely to be repeatedly victimised.</p>
	<p pid=".447W.3/2">More recent figures are available for those aged 65 or over. In 2001&ndash;02, 0.7 per cent of men aged 65 to 74 and 0.7 per cent. of women in this age group experienced one or more violent incidents, while 0.6 per cent. of men aged 75 and over and 0.5 per cent. of women aged 75 and over did so. In 2002&ndash;03, 1.3 per cent of men and 0.7 per cent. of women aged 65 to 74 and 0.4 per cent of men and 0.6 per cent. of women aged 75 and over were victims of a violent crime (Home Office Statistical Bulletin 07/03, Simmons and Dodd, 2003).</p>

	<p pid=".455W.12/1">DFID is committed to working with others, including our donor partners, the pharmaceutical industry, investors, developing country governments and non-governmental organisations (NGOs) to improve access to medicines in developing countries, including for the treatment of HIV/AIDS.</p>
	<p pid=".455W.12/2">With the World Health Organisation, DFID believes that affordable pricing, sustainable financing, reliable health and supply systems, and the rational selection and use of existing drugs are all essential to improve access to medicines.</p>
	<p pid=".455W.12/3">In line with this, DFID has committed over &pound;1.5 billion since May 1997 to support the strengthening of health and supply systems in developing countries, which will help to build capacity to deliver medicines to the poor and to make effective choices about the selection of drugs. The UK has also pledged $280 million to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, TB and Malaria (GFATM). This will help strengthen health system capacity to deliver effective and affordable prevention, treatment, care and support programmes, based on locally determined needs and building upon countries own national priorities. According to UNAIDS, the UK is the second largest bilateral donor for HIV/AIDS programmes.</p>
	<p pid=".455W.12/4">DFID supports a comprehensive response to HIV/AIDS, which includes prevention, treatment and care and alleviation of the impact of AIDS. We welcome recent reductions in the price of both patent and generic anti-retroviral drugs for the treatment of HIV. These reductions have created new opportunities to allow poor people to benefit from the same life-saving treatment that has been available in affluent countries. We will continue to work with the WHO, the patent based and generic pharmaceutical industries and others to further reduce prices. DFID supports the target set by the World Health Organisation and UNAIDS for three million people receiving treatment by the end of 2005. A new policy on treatment and care, to be launched early next year, will set out how DFID will co-ordinate work with partners to promote anti-retroviral treatment for poor people and for women.</p>

(The total number of mesothelioma deaths in Great Britian in 2001 was 1,848; the 175 mesothelioma deaths in London in 2001 represent 9.5 per cent. of this total).

This is something that falls within the responsibilities delegated to me as Chief Executive of the Agency.</p>
	<p pid=".460W.2/4" class="indent">The Jobcentre Plus Programme Procurement Review was initiated following two independent consultants reports towards the end of 2002/03 and is an ongoing review with the following aims and objectives:</p>
	<p pid=".460W.2/5" class="indent">1. define and communicate clear roles, responsibilities and accountabilities for all those involved in the procurement, payment and contract management process;</p>

	<p pid=".460W.2/11" class="indent">7. work jointly with all key stakeholders including Department for Work and Pensions (DWP), Department for Education and Skills (DfES), Learning Skills;</p>
	<p pid=".460W.2/12" class="indent">8. develop and deliver an approved Jobcentre Plus Procurement Strategy, to be incorporated into DWP's Commercial Strategy, which will detail, for example, how best provision should be purchased and paid for, how Jobcentre Plus should interact and develop enhanced relationships with key providers;</p>
	<p pid=".460W.2/13" class="indent">9. provide resource, focus and structure through a Director led steering group to ensure proposals for change are developed and implemented resulting in better value for money and an increase in job outcomes from providers.</p>
	<p pid=".460W.2/14" class="indent">Jobcentre Plus is committed to keeping providers informed of the progress of the review and to seek provider's views on implementation of proposals. Five provider awareness events launching the review, covering six Jobcentre Plus regions, have been held over the last six months. In addition an ongoing progress update has been sent to all existing providers and also made available on the Jobcentre Plus website. Providers will continue to be updated and their views sought through the Provider Liaison Group. This group meets bi-monthly to discuss issues of common concern. The primary purpose of the group is to involve providers in planning and implementation of change, giving them the opportunity to put the provider perspective to policy makers.</p>
	<p pid=".460W.2/15" class="indent">The overall Jobcentre Plus Procurement Strategy for employment programmes is being developed by an independent consultant drawing on a range of expertise including the Office of Government Commerce, DfES, Home Office 'Active Communities Unit' (relationship with voluntary sector providers).</p>

	<p pid=".463W.3/2">The Government accepted Recommendation 54 of the Victoria Climbie Inquiry Report which stated that &quot;Directors of Social Services must ensure that all cases of children assessed as needing a service have an allocated social worker. In cases where this proves to be impossible, arrangements must be made to maintain contact with the child. The number, nature and reasons for such unallocated cases must be reported to the Social Services Committee on a monthly basis, (paragraph 6.589)&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".463W.3/3">The allocation of social workers was included in the checklist of good practice recommendations issued on publication of the report.

	<p pid=".467W.2/2">Data on waiting times for diagnostic tests are not collected centrally, however data may be collected locally. The central returns capture consultant speciality level data on waits for a first outpatient appointment and for inpatient admissions.</p>
	<p pid=".467W.2/3">However, it is the Governments' priority to ensure that all patients are seen quickly in the first instance so that if diagnostic tests are required they are requested sooner. Where this is not the case we are determined to speed up the process. The National Health Service is committed to reducing the length of time that people wait before their treatment starts and the NHS Plan set targets for staged reductions in waiting times.</p>

Individual LEAs and Excellence in Cities partnerships decide which measures to adopt and which schools to involve in the light of local needs. They give priority to a core group of schools, typically four secondary schools and about 20 linked primary schools in an LEA. But in many LEAs other schools also benefit from BIP measures, which include multi-agency Behaviour and Education Support Teams and extra Learning Support Units, Learning Mentors and Education Welfare Officers as well as locally-devised initiatives.</p>

	<p pid=".473W.0/2">It is not possible to answer the Question in precisely the way it has been asked. Table 3.2 of the Department's Annual Report sets out the Departmental funding for schools since 1997 and that shows an increase from less than &pound;2 billion in 1998 to almost &pound;9 billion this year. A copy of the Report has been placed in the Library. However, most programmes were not specifically for particular types of schools and local education authorities were free to distribute the grants between schools in their areas.</p>
	<p pid=".473W.0/3">In 2003&ndash;04, the Department stopped paying grant for programmes which were worth &pound;800 million in 2002&ndash;03 as part of our commitment to reduce ringfenced funding for schools. However much of this funding relates to time-limited courses that had run their course. Having regard to the &pound;250 million headroom between the &pound;2.7 billion increase in general funding for schools which took account of the overall pressures on schools, including the &pound;800 million grant reduction, we intended that each school should choose for itself whether to continue the programmes previously supported through specific grant.</p>
	<p pid=".473W.0/4">Over the next two years, we have announced that we will be making available additional non-ringfenced resources to reverse the reductions in the Standards Fund which were previously planned. For 2004&ndash;05, schools will generally receive a 4 per cent. cash increase on this year's Standards Fund allocation so there should be no reason for any school to decide on financial rather than educational grounds not to continue a particular programme. In total I am making an additional &pound;820 million extra available over the years 2004/05 and 2005/06.</p>

	<p pid=".475W.2/1">The design of effective lessons is fundamental to the pursuit of high quality teaching and learning whatever the age of the pupil, their level of ability, or the subject or skill being learned.</p>
	<p pid=".475W.2/2">The Primary Strategy recommends that literacy and mathematics lessons begin with whole class teaching sessions followed by guided reading and writing activities, during which pupils are grouped according to their individual learning needs.</p>
	<p pid=".475W.2/3">The Key Stage 3 National Strategy recommends a consideration of pupil grouping as part of classroom organisation which is one contributory factor towards effective lesson design. Furthermore, the Strategy has produced a range of materials for schools (such as critical teaching units, literacy progress units, Springboard 7, learning challenge and booster materials) to use in meeting the needs of pupils below expected levels. These allow schools, depending on their particular local circumstances, the flexibility of being able to provide whole class teaching; to re-group pupils according to their needs and abilities; provide within-class pupil grouping and one-to-one coaching or mentoring.</p>

	<p pid=".484W.2/1">Under the Starter Home Initiative, assistance is available to a wide range of health staff including radiographers. Priorities for assistance depend upon the recruitment and retention difficulties being experienced. From <phrase class="date" code="2004-04-01">1 April 2004</phrase>, a new key worker programme will succeed the Starter Home Initiative. This will provide assistance to first time buyers and existing homeowners who need to move to a larger home. It will also provide homes for key workers at below market rents. Funding will be targeted in areas where the high cost of housing is undermining recruitment and retention. Full details of the new programme, including the eligible key worker groups, will be announced by the beginning of March. Employer contributions will supplement assistance under the new programme.</p>

	<p pid=".485W.2/1">The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister is committed to improving the quality of the built environment in the Thames Gateway and elsewhere. To ensure that this happens, Planning Policy Guidance 1 (PPG1) &quot;General Policy and Principles&quot; requires that &quot;good design should be the aim of all those involved in the development process and should be encouraged everywhere&quot;.

	<p pid=".485W.2/2">The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister is working with a wide range of partners to deliver this through a number of policy initiatives. Our Sustainable Communities Plan is central to achieving this and the comprehensive agenda this sets out includes significant extra funding for the Commission for Architecture and the Built Environment (CABE). This will be used to drive up design standards and to improve associated skills.</p>
	<p pid=".485W.2/3">We have increased funding for CABE from &pound;0.5 million in 2002&ndash;03 to &pound;17.75 million over the next three years. CABE are currently working with a range of key partners to ensure that strategies comprehensively incorporate robust requirements for good design. For example, CABE, in partnership with English Partnerships and the Housing Corporation, are scheduled to launch the Growth Areas Housing Quality Forum in March 2004. The Forum will bring together representatives from all key agencies involved in commissioning and procuring new housing, including local authorities, development agencies, mortgage lenders and landowners and will encourage the active participation of private sector house builders and Registered Social Landlords.</p>
