	<p pid="c.2W.5/1">New claims to severe disablement allowance were stopped on <phrase class="date" code="2001-04-06">6 April 2001</phrase>. From that date new customers need to apply for incapacity benefit or income support on grounds of incapacity. At that time youth rules were introduced to incapacity benefit, whereby those incapable of work before the age of 20 (25 years old in certain circumstances) are eligible for the benefit without needing to meet the national insurance contribution condition.</p>
	<p pid="c.2W.5/2">Existing severe disablement allowance customers, apart from those aged under 20 years old on <phrase class="date" code="2001-04-05">5 April 2001</phrase>, have not been transferred onto incapacity benefit. Instead payment of severe disablement allowance continues as long as the benefit conditions continue to be satisfied.</p>
	<p pid="c.2W.5/3">Entitlement to severe disablement allowance does not passport its recipients to other benefits, such as housing benefit, in the way that income support and income related jobseeker's allowance do. Many customers on severe disablement allowance may also qualify for income support and so be passported to other benefits in that way. People on severe disablement allowance with a low income, but not also receiving income support would need to be considered for housing benefit on low-income grounds.</p>

	<p pid="c.7W.11/1">Health and Safety Executive (HSE) recently re-published &quot;Charity and voluntary workers: A guide to health and safety at work&quot; (HSG192).

It was developed in partnership with the Charities Safety Group, which has over 100 member charities, and the Institute of Occupational Safety and Health.</p>
	<p pid="c.7W.11/2">The guidance makes clear that employers are required to carry out an assessment of risks that result from their undertaking and, if they employ five or more people, that they must record the findings of the assessment. Therefore, where the body organising an event is an employer, as many charities are, the law requires that a risk assessment is carried out.</p>
	<p pid="c.7W.11/3">The guidance also includes advice and case studies to help charities and volunteering organisations decide on the practical steps they need to take.</p>
	<p pid="c.7W.11/4">HSE also supported Volunteering England in the development and recent launch of their risk assessment toolkit which is available free online at <a href="http://www.volunteering.org.uk">www.volunteering.org.uk</a>. It gives detailed guidance on all aspects of risk assessment in volunteering, including health and safety aspects of organising events.</p>

This is because individuals who move abroad may at some point have a call upon contributions paid whilst in the UK. In the case of deceased individuals, a partner may make a claim for a contributory benefit, which is dependant on the contribution record of the deceased individual. This means that the number of accounts held on the system accrues as NINOs are allocated each year to all UK children who reach 16 years and persons from abroad requiring a NINO are added.</p>

They can refer people, where appropriate for occupational health assessments, or to access to work advisers, as well as the full range of Jobcentre Plus disability programmes. In addition, DEAs support people who encounter barriers in the workplace associated with disability, and also provide advice and support to employers regarding the employment and retention of disabled people and those with health conditions.</p>

	<p pid="c.14W.2/4" class="indent">As National Statistician I have been asked to reply to your recent Parliamentary Question, what estimate has been made of the Pensioner Prices Index in each year from 1976-77 to 2006-07 (96313).</p>
	<p pid="c.14W.2/5" class="indent">The Retail Prices Index (RPI) covers the expenditure of UK private households only, excluding the top four percent by income and those pensioner households where the head of the household is retired and economically inactive and where at least three-quarters of the household income is derived from state benefits.</p>
	<p pid="c.14W.2/6" class="indent">Since 1969, RPI pensioner indices have been compiled on a quarterly basis for these pensioner households excluded from the RPI (separately for one and two pensioner households). These indices are based on the spending patterns of these specific households, and contain some pensioner specific items such as OAP bus and rail fares. They exclude items such as canteen meals, which are not relevant due to very small expenditure levels. They also exclude housing costs on the grounds that the price indicators used in the RPI would overstate the price increases experienced by these pensioners, because no allowance is made for rebates e.g. on council tax and local authority rents.</p>

	<p pid="c.16W.2/1">The Pension Service has written to every pensioner household to tell them about pension credit. A direct mail initiative &quot;You're missing out&quot; was targeted at 1.5 million households identified as highly likely to be eligible for pension credit, as a result of data matching. A further 'reminder' postcard was sent to one million households who did not respond. Since <phrase class="date" code="2005-12-05">5 December 2005</phrase> customers who contact the pension credit application line to make an application for pension credit are also able to claim housing benefit and council tax benefit during the one phone call.</p>
	<p pid="c.16W.2/2">During 2005-06 Local Service visited approximately 23,000 households each week, focusing on those customers who were most likely to be eligible for pension credit and working closely with partners (e.g. Help the Aged, Age Concern) to encourage pensioners to take up their entitlement to pension credit.</p>

	<p pid="c.17W.2/1">People aged 60 or over who are receiving the guarantee part of pension credit will normally be entitled to full council tax benefit, less deductions for any non-dependants in the household.</p>
	<p pid="c.17W.2/2">There is no capital limit within pension credit although a notional rate of income for capital over &pound;6,000 (&pound;10,000 for those in care homes) is assumed at a rate of &pound;1 for each &pound;500 or part of &pound;500.</p>
	<p pid="c.17W.2/3">Someone in ill-health may also be entitled to an additional amount in pension credit for severe disability if they qualify for attendance allowance or the middle or highest rate of the care component for disability living allowance. This would increase the level of the guaranteed minimum income that would be applied and increase the amount of income (including notional income from savings) that someone could have and still qualify for pension credit.</p>
	<p pid="c.17W.2/4">People over the age of 65 who are severely disabled and have personal care or supervision needs can claim attendance allowance. It is non-contributory, tax free and is not affected by income or savings.</p>
	<p pid="c.17W.2/5">We want to make sure pensioners claim all the benefits to which they are entitled and know that some pensioners need support in doing so. The Pension Service Local Service, local authorities and sometimes the voluntary sector are joining forces nationally so that older people will receive a full and joined up service that can deal with a variety of issues and queries. Many older people dislike having to go through claim processes over and over again with different organisations and these joint teams can help reduce this by providing a single access point to social care and benefit entitlements such as pension credit, housing benefit and attendance allowance.</p>
	<p pid="c.17W.2/6">We now have 118 teams that are able to visit some of the most vulnerable people in the country, people who historically may never have applied for any entitlement or benefit and who would not be aware of referral routes or even the names of the many benefits they could receive.</p>
	<p pid="c.17W.2/7">State pension, winter fuel payments and free television licences are not affected by health or savings and are available to everyone who satisfies the qualifying conditions.</p>

The resulting medical report is considered by the trustees. A former MP or Office Holder may also apply to receive an ill-health pension, subject to confirming that he or she does not intend to seek election to the House or accept any future offer to serve as an Office Holder, and the medical practitioner confirming that the former member has retired from 'gainful work' as a direct consequence of ill-health.</p>

	<p pid="c.27W.2/1">DFID has recently completed a study on the links between sexual and reproductive health and rights and the AIDS response. The study included a review of the experience of programmes to link sexual and reproductive health and HIV and AIDS services. For example a South African NGO, LoveLife, provided youth friendly services for sexual and reproductive health and HIV in combination with a multi-media information campaign aimed at young people. Changes in HIV prevalence and sexual behaviour were tracked through the National Youth Survey. The survey results demonstrated that participation in the programme was associated with decreased odds of HIV infection and increased the odds of young men and women using condoms.</p>
	<p pid="c.27W.2/2">The DFID review concluded that there is emerging consensus, backed up by growing evidence, on the main priorities for developing links between sexual and reproductive health and HIV and AIDS services. The challenge now is to support national governments to scale up the provision of evidence based and comprehensive sexual and reproductive health services for all vulnerable groups including women and girls, men who have sex with men and sex workers.</p>

	<p pid="c.29W.5/1">The UK Government are extremely concerned about the humanitarian situation in the Occupied Palestinian Territories. This is caused by the conflict with Israel; an economic downturn due to restrictions on movement and access and the Palestinian Authority's fiscal crisis, which has meant it has been unable to pay salaries. The fiscal crisis is mainly the result of the withholding of clearance revenues by Israel and a downturn in domestically generated revenues. The suspension of budgetary support by donors has played a less significant role.</p>
	<p pid="c.29W.5/2">The suspension of budgetary support has been necessary following the Hamas-led Government's failure to renounce violence, recognise Israel and sign up to previous peace agreements. However, the international community is doing what it can to address the humanitarian situation. The European Community has increased its aid from &euro;250 million to &euro;340 million this year. UK bilateral aid levels have remained constant at &pound;30 million this financial year.</p>
	<p pid="c.29W.5/3">A Temporary International Mechanism (TIM) has been set up to support Palestinians directly instead of going through the Palestinian Authority. DFID intends to contribute up to &pound;12 million to the TIM and the European Community is contributing &euro;105 million. So far the TIM has delivered 2.6 million litres of fuel to keep water, sanitation and health care facilities running; allowances for over 63,000 Palestinian Government workers; and welfare payments to over 40,000 of the poorest Palestinians.</p>
	<p pid="c.29W.5/4">DFID has provided &pound;15 million this financial year to support Palestinian refugees, through the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNWRA). DFID also gives core funding to other UN agencies which are helping to address the humanitarian situation including the World Food Programme and the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA). Furthermore, we have deployed two experts to OCHA to improve its ability to monitor the humanitarian situation in Gaza. These experts will help to make sure that aid gets to those who need it the most.</p>

Where appropriate, the agency undertakes works to mitigate for the impact of its operational, maintenance and improvement works, which may include the provision of animal welfare measures. These measures include the provision of animal crossings in the form of tunnels and adapted farm crossings and underpasses. Appropriate fencing may be included to both prevent animals crossing the carriageway and direct the animals to a safe crossing facility. They also undertake specific enhancement measures, such as the provision of bat boxes as part of commitments set out in the Highways Agency Biodiversity Action Plan (HABAP). Finally, the agency also undertakes research to support the development of advice in relation to the effectiveness of such measures.</p>
	<p pid="c.34W.2/2">With respect to expenditure, mitigation and enhancement measures are often provided as part of larger scheme budgets and specific costs are not available. However as part of its HABAP commitments, the agency has installed in excess of 920 bat boxes since 2002. Each of these enhancement schemes has been evaluated through a value management process, to ensure that works are appropriate and represent value for money. Other works are evaluated through cost challenge workshops or similar procedures for assessing value for money.</p>

	<p pid="c.43W.2/1">Our new HomeBuy scheme offers three products based on equity sharing. Social HomeBuy enables tenants of local authorities and housing associations to buy a share in their current home at a discount, New Build HomeBuy enables people to buy a share of a newly built property paying a rent on the remainder, (including the First Time Buyers Initiative, which uses public sector land) and Open Market HomeBuy enables people to buy a property on the open market with the help of an equity loan.</p>
	<p pid="c.43W.2/2">Priority groups for our HomeBuy products are social tenants, key workers as defined under the Key Worker Living Programme and other first time buyers nominated by the Regional Housing Boards.

A supplementary table presents key information at local authority level, including the number of households accepted as eligible for assistance, unintentionally homeless and in priority need (and therefore owed a main homelessness duty) during the most recent quarter (April to June 2006), and the number of households in temporary accommodation arranged by the authority under homelessness legislation as at <phrase class="date" code="2006-06-30">30 June</phrase>.

	<p pid="c.48W.2/1">There is no right of appeal against a statutory grant of planning permission which has been enacted by Parliament and part 5 of the General Permitted Development Order (GPDO), in particular, contains no powers, only entitlements. We have no records of part 5 permitted development rights being exercised by statutory undertakers. Statutory undertakers have their own permitted development rights in part 17 of schedule 2 of the GPDO, though there is nothing to prevent a statutory undertaker from enjoying the benefit of any of the other permitted development rights in the GPDO that might apply to their land in a particular case. Were there to be a dispute about whether permitted development rights applied in a particular case, it might be resolved either by an application made to the local planning authority for a certificate of lawfulness to confirm the existence of such rights in respect of a particular development proposal, or by enforcement action taken by the local planning authority.</p>

	<p pid="c.55W.6/1">The second meeting of the parties to the Kyoto Protocol in Nairobi, this November, presents an ideal opportunity to explore how Africa's participation in investment in projects through the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) can be enhanced. There are several alternative proposals on the table for discussion in Nairobi, and the UK is keen to see a positive outcome.</p>
	<p pid="c.55W.6/2">The CDM market has grown enormously in the last year, with an estimated 1,000 projects, and 1.2 billion tonnes of CO2 equivalent in the pipeline to 2012. The UK is the major private sector participant in the CDM market, with UK companies participating in some 25 per cent. of currently registered CDM projects.</p>
	<p pid="c.55W.6/3">Africa does not have a record of attracting significant private investment in CDM.</p>
	<p pid="c.55W.6/4">So the Government are arguing for the development of a fund which could assist in building capacity within Africa to develop and identify projects that could attract carbon finance. I am discussing the idea with colleagues from within the EU as well as from Africa. In parallel, I have asked officials to examine how a carbon fund for Africa could be best designed to deliver on this objective.</p>
	<p pid="c.55W.6/5">The challenge is to ensure that any fund is designed to deliver long-term benefits to the countries concerned. As well as pressing the fund we need to look at the full range of measures to support and enhance Africa's participation in the CDM.</p>
	<p pid="c.55W.6/6">There is already considerable international experience on support to CDM-related investment.</p>
	<p pid="c.55W.6/7">The UK already supports several initiatives that assist African participation in CDM:</p>
	<p pid="c.55W.6/8" class="indent">The Foreign and Commonwealth Office's Global Opportunities Fund supports many projects designed to enhance developing countries' capacity to participate in CDM. There are several projects supporting CDM investment in Africa; in Angola, Nigeria and South Africa.</p>
	<p pid="c.55W.6/9" class="indent">As a Government, we are also investing in the Kuyasa township CDM project in Cape Town, South Africa, to offset the emissions of the G8 presidency. I hope that we can build on this investment in the tender for the Government Carbon Offsetting Fund which we have set up to offset emissions from official travel.</p>
	<p pid="c.55W.6/10">There are also several existing multilateral, European and bilateral initiatives on support capacity building and project investment, both agreed at a United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change level, through the World Banks and bilaterally. This is something we need to learn from and build on.</p>

	<p pid="c.58W.2/1">The Farming Regulation and Charging Strategy for England, published in November 2005, details a number of commitments to reduce bureaucracy and make regulatory controls more effective and easier to comply with, including through the Whole Farm Approach. The strategy is available on the Defra website at:</p>

	<p pid="c.58W.2/3">Defra has made a commitment to reduce the administrative burdens its regulations impose on business by 25 per cent. by 2010. We have recently participated in a cross-government exercise to measure this burden and are now in the final stages of finalising our Simplification Plan to be published in November 2006. This plan outlines a range of simplification initiatives, including many that impact on farmers, that will reduce the burden on business and reach our 25 per cent. target.</p>
	<p pid="c.58W.2/4">Some of these approaches will offer benefits to dairy farmers. In addition, the Government are continuing to press for the abolition of the milk quotas system, which will help to simplify existing arrangements in this sector.</p>

	<p pid="c.65W.0/1">The Environment Agency (EA) is required, in accordance with HM Treasury's guidance and the &quot;polluter pays principle&quot;, to recover the full costs of regulation from those it regulates. The EA have worked with the farming sector to develop a straightforward, least-cost approach for farmers. It is for the EA, as the regulator, to assess the level of effort required to meet the pollution prevention and control requirements. In parallel, my Department continues to encourage the EA to demonstrate full transparency on what costs are for. The EA is also being set targets to drive efficiency throughout the organisation and gains will in turn offset charges as appropriate.</p>
	<p pid="c.65W.0/2">In response to concerns raised by the industry, the EA presented a proposal on subsistence charging in February this year. The EA's proposals were accepted by the British Poultry Council, as well as other intensive livestock trade associations in May. A subsistence charge of &pound;1,471 for an existing small farm and &pound;1,844 for an existing large farm will therefore be charged to the industry from August 2007 until March 2008, provided that the industry stage its applications over the three month application window (from <phrase class="date" code="2006-11-01">1 November 2006</phrase> to <phrase class="date" code="">31 January 2007</phrase>).</p>

	<p pid="c.65W.3/1">The Department has been working closely with the Food Standards Agency (FSA) to improve our understanding of how Campylobacter infection develops and spreads. We have also considered effective methods for controlling the spread of this bacteria at all levels of the food chain, including controls on farm and best practice guidance in the kitchen.</p>
	<p pid="c.65W.3/2">For the period 2005-08, DEFRA has committed &pound;2.65 million towards research on the control of Campylobacter and the development of intervention practices to reduce the incidence of the bacteria within poultry production systems. This includes a DEFRA/FSA joint-funded three year survey, starting in 2007, to determine the prevalence of Campylobacter in UK flocks of chicken for meat production.</p>
	<p pid="c.65W.3/3">A report published by the Advisory Committee on the Microbiological Safety of Food in July 2005 concluded that the control of Campylobacter is a practical proposition in housed flocks where producers maintain rigorous biosecurity measures and high flock management standards. As a result, priority action at farm level has focused on the importance of meeting good biosecurity standards. This action reinforces wider food hygiene initiatives in the commercial and domestic food handling settings.</p>
	<p pid="c.65W.3/4">These research and education projects will help to support the FSA and the poultry industry in meeting their target to achieve a 50 per cent. reduction in the incidence of UK-produced chicken testing positive for Campylobacter by 2010.</p>

	<p pid="c.67W.5/1">I have consulted closely with the chairman and chief executive of British Waterways about the in-year cut of about 7 per cent. of grant in aid amounting to &pound;3.94 million. They accept that Government have provided &pound;524 million in funding for British Waterways since 2000, of which &pound;452 million was for waterways in England and Wales. Over this period, British Waterways has substantially improved the state of its waterways and has eliminated the safety backlog. It has also concluded substantial regeneration and property projects and facilitated the restoration of some 200 miles of derelict canals. The current assessment of the effect of the reduction in the 2006-07 budgets is that there is likely to be some delay to capital works and set back the date by which British Waterways will be able to reduce year-on-year the requirements for grant in aid from Government.</p>

	<p pid="c.69W.3/1">The works programme for each year is planned to fit with the expected parliamentary timetable. Over the past three years approximately &pound;17 million has been spent in each summer recess on works projects across both Houses, of which approximately 60 per cent. (&pound;10 million) has been in the Commons. The Commission has estimated the effect of a two-week sitting period in September 2006 on the basis that such sittings and the works programme were planned from the previous November.</p>
	<p pid="c.69W.3/2">If projects in the Palace and in those buildings housing Members stopped work for two weeks, an additional one/two week period would be required for project close down, making safe, then restarting. This means the overall impact on the works programme would equate to a total delay of up to three or four weeks out of the period over the summer recess from the end of July to mid October.</p>
	<p pid="c.69W.3/3">Assuming that the aim would be to complete most projects in the shorter recess, the overall additional cost of an early September two-week return might be in the order of 15 per cent. (an additional &pound;2.5 million across both Houses or &pound;1.5 million for the Commons) of the cost of recess works in a normal summer. The additional costs would arise primarily from the need to increase evening and weekend working to complete projects more quickly.</p>
	<p pid="c.69W.3/4">This figure for 2006 is substantially higher than the figure of &pound;90,000 for additional works costs in 2003 and 2004 given in my written answer of <phrase class="date" code="2006-07-05">5 July 2006</phrase>, <i> Official Report,</i> column 1083W, because it is impossible to determine with any accuracy what the actual costs of alternative contracts might have been. The &pound;90,000 refers only to direct costs incurred in tidying up for the return including the dismantling of scaffolding and essential health and safety issues.</p>
	<p pid="c.69W.3/5">There are also substantial but unquantifiable long-term costs and risks involved in delaying some projects and not tackling the backlog of maintenance work required for the parliamentary estate. The Parliamentary Estates Board has expressed the view that the Palace structure and infrastructure will need a higher level of maintenance and refurbishment over the next few years to halt further deterioration in its condition. Key elements are the needs for a major overhaul of the cast iron roofs, renewal of much of the internal infrastructure of pipes and cabling, fire compartmentation and automatic fire detection systems, and further stone restoration. It is unlikely that this can be completed effectively if all the work is confined to recesses, whether or not there are September sittings.</p>
	<p pid="c.69W.3/6">It is not possible meaningfully to identify other additional costs arising from September sittings because major costs including accommodation and staffing continue throughout the year irrespective of whether or not the House is sitting. The overall daily resource cost of running the House administration in 2005-06 was &pound;560,000.</p>
	<p pid="c.69W.3/7">The cost of the two-day emergency recall in September 1998 was estimated at the time to have cost about &pound;375,000 in works costs. There were other staff costs, mainly for security and some overtime, amounting to &pound;33,200&mdash;<phrase class="date" code="1998-10-22">22 October 1998</phrase>, <i> Official Report,</i> column 1189.</p>

	<p pid="c.70W.2/3">Following a resolution of the House on <phrase class="date" code="2005-01-26">26 January 2005</phrase>, the House of Commons Commission was authorised to fund the publication and distribution of a new voters' guide.

The Modernisation and Administration Committees were consulted on the design and content of Voting Times prior to final approval being given by the Commission on <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-24">24 April 2006</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="c.70W.2/4">A further programme of research with recipients of the guide is currently under way to determine its effectiveness and any potential areas of improvement. This research will be completed by the new year. In addition, the House of Commons Information Office would welcome suggestions and feedback from hon. Members to improve future versions of the publication.</p>

	<p pid="c.87W.11/4">The administrators have a statutory duty to report to the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry if they consider that the conduct of any of the directors makes them unfit to be the directors of a limited company. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State then has a discretionary power to seek to have the directors disqualified if it appears to him to be in the public interest.</p>
	<p pid="c.87W.11/5">Also, directors do not enjoy absolute immunity from personal liability where a company goes into liquidation. If there is evidence in liquidation cases to indicate that there has been fraudulent or wrongful trading, a liquidator can ask the court to declare that those responsible should make a personal contribution towards the assets of the company.</p>
	<p pid="c.87W.11/6">My right hon. Friend hopes hon. Members will appreciate that these are very early days in the administration. If any Member has constituents with concerns about the conduct of the company's affairs, they should contact the administrators.</p>
	<p pid="c.87W.11/7">My right hon. Friend has also asked officials to make further inquiries as to the circumstances of the company's failure.</p>
	<p pid="c.87W.11/8">My right hon. Friend has been discussing with the British Retail Consortium the possibility of their members making some form of goodwill gesture to the customers of Farepak who have lost the money they had been saving towards Christmas. I am pleased to say that the BRC have accepted in principle this suggestion, given the exceptional circumstances, and are contacting their members to consider further the practical steps required. This will not be a compensation package, and members of the BRC are under no legal obligation to provide any help, but they have had a lot of interest from many large retailers, who are keen to try and do something, and I am grateful to them for their co-operation.</p>

	<p pid="c.94W.0/1">The Employment Equality (Age) Regulations 2006 introduce a default retirement age of 65 together with procedures whereby the employee has a right to request that he or she be allowed to continue in work beyond the employer's normal retirement age. The employer has a duty to consider this request, and if both the employer and employee agree then the employee can continue in work. This will move towards a culture where a retirement decision is influenced by the individual circumstances and preferences of employers and employees, rather than an assumption about the norm. These arrangements were introduced in order to deliver the Government's labour market objectives recognising the need for workforce planning and avoiding adverse impact on the provision of occupational pensions and other work-related benefits.</p>
	<p pid="c.94W.0/2">In March this year we published the Survey of Employers' Policies, Practices, and Preferences Relating to Age that will provide the baseline for assessing the impact of the Employment Equality (Age) Regulations 2006. Once the legislation has bedded in, we intend to carry out a follow-up survey, to inform the review of the default retirement age in 2011. We will also explore, with the Office for National Statistics and the Department for Work and Pensions, the process for collating better statistical data on employee retirement intentions and behaviour.</p>
	<p pid="c.94W.0/3">The default retirement age has been developed as a result of extensive consultation. We have been interested in how other countries have approached age discrimination and seeing what lessons we could draw on. However, we have developed legislation that is right for Britain and which takes into account our own particular domestic and economic circumstances.</p>

	<p pid="c.102W.3/1">Equalised maintenance packages for the RAF's Harrier GR7/9 fleet were introduced in 2005. This has improved aircraft availability by an average of two aircraft per day. The airworthiness of the aircraft is also considered to have benefited from equalised maintenance packages but this aspect has yet to be quantified. The total technical support and man hour requirement of the new scheduled maintenance cycle is similar to the previous arrangements, albeit delivered more effectively; accordingly, there have been no measurable cost savings to date.</p>
	<p pid="c.102W.3/2">Equalised maintenance packages are currently being introduced for the RAF's Nimrod MR2/R1 fleet. At this stage it is too early to measure accurately the full benefits of this change, but it is forecast that the new scheduled maintenance regime will deliver significant improvements in aircraft availability, and financial savings of approximately &pound;2 million per annum from financial year 2008-09. Before implementing this change a full safety assessment was carried out on the Nimrod MR2/R1 fleet and further safety assessments will be undertaken as the transition to equalised maintenance moves forward.</p>

The board of inquiry is under way and it would be inappropriate to speculate on the cause of the crash. Given that the crew had, however, received indications of a fire it was deemed prudent to conduct a fleet-wide examination of areas where flammable materials (such as fuel or hydraulic fluid) may be placed in relative proximity to potential sources of ignition should a leak occur. These examinations included visual inspections of the inboard wing and bomb bay areas, and pressurised functional and leak checks of the aircraft's fuel system.</p>

	<p pid="c.118W.2/2">The relevant target, as set out in the 2002 cross-cutting review into the role of the third sector in public service delivery is:</p>
	<p pid="c.118W.2/3" class="indent">&quot;Funders should recognise that it is legitimate for providers to include the relevant element of overheads in their cost estimates for providing a given service under service agreement or contract&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="c.118W.2/4">The associated recommended action was that by April 2006, all Departments and agencies should recognise that it is legitimate for organisations to include relevant elements of overheads when seeking funding or bidding for contracts. Her Majesty's Treasury's Invest to Save programme now reflects full cost recovery in its bidding rounds; the Department of Health's third sector commissioning taskforce report emphasises the importance of reflecting the full cost of services in grants and contracts, and as set out in the Local Government White Paper, the Department of Communities and Local Government is working with local authorities to ensure relevant Compact principles (including full cost recovery) are reflected in local government finance codes.</p>
	<p pid="c.118W.2/5">The principle of full cost recovery and funding of legitimate overheads is reinforced in &quot;Improving Financial Relationship with the third sector: Guidance to Funders and Purchasers&quot; published jointly by Her Majesty's Treasury, the Cabinet Office, The Office for Government Commerce and the National Audit Office on <phrase class="date" code="2006-05-15">15 May 2006</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="c.118W.2/6">We recognise there is further to go in ensuring that full cost recovery is fully implemented in practice. Further details of the Government's work in this area will be set out in the Office of the Third Sector's Public Service Delivery Action Plan later this year. In addition, the independent Commissioner for the Compact will champion implementation of the Compact principles at all levels, national, regional and local, including those relating to sound funding and procurement practice.</p>

	<p pid="c.129W.3/1">The judicial pension schemes make provision for the immediate payment of accrued pension benefits to judges who are required to retire on grounds of ill health. Under the 1993 Judicial Pension Scheme there is an enhancement of service in the event of ill-health retirement prior to the age of 65. According to the available information, about 9.7 per cent. of judicial retirements in the period between 1992-93 and 2005-06 have been on health grounds. In the first six months of 2006-07 the corresponding figure has been 8.8 per cent.</p>

However, it is not possible to publish robust estimates of the number of incidents of graffiti due to the relatively low incidence and thus high variability of the estimates.</p>
	<p pid="c.129W.10/3">Criminal damage measures from the BCS are published in line with those from recorded crime, and thus will be reviewed if any changes are made to police statistics. We will explore whether police recorded crime returns could be amended to include the information requested, without placing an undue burden on police forces. The reviews of crime statistics (Statistics Commission and Smith, forthcoming) may also affect how measurements of criminal damage and graffiti are made in future years of the BCS and police recorded crime statistics.</p>

	<p pid="c.160W.3/1">Good progress has been made in rolling out the national bowel cancer screening programme.</p>
	<p pid="c.160W.3/2">The programme consists of five programme hubs across England who will invite men and women to participate in the screening programme, send out the faecal occult blood (FOB) testing kits, analyse the returned kits and send out results. Ninety to 100 local screening centres will provide endoscopy services for the 2 per cent, of men and women who have a positive FOB test result.</p>
	<p pid="c.160W.3/3">The five hubs have been confirmed as:</p>
	<p pid="c.160W.3/4" class="indent">Rugby&mdash;West Midlands and the North West - began operations in July 2006;</p>
	<p pid="c.160W.3/5" class="indent">Guildford&mdash;Southern - began operations in September 2006;</p>
	<p pid="c.160W.3/6" class="indent">St Mark's&mdash;London - begins operations in October 2006;</p>
	<p pid="c.160W.3/7" class="indent">Gateshead&mdash;North East; and</p>
	<p pid="c.160W.3/8" class="indent">Nottingham&mdash;Eastern.</p>
	<p pid="c.160W.3/9">All five hubs will be operational by March 2007.</p>
	<p pid="c.160W.3/10">In addition to the hubs, the first six local screening centres have now been confirmed. Wolverhampton and Norwich began sending out invitations in July 2006, and South Devon and Liverpool began sending out invitations in September 2006. St Mark's London is due to begin sending out invitations in October 2006, with St George's London following in November 2006. The other eight sites due to become local screening centres in wave one of the programme, in 2006-07, will be confirmed as soon as possible, when they have satisfied quality and capacity criteria.</p>
	<p pid="c.160W.3/11">We will be writing to the new strategic health authorities (SHAs) shortly for them to bid for their local endoscopy units to become local screening centres as part of wave two of the programme in 2007-08. It is up to SHAs to decide where local screening centres should be located for the benefit of their own populations.</p>
	<p pid="c.160W.3/12">Over 4,550 people have been screened since the start of the national programme.</p>
	<p pid="c.160W.3/13">The bowel cancer screening programme is an ambitious project, and one of the first of its kind in Europe. Full national roll-out in England is expected by December 2009 and when fully implemented, around two million men and women in their 60s will be screened every two years. We are committed to implementing this important programme.</p>

	<p pid="c.162W.0/1">In October 2005, Professor Mike Richards, the national cancer director, wrote to all cancer networks to identify the current level of HER2 testing and to inform them that they would need to put arrangements for HER2 testing in place.</p>
	<p pid="c.162W.0/2">This exercise confirmed that access to HER2 testing facilities was patchy and few networks were testing all women with early breast cancer to determine their HER2 status.</p>
	<p pid="c.162W.0/3">In March 2006, the national cancer director sought a progress report from cancer networks. This showed that there had been a significant improvement in the number of cancer networks providing HER2 testing for all women diagnosed with early breast cancer.</p>

	<p pid="c.164W.0/2">It is not possible to supply a like for like comparison of budgets in 2005-06 and 2006-07 because, as a consequence of the review of 2006-07 budgets, responsibility and resource for a significant proportion have been transferred to the national health service via strategic health authorities.

Under the new contract arrangements PCTs agree with providers a specified annual level of NHS dental treatment. The provider is committed under the contract to providing this level of service&mdash;he or she may do this personally or through other dentists he or she employs (they must however be listed within the PCT contract as potential performers of NHS services). 4. Most NHS dentists do some private work. Figures provided do not take into account the proportion of NHS work undertaken by dentists.  5. Figures for the numbers of dentists at specified dates may vary depending on the date the figures are compiled.

	<p pid="c.172W.14/1">The Government's vision is that women should have easy access to supportive, high quality maternity services, designed around their individual needs and those of their babies. Any decisions about reconfiguration of services should be made at local level as local commissioners and managers are in the best position to determine the needs of their local population. Reconfiguration does not necessarily mean reducing service capacity&mdash;but rather affords local managers the opportunity to build local services that are fit to deliver 21st century maternity care, recognising the fact that services may need to be delivered differently, and in different locations&mdash;for example in community based settings. By 2009, all women will have choice over where and how they have their baby, from a range of settings, including hospitals, midwifery led units and at home. A homebirth or a birth in a midwifery led unit, should be a realistic option for all women with uncomplicated pregnancies. The choices offered to women should fall within the safety net of an emergency network that: is readily available, should the need arise.</p>

	<p pid="c.173W.5/1">The Secretary of State received referrals affecting maternity and paediatric services in Teesside from the joint overview scrutiny committee (JOSC) chaired by the Middlesbrough borough council covering the local authorities of Middlesbrough, Redcar and Cleveland, Stockton, Hartlepool, North Yorkshire and Durham on <phrase class="date" code="2006-07-07">7 July 2006</phrase> and the Stockton overview and scrutiny committee (OSC) on <phrase class="date" code="2006-07-03">3 July 2006</phrase>. In addition, Hartlepool borough council's adult and community services and health scrutiny forum also wrote to her on the same subject on <phrase class="date" code="2006-07-31">31 July</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="c.173W.5/2">Both the OSCs and the JOSC respectively stated that they felt that the proposals to reconfigure maternity services were not in the best interests of the local population.</p>
	<p pid="c.173W.5/3">The views expressed in each of the referrals was fully taken into consideration in the Secretary of State's request to the Independent Reconfiguration Panel (IRP) to undertake a review of maternity and paediatric services in Teesside.</p>
	<p pid="c.173W.5/4">For the JOSC, the rationale is to retain a consultant-led maternity and paediatric service on both the North Tees and Hartlepool hospital sites. For the Stockton OSC, the principle of centralisation of these services on to one site was accepted, with a view that this could only be based at North Tees (Stockton). The Hartlepool borough council supported centralisation of these services on one site with a view that these could only be based at Hartlepool.</p>
	<p pid="c.173W.5/5">The advice from the local NHS (the North East Strategic Health Authority) was that the two issues of centralisation and location of services needed recognition and resolution. The strategic health authority's view is that centralisation of consultant-led services to form one service within the trust is essential, and two separate consultant-led services as advocated by the JOSC are unsustainable. The issue is therefore one of where to locate these services.</p>
	<p pid="c.173W.5/6">In light of the differing views expressed by the local OSCs to her, the Secretary of State wrote to the IRP asking them for their advice on <phrase class="date" code="2006-09-22">22 September 2006</phrase>. A copy of this letter has been placed in the Library.</p>

	<p pid="c.174W.2/1">The Government's vision for woman-focused, family-centred care as well as choice in maternity services is pivotal to the maternity standard of the national service framework for children, young people and maternity services. The standard requires national health service maternity care providers and primary care trusts to ensure that the range of ante-natal, birth and post-birth care services available locally provides real choice for women (including home births) and that local options for midwife-led care will include midwife-led units in the community or on a hospital site to all women who have been appropriately assessed.</p>
	<p pid="c.174W.2/2">In its manifesto, the Government made a commitment that, by 2009, all women will have choice over where and how they have their baby and this should include offering services in a range of settings, including hospitals, midwife-led units and at home. The choices offered to women should ensure access to an emergency network that is readily available, should the need arise. The Government have further demonstrated its commitment to choice in maternity in the White Paper &quot;Our Health, Our Care, Our Say&quot;, published on <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-30">30 January</phrase> this year, which pledges to raise the profile of maternity services and encourages doctors to support birth choices.</p>
	<p pid="c.174W.2/3">Ultimately, decisions about the patterns of maternity service delivery are matters for local NHS trusts to determine, taking into account local population needs, priorities and resources.</p>

	<p pid="c.175W.0/2">The child and adolescent mental health services (CAMHS) mapping exercise for 2005 found that in 2004-05 the total spend on specialist CAMHS by the NHS and local authorities was &pound;431 million. Further information on expenditure on CAMHS can be found at <a href="http://www.camhsmapping.org.uk/2005">www.camhsmapping.org.uk/2005</a>.</p>

	<p pid="c.175W.3/1">Following a number of high profile homicides by people with a mental illness the Home Secretary and the Secretary of State for Health asked for an assessment of what actions could be taken to prevent such tragedies.</p>
	<p pid="c.175W.3/2">In October 2005, as part of a broader programme of work, the Department of Health Risk Management Programme commissioned Professor Anthony Maden, as an acknowledged international expert on risk in mental health, to review independent homicide inquiry reports relating to patients with severe mental illness and a history of violence and report on the lessons services could learn to help avoid such tragedies.</p>
	<p pid="c.175W.3/3">The terms of reference of the work, case selection criteria and outputs were agreed between Professor Maden, the national director for mental health Professor Louis Appleby and departmental officials. Departmental Ministers have not met Professor Maden to discuss the work.</p>
	<p pid="c.175W.3/4">Cases were selected from the database of the National Confidential Inquiry into Suicide and Homicide by People with Mental Illness using the following criteria:</p>
	<p pid="c.175W.3/5" class="indent">a current patient of the NHS mental health services in England and Wales committing a homicide during the last 10 years;</p>

	<p pid="c.175W.3/9">The data were used to complete the HCR20, a structured clinical assessment of violence risk, for each case. The findings were then used to draw practical conclusions as to how clinical services can better manage violence risk in patients with major mental illness and a previous risk of violence.</p>

	<p pid="c.176W.2/1">Information is not available in the requested format.</p>
	<p pid="c.176W.2/2">The Department makes revenue allocations to primary care trusts (PCTs), but not to mental health trusts. Allocations were first made to PCTs in 2003-04, but prior to this funding was allocated to health authorities. Information has been placed in the Library.</p>
	<p pid="c.176W.2/3">Information on expenditure by each PCT on commissioning of mental illness services in each of the last five years for which data are available has been placed in the Library.</p>
	<p pid="c.176W.2/4">The data excludes social care spend on people with mental health problems, and expenditure concerning people treated in primary care. It should be noted that some commissioning expenditure would also have been undertaken by health authorities, particularly in 2000-01 and 2001-02. The figures therefore underestimate the total mental health expenditure.</p>
	<p pid="c.176W.2/5">Some primary care trusts may have local arrangements in respect of commissioning. For example, North and South Peterborough PCTs have an arrangement whereby the commissioning of health care expenditure in the area is by North Peterborough only. This produces a degree of variance year on year.</p>
	<p pid="c.176W.2/6">In order to gain a more comprehensive picture of mental health spend, the Department commissioned national surveys of investment in mental health services in each year since 2001. The reports of five surveys covering the period from 2000-01 to 2005-06 are available from the Department's website at <a href="http://www.dh.gov.uk">www.dh.gov.uk</a>.</p>

	<p pid="c.178W.8/1">Necrotising enterocolitis (NEC) is a serious gastrointestinal disease seen principally in neonatal intensive care units. The Medical Research Council funded researchers at the Institute of Child Health to undertake a study with the objective of establishing the incidence of necrotising enterocolitis, to determine whether early diet influenced its onset and severity. The study ran from October 1993 to October 1994 and used the surveillance system set up by the British paediatric surveillance unit. The outcome data highlighted the benefits of breast feeding adding weight to the view, based now on several lines of evidence that the inclusion of human milk in the diets of preterm infants may be clinically beneficial. The Government are fully committed to the promotion of breastfeeding as the best form of nutrition for infants and recommends exclusive breastfeeding for the first six months of life, followed by continued breastfeeding with appropriate types and amounts of complementary foods.</p>
	<p pid="c.178W.8/2">We are aware that the Health Technology Assessment, which researches health interventions of diseases, has a project soon to be commissioned that relates to prevention of the condition. The title is &quot;Early administration to preterm infants of Bifidobacterium breve strain BBG to prevent infection and necrotising enterocolitis&quot;.</p>

	<p pid="c.184W.5/2">The Government believe that people have a range of opportunities for having real influence over their health and social care services. A stronger local voice, copies of which are available in the Library, set out plans for developing local involvement networks (LINks), which would be set up to gather the views and experiences of people on their health and social care services.</p>
	<p pid="c.184W.5/3">One of the fundamental strengths of LINks is that they will relate to both health and social care, providing a joined up way of considering the entire patient journey. They are therefore not limited to the remit of patient forums, which focused solely on health issues. In addition, the intention is that LINks should have a flexible structure so that they can best adapt to local circumstances.</p>

	<p pid="c.185W.11/1">Most patients who would previously have been treated at Ravenscourt Park Hospital will receive treatment at Charing Cross, St. Mary's, Northwick Park and West Middlesex Hospitals. These hospitals initially referred patients to Ravenscourt Park Hospital. From January 2006 patients in England have been able to expect their general practitioners to offer them choice from four or more national health service trusts or other service providers commissioned by their primary care trusts so people formerly referred to Ravenscourt Park could have gone to other places as well.</p>

	<p pid="c.186W.2/1">This was a local decision.</p>
	<p pid="c.186W.2/2">I understand that the decision to close Ravenscourt Park hospital was taken by the Hammersmith hospitals national health service trust after detailed financial and predicted patient analysis. Having successfully reduced waits for orthopaedic services in north west London the extra capacity offered by Ravenscourt Park hospital is no longer required. Improved efficiency and reduced waiting lists now mean that north west London has more capacity than it needs to achieve the 18-week target and to provide patients with a range of choice over where they are treated.</p>

	<p pid="c.187W.2/1">This is a local matter. However, officials have been advised by National Health Service London that an additional population increase is anticipated as a direct result of the Thames Gateway development in north east London, which includes Stratford City, and that all of the hospitals in north east London will be affected by this population increase.</p>
	<p pid="c.187W.2/2">Departmental officials work closely with Department for Communities and Local Government on the development of the Thames Gateway and are currently liaising on the development of a cross-government Thames Gateway strategic framework, which will set out further action to support this housing growth area.</p>
	<p pid="c.187W.2/3">I understand that considerable analysis has been done by the local NHS as to how demand will change as a result of this increase and how it will be met. It should also be noted that this growth will take place alongside natural population growth of a similar magnitude.</p>
	<p pid="c.187W.2/4">The revenue allocations to primary care trusts for 2006-07 and 2007-08 include projected increases in populations. This means we are using the best available population data which properly takes account of the challenges faced in areas with growing populations.</p>

It will continue to be taught at primary and post-primary level and provision is made for its delivery through personal development. By the end of Key Stage 3 pupils should have developed an awareness of emergency first aid procedures and have the understanding and skills to develop preventative strategies in relation to accidents in the home, school and on the road.</p>

	<p pid="c.196W.2/1">There are no statistics on the number of plastic bags produced or used in Northern Ireland. However, UK figures show UK consumers use an estimated 10 billion plastic bags a year.

	<p pid="c.196W.2/2">The Department of the Environment is committed to a DEFRA led initiative to produce a UK-wide voluntary code of practice for retailers aimed at reducing the number of plastic and paper bags given to customers. It is hoped that all the major retailers will sign up to the code and agree to set targets for a reduction in the number of disposable bags handed out at the point of sale. The Department also supports a number of other initiatives including Baglady Productions' NEEDabag 2 project which aims to encourage alternatives to plastic bags, promote recycling, encourage people to refuse plastic bags and increase awareness of all issues relating to litter and waste and the &quot;Wake up to Waste&mdash;Reduce, Reuse, Recycle&quot; campaign aimed at raising consumer awareness of waste management issues and the part each person can play in reducing the amount of waste we produce.</p>

During these discussions Ofsted visited the school and noted it had made satisfactory progress since it was placed in special measures and good progress since the previous monitoring inspection. It was not, therefore, a strong candidate for a Fresh Start, which is normally reserved for intractable cases of failure. Although the school could not be supported with additional Fresh Start funding under the programme's criteria, the local authority took the decision to close the school in August 2006 and it reopened as Willow Brook Primary in September with a new head teacher.</p>

	<p pid="c.212W.8/2">There are two main routes by which we publish post-16 attainment results at institutional level. These are the achievement and attainment tables (AAT) for 16, 17 and 18-year-olds and the further education benchmarking data published by the Learning and Skills Council (LSC).</p>
	<p pid="c.212W.8/3">The post-16 achievement and attainment tables provide information on the achievement and attainment of sixth-form students in their local secondary schools and further education sector colleges, and how they compare with other schools and colleges in the area and in England as a whole. The tables report the achievement of 16, 17 and 18-year-olds that have completed advanced level studies. Students are reported against the institution where they are on roll.</p>
	<p pid="c.212W.8/4">Each entry in the forthcoming 2006 tables will provide information about the achievement and attainment of students over the 2004/05 and 2005/06 academic years in general and vocational A and AS level examinations and equivalent level 3 qualifications. The most recently published tables for 2005 cover the 2003/04 and 2004/05 academic years and are published by DfES through the following web-link:</p>

	<p pid="c.212W.8/6">In addition the Learning and Skills Council (LSC) publish figures for individual further education institutions on their website, including further education colleges, sixth-form colleges, specialist designated colleges and external institutions. The data cover learners of all ages.</p>
	<p pid="c.212W.8/7">Figures relating to retention, achievement and overall success rates are published for every institution broken down by demographic groups such as age, gender, ethnicity and disability status.</p>
	<p pid="c.212W.8/8">The LSC also publish institution level retention, achievement and success rates that differentiate between courses based on their sector subject area (e.g. social sciences vs. arts, media and publishing), length of course, and for those courses that last more than 24 weeks the level of the course in terms of NVQ equivalence.</p>

	<p pid="c.219W.2/3">In the case of the SIPs programme, there is a quality assurance framework covering both the initial accreditation and impact of SIPs. This framework together with the progress reports have been shared with all local authorities (LAs) who are responsible for the delivery of the SIPs programme, as well as representatives of the teaching profession who form part of a wider consultative group.</p>
	<p pid="c.219W.2/4">The Department uses a variety of mechanisms for evaluating quality, progress and impact of the national strategies including: the strategies' own quality assurance processes; Ofsted; the Prime Ministers delivery unit on specific aspects of delivery; and externally commission evaluations from research organisations such as the National Foundation for Education Research (NfER).</p>

	<p pid="c.221W.2/1">The Department does not routinely collect information on individual laboratories. However, we are committed to improving accommodation for teaching and learning science.</p>
	<p pid="c.221W.2/2">Funding for investment in schools is &pound;5.9 billion this year and it will rise to over &pound;8 billion by 2010-11. Much of this funding can be used to improve school laboratories where this is the local priority.</p>
	<p pid="c.221W.2/3">Building Schools for the Future will in time renew all secondary schools including their science provision. Already about 350 schools have been prioritised in the first three waves, and we aim to include up to a further 600 schools in the next three waves. We also aim to have 200 academies open or in the pipeline by 2010. In all, by 2010 almost a third of all secondary schools will be funded to improve their facilities, including their science laboratories. In the meantime, where there is urgent need, all schools have access to the other funding available including the capital devolved to authorities and to schools.</p>
	<p pid="c.221W.2/4">We are providing the resources to improve school laboratories where this is the priority. What is now important is to ensure that science facilities in schools are designed to meet curriculum needs and inspire excellent teaching and learning. &quot;Project Faraday&quot; has been launched to address this need. It will bring together teams of leading designers and educationalists with specialist interest in, and practical knowledge of, the teaching and learning of science to develop a range of exemplar designs by mid 2007. Project Faraday also aims to build a range of science demonstration projects that will provide practical examples of excellent facilities to act as benchmarks and to disseminate the learning.

	<p pid="c.223W.0/1">Under section 10 of the Children Act 2004 all local authorities and 'relevant partners', including health, are under a duty to improve a child's well-being. This underpins the children's trust approach. Local priorities for action, including speech and language provision, will be informed by a needs assessment which will be carried out in partnership by all involved in the planning process.</p>
	<p pid="c.223W.0/2">Local authorities themselves have a critical role in co-ordinating, commissioning and brokering services such as speech and language therapy. They develop multi-agency teams to work in partnership through Sure Start Children's Centres, other early years providers and extended schools to respond to the needs of individual children. When a practitioner in an early years setting identifies a child in need of specialist provision, support will be available from the local authority.</p>
	<p pid="c.223W.0/3">We have put in place various measures to support local authorities and settings intervene early on speech and language difficulties. These include the following.</p>
	<p pid="c.223W.0/4" class="indent">The Joint Planning and Commissioning Framework for Children, Young People, and Maternity Services, published in March 2006, aims to help local partners put in place a unified planning and commissioning system. The framework supports integrated working on improving outcomes and making best use of resources, and will join up services so that children and young people with multiple needs experience a seamless service.</p>
	<p pid="c.223W.0/5" class="indent">Early years practice will be delivered through the Early Years Foundation Stage (EYFS), a high quality framework for learning and care which all registered settings will be required to work within. It is being developed to allow early years practitioners to meet the individual needs of all children in their care, enabling them to take into account the particular needs of each child. Practitioners must provide relevant, developmental-appropriate learning opportunities and set realistic and challenging expectations that meet the diverse needs of babies and young children.</p>
	<p pid="c.223W.0/6" class="indent">Supporting this practice, the Early Support Programme&mdash;a DFES/RNID led partnership aimed at co-ordinating services for young disabled children or children with SEN aged 0 to 5&mdash;has also, in partnership with the Royal College of Speech and Language Therapists, developed a wide range of practical resources and training materials that can support the communication needs of children. This is available to local authorities and to settings.</p>
	<p pid="c.223W.0/7" class="indent">The Sure Start Children's Centre practice guidance, first issued in November 2005, recognises the importance of speech and languages support, and covers development of this in detail, demonstrating how it improves children's outcomes. We have based the guidance on experiences of centres themselves and evidence highlighted through evaluation and research. The guidance explains the key role children's centres can play in the positive promotion of children's speech and language development, and offers advice and guidance on delivery and good practice.</p>
	<p pid="c.223W.0/8">Although not focused directly on speech and language, the Early Years Transition and Special Educational Needs (EYTSEN) project, conducted in association with the Effective Practice in Pre-school Education (EPPE) longitudinal study, concluded in 2003 that pre-school provision was an effective intervention for reducing SEN, including communication difficulties, especially for the most disadvantaged and vulnerable children. The National Evaluation of Sure Start has been assessing the interventions made by Sure Start Local Programmes on young children's language development. The results of this will be available next year.</p>

	<p pid="c.240W.2/2" class="italic"> Letter from Karen Dunnell, dated <phrase class="date" code="2006-10-30">30 October 2006</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="c.240W.2/3" class="indent">As National Statistician, I have been asked to reply to your recent Parliamentary Question what the (a) average wage for (i) full-time male, (ii) full-time female, (iii) part time male and (iv) part time female employees and (b) average household income for working age households was for working age households was in the Peterborough City Council area in (A) cash and (B) constant price terms in each of the last 10 years. (97518).</p>
	<p pid="c.240W.2/4" class="indent">Currently average earnings are estimated from the Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings (ASHE), and are provided for employees on adult rates of pay whose pay was unaffected by absence during the pay period. This is the standard definition used for ASHE. The ASHE does not collect data on the self employed and people who do unpaid work. I have attached tables containing statistics on earnings from the ASHE for the years 1997-2006 for the Peterborough City Council area. The second table shows these earnings statistics expressed in 2006 prices by uprating with the Retail Price Index (RPI).</p>
	<p pid="c.240W.2/5" class="indent">Average household income for working age households by council area is not available. Household income statistics for all households in the UK, based on the Family Resources Survey, are produced by the Department of Work and Pensions. Additionally the Office for National Statistics has produced statistics for wards for 2001-02 only. These estimates are based on a statistical model and are experimental statistics&mdash;they have been developed in accordance with the principles set out in the National Statistics Code of Practice but are not accredited as National Statistics.</p>
	<p pid="c.240W.2/6" class="indent">The ASHE, carried out in April of each year, is the most comprehensive source of earnings information in the United Kingdom. It is a one per cent sample of all employees who are members of pay-as-you-earn (PAYE) schemes, but because of its sampling frame, it has difficulty capturing data on people with very low pay. It is therefore likely to under-represent relatively low paid staff earning below the tax threshold.</p>

This report recommends that the future EU Special Representative (EUSR) will play a central coordinating role amongst the international community in BiH. We expect that the future EUSR will be mandated to engage with BiH politicians and other interlocutors in order to facilitate the reform process and help to maintain peace and stability.

In Bogota, I called on the Vice President, Foreign Minister and Defence Minister to discuss current co-operation and the Colombian government's own serious commitment to this task. I emphasised in all meetings the importance which the UK attaches to co-operation to tackle the drugs problem, the essential nature of strict adherence to international human rights standards and the need for Colombia to develop its democracy and economy. All interlocutors gave clear commitments on these important issues. I also met a number of Colombian police and military personnel who are directly engaged in tackling drugs trafficking and which the UK supports, in particular through a number of training projects including bomb disposal, de-mining and rules of engagement. It is not our practice to name those involved in operational matters, nor to make public any records of discussions of operational matters. The UK will continue to support the Colombian authorities, where we consider it appropriate to do so and where we can be satisfied that our co-operation serves to develop human rights-compatible law enforcement in Colombia.</p>

	<p pid="c.247W.0/3">My noble Friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, Lord Triesman of Tottenham, also raised human rights issues with the Government of Colombia when he visited the country in September this year. He met a range of interlocutors, including the Minister of Defence and Minister of Interior, as well as representatives from civil society, non-governmental organisations, trade unions, the business community and the Colombian armed forces. During his meetings he emphasised the importance the UK attaches to respect for human rights. He raised our concerns about a range of human rights issues in Colombia and encouraged the Colombian authorities to continue in their efforts to improve the human rights situation. The UK will continue to work with civil society organisations and the Colombian authorities to help achieve this and we support a number of projects related to security sector reform and human rights in this respect.</p>

The proposal, as amended by the Council, would deregulate all pre-packaged products except wines and spirits, though member states which currently maintain quantity restrictions on milk, butter, pasta, or coffee, or on white sugar, would be able to retain these for a transitional period of five years (six for white sugar). The United Kingdom supports this proposal, which is a valuable step towards simplifying the corpus of EU legislation and removing out of date restrictions.

We are in close contact with the UN Secretariat on their response and have protested directly to President Bashir. We call upon the Sudanese Government to reconsider their decision.</p>
