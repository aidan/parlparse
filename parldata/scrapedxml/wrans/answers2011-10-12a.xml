	<p pid="a.371W.5/1">The Department's review of default speed limits is focused on the national motorway speed limit. It is not actively reviewing the national 30 mph speed limit for built up (lit) roads, the 60 mph limit for non-built up single carriageway roads or the 70 mph limit for non-built up dual carriageway all purpose roads.</p>
	<p pid="a.371W.5/2">In the course of considering the national motorway speed limit, the case for parallel changes on sections of high standard dual carriageway all purpose trunk roads is being considered.</p>

	<p pid="a.377W.8/1">Local engagement is particularly important in crime and policing and it is up to the relevant authorities in a local area to determine how to allocate resources, including whether to adopt participatory budgeting. Through the introduction of elected Police and Crime Commissioners (PCCs), the Home Office is strengthening local accountability over how resources are used to tackle crime reduction and policing. PCCs will determine local policing priorities, publish a five-year police and crime plan, set a local precept and set the annual force budget in discussion with chief constables. PCCs will be required to seek the views of local people before deciding how resources are allocated.</p>

	<p pid="a.380W.6/2">It is a key requirement for each of the armed forces to maintain a satisfactory balance of skills, experience, ability and seniority in rank to enable delivery of operational requirements. Despite the reduction in overall numbers of service personnel, and the associated need for a redundancy programme, the armed forces must still recruit and train personnel to replace those who leave the services at the end of their current engagements. In order to maintain that balance each service continues to recruit where personnel are required, including those trades/branches which are historically difficult to fill due to the requirement of specialist qualifications or experience.</p>
	<p pid="a.380W.6/3">The Ministry of Defence has spent &#163;5.19 million for the Army, &#163;2.20 million for the Royal Navy, and &#163;1.85 million for the Royal Air Force on recruitment advertising since May 2010.

	<p pid="a.381W.3/1">NATO remains the cornerstone of UK defence. We see no justification for a permanent EU military Operational Headquarters (OHQ) and would oppose it, whether there is an attempt to create it by Permanent Structural Cooperation (PESCO) or other means. We have been clear that establishment of a permanent OHQ would be a duplication of existing capability provided by NATO, would permanently disassociate the EU from NATO and would be an unnecessary use of resources.</p>
	<p pid="a.381W.3/2">Under the Lisbon treaty, signed by the previous Government, PESCO could be established by qualified majority voting in the European Council following notification from member states wishing to participate in it. However, all decisions made within PESCO are made by unanimity. Therefore, individual member states do not have the ability to veto the establishment of PESCO, but those who participate would have the right to veto any decisions made within it. Regardless of whether PESCO were to be established, the UK retains the ability to veto the launch of any EU operation.</p>

	<p pid="a.384W.2/1">Based on advice from the NHS East of England strategic health authority, we can confirm the following:</p>
	<p pid="a.384W.2/2">The Hinchingbrooke Next Steps project was devised to establish a solution to Hinchingbrooke Health Care NHS Trust's historic debt and secure its long term sustainability. The trust's board recognised that it was unlikely to reach foundation trust status as a standalone organisation or pay back its debt to the taxpayer so, after a public consultation in 2007, a procurement took place to find a suitable partner, using a unique franchise arrangement. On <phrase class="date" code="2010-11-25">25 November 2010</phrase>, following considerable stakeholder engagement, Circle was announced as the recommended bidder to take on the management of Hinchingbrooke and the full business case was sent to the Department and HM Treasury for scrutiny. It is anticipated that a decision regarding the business case will be made very soon.</p>
	<p pid="a.384W.2/3">Circle will manage the hospital but the hospital will trade and provide services as a national health service trust. The trust will therefore be subject to the same quality and standards regulations as all other NHS hospitals.</p>
	<p pid="a.384W.2/4">The board of Hinchingbrooke Health Care NHS Trust will continue to meet in public and publish its agendas and minutes.</p>
	<p pid="a.384W.2/5">Currently, there is no contract between Circle and Hinchingbrooke Health Care NHS Trust. The contract will be signed only when approvals have been received from the Department and HM Treasury. The contract may be made publicly available, subject to commercial confidentiality.</p>
	<p pid="a.384W.2/6">Circle has made a commitment to address the hospital's historic debt. The trust, under Circle's management, may be permitted, subject to normal NHS procedures, to sell its assets. However, any revenue gained would be reinvested within the hospital. As part of the franchise, Circle is committed to maintain the current level of services, as long as commissioners continue to purchase them. This includes accident and emergency and maternity services, a commitment to which was made following the 2007 public consultation, led by the lead commissioner, NHS Cambridgeshire. In the future, if there are proposals to change the services provided at the hospital, they will be subject to public consultation, as they would with any NHS hospital. Circle's plans for the hospital as defined in their bid do not include plans to construct any new facilities.</p>
	<p pid="a.384W.2/7">Under the Hinchingbrooke hospital franchise arrangement, staff will remain employees of the NHS, retaining their terms and conditions. The hospital's assets will remain within the NHS, and patients will continue to receive NHS services.</p>

	<p pid="a.386W.2/1">The Personal Demographics Service (PDS) resides within a fully private network known as N3. The service can only be accessed from within this private network or through centrally managed and assured gateways such as the secure Government network (GCSX). If an attacker manages to gain access to the national health service private N3 network they would then have to break through many separate layers of tiered architecture with each tier being protected by industry grade firewalls of different manufacture to access the database. The firewalls are supported by intrusion detection systems, and other multiple security measures which routinely monitor network traffic and alert upon detection of suspicious activity.</p>
	<p pid="a.386W.2/2">Local access to the PDS is controlled by local organisations and each organisation is legally responsible for compliance with the Data Protection Act and other relevant legislation. This requires that they put in place appropriate technical and organisational measures to prevent unauthorised or unlawful processing of personal data such as that held by the PDS. Organisations with access to the PDS are expected to complete and publish an annual assessment of the adequacy of their safeguards through the NHS Information Governance Toolkit.</p>

Figures do not represent the number of different patients, as a person may have more than one episode of care within the same stay in hospital or in different stays in the same year. <sup>(2)</sup> Time waited statistics from Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) are not the same as the published waiting list statistics. HES provides counts and time waited for all patients admitted to hospital within a given period, whereas the published waiting list statistics count those waiting for treatment on a specific date and how long they have been on the waiting list. Also, HES calculates the time waited as the difference between the admission and decision to admit dates. Unlike published waiting list statistics, this is not adjusted for self-deferrals or periods of medical/social suspension. In order to calculate those who waited more than six months, we have used waits of 182 days or longer. <sup>(3)</sup> In July 2006, the national health service reorganised strategic health authorities (SHAs) and primary care trusts (PCTs) in England from 28 SHAs into 10, and from 303 PCTs into 152.

Changes to the figures over time need to be interpreted in the context of improvements in data quality and coverage (particularly in earlier years), improvements in coverage of independent sector activity (particularly from 2006-07) and changes in NHS practice. For example, apparent reductions in activity may be due to a number of procedures which may now be undertaken in out-patient settings and so no longer include in admitted patient HES data. <i>Source:</i> Hospital Episode Statistics, The Information Centre for health and social care</td> </tr>

The ability of a local authority to provide its data for the purposes of the data matching schemes ends on <phrase class="date" code="2011-11-30">30 November 2011</phrase>.

	<p pid="a.402W.5/3">There is some anecdotal evidence of people entering into polygamous marriage in the UK through religious ceremonies that are not registered by the state and are not recognised under UK law. Due to the fact that these marriages are not legally recognised there is no indication of how many such polygamous relationships exist. Any parties to such relationships do not share the same rights as a legally married couple, such as access to financial remedies available on divorce or inheritance rights on the death of one of the spouses, and are treated as cohabitants. The Government have carried out some work with the Muslim community to encourage mosques to undertake the civil aspects of marriage and to raise awareness of the need for marriages to be legally recognised.</p>

	<p pid="a.412W.2/11">It is not possible to predict the exact cost that would have been saved on extra prisoner escorts while the system was being repaired, as the number of usages can vary month on month. However, as an indication, we calculate that the saving made by using PCVL instead of escorts to court in July 2011, the last full month when the system was fully operational, was &#163;16,400 for the 49 occasions used. September's lower usage of 30 occasions is therefore likely to have saved around 39% less than normal expectations.</p>

	<p pid="a.414W.2/46">Approximately three-fifths of the outstanding employment tribunal caseload related to 'multiple' claims (collections of two or more of these cases are grouped and managed together). They are often legally and factually complex and at any point in time is it common for such cases to be 'stayed', meaning that they are not ready to have a final hearing at that time for some reason; for example due to awaiting the decision of an appellate court on case management or other interim matters.</p>

	<p pid="a.415W.2/1">Her Majesty's Courts and Tribunals Service (HMCTS) hears appeals against Department for Work and Pensions decisions on entitlement to Employment and Support Allowance (ESA) (decisions in which the work capability assessment is a key factor) rather than appeals against work capability assessment decisions themselves.</p>
	<p pid="a.415W.2/2">It is not possible to identify how many staff deal specifically with ESA appeals. The following table shows the number of staff employed by the Social Security and Child Support (SSCS) tribunal (the lowest level to which the figures can be broken down) as at the end of each month between January 2010 and June 2011 (the latest period for which published figures are available). The tribunal hears appeals on a range of benefits, of which ESA is one. There was an increase in headcount of 236 over the time period. Of this, 68 were permanent staff and 168 staff on fixed term contracts. HMCTS disposed of 37,200 SSCS appeals in June 2011, up 55% from 24,100 in January 2010.</p>

We consider that the approach being adopted under the GB Electricity Market Reform is consistent with the EU's vision for decarbonisation and security of supply. We support full integration of the UK energy market with the wider EU electricity market. We are working with the European Commission and other EU stakeholders to ensure that the Electricity Market Reform package is consistent with, and complementary to, developing EU energy policy.</p>
	<p pid="a.420W.6/3">As set out in chapter 2 of the Government's Electricity Market Reform White Paper, the CPF complements the EU ETS by strengthening the carbon price signal in the UK electricity generation sector, enabling higher levels of investment in low-carbon infrastructure and therefore a faster rate of decarbonisation. Going forward, we would support an EU-wide tightening of the EU ETS in order to meet ambitious carbon emission reduction targets in the EU, and to meet the long-term EU objective of reducing emissions by 80% to 95% by 2050.</p>

	<p pid="a.427W.6/1">The current policy is that where an ESA recipient who is found fit for work following a work capability assessment (WCA) subsequently appeals against the decision, they will receive the assessment phase rate of ESA during the appeals process. Therefore, the amount of money the person receives will not change.</p>
	<p pid="a.427W.6/2">Those ESA claimants who appeal the WCA outcome of being placed in the Work Related Activity Group will continue to receive basic-rate ESA plus the work-related activity component until the outcome of the appeal is known.</p>
	<p pid="a.427W.6/3">Where a claimant fails to attend a WCA appointment, benefit entitlement is not automatically withdrawn by a decision maker. It is recognised that there can be genuine reasons for non-attendance, particularly when a claimant's medical condition fluctuates daily to such an extent that it prevents attendance. To identify when such circumstances may apply, a number of provisions and safeguards have been built into the current process.</p>
	<p pid="a.427W.6/4">These provisions ensure decision makers give full consideration to each claimant's particular circumstances before deciding whether benefit entitlement is affected. It is only when a Decision Maker decides a claimant has not shown &quot;good cause&quot; for not attending that entitlement is changed.</p>
	<p pid="a.427W.6/5">Where ESA is disallowed for failing to return the WCA questionnaire or attend for medical examination, ESA is not available pending the outcome of an appeal. This avoids the risk of abuse. If benefit were available in this situation it could be paid indefinitely to people who repeatedly fail to comply. As such, benefit is payable only when the questionnaire is completed and returned or the person attends for examination.</p>
	<p pid="a.427W.6/6">This is different to the situation where a person appeals because they do not agree with a determination, for benefit entitlement purpose's, that they do not have limited capability for work. ESA is available in these cases in recognition that people who disagree with the decision that they do not have limited capability for work would not necessarily wish to work, or present themselves as well enough to work, until their appeal had been decided.</p>
	<p pid="a.427W.6/7">The Department does not collect information in respect of the number of ESA claimants whose benefit has ceased as a result of a failure to attend a WCA or return their medical questionnaire.</p>

The Department regularly publishes official statistics on the employment and support allowance (ESA) work capability assessment at the national level. The latest report, published in July 2011, covers new claimants to ESA for October 2008 to November 2010 (the latest data available) and can be found at: http://research.dwp.gov.uk/asd/workingage/index.php?page=esa_wca 2. The data presented above come from benefit claims data held by the Department for Work and Pensions, functional assessment data from Atos Healthcare and appeals data from the Tribunals Service. 3. Data on appeal includes ESA claims up to the end of May 2010 (the latest month where we have sufficient volumes of appeals heard to include in the publication) where the person claiming has been assessed to be fit for work, they subsequently appeal the Department's decision and the appeal has been heard by Tribunals Service. 4. Due to the time it takes for appeals to be submitted to the Tribunals Service and heard, it is likely that there are more appeals that have not yet been heard. Therefore these figures should be treated as emerging findings rather than final at this stage.</td> </tr>

	<p pid="a.436W.5/1">The following estimates assume that the timetable proposed in the Pensions Bill 2011 is applied until the relevant cap comes into force. The cap is applied until it is either no longer relevant, as the Pensions Bill timetable implies an increase lower than the cap, or a state pension age of 66 is reached.</p>
	<p pid="a.436W.5/2"><i>(a)</i> The cost of capping the increase in state pension age to a maximum of 18 months compared to the change in spend from the current Pensions Bill proposal is estimated at &#163;1.1 billion between 2019-20 and 2020-21.</p>
	<p pid="a.436W.5/3"><i>(b)</i> The cost of capping the increase in state pension age to a maximum of 15 months compared to the change in spend from the current Pensions Bill proposal is estimated at &#163;2.4 billion between 2018-19 and 2020-21.</p>
	<p pid="a.436W.5/4"><i>(c)</i> The cost of capping the increase in state pension age to a maximum of 12 months compared to the change in spend from the current Pensions Bill proposal is estimated at &#163;4.3 billion between 2018-19 and 2020-21.</p>
	<p pid="a.436W.5/5" class="italic">Notes</p>
	<p pid="a.436W.5/6">1. The savings estimates presented are calculated in line with the methodology used to prepare the estimates of DWP AME savings published in the impact assessment presented with the Pensions Bill 2011. They take into account lower spending on pensioner benefits and higher spending on working age benefits and incorporate changes to long-term assumptions following the publication of the Office of Budget Responsibility's July 2011 Fiscal Sustainability report.</p>
	<p pid="a.436W.5/7">2. The estimates are based on the current welfare system. Reliance on income-related pension benefits and working age benefits is assumed to remain in line with current age-specific rates of reliance.</p>
	<p pid="a.436W.5/8">3. A baseline of the state pension age reaching 66 by April 2020 is assumed in line with the proposals set out in the Pensions Bill 2011.</p>

	<p pid="a.439W.5/1">The reassessment of existing incapacity benefits customers using the work capability assessment (WCA) was rolled out nationally from February 2011.</p>
	<p pid="a.439W.5/2">Letters are being issued as planned to 11,000 claimants per week informing them that their reassessment is about to commence. To manage the process smoothly, volumes were gradually ramped up from the end of February, and the numbers reached 11,000 per week in May. As at the end of September 2011, approximately 128,000 WCAs have been completed for IB reassessment claimants. After the WCA, the decision on entitlement to benefit is taken by a DWP decision maker.</p>
	<p pid="a.439W.5/3">The Information on the number of WCAs completed above is from the Department's Management Information System. It relates to those assessments where Atos have made a recommendation based on either a face to face assessment or cleared by scrutiny of the customer's medical questionnaire. It does not include those customers whose WCA recommendations were returned to Job-centre Plus because they had not complied with the process.</p>
	<p pid="a.439W.5/4">A monthly breakdown of the management information is not reliable because the data is captured by week. This means that for those weeks that cross over a month end the data cannot be attributed to any particular calendar month. In addition, as it was never the intention to publish this information, it has not been subject to the same rigorous quality assurance processes that are used for official statistics and as a result they should be used with a degree of caution.</p>
	<p pid="a.439W.5/5">Due to the overall length of the incapacity benefits reassessment process, information on the entire process including the final outcomes and subsequent destinations of claimants being reassessed is not yet available. Individual level data are being collected, but it will take time to complete because of the overall length of the reassessment process. The Department plans to publish data on the outcomes of the reassessment process but only once it has been quality assured and is considered robust.</p>

	<p pid="a.450W.0/1">We have already made clear our policy on the funding of the New Homes Bonus. The full amount of the New Homes Bonus for 2011-12 was met from Department for Communities and Local Government funding. For each of the years 2012-2013, 2013-2014 and 2014-2015, &#163;250 million was allocated to the New Homes Bonus from Department for Communities and Local Government funding. Funding beyond these levels will come from Formula Grant.</p>
	<p pid="a.450W.0/2">Under the provisional 2012-13 Settlement we transferred &#163;176 million from formula grant to fund the New Homes Bonus. Transition grant guarantees that no authority will receive a reduction in its spending power of more than 8.8% in both 2011-2012 and 2012-13.</p>
	<p pid="a.450W.0/3">The New Homes Bonus will ensure that the economic benefits of housing growth are returned to the local area, so encouraging and rewarding the construction of new homes in the north of England and across the Country.</p>

	<p pid="a.454W.0/1">Between September 2010 and August 2011, the CPS reviewed, in accordance with the Code for Crown Prosecutors, a total of 930,457 cases; 46,544 of those cases did not progress because there was not sufficient evidence to proceed to court. The CPS does not hold reliable data which distinguishes the stage of review.</p>
