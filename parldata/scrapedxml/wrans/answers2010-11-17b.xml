	<p pid="b.783W.0/1">In 2009-10, 55% of public service vehicles in Great Britain were fitted with automatic vehicle location (AVL) equipment. However, no estimate is available of the proportion of bus services that are operated by vehicles fitted with such equipment.</p>
	<p pid="b.783W.0/2">In April 2010, the Department for Transport introduced an incentive payment to the Bus Service Operators Grant (BSOG) to support the use of AVL systems in the operation of local bus services. There is no fixed budget for this incentive, as the amount paid each year will depend on the number of buses which meet the eligibility criteria. Since April 2010, the Department has paid around &#163;33,000 for this incentive. We expect that this will increase as more operators submit valid claims. The amount of grant paid over the next three years will depend on the take-up of the incentive by operators.</p>
	<p pid="b.783W.0/3">The Department's approach to improving bus punctuality is based on effective local partnership. Working with local authorities, the Traffic Commissioners, operators and Passenger Focus, the Department has developed a new punctuality regime which recognises the role that local authorities and operators should both play in tackling poor punctuality. The aim is to encourage local authorities and operators to share punctuality data and other relevant information on a voluntary basis to underpin their agreed approach to managing local services. More generally, the Department will work with bus operators to seek to make information on bus punctuality more widely available, but I have no plans to require the publication of composite performance information derived from AVL equipment at present.</p>

Joint legal guidance for prosecutors in the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) and the Serious Fraud Office (SFO) is currently being prepared. This guidance will address how the adequate procedures defence should be approached by prosecutors when it is raised. Prosecutors will also take into account the guidance on adequate procedures which will be issued by the Secretary of State for Justice as required by section 9 of the Act. The defence of adequate procedures applies to 'relevant commercial organisations' as defined under section 7 of the Act; whether any particular body falls within this definition will be considered on the facts in individual cases.</p>

	<p pid="b.790W.0/2">There are currently no plans to conduct a bespoke study into the potential effects on the mental and physical health of children whose parent is deployed on military service in Afghanistan. However, in addition to our Continuous Attitude Surveys, we have strong links with research communities in the UK and allied countries, all of which feed into and help us develop further our welfare policies. The King's Centre for Military Health Research is currently conducting a study to understand better the impact, both the benefits and drawbacks, of military life on the well-being of children of UK Service personnel. In particular the study, which is funded by the US Department of Defense, will examine whether children of military personnel who are suffering from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder are disadvantaged as a result.</p>

This means that for waste which cannot be re-used or recycled, recovery of energy is a preferable route, and that EfW is almost always preferable to landfill (unless analysis of the overall environmental impact, for specific types of waste, shows otherwise). The waste hierarchy will shortly become law through the revised Waste Framework Directive, which seeks to promote waste prevention, increase recycling, and ensure better use of resources, to protect human health and the environment. This will help to underpin the Government's vision of a zero waste economy.</p>

Other UK funding for Gaza since 2007 has supported projects implemented by established and reputable organisations, such as UN agencies, the International Committee of the Red Cross, and international non-governmental organisations like Oxfam, Save the Children and Islamic Relief. We work closely with all partners on project design to ensure that UK funding complies with European Union and UK legislation on terrorist financing.

We will, for example, be looking with interest at the outcomes of local authority innovative SEN projects which are currently under way.

	<p pid="b.803W.5/2"><i> </i>Decisions on Sure Start grant capital funding applications from any individual setting are a matter for the local authority, not the Secretary of State for Education. Ministers are still considering information and evidence from Essex county council concerning its 2010-11 capital programme, as part of the Department's review of each local authority (LA)'s funding to identify areas where savings may need to be found. When a decision has been made, officials will write to the authority informing it of its revised allocation for the year. Once notification of that allocation has been received, it will be for Essex to determine how to distribute the funding in the light of local needs and priorities.</p>

	<p pid="b.804W.3/1">The Government have made clear that our most urgent priority is to tackle the UK's record deficit in order to restore confidence in our economy and support the recovery. In order to tackle the budget deficit all Government Departments have been required to work within a very tight fiscal settlement. Failure to tackle the deficit would have pushed up mortgage rates and made housing less affordable.</p>

	<p pid="b.804W.3/3">Where Private Sector Renewal activities are a local priority, local authorities may chose to direct other funding to provide support packages for vulnerable private sector households. Neither Bolton at Home nor other ALMO would have been direct beneficiaries of funding from this programme.</p>
	<p pid="b.804W.3/4">DCLG has undertaken an equality impact assessment into the end of funding for the Private Sector Renewal programme, in line with our equalities duties, and will be publishing the assessment shortly.</p>

We are also giving housing associations much more flexibility on rents and use of assets. Our aspiration is to deliver even more homes through our investment and reforms. We will publish details of how these proposals will work shortly.</p>

	<p pid="b.805W.5/3">As I outlined in my Department's press release of <phrase class="date" code="2010-10-14">14 October 2010</phrase>, councils should not seek to avoid making the savings described above by targeting instead the voluntary sector.

	<p pid="b.807W.5/1">In reaching a decision on a planning appeal, a planning inspector will consider whether a proposed development is acceptable in terms of the local council's development plan and other considerations which can include national planning policy and relevant planning issues raised by local communities. The Planning Inspectorate has an important role to play as the arbiter of potential conflicts between the interests of individuals, or local communities, and the needs of the nation. It would therefore be inappropriate to direct the Planning Inspectorate to refuse a planning appeal solely because of community opposition because there may still be strong national or local policy support for a proposal.</p>
	<p pid="b.807W.5/2">We are not proposing to include any specific provisions in the Localism Bill on planning for wind farms. We will publish and present to Parliament a simple and consolidated national planning policy framework covering all forms of development and setting out national economic, environmental and social priorities. We will make an announcement on how we propose to take forward the national planning policy framework and the implications for specific areas of planning policy.</p>
	<p pid="b.807W.5/3">There are requirements on local planning authorities to consult local communities and take their views into account when preparing development plan documents and planning applications must be publicised to allow representations to be made on the planning issues they raise. We will give local people and communities far more ability to determine the shape of the places in which they live by radically reforming the planning system.</p>
	<p pid="b.807W.5/4">Local planning authorities are able to attach conditions to a planning consent to require the restoration of a site as part of the decommissioning of a wind farm when it ceases to be operational.</p>

We are unable to confirm how many were remunerated with expenses without incurring disproportionate cost.</p>
	<p pid="b.812W.5/2">All of the intern placements were offered and accepted by the applicants prior to the Chancellor's announcement of a recruitment freeze across the civil service in May 2010.</p>
	<p pid="b.812W.5/3">In addition, the Home Office, including UKBA but excluding its other agencies, appointed 24 undergraduates under the Fast Stream Summer Development Programme (SDP) and Summer Placement Scheme (SPS), and a further two undergraduates under the Windsor Fellowship. The SDP and SPS are 6-8 week placements offered to undergraduates from ethnic minority backgrounds and with disabilities respectively, and the Windsor Fellowship is a Leadership Programme offering 6-8 week placements for ethnic minority undergraduates who have been identified as having leadership potential. All 26 were remunerated at the executive officer wage.</p>
	<p pid="b.812W.5/4">All 26 appointments relate to the Graduate Fast Stream Programme and were therefore exempt from the recruitment freeze.</p>

Because we do not expect that global carbon sink failure is a likely scenario it is not expected to have an impact on UK emissions reductions. The UK's carbon budgets under the Climate Change Act, combine both emissions and uptake from sinks. These are reported via the UK Greenhouse Gas Inventory funded by my Department, and increases or decreases in sinks are taken into account in measuring how the UK is meeting its carbon budgets.</p>

	<p pid="b.821W.6/1">The 2050 Pathways Calculator is open source: the full model is available for inspection, improvement and reuse by anyone. As a result, the Department has received useful suggestions about how to improve the model during the Call for Evidence period which ran between <phrase class="date" code="2010-07-27">27 July</phrase> and <phrase class="date" code="2010-10-05">5 October 2010</phrase>. The file format is .xlxs, which is documented in the ECMA-376 international standard and therefore could be implemented by an open source equivalent to Excel.</p>
	<p pid="b.821W.6/2">The only software that implements the file format sufficiently for the model to run is Microsoft Excel for PCs 2007 and 2010, and Microsoft Excel for Macs 2011. The reason is that the model includes &quot;structured references&quot; and these have not been implemented by open source Excel alternatives. Structured references were implemented in the &quot;Excel to Ruby programming language&quot; convertor which was released by the Department under an open source licence as part of the source code for the web version of the 2050 Calculator.</p>
	<p pid="b.821W.6/3">In evaluating the consequences of the use of structured references, it was concluded that the benefit that structured references gave of allowing the model to be implemented and updated accurately within the time available outweighed the drawback of its inability to run on open source alternatives. This drawback was further mitigated by the availability of trial copies of appropriate versions of Microsoft Excel (which were free at the time of the Call for Evidence) and which meant that most people would be able to make use of the 2050 Calculator tool during the Call for Evidence period of the project.</p>

	<p pid="b.824W.5/1">The main financial mechanisms that the Government have to incentivise the generation of renewable electricity are the renewables obligation (RO) and the feed-in tariff (FIT) scheme:</p>
	<p pid="b.824W.5/2" class="indent">RO supports large-scale generation of renewable electricity. Since its introduction in 2002, it has tripled the level of renewable electricity in the UK from 1.8% to 6.7%<sup>(1)</sup> in 2009, and is currently worth around &#163;1.4<sup>(2)</sup> billion/year in support to the renewable electricity industry. The spending review of <phrase class="date" code="2010-10-20">20 October 2010</phrase> announced that this level of funding will continue, confirming the Government's commitment to the increase of renewable electricity. The Electricity Market Reform consultation document is due to be published next month and will set out proposals for changes to the existing market in order to meet our renewables and decarbonisation goals. But whatever the proposal, the Government understand the need for investor certainty, and are not looking to make retrospective changes.</p>
	<p pid="b.824W.5/3" class="indent">The FIT scheme was launched on <phrase class="date" code="2010-04-01">1 April</phrase> of this year and supports small-scale low carbon electricity generation up to 5MW (2kW for microCHP) in capacity. Initial figures for the first six months of the scheme (taken from Ofgem's online database) indicate that 8,960 installations commissioned since the announcement of the scheme in July 2009 were supported. This amounts to a total installed capacity of 35.8MW.</p>
	<p pid="b.824W.5/4">We are also addressing the non-financial barriers to deployment:</p>
	<p pid="b.824W.5/5" class="indent">The spending review of <phrase class="date" code="2010-10-20">20 October 2010</phrase> included an announcement for over &#163;200 million to support the development of energy technologies, of which &#163;60 million has been earmarked for offshore wind manufacturing infrastructure at port locations. By supporting this manufacturing development, we are bringing forward industrial capacity that will help the UK meet its energy policy objectives. The Government are currently developing its detailed plans for the allocation of the remainder of this funding.</p>
	<p pid="b.824W.5/6" class="indent">Alongside this, we are working to remove grid connection barriers for low carbon energy production. We have already implemented enduring grid access reform in the form of a 'Connect and Manage' regime, so that new generation will be able to connect to the grid as soon as their local connection is built without waiting for wider network reinforcement. In addition, we have also been working to put in place the most effective regulatory regime for offshore electricity transmission, so that these connections can be delivered in a cost effective, timely and co-ordinated manner.</p>
	<p pid="b.824W.5/7" class="indent">A fast and efficient planning system is critical for facilitating investment in new major energy infrastructure, including renewables. The Government want a planning system for such infrastructure which is rapid, predictable and accountable. The Government intend to abolish the Infrastructure Planning Commission and replace it with a major infrastructure planning unit (MIPU). Under the MIPU system, the fast-track examination system would be retained but MIPU would make recommendations to Ministers who would then take the final decision. The new system gives local residents and community groups opportunities to become involved in the nationally significant infrastructure projects development consents process.</p>
	<p pid="b.824W.5/8">We will publish our renewables delivery plan in the spring. This will set out the actions necessary to drive faster deployment of renewables through the decade.</p>

Commercial businesses or public services that provide residential accommodation have the same responsibility as employers if, in general, they are responsible for the maintenance and repairs of the water system at the premises. The use of new energy saving technology to heat water, including heat pumps, does not in itself introduce a new legionella bacteria risk.

	<p pid="b.832W.2/1">The Department has cut average sickness absence by 25%, from 11.1 days per employee per year in 2007 to 8.3 days per employee per year currently.

	<p pid="b.832W.2/2">The Department achieved this reduction by applying an ongoing programme to help employees maintain good health, such as providing stress counselling. Where employees do take sick leave, we use occupational health services to support rehabilitation. If, following the provision of all reasonable help, an employee is unable to maintain a satisfactory attendance record, action is taken to dismiss or retire them on ill health grounds.</p>

Furthermore, the relationship between arrears and continued home ownership is a complex one dependant on more than the level of support for mortgage interest payable.</p>
	<p pid="b.841W.6/9">The Department is in the process of developing a model to estimate the impact of changes to support for mortgage interest on the number of repossessions. However any estimates will always be limited since detailed case-by-case information, such as arrears at the start of a claim, is not collected by the department. The Department will consider whether the results can be used publicly once this is work is complete.</p>
	<p pid="b.841W.6/10">The Council of Mortgage Lenders has told the Department that it expects lenders to continue to exercise forbearance where it is fair to do so for the borrower, and the borrower has a chance of paying off any arrears in the future. The Council of Mortgage Lenders thinks that where arrears levels increase for some borrowers as a result of the change in the standard interest rate this does not translate into an immediate possession risk.</p>

	<p pid="b.844W.8/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="b.844W.8/2">The Government value highly the work of the independent charities which make up the Citizens Advice Service. It has both high public awareness and is a much trusted source of advice for people from all backgrounds. It equally values the feedback received from bureaux via case studies which helps to hold Government and others to account and is vital in helping to inform and shape future policy.</p>
	<p pid="b.844W.8/3">The Department for Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS) already supports the Citizens Advice Service through the provision of annual Grant-in-Aid to its umbrella bodies in England and Wales and in Scotland (Citizens Advice and Citizens Advice Scotland) which it does on behalf of all Government Departments and the Welsh and Scottish Governments. That funding enables both to provide business services to their customers-the national network of Citizens Advice Bureaux in England and Wales and Scotland-which enable them to provide front-line services to the public. Without these national business services (IT infrastructure and content, research, training, and standards), the bureaux would not be able to provide their services to the public.</p>
	<p pid="b.844W.8/4">My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State also announced on <phrase class="date" code="2010-10-14">14 October</phrase>, changes to the future competition and consumer landscape including proposals to transfer the functions of Consumer Focus and the Consumer Direct helpline, operated by the Office of Fair Trading (OFT) to the national bodies for the Citizens Advice service in England and Wales and in Scotland and most of the consumer-related research and advocacy functions, currently undertaken by OFT and Consumer Focus, to the Citizens Advice Service.</p>
	<p pid="b.844W.8/5" class="indent"><a href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/policies/consumer-issues">http://www.bis.gov.uk/policies/consumer-issues</a></p>
	<p pid="b.844W.8/6">BIS's proposal, on which it will consult publicly in the new year, would see the Citizens Advice Service, together with Trading Standards as the two groups at the centre of our plans for a better model for the future consumer landscape. This fits with both the Government's localism and Big Society agendas.</p>

This includes proposals relating to the reform of conditional fee agreements (CFAs) and damages-based agreements (DBAs) or contingency fees. I should make it clear that Sir Rupert Jackson did not recommend replacing CFAs with contingency fees or DBAs. Rather he suggested that CFAs should be reformed and that DBAs should be permitted in litigation as an additional funding mechanism. That is what we are consulting on.</p>
	<p pid="b.860W.3/2">The intention is to increase the choice of funding options available to claimants to pursue necessary claims. Sir Rupert is of the view that implementing his proposals, particularly those on the reform of CFAs, would deliver significant costs savings including for Government. The consultation paper and preliminary impact assessments are available on the Ministry of Justice website:</p>

These costs do not include YJB funding to National Offender Management Service (NOMS) prisoner escort management (PEM) for the provision of prison escort and custodial services (PECS) for young people.<br/> 6. For the YOI cost:<br/> As of 1 April 2010, the YJB is no longer responsible for the budget for education funding and so this cost is not included in the above;<br/> The YJB is not responsible for health funding budgets-except where specific services are commissioned (i.e. at the Keppel Unit)-and so the cost of health services in not included in the above;<br/> For public YOIs, NOMS estimated that central overhead costs (excluding those for the Young People's Team) apportionable to the YJB at &#163;7.601 million; the cost above uses the actual funding received from MOJ for these overheads of &#163;5.070 million.<br/> For public YOIs, the NOMS business rates, maintenance charges, capital charges and overheads for these charges have been estimated based upon 2009-10 levels and inflated;<br/> YJB funding for the Lucy Faithfull Foundation is included.</td> </tr>

	<p pid="b.867W.6/1">Steps to reduce mortality from breast cancer will be taken through our public health strategy, cancer drugs fund and refreshed cancer reform strategy.</p>
	<p pid="b.867W.6/2">Lifestyle behaviours such as smoking, the harmful use of alcohol, drug misuse, poor diet and nutrition, being overweight and physical inactivity are acknowledged risk factors for a number of chronic diseases, including breast cancer. Later this year, we will publish a public health White Paper setting out details of our strategy for improving public health and reducing the risk factors associated with developing conditions such as breast cancer.</p>
	<p pid="b.867W.6/3">Diagnosing cancer earlier is also important in reducing mortality. Experts estimate that the NHS breast screening programme saves 1,400 lives per year by diagnosing cancer earlier. The Cancer Reform Strategy (CRS) included the commitment that the NHS breast screening programme would be extended to women aged 47 to 73. In June this year, we confirmed in the &quot;Revision to the NHS Operating Framework 2010-11&quot; that all local breast screening programmes should begin the extension in 2010-11 ensuring that more women have the opportunity to benefit from the screening service.</p>
	<p pid="b.867W.6/4">In September, as part of the national awareness and early diagnosis initiative, we announced that &#163;9 million would be provided to support 59 campaigns that will work to raise awareness of the signs and symptoms of breast, bowel and lung cancers and to encourage early presentation at a general practitioner surgery.</p>
	<p pid="b.867W.6/5">Through the Cancer Drugs Fund, we will give cancer patients better access to the drugs that their clinicians believe will help them, and on <phrase class="date" code="2010-10-01">1 October</phrase>, we allocated &#163;50 million to the NHS to enable cancer patients to access appropriate drugs now. Following the spending review, we have committed &#163;200 million per year for the drugs fund for the next three years, and are consulting on proposals for establishment of the fund.</p>
	<p pid="b.867W.6/6">We are also undertaking a review of the CRS to ensure that we have the right strategy to deliver improved outcomes for cancer patients including survival and mortality. We plan to publish the report later this winter.</p>

	<p pid="b.880W.2/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="b.880W.2/2">Evidence shows that children born to teenage mothers have a 60% higher risk of infant mortality; and 25% higher risk of low birth weight-which is a predictor for poorer health outcomes in later life. The key factors that contribute to these poor outcomes are:</p>
	<p pid="b.880W.2/3" class="indent">later engagement with antenatal services, including lower rates of attendance at antenatal education;</p>
	<p pid="b.880W.2/4" class="indent">poorer diet during pregnancy;</p>
	<p pid="b.880W.2/5" class="indent">higher rates of smoking during pregnancy; and</p>
	<p pid="b.880W.2/6" class="indent">lower rates of breastfeeding.</p>
	<p pid="b.880W.2/7">Teenage mothers also experience poorer emotional health and well-being, with rates of post-natal depression three times higher than those for older mothers.</p>
	<p pid="b.880W.2/8">All secondary schools are required to provide sex education. This provides the opportunity to raise awareness of these issues among all young people. But the extent to which schools cover the specific health risks associated with teenage pregnancy will vary, depending on teachers' assessment of their students' needs. SRE is a broad topic and curriculum time is limited. The fact that less than 1% of under-16s conceive each year means that schools may not see this issue as a priority for their students.</p>
	<p pid="b.880W.2/9">Once a young woman has become pregnant and decides to have the baby, we would expect them to receive high quality antenatal care, which highlights the importance of a healthy lifestyle during pregnancy and the risk of poor outcomes if, for example, mothers continue to smoke during their pregnancy. In some areas, specially tailored antenatal services are available for young parents, in recognition that they have particular needs that may not be met through all-age services.</p>
	<p pid="b.880W.2/10">After the birth, we would expect vulnerable young mothers to receive support through children's centres which will be focusing on the most disadvantaged families and through the Family Nurse Partnership (FNP) programme in the 56 local areas where it operates. FNP recognises that first-time young mothers are more likely to need additional practical and emotional support to deal with the challenges of parenthood.</p>

No one should be put off from raising their skills because of a lack of access to finance. In 2008/09, 92% (91.6%) 297,080 of UK-domiciled undergraduate entrants to part-time courses at UK higher education institutions, including the Open University, were mature (21+). Under our proposals for higher education funding, for the first time, eligible part-time students studying at at least one-third the intensity of a full-time course, will be entitled to a full loan for tuition, on the same basis as full-timers.</p>
