	<p pid="a.1380W.5/1">We agree with the European Commission's conclusion that legislation on car efficiency is necessary. The target should be challenging but achievable. A target for average new car tailpipe CO2 emissions of 130 g/km is, in principle, around the right level. But more work will be necessary to examine the feasibility and impacts of this target (including full impact assessments and consultation) before making any final decisions. Similarly, there will need to be careful consideration of how the target should be structured. We will continue to engage actively in discussions at the EU level, and we will also be calling on the European Commission to develop longer term targets in order to give the car industry greater certainty.</p>

In addition to this the Department provided &pound;3.6 million as a contribution to the costs of dealing with the London bombings in July 2005. This money was used to fund a variety of capital developments and improvements such as communications and information systems, fleet replacement and modernisation and accommodation improvements.

	<p pid="a.1387W.0/1">The Department for Transport recognises that over-provision or poor design of signs and street furniture can lead to clutter. We therefore encourage local authorities to avoid unnecessary street clutter through our Local Transport Plan guidance and through the design guidance we provide. Guidance on minimising clutter is given in the Traffic Signs Manual and in the &quot;Streets for All&quot; guides produced with English Heritage.</p>
	<p pid="a.1387W.0/2">We are strengthening our guidance in new publications such as Manual for Streets, which will encourage a fresh approach to residential street design; good practice guidance on the use of pedestrian guardrails; and guidance on how to reduce the impact of traffic management measures on the street scene.</p>

	<p pid="a.1387W.3/1">The responsibility for the design of new rolling stock and the carriage of bikes on trains rests with individual train operating companies (TOCs). All TOCs currently carry folding bikes on trains at all times and the Government encourages TOCs to carry non folding bikes whenever possible. Non folding bikes are not carried on light rail services.</p>
	<p pid="a.1387W.3/2">We also encourage all train operators to provide secure cycle parking at stations in 2004-05. DfT funded a Strategic Rail Authority project to provide an additional 2,500 cycle parking spaces with shelters and CCTV at over 100 stations as part of a project to improve cycle parking capacity on the rail network.</p>

Skills brokers conduct an organisational needs analysis to understand the problems facing the company. They then source the most appropriate training provider to meet that needs analysis giving the employer a real choice in the selection of the training provider. Skills brokers then help the company put together a fully costed action plan, setting out the likely levels of public subsidy together with any investment from the employer. Employers do not sign a contract but do enter into a non-contractual agreement setting out their commitment to the delivery of the action plan. By the end of January 2007, more than 25,000 employers have engaged with Train to Gain with more than 90,000 employees starting on a course of training.</p>

	<p pid="a.1394W.2/1">The Government welcome the recent Ofsted report and accepts many of the recommendations. Evidence in this report was collected before the launch last September of the new programme of high quality phonics work to address the findings of Jim Rose's review of early reading. We are confident that this programme will deliver higher standards of communication, language and literacy skills.</p>
	<p pid="a.1394W.2/2">The 'Curriculum Guidance for the Foundation Stage' already makes it clear that practitioners should plan a curriculum that helps all children to make good progress towards the early learning goals and, where appropriate, beyond. The Department has reinforced this by producing guidance on the identification of gifted and talented children and by asking the Primary National Strategy to produce guidance on better support for boys' learning. The 'Early Years Foundation Stage' (EYFS) which takes effect in September 2008 and replaces the Foundation Stage guidance will set out equally clear expectations for all children.</p>
	<p pid="a.1394W.2/3">The Department has produced a training package, 'Communicating Matters', to help local authorities to support staff working with early years settings to raise standards in communication and language. In addition, the Primary National Strategy will shortly publish a new document to replace 'Progression in Phonics' and 'Playing with Sounds' which will support effective phonics teaching from the EYFS through to the end of Key Stage One. Training and briefing for practitioners emphasises the links and interdependencies between all the areas of learning and development.</p>
	<p pid="a.1394W.2/4">The EYFS and the 'Primary Framework for literacy and mathematics' which support planning progression and personalisation of learning have been developed in parallel, with relevant sections of each mirroring the other to ensure that there is continuity between the EYFS and Key Stage 1. In conjunction with the Primary National Strategy, the Department has also produced guidance on the importance of providing continuity of experience for young children and their families.</p>

However, Lord Dearing's Languages Review, published on <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-12">12 March</phrase>, considers the view that languages GCSEs are more demanding than other subjects, and that this perception has a negative impact on the number of pupils continuing to study languages post-14. He recommends that there is a study to resolve this issue as soon as possible. The Secretary of State has welcomed Lord Dearing's recommendations and we are considering how to take this recommendation forward.</p>

	<p pid="a.1395W.5/2">These matters are for Ofsted. HM Chief Inspector, Christine Gilbert, has written to my hon. Friend and a copy of her reply has been placed in the House Library.</p>
	<p pid="a.1395W.5/3" class="italic"> Letter from Christine Gilbert, dated <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-15">15 March 2007</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="a.1395W.5/4" class="indent">Your recent parliamentary questions have been passed to me, as Her Majesty's Chief Inspector, for reply. I will address these in turn:</p>
	<p pid="a.1395W.5/5" class="indent">I. You asked how many members of staff have made formal complaints of bullying in the last 12 months (PQ127625).</p>
	<p pid="a.1395W.5/6" class="indent">Of the 20 grievances raised between February 2006 and February 2007, four have related to &quot;bullying and harassment&quot;. Of these, two have been heard and the grievance was not upheld, in one case the individual resigned before the hearing took place and a decision is pending on the fourth. This compares to seven complaints of bullying and harassment in 2004-2005; two in 2003-2004 and one in 2002-2003.</p>
	<p pid="a.1395W.5/7" class="indent">The increase in the number of complaints has partly been due to a revised bullying and harassment policy and initiatives implemented following Ofeted's 2004 staff survey results. These raised awareness of this issue and encouraged individuals to come forward with concerns they had. This issue remains a priority for Ofsted.</p>
	<p pid="a.1395W.5/8" class="indent">II. You asked how many grievances have been raised by staff at Ofsted in each of the last three years (PQ127626).</p>
	<p pid="a.1395W.5/9" class="indent">Until fairly recently, Ofsted has not kept records of all types of grievance. Those relating to bullying and harassment are on file as these are reported in our equal opportunities reports. Ofsted started collecting general grievance data as of November 2005 and our data therefore reflects this period onwards.</p>
	<p pid="a.1395W.5/10" class="indent">From the data we hold, we are able to report that, over the last 16 months, we have 22 grievances in total from members of staff (this figure includes the 20 grievances noted in response to PQ127625). Four of these were from the same individual, one was a collective grievance (from four members of staff) and the others were all individual one-off grievances.</p>
	<p pid="a.1395W.5/11" class="indent">III You asked how much Ofsted spent on (a) in-house training and (b) external training in each of the last three years (PQ127627).</p>
	<p pid="a.1395W.5/12" class="indent">The following internal costs (rounded to the nearest &pound;5k) include a programme of courses that have been developed specifically for an Ofsted audience; these include management development, IT skills and nationally supported qualifications such as specialist degrees. They also include the cost of our corporate learning and development team:</p>

	<p pid="a.1395W.5/22" class="indent">IV. You asked what the total cost of consultants employed by Ofsted was in each of the last three years (PQ127628) and how many consultants have been contracted to work for Ofsted in each of the last three years (PQ127629).</p>
	<p pid="a.1395W.5/23" class="indent">Based on the DfES definition of consultancy services, which is &quot;investigating problems, providing analysis or advice, or assisting with the development of new systems, new structures or new capabilities within the organisation&quot;, we will have spent around &pound;2.5 million (including VAT) in the financial year 2006-07. This spend is through 42 consultants.</p>
	<p pid="a.1395W.5/24" class="indent">Within this total around three quarters is for Information Services related consultancy to build new systems ready for the creation of the New Ofsted with effect from <phrase class="date" code="">1 April 2007</phrase>. The remainder covers other corporate areas such as estates, personnel and finance.</p>
	<p pid="a.1395W.5/25" class="indent">Due to the way in which Ofsted has previously prepared our accounts, this is the only year for which a separately identifiable consultancy figure is available.</p>

	<p pid="a.1399W.11/13">The new School Admissions Code rules out the use of unfair admission criteria, and encourages admission authorities for schools to consider how they can ensure fair access to schools for all children in their area. Local authorities must provide free home to school transport for secondary pupils attending their nearest suitable school where the school is beyond the statutory walking distance of three miles.</p>
	<p pid="a.1399W.11/14">The Education and Inspections Act 2006 extends rights to free home to school transport to a choice of three maintained schools and academies for children from low income families (defined as those whose children are entitled to free school meals or who are in receipt of their maximum level of working tax credit) where they live between two and six miles from their chosen school. This will remove the lack of affordable transport as a barrier to choice for these families.</p>

	<p pid="a.1406W.2/1">Ofsted inspectors are required by the framework for inspection to evaluate the extent to which learning programmes match learners' aspirations and potential, building on their prior attainment and experience, and how far the curriculum meets external requirements and is responsive to local circumstances. External requirements are those of the National Curriculum, but inspectors would also be aware of other guidance received by schools. The Chief Inspector will consider what if any additional advice needs to be provided to inspectors in the light of guidance issued to schools.</p>

Most vacancies will be filled by schools as from the start of the academic year in September and therefore will not be shown as such at the single point in January when vacancy statistics are counted. The January figure is therefore a reflection of posts that are unfilled at that time, not of vacancies that have become available and been filled during the year.</p>

	<p pid="a.1409W.6/2">The main DfES programme working in this way has been the Positive Activities for Young People programme (PAYP).

The evaluation of PAYP found that the programme had achieved a range of positive outcomes for participating young people, including contributing to reductions in criminal and antisocial behaviour, supporting people back into education, and offering opportunities for personal development.</p>

	<p pid="a.1422W.2/1">The Building (Amendment) (No. 2) Regulations 2004 introduced part P of the Building Regulations (Electrical safety in dwellings) to help reduce the number of deaths, injuries and fires caused by faulty electrical installations. Prior to its introduction the Department produced a regulatory impact assessment (RIA) which estimated costs and benefits over a 10-year period, discounted at 3.5 per cent. to present value. The full RIA is available on this Department's website:</p>

Part L deals with conservation of fuel and power, and Approved Document F gives technical guidance on ventilation of buildings. A regulatory impact assessment was carried out and is on the Department's website. It gives the following estimates of costs:</p>

	<p pid="a.1422W.2/47">One-off cost to business and regulators was not estimated separately in the RIA but was assumed to be nil, since the regulations did not incur administrative costs additional to or separate from those normally incurred by the building control process.</p>
	<p pid="a.1422W.2/48">The changes were shown to deliver substantial benefits which far outweighed the costs. To put this into perspective the expected annual cost for new buildings of &pound;120 million was estimated to provide benefits to the value of approximately &pound;10 per annum for each of the estimated 11.7 million people with disabilities. In view of the wide range of personal and social benefits that would result from improved access to disabled people and taking account of additional accessibility benefits for other groups and businesses, the actual benefits of these proposals are expected to exceed this by a considerable margin.</p>

As the armed forces are not involved in clearance, there is no requirement for mine clearing vehicles in Afghanistan.

It is, therefore, not legally possible to ensure that goods provided to the Army Board or the wider public sector are fair trade. However, the Department's policy encourages full consideration to be given to fair trade products whenever they meet the relevant, legitimate, criteria.</p>

The unit production cost of tranche 1 and 2 Eurofighter Typhoon, as published in Major Projects Report 2006, is &pound;66.7 million.</p>

	<p pid="a.1444W.2/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="a.1444W.2/2">The Department for Constitutional Affairs (DCA) has considered the recent report 'Misjudging Rape: Breaching Gender Guidelines and International Law in Asylum Appeals' published by the Black Women's Rape Action Project (BWRAP) and Women Against Rape. Additionally, it has recently received representations on similar issues from stakeholders groups such as Asylum Aid and the Medical Foundation for the Victims of Torture.</p>
	<p pid="a.1444W.2/3">The BWRAP report recommended that the Asylum Gender Guidelines (2000) be applied by immigration judges in all asylum appeals where rape is cited in the grounds of appeal. The guidelines never had binding authority on the tribunal and are out of date in respect of current law. The guidelines are framed very much as a statement of what the law is on particular aspects of a refugee claim. It is not the role of the tribunal to make statements on the law, save through its jurisprudence.</p>
	<p pid="a.1444W.2/4">Immigration judges are independent members of the judiciary who determine cases on the evidence that is placed before them. Judicial training is facilitated by senior and experienced members of the judiciary. All immigration judges receive training in diversity and refugee law and are encouraged to keep up to date with legal developments both in the UK and nationally. All judiciary have access to the Judicial Studies Board (JSB) Equal Treatment Benchbook as well as country guidance determinations, Home Office country reports and wider information, and case law of the AIT and higher courts.</p>
	<p pid="a.1444W.2/5">There are currently no plans for the DCA to commission research into this area. It is not for the AIT, as an independent tribunal, to commission objective research into such issues.</p>

	<p pid="a.1448W.8/9" class="indent">From 2002 created a database of around 750,000 infant death records to counter &quot;Day of the Jackal&quot; type fraud.</p>

	<p pid="a.1448W.8/14">On an operational level, IPS are using intelligence received and data on known frauds to actively manage passport fraud identified after the issue of the passport. It is currently investigating some 2000 cases. Utilising intelligence on known fraud patterns, other fraud will be identified through the searches IPS are conducting on its database of 50 million passport records. This will be a similar set of exercises as that successfully conducted on infant deaths. This is an ongoing process and will be strengthened in November 2007 when IPS has access to adult death information. IPS are also developing plans to use facial recognition to check for duplicate identity fraud.</p>
	<p pid="a.1448W.8/15">All the information uncovered on fraudulently obtained passports is passed to the UK Immigration Service for use at all UK ports. Experience shows that this is successful in disrupting criminal activities.</p>

	<p pid="a.1449W.2/1">Data on passport photograph rejections is not kept in a way that allows a figure to be obtained for a specific area. Although passport applications originating from Scotland are dealt with by the Glasgow passport office, they also deal with applications emanating from elsewhere in the UK as a consequence of their catchment area which includes part of England. Additionally, IPS routinely transfers work between offices in order to provide the most efficient and effective service to the public.</p>

Led by BAA, the UK Regional Group also comprised Accenture, Cathay Pacific, Emirates, IER, Raytheon, Sagem, SITA and IND along with a number of associate partners. Each partner provided resources at their own cost; in the case of central Government this amounted to staff costs only. The use of collaboration groups enables low cost, low risk trial delivery as costs and risks are distributed to the collaboration partner that is best able to manage the risk.</p>

	<p pid="a.1460W.2/1">The exact information requested is not available. The table provides estimates in respect of those aged 18 to 20 inclusive derived from a national recording system of each incident of self-harm, the majority of which are minor. The improved system was only introduced in 2003 and figures before this time should not be compared directly with those since that date.</p>
	<p pid="a.1460W.2/2">The Home Office definition of prisoner self-inflicted deaths is broader than the legal definition of suicide and includes all deaths where it appears that a prisoner has acted specifically to take their own life. Annual figures may change slightly as inquest verdicts and other information becomes available although the figures presented here are a fair reflection of the number of self-inflicted deaths among young offenders.</p>

	<p pid="a.1461W.0/4">Although care is taken in collating and analysing the returns used to compile the figures in this publication, the data are of necessity subject to the inaccuracies inherent in any large-scale recording system.

	<p pid="a.1463W.3/1">The Government support co-firing through the renewables obligation (RO). Currently, all technologies under the RO receive the same level of support. The Energy Review Report proposed banding the RO so that it provides different levels of support to different technologies. As co-firing is one of the most economic technologies, we have consulted on proposals to decrease the level of support it receives. These proposals would require amendments to the Electricity Act 1989 and will be the subject of an announcement later this year. At present, the level through which suppliers can meet their obligation through co-firing is capped at 10 per cent. having fallen from 25 per cent. in 2006. This cap not only protects the RO certificate market but also restricts the volumes of biomass, including wood, that can be used.</p>
	<p pid="a.1463W.3/2">The Government also commissioned an independent report to look at the current and future impact of co-firing on the wood panel industry (ILEX, September 2005). The report concluded that allowing more waste wood (which is not suitable for use by the wood panel industry) to qualify for support through the RO would ease competition for the industry's preferred feedstock. We accepted these recommendations and have implemented them through changes to the biomass definition in the Renewables Obligation Order 2006 and will make further changes through the Renewables Obligation Order 2006 Amendment Order 2007 from <phrase class="date" code="">1 April 2007</phrase>.</p>

Over time the contribution from income will fall off, as productive units are progressively taken out of service. The NDA's commercial income is taken fully into accounting setting its budget. We have agreed a budget for 2007-08 that will ensure that the NDA delivers a small increase in programme funding and which will ensure the NDA can meet its core objectives and maintain safety.

	<p pid="a.1468W.6/3">An important part of reducing mortality from cancer is early detection and we are working with the healthy communities collaborative, part of the improvement foundation, to test locally developed approaches to raising awareness of cancer symptoms in local communities, including black and minority ethnic communities.

	<p pid="a.1468W.6/4">The NHS Cancer Plan sets out our strategy for improving cancer services for all patients and we have seen significant improvements in the management and provision of cancer services for all cancer patients, regardless of their ethnicity.

	<p pid="a.1468W.6/5">As announced in November 2006, by my right hon.

One of the Government's objectives in introducing from April 2006 local commissioning arrangements for primary dental care services and changing the basis of remuneration for dental practices away from item of service fees was to give dentists more scope to focus on preventative care. Primary care trusts are also now required to provide oral health promotion programmes to the extent that they consider it necessary to meet all reasonable requirements within their areas. To assist them, we published an oral health plan for England &quot;Choosing Better Oral Health&quot; in November 2005.</p>

Portsmouth City Teaching PCT remains a PCT after 1 October 2006. The other PCTs listed are those that now form Hampshire PCT as a result of the 1 October 2006 PCT boundary changes.<br/> 3. Patients have been identified by using surname, first initial, gender and date of birth. Each unique patient ID is normally assigned to the dental contract (and therefore PCT) against which the most recent claim for routine treatment was recorded in the 24 month period.<br/> 4. The information shows number of patients seen by dentists and the location in which these patients were seen. It does not show the patients home address. Most patients live within the PCT area in which they receive primary care dental services but some will attend a dentist further afield (near work for example).<br/> 5. The count of patient IDs is a robust statistical indicator of the overall level of patient involvement with NHS primary dental care. As with the previous registration system there will be some duplications and omissions. Patients will be omitted if two or more share the same surname, initial, sex and date of birth. Patients may be counted twice if they have two or more episodes of care and their name is misspelled or changed (for example on marriage) between those episodes of care. The risk of duplication increases if the episodes of care are at different practices.<br/> 6. None of the above factors is likely to affect the overall count by more than one or two percent. but at a PCT level there may be local demographic factors which make the local total more susceptible, e.g. a high proportion of women changing names after marriage, a local concentration of surnames prone to be misspelled, and or a transient patient base.<br/> <i> Sources</i>:<br/> The Information Centre for health and social care<br/> NHS Business Services Authority (BSA)</td> </tr>

	<p pid="a.1472W.2/1">&quot;The Report of the Primary Care Dental Workforce Review&quot; published in 2004 identified a shortage of dentists to which the Department responded with two major initiatives. Through the Project 1000 campaign, the Department supported the national health service in recruiting the equivalent of 1,453 additional whole time dentists including some 500 overseas dentists. For the longer term, the Department increased the number of undergraduate training places in English dental schools by 170, a 25 per cent. increase in capacity. The first cohort of students to take these additional places will graduate in 2009 by when there will have been three years experience of the devolution of the commissioning of primary care dentistry to primary care trusts (PCTs). As part of these new arrangements, PCTs are responsible for assessing local needs and commissioning services to reflect these needs. The Department will work with the NHS to allow local need assessments and commissioning plans to feed into long term work force planning at national level.</p>

Please note that admissions do not represent the number of in-patients as a person may have more than one admission within the year.  2. Ungrossed data: Figures have not been adjusted for shortfalls in the data (i.e. the data are ungrossed).  3. Time waited (days): Time waited statistics from HES are not the same as the publicised waiting list statistics. HES provides counts and time waited for all patients admitted to hospital within a given period whereas the published waiting list statistics count those waiting for treatment on a specific date and how long they have been on the waiting list. Also, HES calculates the time waited as the difference between admission and the decision to admit dates. Where there is no recorded entry for decision to admit, or when decision to admit and admission date are the same this creates an invalid waiting time. Unlike published waiting list statistics, this is not adjusted for self-referrals or periods of medical/social suspension. The time bands &quot;more than 6 months to 12 months' includes those who waited 183 to 364 days, the 'more than 12 months to 18 months' includes those who waited 365 to 547 days, the 'more than 18 months' includes those who waited 548 and more days.  4. Data quality: HES are compiled from data sent by over 300 NHS trusts and PCTs in England. The Information Centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies and the effect of missing and invalid data via HES processes. While this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain.  <i> Source:</i>  Hospital Episodes Statistics (HES), The Information Centre for health and social care.</td> </tr>

	<p pid="a.1486W.2/1">Applicants for a postal vote must be included on the electoral register. The Electoral Administration Act 2006 imposes a duty on the Electoral Registration Officer (ERO) to ensure electoral registers are accurate and comprehensive. It also strengthens the objections procedures, and enables EROs to act upon any objections made to a person's entry on the register, and to initiate an investigation into a person's entry on the register if the ERO is in doubt about whether the person is entitled to be registered.</p>
	<p pid="a.1486W.2/2">The Act creates the new offence of falsely applying for a postal vote.</p>
	<p pid="a.1486W.2/3">The Act also establishes a scheme that provides for the use of personal identifiers by postal voters. They require persons voting by post to provide their signature and date of birth, both when they apply for a postal vote and when they return their postal vote at an election. Checks will be done to ensure the personal identifiers match.</p>
	<p pid="a.1486W.2/4">If an ERO is in doubt about the validity of a postal vote application he may make further inquiries with the applicant, and if necessary, he may report the matter to the police. Signatures and dates of birth will be stored by the ERO, and will be important evidence in the event of any investigation into suspected fraudulent applications.</p>

The UK took lead responsibility for counter narcotics. When the Afghan Compact was agreed at the London Conference in early 2006, the international community recognised the progress that had been made since the Bonn Agreement. It was agreed with the Afghan government that the concept of lead nation was now redundant, as the Afghan government now had lead responsibility for all aspects of Security Sector Reform, and that the G8 countries should become partner nations.

To date, the six provinces that were opium poppy free in 2006 have been awarded US $500,000 each, and eight provinces that cultivated less than l,000 hectares of opium poppy in 2006 have been awarded US $150,000.

	<p pid="a.1492W.2/1">I met with Colombian Vice President Santos at the UN Human Rights Council in March. While I welcomed the significant progress that Colombia had made, I pointed out that civil society and trade union development in Colombia continued to present big challenges.</p>
	<p pid="a.1492W.2/2">My noble Friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, Lord Triesman of Tottenham, has met with both British and Colombian trade unionists in the UK and Colombia. This close contact was enhanced during his visit to the region in September 2006 when he met again with trade unions in order to strengthen, links, learn from shared experiences and to demonstrate the importance the UK attaches to the role of civil society in Colombia. There was detailed discussions of the role of the new International Labour Organisation (ILO) office in Bogota, Colombia. Our Embassy in Bogota also regularly communicates with Colombian trade unions.</p>
	<p pid="a.1492W.2/3">We remain concerned that threats against trade unionists and human rights defenders remain in Colombia. However, we are encouraged by the positive steps the Government of Colombia has been taking to improve the human rights situation. For example, a new unit of specialised prosecutors has been established to deal with cases of human rights abuses involving trade unionists, with greater resources&mdash;a point specifically welcomed by the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights in his report on Colombia, published on <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-15">15 March</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.1492W.2/4">We continue to urge the Government of Colombia to meet its international obligations in regard to workers' rights. But we believe that change can be best achieved through a supportive approach; and consider the ILO's Special Technical Co-operation Programme for Colombia to be one of the most effective ways of helping to bring about real and positive improvement in workers' rights in that country. We are encouraged that the ILO has established an office in Colombia and hope that this will be a step forward in improving labour issues in the country.</p>

	<p pid="a.1493W.5/1">My right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary has not formally met representatives from the European Movement since assuming her position, but I have had the opportunity to meet a range of contacts. For instance, in January 2007, I spoke at a panel-style debate organised by the European Movement as part of a series of &quot;Speak Up Europe&quot; debates being held across the European Union. On <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-22">22 March</phrase>, I gave a keynote speech at a European Movement conference at Chatham House called &quot;Celebrating 50 years of the Treaty of Rome&quot;.</p>

However, President Bashir's delay in doing so, and now his refusal to endorse the Heavy Support Package as agreed between the AU and UN, highlights Sudan's reluctance to have the UN deploy in Darfur. This is part of a wider pattern of non-co-operation with the international community. The UK will be pushing for tougher measures in the Security Council against Sudan, including a country-wide arms embargo and further targeted sanctions.</p>

	<p pid="a.1495W.0/5" class="indent">You asked the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, whether regulations on time limits which apply to the collection of civil debts also apply to the collection by the Child Support Agency of historic arrears of child maintenance.</p>
	<p pid="a.1495W.0/6" class="indent">When a non-resident parent has defaulted on child support payments, and arrears have accrued, as a result the Child Support Agency may instigate debt recovery by alternative measures such as of civil court action or by employing the services of an external collection agency. If the non-resident parent is employed then a Deduction from Earnings Order may be implemented to recover both ongoing child support maintenance and an amount towards arrears.</p>
	<p pid="a.1495W.0/7" class="indent">Although in England and Wales most civil debt is subject to the Statute of Limitations, the time bar relating to collection of child maintenance debt is determined by the Child Support (Collection and Enforcement) Regulations 1992, Regulation 28 (2A) as amended by the Child Support (Miscellaneous Amendments) Regulations 2006. When pursuing collection and enforcement through the courts this legislation has the effect of removing the 6 year limitation in respect of all amounts that became due after <phrase class="date" code="2000-07-12">12 July 2000</phrase>. The Prescription and Limitation (Scotland) Act 1973, limits the age of debt recoverable through the Scottish civil courts to twenty years.</p>

	<p pid="a.1499W.2/3">Jobs measured by the Job Entry Target (JET) up to March 2006 are for the most part job opportunities that customers have been submitted to by JCP staff and that JCP staff have followed up to confirm the job entry, or jobs from NDDP brokers. Not all jobs obtained by people who have made an IB claim in a Pathways to Work area will be obtained in this manner as they would also be looking at newspaper ads, employment agencies, the internet, word of mouth, etc.</p>
	<p pid="a.1499W.2/4">Since April 2006 jobs have been measured via the Job Outcome Target (JOT). This is based on HMRC income tax payment records it not a complete measure of all job entries for a number of reasons. For example; a large proportion of part-time/lower paid jobs will not be reported as they are below the tax threshold.</p>

Figures have been rounded to the nearest 10. A value of '-' indicates a nil or negligible value. A value of '.' indicates that the value has not been calculated.<br/> 2. As pathways began in October 2003, the first year covers approximately six months. The second and third years, based on an operational year, run from April until March. The last year covers approximately three months, until the last recorded data in June 2006.<br/> 3. Data for starts on pathways is to end of June 2006. Data for job entries is to end of March 2006. No more recent data is available for job entries because the previous job entry measure was terminated in March 2006, and the new job outcomes target data which replaced it has an approximate six month reporting lag, so that April 2006 data is not yet available. Because of the time it takes for pathways participants to find work, the latest cohort of entrants for whom it is possible to give a meaningful figure for proportion entering work is those starting in September 2005. Even then, this figure is potentially misleading if compared with earlier cohorts, as many find work more than six months after joining. To give a more useful comparison over time, the proportion finding jobs within six months is also given.<br/> 4. Additionally, this understates total job entries since it only counts those recorded in Jobcentre Plus systems. Survey data from the independent evaluation suggests for example that 42 per cent. of pathways participants had done at least some paid work in the 10 months after starting..<br/> 5. Job entry figures include all recorded job entries plus return to work credit (RTWC) awards for which no job entry is yet recorded. (By definition, an RTWC award must indicate that a job entry has occurred). Figures for job entries include new deal for disabled people (NDDP) job starts.<br/> 6. Data for physical disability is based on those participants for whom a medical condition is recorded, but whose condition is not classified as a mental health condition.<br/> 7. The data on medical condition for Pathways to Work participants is incomplete. This is because it is drawn from incapacity benefit data that appears in the National Benefits Database (NBD). This impacts on the completeness of pathways medical condition data in two ways; (1) NBD lags behind other Pathways Evaluation Database sources by some three to four months, and (2) The NBD incapacity benefit data is based on a six-weekly snapshot, which means that some short-term claims of less than six weeks are not included.<br/> <i> Source</i>:<br/> Pathways to Work Evaluation Database</td> </tr>

	<p pid="a.1502W.12/1">These benefits are designed to help carers in very different circumstances. Income support and the income-based element of jobseekers allowance, both of which include extra help for carers, are intended to ensure that people of working age and their families can meet all their normal daily living needs when they are out of work. Carer's allowance provides a measure of income-maintenance to those carers who provide at least 35 hours of care each week for a severely disabled person, but who are not entitled to additional means-tested support from the benefit system.</p>
	<p pid="a.1502W.12/2">We have introduced improvements for carers in all these benefits, in addition to the normal annual uprating. We also review the adequacy of these benefits at regular intervals.</p>

	<p pid="a.1506W.11/4">The first draft corporation tax clauses were published for consultation in 2006 and a response document will be published shortly. The project has also published papers on the scope of the corporation tax rewrite. Its scope has been agreed by both the steering and the consultative committees.

	<p pid="a.1509W.2/2">The UK-Isle of Man revenue-sharing arrangement applies to a number of indirect taxes including VAT, customs duty and most excise duties, referred to as the 'common duties'. The Isle of Man's share of the common duties for each of the last 10 years is contained in the Isle of Man Annual Account. This account is certified by the National Audit Office, laid before Parliament and is therefore available from the House of Commons Library.</p>
	<p pid="a.1509W.2/3">The formula for calculating the Isle of Man's share of the common duties has recently been jointly reviewed by the UK and the Isle of Man and it has been agreed that a new formula will apply from <phrase class="date" code="">1 April 2007</phrase>. A copy of the revised Treasury Direction, which sets out how the new revenue sharing formula will operate, will be placed in the House of Commons Library at the earliest opportunity.</p>

	<p pid="a.1514W.6/21">In March 2006 HMRC paid &pound;270,000 back to Capgemini for overpayments made by Capgemini on service credits in previous quarters.</p>
	<p pid="a.1514W.6/22">Since Capgemini took over the tax credit IT system in June 2004 there have been 18 hours and 30 minutes of unscheduled online service disruption against a contracted time of 13,962 hours and 30 minutes. This represents 0.1 per cent. of unscheduled online service disruption. Of these 18 hours and 30 minutes, 15 hours and 45 minutes fell in the first year. In calendar year 2006 no hours were lost.</p>

They also check to see if there is any existing dispute about the overpayment before commencing legal action. Where the issue of a court summons produces a defence claiming that the overpayment is in dispute proceedings are suspended until the claim is resolved.</p>
