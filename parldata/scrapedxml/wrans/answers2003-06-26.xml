The unit was launched in 2000 and received a Charter Mark Award for excellence last December. It achieved more than 300 ministerial visits between 2000 and 2002 that otherwise would not have taken place.</p>

	<p pid=".893W.3/1">There is no business rates relief available specifically for homes that provide residential or nursing care for the elderly. However, there are existing mandatory and discretionary rate relief available to ratepayers under the rating system and under certain circumstances homes that provide residential and nursing care for the elderly can qualify for these reliefs.</p>
	<p pid=".893W.3/2">To qualify for mandatory rate relief, the ratepayer must be a charity or a non-profit making body operating as a charity and use the property they occupy wholly or mainly for charitable purposes. Mandatory relief is available at 80 per cent. of the full rates bill, is fully centrally funded and can be topped up to 100 per cent. at the discretion of the local authority. The discretionary top-up is 25 per cent. centrally funded, and local authorities are required to meet 75 per cent. of any such top-up.</p>
	<p pid=".893W.3/3">Where the property does not qualify for mandatory relief, local authorities can consider the award of discretionary rate relief. To be eligible for consideration, the ratepayer must be a non-profit making body and the property used for social, philanthropic, educational or religious purposes. Local authorities have the discretionary power to grant up to 100 per cent. rate relief to certain non-profit making bodies. 75 per cent. of the cost of all discretionary reliefs is met centrally, with the local authority, and through them, the council taxpayer meeting the remaining 25 per cent.. However, whether or not a particular ratepayer would qualify for this rate relief would depend on whether it meets the qualifying criteria set by the local authority.</p>
	<p pid=".893W.3/4">There are no council tax discounts or exemptions available for care homes that provide residential or nursing care for the elderly. However, the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister included provisions in the Local Government Bill currently before Parliament giving local authorities the power to grant their own discounts and exemptions. This could include care homes if the local authority wished.</p>

The number of non-decent homes in the social sector has already been reduced by about 700,000 since 1996. The Office has also set a target to end, by March 2004, the use of bed and breakfast accommodation for families with children except in emergencies, and then for no longer than six weeks; and is currently consulting on proposals to make it unlawful for local authorities to exceed this six-week deadline.</p>

	<p pid=".900W.5/1">A range of issues affects the results of elections, and the performance of a council will be a significant factor for many local people. Comprehensive Performance Assessments (CPAs) are now beginning to provide clear and consistent information to local people, as well as to councils and central Government, on the performance of local government. All county councils and single tier authorities were assessed under the CPA process in the past year. District councils will be assessed in the course of the next 18 months. Half of the councils which have received a CPA were subject to elections in May this year.</p>
	<p pid=".900W.5/2">The trend between the 2002 CPA categories and 2003 local government election results tends to support the view that the performance of the council has an influence on the outcome of the election. 45 per cent. of weak and poor councils where elections were held changed overall control. In comparison this happened in just 29 per cent. of the excellent and good councils where elections were held.</p>

	<p pid=".901W.8/1">Low turnout in elections is caused by a number of different factors, and no single solution will solve it. However, one of the most important ways in which we can help is to make voting more straightforward and accessible to all voters. In conjunction with the independent Electoral Commission and Local Government Association, we are promoting a programme of electoral pilots to test new methods of voting, which are aimed at increasing the opportunity for voting. These include various electronic voting techniques (including the use of the internet, telephone, SMS text messaging and interactive digital television), as well as all-postal ballots.</p>
	<p pid=".901W.8/2">At this year's local elections the 33 all-postal pilot elections recorded an average turnout of 49.5 per cent. One pilot authority achieved a 61 per cent. turnout in its pilot, while another more than doubled its turnout compared to the last comparable election. The Electoral Commission's evaluation of these pilots should provide us with more details about how they worked. Initial indications are that the new methods of voting are having a positive effect on voter turnout.</p>

	<p pid=".903W.8/1">The first two council housing Private Finance Initiatives (PFI) contracts were signed in March this year by Manchester city council and the London borough of Islington which will see a total of 2,500 council homes refurbished. It is too early to expect any of these to have been refurbished at this point in time. Manchester let a small preliminary contract in advance of the main agreement which has resulted in 21 homes being improved.</p>

	<p pid=".905W.0/1">The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister is fully engaged in the Cabinet Office-led capabilities programme, and all resilience work is co-ordinated within that programme. The central response capability focuses on mechanisms such as business continuity planning which assure that Government departments can function and respond effectively to a no-notice crisis. The local response capability focuses on mechanisms which allow local authorities and emergency services to plan and respond to serious disruption, while the site clearance capability aims to create an action plan for the handling of rabble and site clearance. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister has specific responsibilities as lead Government Department for the regional response and site clearance capabilities, and contributes to the development of other capabilities as necessary. Under the central response capability, the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister did not incur any specific additional spend during 2002&ndash;03, and has budgeted for &pound;1 million in 2003&ndash;04. On the local responses and site clearance capabilities, the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister spent &pound;2,072,412 during 2002&ndash;03, and has budgeted for &pound;4.5 million in 2003&ndash;04. With regard to the other areas the hon. Member has raised, the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister is either not directly involved in those workstreams or has incurred no spend.</p>
	<p pid=".905W.0/2">The capabilities that we are working to deliver have been developed to allow the Government to deal with the widest range of scenarios. Should a specific additional urgent operational need arise, at any point of the spending cycle, action would be taken to meet it. The public expenditure framework the Government have put in place provides the flexibility to deal with unexpected pressures.</p>

Each distributor is required to have a performance indicator on the average time taken to process applications, but the indicator can be formulated differently by individual distributors. The timing of the release of funding by distributors to successful applicants can depend on many factors including the nature of the project concerned, the terms and conditions of grant agreed between the applicant and the distributor, and the rate at which the project progresses. For many projects, a grant may be released in instalments over a period of months or years.</p>

	<p pid=".915W.5/2">Additional resources for the coming years, together with the improved enforcement and intelligence capability provided by HM Customs and Excise, should ensure that this work is consolidated and built upon. HM Customs are setting up four mobile detection teams to target meat and animal products, and will be increasing the number of detector dog teams to six during the current financial year.</p>
	<p pid=".915W.5/3">Defra are also working with the Food Standards Agency and HM Customs to understand what drives the demand for exotic meats and animal products in the UK.</p>
	<p pid=".915W.5/4">In addition, under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) the UK played a key role in setting up a Working Group of Central African countries, which is due to report to the next Conference of the Parties in October 2004. We expect its recommendations to provide a valuable resource for all the countries of the region, in aiding their efforts to harmonise and strengthen local controls on the bushmeat trade.</p>

Once in force, it will provide a common basis for all countries of the world to take informed decisions about imports and exports of any GMOs that may affect wildlife and natural habitats. Most of the UK's obligations under the Protocol have been, or are being, implemented at European Community level. The Community legal framework for the Protocol is expected to be completed later this month with the adoption of measures governing exports of GMOs. Adoption of these measures will demonstrate that the UK is fully able to meet its obligations under the Protocol and will enable the necessary national ratification procedures to be completed shortly thereafter.</p>

	<p pid=".917W.5/1">Public contracting authorities, including local authorities, must comply in full with UK public procurement regulations when awarding contracts for the supply of food. The regulations implement EU Directives on procurement that are designed to ensure that public sector contracts are awarded following transparent competitions that do not unfairly exclude suppliers from outside the UK. Even when the values of contract requirements fall below the thresholds for applying the Regulations the European Treaty prohibits the public sector from demanding local food. Discriminating on grounds of nationality is strictly prohibited under any circumstance.</p>
	<p pid=".917W.5/2">It is a common misconception that the EU Directives work against local producers and growers. There are legitimate ways and means for public contracting authorities to increase the opportunities that local producers have for competing for public sector contracts. One of the most effective measures is to ensure that the quality of food specified takes into account food production and processing standards that result in safe, healthy nutritious food and ensure that adverse environmental impacts are reduced as much as possible. More detailed guidance on stimulating the demand and supply of local produce can be found in Defra's Action Sheet at:</p>

	<p pid=".919W.3/1">There are no publishable guidelines or data available on how quickly removal should take The speed with which a person or persons can be removed depends on whether there are any barriers to removal and how quickly they can be overcome.</p>
	<p pid=".919W.3/2">The Immigration Service (IS) is fully committed, however, to removing from the United Kingdom, all of those who have no entitlement to remain in this country. The IS targets in particular those who have applied for and failed the asylum process and those who have not lodged an appeal within 15 working days of adverse decision.</p>
	<p pid=".919W.3/3">I am able to report that, following a series of measures, there has been a steady increase in removals performance across the board. Some 14,400 people (including dependants) were removed in 2002, representing an increase of 12 per cent. over the previous year and a 45 per cent. increase compared to 1997. Though, among other things, greater contact management with asylum seekers at all stages of the asylum process and better intelligence, we would expect this trend to continue over the coming months.</p>
	<p pid=".919W.3/4">Through close collaboration with the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO), planning and work is also undertaken to overcome immigration related problems with specific countries. Were necessary, this includes working with other Government Departments and the Governments of the countries where specific problems exist. Through this approach, and by drawing upon the joint expertise of Immigration and Nationality Directorate (IND) and FCO, measures can be identified and implemented that counter particular, and sometimes unique, problems including difficulties with delays and barriers to removal.</p>

	<p pid=".921W.6/1">Assaulting a public sector worker in the course of his or her duty is an extremely serious matter, as reflected in guidelines issued by the Magistrates' Association. Magistrates court guidelines already make clear that when an assault is against a &quot;victim serving the public&quot;, it should be considered as an aggravating factor. The Criminal Justice Bill contains provisions on sentencing and sets up a new Sentencing Guidelines Council, charged with drafting and distributing a new set of consolidated sentencing guidelines applicable across all criminal courts. The purpose of the guidelines is to ensure consistency and to require the courts to take account of all the relevant aggravating or mitigating features. The guidelines could, and we expect will, refer explicitly to the fact that if a victim was at the time of the offence working with the public, it should be treated as an aggravating feature of the crime. We have no current plans to introduce specific offences for attacks on public sector workers.</p>

	<p pid=".921W.9/1">A Home Office research study 'Stopping Traffic' (Police Research Series 125, published in 2000), indicated that there was intelligence to suggest that some women and children are trafficked into the UK for the purposes of sexual exploitation. This was estimated at between 140 and 1,400 per year but it was impossible to make a more accurate assessment of numbers. The report concluded that there was no evidence to suggest that this was on a large scale compared with other European countries.</p>

Therefore, it will be for them to assess if potential costs will outweigh potential benefits. However, HMG recognises that developing countries require support in this assessment, and this is why the Department for International Development is co-ordinating with the World bank and UNCTAD to conduct research in this area, which will help inform the position of developing countries in the negotiations.</p>

ISO 9001:2000 is the most recent version of the ISO 9000 series of quality management systems and has been produced by quality and industry experts working under the aegis of the International Organisation for Standardisation (ISO). From <phrase class="date" code="2003-12-15">15 December 2003</phrase> it is the intention of the certification organisations only to issue certificates against the new standard. It is a matter for individual businesses to decide whether to be certified against the new standard.</p>
	<p pid=".926W.11/2">However, ISO 9001:2000 is intended to reflect modern management approaches and the experience gained in industry and commerce over the past 25 years, with the focus moving from compliance to achieving results, and as such it is welcomed by the government. We hope that businesses will use the new standard to improve their productivity and competitiveness and that as many as possible will transfer to the new standard.</p>

	<p pid=".929W.8/1">There is a sizeable body of law, which gives consumers protection in respect to both civil and criminal matters. Within this framework, the Office of Fair Trading (OFT) and Trading Standards services enforce a wide range of legislation aimed at protecting all consumers. Some of this legislation is directed at practices more likely to affect vulnerable consumers. Through the Enterprise Act we have strengthened the enforcement of consumer protection legislation by making it possible for enforcers to seek a Stop Now Order against a trader acting unlawfully in respect of a wide range of legislative infringements, which harm the collective interests of consumers. These provisions came into force on <phrase class="date" code="2003-06-20">20 June 2003</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".929W.8/2">The Enterprise Act empowers the OFT to formally approve and promote voluntary codes of practice that meet its challenging core criteria and, if necessary, withdraw that approval publicly if a code is found to be not operating satisfactorily. The aim of the new scheme is to promote and safeguard consumers' interests by helping them identify better businesses and to encourage businesses to raise their standards of customer service.</p>

	<p pid=".930W.12/1">Overcrowding is primarily a problem in London in the peak periods. Overall overcrowding levels fell from 1992 to 1996, rose in 1997, fell in 1998, rose in 1999 and 2000, were unchanged in 2001 and fell in 2002.</p>
	<p pid=".930W.12/2">Nearly half a million people now travel by train into London each morning. This is the highest figure since the late 1980s. Despite this growth in use at peak times the number of operators that have overcrowding levels exceeding the Strategic Rail Authority's threshold has fallen to three. A graph showing London commuter numbers and crowding has been placed in the Libraries of the House.</p>
	<p pid=".930W.12/3">An updated version of the chart showing passenger numbers and crowding figures from 1990 onwards has also been placed in the Libraries of the House.</p>

The UN Assistance Mission to Afghanistan (UNAMA) is working closely with the Afghan Transitional Administration to develop a programme of voter registration. The actual process of registration is scheduled to begin in August and run through the winter until March 2004. Subject to security constraints, rural areas, less accessible in winter, will be registered first followed then by urban areas. Registration will be non-compulsory and conducted individually, to ensure privacy. UNAMA expect to have a final voters list ready by May 2004.</p>

	<p pid=".939W.6/2">Coalition investigations into Iraqi programmes to develop weapons of mass destruction are moving from an initial approach based on specific sites to a broader approach, encompassing other forms of evidence such as documentation and interviews, under the auspices of the Iraq Survey Group. On current plans the United Kingdom contribution to the Iraq Survey Group will be around 90&ndash;100 personnel, military and civilian, supported by Coalition forces. As at <phrase class="date" code="2003-06-22">22 June 2003</phrase>, Coalition forces had initiated investigations into 159 sites within Iraq, from a list of over 500, which may be connected to programmes to develop weapons of mass destruction. Additionally, investigations had been initiated into a further 83 sites identified since the conflict began. We anticipate that further sites will be identified as investigations progress.</p>

	<p pid=".942W.8/1">The Department for International Development commissioned a series of pilot Poverty and Social Impact Analyses (PSIAs) in seven countries in 2002. These were selected following demand from national governments and were carried out by both international and local consultants; they were funded by DFID headquarters and have been finalised. These pilots were in Honduras (electricity reform), Mozambique (fuel tax), Uganda (export promotion), Rwanda (macro policy), Armenia (water policy), Indonesia (rice tariff) and Orissa State India (public finances). The aim of these studies was to provide lessons to national governments in developing countries, as well as partners in the donor community, on what could be done, and how.</p>
	<p pid=".942W.8/2">DFID's policy is to support nationally-led processes, and support governments in undertaking PSIAs, together with partners and other national stakeholders. For example, DFID is supporting government-led initiatives in PSIA in a number of countries as and when demand arises; this currently includes co-ordinating stakeholder workshops in Ghana and Uganda to determine PSIA priorities. DFID is supporting PSIA in a number of other countries, which is led by national governments, and often financially supported by other donors.</p>

	<p pid=".948W.11/2">In December 2002, the Local Government Association, the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister, the Home Office, and the Commission for Racial Equality jointly published &quot;Guidance on Community Cohesion&quot;. This gives advice to local authorities on the practical steps they can take to promote community cohesion through all their policies and services, including education.</p>
	<p pid=".948W.11/3">The Government is also expanding the Specialist Schools Programme which requires schools to set objectives and targets to work with partner schools and the wider community, to spread the benefits of specialism to other schools and beyond.</p>
	<p pid=".948W.11/4">Excellence in Cities establishes important links between the schools which deliver the programme and the communities they serve. In particular, City Learning Centres, Excellence in Cities Action Zones and Learning Mentors all work directly with the wider community as well as with pupils and students.</p>
	<p pid=".948W.11/5">In addition, citizenship education, which has been a compulsory subject in secondary schools since September 2002, plays a part in building community cohesion in schools by teaching pupils tolerance, respect and understanding. It helps pupils learn how to become helpfully involved in the life and concerns of their school and develop socially and morally responsible behaviour towards those in authority and each other.</p>

	<p pid=".951W.9/1">The Department for Education and Skills has no executive agencies. Our executive non-departmental public bodies were tasked, in a letter sent in October 2000, with ensuring that sustainable development is incorporated into their activities and operations. As an example, in the remit letter issued to the Learning and Skills Council in November 2000, there are clear strategic objectives relating to sustainable development. Otherwise, we have one small independent tribunal, whose administrative function is provided by the Department.</p>
	<p pid=".951W.9/2">My Department is developing a sustainable development action plan for the education sector. It will seek a step change in the environmental operations of all publicly-funded educational establishments in England and in how people learn about sustainable development in all contexts. The Department itself will aim to become a model of best practice and would expect the same to apply to all of our associate bodies.</p>

	<p pid=".952W.2/1">Since 1997 we have been supporting schools and Local Education Authorities through funding a range of local and national initiatives to tackle truancy and improve school attendance, including the dissemination of school attendance guidance, a series of practitioner conferences and funding for the introduction of electronic registration systems into over 500 schools to track and manage absence.</p>
	<p pid=".952W.2/2">As part of the three year &pound;470 million Behaviour and Attendance strategy, targeted support is now being provided for schools with some of the greatest challenges to meet in improving behaviour and attendance. 700 schools are currently covered and this will extend to a further 1,900 schools by 2005. In addition the strategy will support all secondary schools with behaviour and attendance training and audits which will be available from September. Local Education Authorities with higher than expected levels of truancy are being provided with additional expert support to impact on school attendance rates.</p>
	<p pid=".952W.2/3">We have also co-ordinated national truancy sweeps in consultation with schools, Local Education Authorities and the police, and we have issued guidance on the operation of truancy sweeps. The last nationally co-ordinated truancy sweeps took place over three weeks last month involving all police forces in England and a further round is planned for the autumn. At local level truancy sweeps are now a regular feature in most Local Education Authorities and they are planned and conducted in partnership with schools, the police and other bodies such as Connexions and Youth Offending Teams.</p>
	<p pid=".952W.2/4">All schools are encouraged to develop good links between themselves and their local police. This includes the development of joint school and police liaison protocols.</p>

	<p pid=".954W.12/1">The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister does not use a standard definition of the term 'empty property'. It is commonly used to refer to property that is not occupied, even on an infrequent basis. Generally, properties that are used infrequently, such as second homes or holiday homes, are excluded from any definition but properties that are under-occupied, particularly in the case of commercial property, may not be.</p>
	<p pid=".954W.12/2">The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister recently published guidance, &quot;Empty Property: Unlocking the potential&mdash;an implementation handbook&quot; which sets out further information on identifying whether a property is empty.

	<p pid=".956W.0/23">Formula Spending Shares are not grant, nor are they the Government's assessment of how much an authority should spend on a particular service, they are simply the formula used to calculate an authority's Revenue Support Grant. Funding for social services (as for all other services) is largely funded through redistributed business rates, Revenue Support Grant and council tax. The amount of funding each social service department receives is determined by the local authority taking into account local priorities. Revenue Support Grant is an unhypothecated block grant that may be spent on any service.</p>

	<p pid=".965W.8/1">Recent labour market developments reflect continued steady growth in employment, up by 51,000 in the last three months and 242,000 over the last year. The increase in employment has been matched by a rise in the labour force brought about by population growth and higher activity rates. As a result unemployment has been broadly flat, though it has been fluctuating from month to month around this flat trend.</p>
	<p pid=".965W.8/2">ILO unemployment currently stands at 1.495 million. The ILO unemployment rate is 5.1 per cent., up 0.1 percentage points in the last three months, but down by the same amount over the last year. The number of unemployed claimants is 950,800. The claimant unemployment rate is 3.1 per cent. and has been unchanged at this level since December 2001.</p>
	<p pid=".965W.8/3">The Government's approach is based on macro-economic stability combined with active labour market measures to help jobless people, particularly the most disadvantaged, get back into work. Steady economic growth and policies such as New Deal have contributed to a rise of 1.5 million in the number of people in work since 1997, while long-term unemployment has fallen by 75 per cent. to a historically low level.</p>

	<p pid=".967W.0/1">HSE's operational directorates and divisions deal with a wide range of workplaces, both fixed and transient, across several employment sectors. This requires HSE to adopt different approaches based on understanding of hazards and risks and the performance of duty holders. Higher risk sites and high hazard sites where there is potential for catastrophic events are visited more frequently than lower risk sites which might be visited infrequently. The lowest risk sites might be contacted through other means than visits such as seminars and mailshots.</p>
	<p pid=".967W.0/2">In addition, local authorities have inspection responsibility under the Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974 for approximately 1.2 million premises in the retail, finance and leisure sectors.. Intervention strategies are based on assessments of intrinsic hazard and risk and judgments about the competence and willingness of duty holders to control risks and comply with the law. Intervals between visits will vary substantially between sectors and between duty holders within each sector. For these reasons it is not possible to provide a meaningful average for the frequency of visits.</p>
