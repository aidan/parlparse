	<p pid="c.16W.2/2">All single living accommodation (SLA) at RM Condor has been subject to a Grading Review in accordance with this Department's 4-Tier Grading system, which provides the means of determining accommodation charges for differing standards of SLA. In this system, Grade 1 for Charge (GlfC) is the highest and G4fC the lowest. The grading system assesses 14 different criteria relating to accommodation such as condition (including decoration), scaling, provision of local amenities and environmental factors. All the different factors are taken into account, and when targets are not met a graduated number of points are deducted from the overall score. The more deductions there are, the lower the grade allocated to the SLA.</p>
	<p pid="c.16W.2/3">Of the 1,021 SLA bed-spaces at RM Condor, 383 have been assessed at being GlfC, 566 are at G3fC and 72 at G4fC. SLA bedspaces at RM Condor, while not new, are generally in a reasonable standard of condition and the main reasons for the number of G3fC and G4fC bedspaces is due to either Scaling (e.g. size of rooms) or Location (e.g. proximity to local amenities). Given the number of bed-spaces assessed as G3fC and G4fC, details of individual assessments could be provided only at disproportionate cost.</p>

	<p pid="c.18W.2/1">Reports made to the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) under the Reporting of Injuries, Diseases and Dangerous Occurrences Regulations 1995 (RIDDOR), include a wider range of issues than incidents purely relating to toppling (i.e. collapsing) tower cranes, because they fall within the broader category of &quot;failure, collapse or overturning of lifting machinery, excavator, pile driving, or Mobile Elevated Working Platform.&quot; Similar difficulties arise with injury reports.</p>
	<p pid="c.18W.2/2">Accordingly, the figures for collapsing tower cranes are based on the best available data held by HSE's Construction Division, rather than wider RIDDOR information.

	<p pid="c.32W.8/3">The Government have welcomed this important report, which highlights the need for better, more strategic decision making by local authorities on the procurement and management of leisure facilities. We want to help local authorities to revitalise their leisure facilities and to ensure that the right sports facilities are in the right places. Sport England has already developed a range of strategic planning tools to assist them. These include, among others: the Active Places database, which provides a comprehensive picture of sports facilities across the country; the National Benchmarking Service; a Facilities Planning Model; and a Sports Facilities Demand Estimator. In addition, Sport England's Facilities Improvement Service is working closely with local authorities to improve the quality of their sports facilities and service delivery.</p>

	<p pid="c.38W.6/1">The driver for the project at Peaseholme Green is primarily to increase occupancy capacity to enable the Department to achieve greater efficiencies in office utilisation which in itself will contribute to reducing the Department's environmental impact. All government major refurbishments and new builds are required to achieve BREEAM Excellent accreditation.</p>
	<p pid="c.38W.6/2">DEFRA approach capital projects holistically, which includes sustainable construction, energy and water efficiency, achieving BREEAM Excellent while giving value for money to the Exchequer. This approach is supported by the reference to two of its major projects in the National Audit Office's report dated April 2007 titled 'Building for the future: Sustainable construction and refurbishment on the government estate' where the NAO cite them as good examples.</p>
	<p pid="c.38W.6/3">The construction works at Kings Pool are being undertaken in an industry leading way, minimising waste output while maximising the recycling of any waste materials produced. A number of low and zero carbon technologies are also being introduced to the site including solar thermal hot water, rain water harvesting and ultra low NOx gas fired boilers. These technologies combined with a state of the art building management system have been designed to help the building user make the most efficient use of the new facilities, and reduce the environmental impact of the site.</p>
	<p pid="c.38W.6/4">Using its experience in refurbishing office buildings, achieving BREEAM Excellent, reducing energy and water consumption, selecting sustainable materials and adopting sustainable construction methods, DEFRA estimate that the extra-over cost of additional sustainable technologies incorporated into the works is around &pound;485,000 inclusive of VAT, which equates to 2.9 per cent. of the capital construction costs, which were budgeted at &pound;16.9 million inclusive of VAT.</p>
	<p pid="c.38W.6/5">For comparison, BRE supported documentation indicate that in a new build naturally ventilated building a BREEAM Excellent rating costs between 2.5 per cent. and 3.4 per cent. of the capital cost; to achieve this in a major refurbishment such as that being undertaken at Kings Pool, we would anticipate this figure being higher.</p>

The greenhouse gas emissions from the water sector were mapped for the first time in &quot;Future Water&mdash;The Government's Water Strategy for England&quot;, which was published in February 2008. Over 2.5 million tonnes of greenhouse gases, as carbon dioxide equivalents, are emitted from the treatment of wastewater every year.</p>
	<p pid="c.48W.5/2">The use of urine separation systems has the potential to help reduce emissions, save water and reduce wastewater treatment costs. However, while urine-separation toilets would be relatively easy to install, it would also be necessary to adapt associated domestic pipe work and fit on-site storage facilities. Existing public sewerage systems have been developed to carry away all foul water from premises. To alter these systems in order to separate waste streams would be costly and impractical, but could be considered in new developments with discrete sewerage infrastructure.</p>

Regional Ministers have been actively pursuing those roles set out for them in the Governance of Britain Green Paper published in July 2007. They have helped ensure that the development and delivery of Government policy takes account of the key issues facing their regions, both by engaging with a wide range of regional partners in meetings and dedicated visits and by representing their regions within Government. Regional Ministers have also been involved in the appointment of Regional Development Agency chairs and boards, while their relation to forthcoming regional committees will be determined over the coming months following the Modernisation Committee's inquiry into regional accountability.</p>

However, under the terms of their contacts with my Department, each provider for the Deposit Protection Service must submit a monthly report giving details of performance against key performance indicators. The providers incur penalty points if key targets are not met. Resolution of disputes within stated timescales (currently 28 days) is one of the key performance indicators used in this way. Monthly monitoring returns up to end February 2008 have been received. So far, I can confirm that performance has been good with each scheme delivering in full against the indicator.</p>

I am very pleased that new regulations to this effect were introduced in China in January. This is very positive, but more needs to be done and we are encouraging China to extend this freedom beyond 2008 and to China's domestic media too, so that it is a real legacy from the Games.

	<p pid="c.70W.6/1">The handover ceremonies at the end of the Beijing Olympic Games and Paralympic Games this summer provide a starting point for promoting the 2012 Games. They will focus the world's attention on Britain. Visit Britain, UKTI, FCO, and the British Council are working together to promote this opportunity for Britain, alongside Visit London and other London agencies. Visit Britain will engage with the estimated 40,000 global media representatives present in Beijing to promote this country. An estimated 321,000 additional visitors will come to London for the Games. A framework for marketing the UK was published in October by DCMS in &quot;Winning&mdash;the tourism strategy for 2012&quot;.</p>

Admissions do not represent the number of in-patients, as a person may have more than one admission within the year.<br/> <i> Data Quality</i><br/> Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) are compiled from data sent by over 300 NHS trusts and primary care trusts (PCTs) in England. The Information Centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies and the effect of missing and invalid data via HES processes. While this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain.<br/> <i> Assessing growth through time</i><br/> HES figures are available from 1989-90 onwards. During the years that these records have been collected by the NHS, there have been ongoing improvements in quality and coverage. These improvements in information submitted by the NHS have been particularly marked in the earlier years and need to be borne in mind when analysing time series.<br/> Changes in NHS practice also need to be borne in mind when analysing time series. For example, a number of procedures may now be undertaken in out-patient settings and may no longer be accounted in the HES data. This may account for any reductions in activity over time.<br/> <i> All Diagnoses count of Mentions</i><br/> These figures represent a count of all mentions of a diagnosis in any of the 14 diagnosis fields in the HES data set. Therefore, if a diagnosis is mentioned in more than one diagnosis field during an episode, all diagnoses are counted.<br/> <i> ICD-10 Diagnosis Codes Used:</i><br/> T51: Toxic effect of Alcohol<br/> <i> Ungrossed Data</i><br/> Figures have not been adjusted for shortfalls in data (i.e. the data are ungrossed).<br/> <i> Source:</i><br/> HES, The Information Centre for health and social care.</td> </tr>

	<p pid="c.81W.3/2">The new &quot;National Stroke Strategy&quot;, announced in December 2007, will modernise services and deliver the newest treatments for stroke across England. The strategy emphasises the need to improve access to scans and stipulates that brain imaging should be performed in the next scan slot, or within 60 minutes of request out of hours. We are asking all local stroke networks to ensure that any patient who could benefit from urgent care is transferred to an acute stroke centre that provides 24-hour access to scans and other specialist stroke care.</p>
	<p pid="c.81W.3/3">We have fully costed the proposals in the strategy, and this will be reflected in the allocation that goes to primary care trusts for next year. In addition, we have committed new central funds totalling &pound;105 million over the next three years. Some of that new funding will be used to develop demonstration sites for acute services that will enable us not only to show a step change in service provision in those areas, but also to provide lessons that can be shared. The &pound;105 million is central funding&mdash;on top of money going into the national health service to support this change.</p>

This, coupled with the lag between the provision of treatment, the collation of the claim data and the often lengthy process of reviewing and then accepting or rejecting a claim by another member state, means it is normal practice for EEA countries (including the UK) to have outstanding claims.

	<p pid="c.105W.0/1">Relations between Japan and the UK are excellent. We co-operate closely on a range of key global issues including climate change, development, international security and science and technology, as outlined in the 2007 UK-Japan Joint Statement. Our two countries also enjoy thriving economic and trade links, and Japanese investment continues to be very important for the UK economy. In addition to these areas of shared interest, our close and collaborative relationship allows us to raise frankly with our Japanese colleagues those issues where we disagree, such as whaling and the death penalty.</p>
	<p pid="c.105W.0/2">Both my right hon. Friends the Prime Minister and Foreign Secretary recently held telephone conversations with their Japanese counterparts. They also look forward to visiting Japan in the next few months for the G8 Summit and related meetings. I hope we will be able to explore new ways in which we can strengthen our ties ahead of and during these visits.</p>

	<p pid="c.106W.5/1">Like all our Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) Missions overseas, our embassies in Venezuela, Colombia and Ecuador have robust contingency planning processes, which are reviewed and updated regularly. If there is a risk in a host country (e.g. from civil disorder or a natural disaster) that could lead to an evacuation of British nationals, the FCO mission there will hold a civil contingency plan. Missions continually assess the risk level they face and plan accordingly. In compiling civil contingency plans, the FCO's objective is to protect British nationals from a situation that poses a serious threat to their safety and, in a worst case scenario, to assist their departure to a place of safety. We encourage our Missions overseas to ensure their plans are compatible with other European partners and to identify areas where cooperation would enhance our planning.</p>
	<p pid="c.106W.5/2">The FCO travel advice for all three countries remains under constant review and has been amended to include factual information about recent developments. We have advised against all but essential travel to certain areas along the Colombian/Venezuelan border. A full copy of the latest FCO travel advice can be read at:</p>

The figures provided are for the twelve months ending February 2002 and for the latest period, the twelve months ending March 2007. The source data used is the APS, using Standard Occupational Classification 2000 (SOC2000). The twenty-five occupational classifications are ranked according to the largest positive change in Bexleyheath and Crayford. Data prior to 2002 are classified using Standard Occupational Classification 1990 (SOC90), consequently it is not possible to provide a consistent time series for the period requested.</p>

Planning guidance to local authorities is clear: no playing field needed by the community should be removed. In addition, Sport England object to all applications that would result in a loss of playing fields, unless there is a clear benefit to sport.</p>

	<p pid="c.148W.11/2">Take it Away is an Arts Council initiative and was launched as a national scheme in July 2007. Through ArtCo Trading Ltd, the Take it Away scheme has received &pound;165,000 in 2006-07, and &pound;625,000 in 2007-08, in grant funding.</p>
	<p pid="c.148W.11/3">There are currently 91 member retailers across England. This is expected to increase to 250 from April/May 2008.</p>
	<p pid="c.148W.11/4">For the first six months (July to December 2007) a total of 3,849 loans have been taken out by customers.</p>
	<p pid="c.148W.11/5">The scheme is open to anyone but has the following target groups:</p>
	<p pid="c.148W.11/6" class="indent">Those buying an instrument for a child or young person under 18;</p>
	<p pid="c.148W.11/7" class="indent">Those buying an instrument for the first time (of any age);</p>
	<p pid="c.148W.11/8" class="indent">Those on lower than the average national income (&pound;22,500).</p>
	<p pid="c.148W.11/9">The first six month report shows that 82.72 per cent. of customers to date fall within at least one of the three priority groups: Over a quarter (29.8 per cent.) of instruments have been bought for a young person; almost half (46.03 per cent.) of all loans have been taken out by customers on incomes less than &pound;22,500 per annum; and almost half (47.93 per cent.) of all loans have provided instruments for people who have classed themselves as a beginner or adult re-starter. 57.6 per cent. of customers fall into the socio-economic grade A, B and C1 and 42.4 per cent. fall into socio-economic grades C2, D and E collectively.</p>
	<p pid="c.148W.11/10">The Arts Council's view is that it is too early at this stage to assess the longer term impact and effectiveness of the scheme in promoting the learning of musical instruments. However, the strong uptake in the first six months suggests that the scheme is having an impact in generating interest and engagement from a broad cross section of the community.</p>

	<p pid="c.158W.3/3">Information on the number of prisoners doubled in cells intended for one or trebled in cells intended for two on <phrase class="date" code="2008-02-22">22 February</phrase> is not yet available. The most recent figures available are from the end of January when 20,055 prisoners were held in such cells. Data are provisional and final figures are published following the year end. Our records show that no prisoners are currently trebled in cells intended for one.</p>
	<p pid="c.158W.3/4">An establishment's certified normal accommodation (CNA) does not normally include cells in punishment or segregation units. Nor does the CNA of training prisons and young offender institutions normally include health care cells or rooms that are not routinely used to accommodate long stay patients. The information regarding prisoners held in these types of accommodation is not recorded centrally.</p>
	<p pid="c.158W.3/5">No prison is expected to operate at a level of crowding beyond that which the Prison Service area manager (or regional offender manager in the case of a contracted prison) considers safe.</p>
	<p pid="c.158W.3/6">There are no other forms of temporary or emergency accommodation used for prisoners.</p>

	<p pid="c.169W.2/12">Over the past decade we have more than doubled the number of young people and adults starting apprenticeships. Over the period to 2020 we project that apprenticeship starts will increase to over 250,000 per year. As we grow the programme, taking up an apprenticeship may become attractive to even more young people. We will maintain our commitment to meeting the demand from suitably qualified young people, so that if more come forward we will work with employers to expand further. On this basis, we anticipate that around one in five of all young people will be undertaking an apprenticeship within the next decade.</p>

	<p pid="c.182W.5/1">The Department issued its 'Drugs: Guidance for Schools' to all mainlined schools in February 2004, This makes clear our intention for pupils to be educated about alcohol and its effects in primary school&mdash;before drinking patterns become established&mdash; and for this to be revisited in secondary school as pupils' understanding and experience increases.</p>
	<p pid="c.182W.5/2">Alcohol education should be delivered (along with other drug education) through well planned personal, social, health and economic education (PSHE). Schools are expected to use the non-statutory frameworks of PSHE and citizenship at key stages 1 and 2, PSHE at key stages 3 and 4, the statutory citizenship programme of study at key stages 3 and 4 and the statutory requirements within the national curriculum science order for all phases for developing drug education.</p>
	<p pid="c.182W.5/3">We announced in the Children's Plan that we would this year review the delivery of drug and alcohol education in schools in the light of the comprehensive and long-running Blueprint study, which is expected to conclude shortly.</p>
	<p pid="c.182W.5/4">In addition to that, we also announced in the Children's Plan that we would publish an action plan on young people and alcohol, which will look at whether there are other ways&mdash;including action on alcohol education, low-price sales of alcohol and alcohol advertising&mdash;in which we could seek to influence young people's consumption of alcohol. We expect to publish the action plan shortly.</p>
	<p pid="c.182W.5/5">The action plan will build on existing measures to communicate clearer information to young people and parents about the harms associated with alcohol, which were set out in the Government document 'Safe, Sensible, Social,' which updated the national alcohol harm reduction strategy.</p>

	<p pid="c.186W.6/2">In respect of paragraph 69, the Government remain committed to the promotion and protection of human rights including respect for, and acceptance of, pluralism and diversity. The non-statutory framework for religious education places inclusion, tolerance, diversity and interfaith dialogue at the heart of children's learning. Each locally agreed syllabus must take into account not only Christianity but the teaching and practices of the other principal religions represented in the country. The membership of a Standing Advisory Council on Religious Education, as set out in law, should comprise representatives of Christian denominations and other religions which reflect the principal religious traditions in the area, as well as representatives of teaching unions and of the local authority.</p>
	<p pid="c.186W.6/3">In relation to paragraph 70 of the report, every parent has the right to withdraw their child from all or any part of religious education and/or collective worship, Since September 2007, sixth form pupils have had the right to opt-out of collective worship without parental consent. We believe it is reasonable to limit this right to collective worship and to those above compulsory school age.</p>

	<p pid="c.193W.0/1">The Special Educational Needs Code of Practice is statutory guidance to which local authorities and others must have regard. It sets out parents' right under the Education Act 1996 to request an assessment of their children's special educational needs (SEN) and local authorities' duties, where necessary, to assess and to draw up SEN statements. The code includes guidance, and the regulations, setting out the form the statement must take. It advises local authorities of their duty to send parents draft statements with the name of the school left blank and invite the parents to request a maintained mainstream or special school or to make representations for a non-maintained school. The code makes clear that where parents request a maintained school the local authority must name that school on the final statement unless the school is unsuitable for the child's age, ability, aptitude or SEN or naming the school would be incompatible with the efficient education of other children there or the efficient use of resources, A maintained school named on a final statement must admit the child.</p>
	<p pid="c.193W.0/2">Parents have the right to obtain an independent assessment of their child's SEN if they are in dispute with their local authority. If parents include the report of such an assessment in the advice they give to the local authority as part of the statutory assessment process then the local authority must take it into account when deciding whether to draw up a statement. If the parents appeal to the SEN and Disability Tribunal and include the report of the independent assessment in their statement of case then the tribunal panel must take it into account when considering the appeal.</p>

	<p pid="c.196W.5/1">The Government are committed to every child having access to personalised learning support, which could include small group tuition, to ensure that every child achieves their potential. As part of personalising learning for children and young people, the Government are encouraging schools to consider the opportunities for children beyond the school day, and in particular through extended schools. The extended school core offer includes a varied menu of activities for children and young people, with study support as part of this. The Government have committed over &pound;13 billion over the next three years to support the development of extended schools, and included in this is funding to support small group academic focused study support in some secondary schools, with funding for this becoming available in 2009/10.</p>
	<p pid="c.196W.5/2">In addition, the Every Child a Reader programme is providing support to six to seven-year-olds who are struggling to learn to read. An expert literacy intervention teacher will be trained in every school that is part of this programme. Their first task will be to provide one to one support to children with the greatest difficulties in learning to read. They will also give small group tuition to children with less severe reading difficulties.</p>

There is, however, a statutory requirement for schools to provide work-related learning for 14 to 16-year-olds. From September 2008 we are also introducing new Diplomas for 14-19s which cover a wide range of business sectors. Work related learning includes work experience placements which can be organised flexibly and which prepare young people for adult and working life. Additionally, many young people have access to summer schools as part of the Aimhigher and City Challenge programmes.</p>
