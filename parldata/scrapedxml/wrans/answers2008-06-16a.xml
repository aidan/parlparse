	<p pid="a.628W.8/1">I have had a number of recent discussions with the First Minister regarding the proposal for an Order on the Welsh language. The Welsh Language Act 1993 provides a practical framework to promote and develop the use of the Welsh language in Wales. It has proved an effective tool in ensuring Welsh speakers are able to receive key public services in Welsh.</p>
	<p pid="a.628W.8/2">The Wales Office has recorded some 20 representations on the provision of public services in the Welsh language in the last three years. In the first year, these broadly covered Welsh language schemes, translation services, utility bills in Welsh and the use of Welsh in the European Union. In the second year, issues raised included the use of Welsh in the domestic energy sector and provision of Welsh language services in prisons. Issues raised over the last year have included the provision of translation services and future statutory provision on the Welsh Language.</p>

	<p pid="a.634W.5/1">My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Environment (Hilary Benn) attended this meeting on 24 to <phrase class="date" code="2008-05-26">26 May</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.634W.5/2">The three agenda items were climate change, biodiversity (covering illegal logging issues) and the 3Rs (Reduce, Reuse, Recycle). The meeting produced a Chair's Summary, as well as agreeing a '3R Action Plan' and a 'Call to Action on Biodiversity', linked to a 'G8 Forests Experts' Report on Illegal Logging' that includes a menu of actions for G8 members to address illegal logging collectively and individually. These documents are publicly available on the website of Japan's Ministry of the Environment.</p>
	<p pid="a.634W.5/3">At the meeting, the UK made contributions on each of the three items.</p>
	<p pid="a.634W.5/4">On climate change, the Secretary of State's overall aim was to give impetus to the G8 summit and to engage in dialogue with G8+8 countries on climate change issues. There was a positive discussion on long-term climate goals which should send an appropriately strong signal to the G8 summit and a good discussion on carbon markets, with several parties explaining their intentions on national cap and trade schemes. There was also agreement to a further dialogue&mdash;the Kobe process&mdash;which will provide a valuable forum for informal discussions with major emitters.</p>
	<p pid="a.634W.5/5">On the 3Rs, the Secretary of State underlined the importance of improving resource efficiency and promoting more sustainable products and materials at national and international level. He pointed out that implementing the England Waste Strategy 2007 is expected to lead to an annual net reduction in greenhouse gas emissions of at least 9.3 million tons of CO2 equivalent, roughly the same as taking three million cars off the road each year. He stressed the need for strict compliance with the UN Basel Convention on the trans-boundary movement of waste, and for measures to promote environmentally sound ship recycling.</p>
	<p pid="a.634W.5/6">On biodiversity, the Secretary of State in his interventions focused particularly on forestry and illegal logging, emphasising that improved forest governance is essential to deliver reduced emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD) as well as to maintain forest biodiversity. He also underlined the importance of working to achieve the 2010 biodiversity target and ensuring effective follow-up to that target.</p>

	<p pid="a.636W.8/1">Proposals for strengthened powers for local authorities to stop, search and seize vehicles suspected of involvement in fly-tipping form part of a wider package of measures designed to tackle illegal waste activity which has been discussed with stakeholders during the course of the last year. The Government issued a consultation document on all these measures on <phrase class="date" code="2008-06-13">13 June 2008</phrase>. This consultation will end in September 2008. Allowing sufficient time for consideration of responses and detailed policy development means that the legislation will not come into force before the common commencement date in April 2009.</p>

A separate survey by Entertainment Media Research showed that in 2007 some 43 per cent. of respondents had downloaded unauthorised music from file-sharing sites, although a different survey by Olswang into convergence reported lower figures, whereby only 14 per cent. of respondents admitted unlawfully copying music.</p>

	<p pid="a.640W.2/1">The individual allocations have been calculated by reference to each company's market share based on customer account numbers. Each supplier has agreed to pay a contribution per customer account. The contribution per customer account is then multiplied by the number of customer accounts &quot;owned&quot; by a supplier to arrive at each supplier's contribution. A breakdown of suppliers' individual contributions cannot be made available as it contains commercially sensitive information and therefore remains confidential between the Department and the energy supplier.</p>

	<p pid="a.640W.5/3">In Budget 2008, the Government said they would like to see the amount energy suppliers spend on social programmes increase to at least &pound;150 million a year over the period ahead. A new voluntary agreement has recently been signed individually with the six major energy suppliers to treble their investment on social programmes in the next three years, reaching collective investment of &pound;150 million by 2010-11. This will take spend to &pound;100 million in 2008-09, &pound;125 million in 2009-10 and &pound;150 million in 2010-11.</p>
	<p pid="a.640W.5/4">In addition, winter fuel payments helped keep 11.7 million people warm in winter 2006-07 and Budget 2008 announced an additional one-off payment of &pound;100 to over-80s households and &pound;50 to over-60s households in 2008-09.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2008-06-16a.208550.r0" oldstyleid="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2008-06-16a.643W.6" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1423" speakername="Jack Straw" colnum="643W"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080616/text/80616w0003.htm#0806167000932">
	<p pid="a.643W.6/1">Under section 139 Criminal Justice Act 1988, it is an offence to have any article which has a blade or is sharply pointed in a public place; the definition of 'public place' includes courts as a place to which the public have access. It is a defence to prove that a knife is carried for work, religious reasons or as part of a national costume. Section 139 only applies to those folding pen-knives with a blade of more than 3 in so possession of a pen-knife with a blade of this length or less is not an offence under the Act.</p>
	<p pid="a.643W.6/2">The powers of seizure and retention of items, and of exclusion from courts, are derived from sections 53 to 55 of the Courts Act 2003.</p>
	<p pid="a.643W.6/3">All knives, of whatever length, are among those items which Her Majesty's Courts Service class as prohibited items and are not permitted inside any place where court business takes place. All bladed items must be surrendered to a court security officer and if not willingly surrendered, they may be seized by those officers. If the item is not surrendered or seized, the bearer will be excluded from entry into the court or removed. The police are informed of all offensive weapons surrendered or seized and court security officers follow the advice given by them. As possession of folding pen-knife with a blade of 3 in or less is not an offence, the court security officers would not normally advise the police of these items being retained.</p>
	<p pid="a.643W.6/4">If a court security officer reasonably believes that a bladed item is evidence of, or in relation to, an offence, then they contact the police as soon as possible after the item was surrendered or seized and provide them with information about the item, the person carrying the item and if appropriate, any difficulties they had in obtaining the item.</p>
	<p pid="a.643W.6/5">The court security officer will then follow the advice of the police who may attend, dispose of the item, and take any other appropriate investigative action.</p>
	<p pid="a.643W.6/6">If a person requests the return of an item when he/she leaves the court building, but the court security officer has reasonable grounds to believe that the item may be evidence of, or in relation to an offence, then the person is told that under section 55(2)(b), the officer has the power to retain it for up to 24 hours or until they have sought advice from the police. Items which are lawful to possess, such as folding pen-knives with the permitted length of blade, are returned when the owner asks for them.</p>
	<p pid="a.643W.6/7">The Courts Act itself gives no power to retain articles beyond either the 24-hour permitted period or the later point when the owner returns to collect it. If the police do not collect the item within the permitted period or at any rate before the owner returns to collect it, then the article must be returned.</p>
	<p pid="a.643W.6/8">Policy guidance on all aspects of security, including detailed guidance on the powers and practice of searching, and the seizure of prohibited items, is disseminated through the document Safe and Secure to all staff and contractors. In addition, court security officers receive full training on these powers and are not appointed until assurance is provided that this has been completed satisfactorily.</p>

	<p pid="a.645W.5/1">There have been no prosecutions under the 2003 Act since it came into force in March 2004. However, the Act is designed to help to prevent this unacceptable practice from happening in the first place and anecdotal evidence suggests that it is doing this. It is also being used to raise awareness among relevant professionals including police forces and others in the Criminal Justice System and those involved with health care, social services and the education sector so that girls at risk can be identified. There is evidence that the law is being pursued vigorously. The Metropolitan Police Child Abuse Investigation Command, for example, has specifically targeted female genital mutilation and produced a comprehensive training pack which has been disseminated widely to London's schools and many other agencies. Ultimately, educating communities to abandon the practice is the best way forward to break the cycle of mutilation and the Act continues to be widely used for that purpose.</p>

The UK ranks fifth in the OECD for first degree completion rates, out of 23 countries who report data in this area. A university education is now open to more students than ever before and the Government is totally committed to providing opportunities for all people to achieve their potential and to maximise their talent. The improved student finance support package, from academic year 2008-09 onwards, demonstrates that commitment.</p>

However, we will explore this issue further when more relevant data is available and feed this into the evidence base for the independent review of variable fees.</p>

	<p pid="a.651W.8/1">There are no plans to abolish university tuition fees for all undergraduate students from England studying at English universities.

Record numbers of undergraduate students are going to universities both generally and from non-traditional backgrounds since we introduced our reforms in 2006.</p>

	<p pid="a.652W.2/1">Information from the Student Loans Company shows that, in the academic year 2006-07, of English domiciled part-time students, around 44,000 received fee grants and 46,000 received course grants. Each total represents around 10 per cent. of part-time undergraduate students. Part-time students need to be studying at 50 per cent. of the intensity of a full-time student to apply for both a fee and course grant.</p>
	<p pid="a.652W.2/2">This Government were the first to introduce statutory support for part-time students, in 2000/01. In 2006-07, we introduced the most generous package of financial support ever for part-time students in England. This included increasing the maximum fee grant by 27 per cent. and an above-inflation increase in the income threshold for receiving this support. English-domiciled part time students in 2006-07 received &pound;11 million course grant and &pound;27 million fee grant, compared with &pound;9 million course grant and &pound;19 million fee grant in 2005-06.</p>
	<p pid="a.652W.2/3">The part-time package is different from the support available to full-time students because it has been designed to meet the particular needs of part-time students. Unlike full-time students, many part-time students are in full-time employment&mdash;two-thirds according to the Woodley report, published at the end of 2004. That report also found that 36 per cent. of part-time students receive full fee support from their employer.</p>

The UK is already one of the world's leading donors to humanitarian demining, and since 2001 the Department for International Development (DFID) has spent over &pound;70 million on clearing landmines, cluster munitions and other explosive remnants of war, and helping victims in the worst affected countries. For example, DFID has contributed over &pound;3.5 million towards clearance of the 40 square kilometres of southern Lebanon contaminated by unexploded cluster munitions during the conflict in 2006. One of our major partners, the Mines Advisory Group, has alone cleared over 17,000 unexploded sub-munitions in southern Lebanon since August 2006, allowing thousands of people to return home safely.</p>

	<p pid="a.674W.5/1">We have made it perfectly clear that our objective is that foreign national prisoners should face deportation, when they meet the relevant criteria, and that deportation should happen as early as possible in their sentence. Any European Economic Area national who has committed a crime in the UK and received a recommendation for deportation at the time of sentencing or received a custodial sentence of 24 months or more will be considered for deportation action. The UK Border Agency will continue to take a robust approach in considering and, where international obligations allow, pursuing the deportation of EEA nationals.</p>

	<p pid="a.678W.5/2">No Government have ever been able to produce an accurate figure for the number of people who are in the country illegally. By its very nature, it is impossible to quantify accurately and that remains the case.</p>
	<p pid="a.678W.5/3">Exit controls were phased out from 1994. As part of the Government's 10-point plan for delivery by Christmas 2008, the majority of foreign nationals will be counted in and out of the country. This will build on the successes of our early testing of the e-Borders programme (Project Semaphore) which already covers over 30 million passenger movements and has led to 18,000 alerts and more than 1,500 arrests.</p>
	<p pid="a.678W.5/4">This is part of a sweeping programme of border protection which also includes the global roll-out of fingerprint visas, compulsory watch-list checks for all travellers from high-risk countries before they land in Britain and ID cards for foreign nationals.</p>

	<p pid="a.682W.2/3">On <phrase class="date" code="2008-06-05">5 June</phrase>, the Government announced that anyone over the age of 16 caught in possession of a knife should expect to be prosecuted on the first offence. Those under 16 who commit offences without aggravating factors can still expect to receive a warning coupled with referral to a knife education scheme to help them understand the dangers and consequences of carrying knives, and reduce the chances of reoffending.</p>
	<p pid="a.682W.2/4">The Home Office also announced a targeted programme on the Tackling Gangs Action Programme model, working with police forces and local authority partners to tackle knife crime. &pound;2 million has been allocated to support police partnerships in specific areas, including the West Midlands, which will include:</p>
	<p pid="a.682W.2/5" class="indent">Increased use of searches, in targeted and intelligence-led operations, to complement the 100 new portable knife arches and 350 search wands brought in over the last three months.</p>
	<p pid="a.682W.2/6" class="indent">Fast-tracking the 'knife referral project' in which all young people convicted of a knife offence but not receiving a custodial sentence attend a course to bring home the consequences of knife crime</p>
	<p pid="a.682W.2/7" class="indent">Home visits and letters to parents of those young people whom intelligence suggests are known to carry weapons.</p>
	<p pid="a.682W.2/8">We are ensuring that the police have access to detection equipment through the provision of an additional 100 search arches and 400 search 'wands' this year, and we will provide additional equipment beyond this according to need.</p>
	<p pid="a.682W.2/9">We are working with the Youth Justice Board to ensure that young people convicted of knife offences receive focused interventions to change their behaviour and prevent them from reoffending.</p>
	<p pid="a.682W.2/10">In addition to focused local action, we launched on <phrase class="date" code="2008-05-29">29 May</phrase> a knife marketing campaign investing &pound;3 million over three years aimed at reducing youth knife possession. Developed by young people, the message &quot;It doesn't have to happen&quot; is being conveyed through posters, radio ads, viral video sharing and social networking sites. The campaign also focuses on engaging with mothers to encourage them to talk to their children about the dangers of carrying knives.</p>

The blocking initiative is designed to reduce the occasions when innocent internet users might accidentally be exposed to traumatic and unlawful images, diminish the re-victimisation of children by restricting opportunities to view their sexual abuse and disrupt the accessibility and supply of such content to those who may seek out such images.</p>

Since 2004, blocking of these sites on consumer broadband in the UK has gone from nothing to 95 per cent. thanks to the work carried out by industry and the IWF.

	<p pid="a.687W.2/4">Given the scale and trend for increasingly large and complex cases we believe there may be a need to go beyond 28 days in future. The Government are determined to give the police the powers they need to tackle terrorism. That is why it is right and proper to legislate now to put in place the reserve power to extend pre-charge detention beyond 28 days if in future there is a grave exceptional terrorist threat. We have consulted widely on all of the proposals in the Counter-Terrorism Bill, including pre-charge detention, and this is an approach which has been widely welcomed. This has included discussions with the police, CPS and the intelligence and security agencies.</p>

As was the case with previous Administrations, it is not the Government's practice to provide details of all such representations.</p>
	<p pid="a.692W.9/2">HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) is committed to increasing the efficiency of its operations in the interests of improved customer service and better value for taxpayers. It undertook extensive internal and external consultation, and detailed feasibility work, last year on its proposals for reducing its estate in the Southend urban centre to meet its future business needs in the area. The decision was taken last July that there was no requirement to retain either Portcullis House or Tyler's House, as all the staff who would be needed in Southend by 2010 could be accommodated in Alexander House, Southend.</p>
	<p pid="a.692W.9/3">The latest staffing projections for Southend, which take account of further developments in business plans, indicate that slightly fewer staff than in 2010 will be needed by 2011. There is therefore no reason to disturb the original decision that Portcullis House and Tyler's House will be surplus to HMRC's future business requirements.</p>

Furthermore, &quot;Planning Policy Guidance Note 17: Planning for Open Space, Sport and Recreation, 2002&quot; requires local authorities to make provision for all types of open space and requires them to undertake robust assessments of local needs and audits of existing open space, to establish standards for new provision.

	<p pid="a.700W.9/1">The Housing Revenue Account (HRA) capital financing requirement (CFR) is a measure of HRA debt. It is a &quot;stock&quot; which is rolled forward each year to take account of new borrowing for HRA purposes. The HRA CFR from 1992-93 to 2007-08 is set out in the following table. We cannot differentiate the purpose for which the debt was taken out.</p>
	<p pid="a.700W.9/2">The HRA CFR increases by the value of new borrowing every year and decreases by the value of principal repaid every year. The decline in HRA debt, from 1994-95 to 2004-05, shows that local authorities have been repaying more debt than they have been taking out. We would expect to see this as until 2004-05 local authorities were compelled to set-aside money to repay debt and this was taken into consideration in the calculation of their HRA debt level, and hence a reduction in the percentages of housing revenue account capital financing charge as public sector net debt.</p>
	<p pid="a.700W.9/3">Public sector net debt (PSND) is the main measure of national debt used in the Government's fiscal policy framework. PSND records financial liabilities issued by the public sector less its holdings of liquid financial assets. Public sector includes central Government, local government and public corporations.</p>

	<p pid="a.715W.2/1">In November 2006, HMG made the decision to take the lead, internationally, in addressing the humanitarian concerns posed by certain types of cluster munitions.</p>
	<p pid="a.715W.2/2">Since this date the UK has been actively engaged with the convention on conventional weapons (CCW) and in February 2007 decided also to join the 'Oslo' process to drive this issue forward and secure the best possible humanitarian effect.</p>
	<p pid="a.715W.2/3">In March 2007 the UK took the initiative and withdrew from service two types of cluster munition believed to inflict 'unacceptable harm'&mdash;the first country to do so after the Oslo conference.</p>
	<p pid="a.715W.2/4">Consistently HMG's position on this issue has been made clear and was conveyed in the Prime Minister's speech in the mansion House in November 2007 and his statement during the 'Oslo' process conference in Dublin on <phrase class="date" code="2008-05-28">28 May 2008</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.715W.2/5">As one of 46 nations to support the 'Oslo' process from the outset, HMG is delighted with the outcome of the Dublin Conference. A joint FCO, MOD and DfID team has worked very hard to secure a strong convention that addressed the key humanitarian concerns.</p>
	<p pid="a.715W.2/6">In advance of the convention entering into force the UK has once again led by example by ceasing use of cluster munitions with immediate effect and starting the programme to have them removed from service.</p>
	<p pid="a.715W.2/7">While this has resulted in some additional capability risk, this has been assessed as manageable and acceptable against the benefit in delivering both a strong humanitarian effect and legitimacy within the convention.</p>

HMS Westminster's capabilities include fresh water production (up to 50 metric tonnes per day), two sea boats for the transport of personnel and equipment, communications liabilities and a Merlin helicopter which could be used for reconnaissance or to transport personnel and equipment.

	<p pid="a.736W.0/1">The administration of Jobcentre Plus is a matter for the chief executive of Jobcentre Plus, Lesley Strathie. I have asked her to provide the hon. Member with the information requested.</p>
	<p pid="a.736W.0/2" class="italic"> Letter from Mel Groves, dated <phrase class="date" code="2008-06-16">16 June 2008</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="a.736W.0/3" class="indent">The Secretary of State has asked me to reply to your questions asking if he will review arrangements for travel expenses for clients where no local Jobcentre Plus office exists; and if he will make a statement; and if he will make it his policy to (a) permit telephone or postal signing on and (b) provide assistance towards travel expenses to allow claimants to sign on in person where local Jobcentre Plus offices have closed and claimants do not live near another office. This is something that falls within the responsibilities delegated to Ms Strathie as Chief Executive of Jobcentre Plus. I am replying in her absence as Acting Chief Executive.</p>
	<p pid="a.736W.0/4" class="indent">There are circumstances in which it is unreasonable to expect people to attend the Jobcentre and where reimbursement of travel expenses is appropriate.</p>
	<p pid="a.736W.0/5" class="indent">Where it is unreasonable to expect someone to attend their nearest Jobcentre Plus office, we have long-standing arrangements that allow people to maintain their claim by post. These arrangements apply:</p>
	<p pid="a.736W.0/6" class="indent">if the customer lives more than one hour (door to door) by public transport from the nearest office;</p>
	<p pid="a.736W.0/7" class="indent">if attendance means being away from home in excess of four hours;</p>
	<p pid="a.736W.0/8" class="indent">if the customer has a mental or physical disability that restricts mobility; and</p>
	<p pid="a.736W.0/9" class="indent">in other exceptional circumstances for example, the customer would have to use a form of transport they would not ordinarily be expected to use on a regular basis, i.e. an inter-city train, ferry or plane.</p>
	<p pid="a.736W.0/10" class="indent">Personal Adviser interviews for customers claiming Jobseekers Allowance are nearly always timed to coincide with regular jobsearch review appointments, so additional costs are not incurred for attending. We do pay travel expenses if a personal adviser appointment is:</p>
	<p pid="a.736W.0/11" class="indent">in an office other than their normal office of attendance and they incur additional expenses for attending; or</p>
	<p pid="a.736W.0/12" class="indent">in their normal office of attendance, but not on their normal day of attendance.</p>
	<p pid="a.736W.0/13" class="indent">For customers claiming benefits other than Jobseekers Allowance, travel expenses are reimbursed for pre-arranged interviews, medical services examinations, work-focused interviews, new deal interviews and other work-related events.</p>
	<p pid="a.736W.0/14" class="indent">These arrangements ensure people are only required to attend the Jobcentre where it is reasonable to expect them to do so and travel costs are reimbursed in appropriate circumstances. I therefore have no plans to review these existing arrangements.</p>

	<p pid="a.737W.8/5" class="indent">In April-June 2007, an estimated 542,000 parents in employment with at least one child under 16 had an agreed 'term-time' working arrangement. This figure accounts for 7 per cent. of parents in employment with children under 16. Estimates are taken from the Labour Force Survey (LFS) household datasets. They are weighted to the population estimates published by ONS in February and March 2003. They do not incorporate the more recent population estimates used in the monthly Labour Market Statistics First Release.</p>
	<p pid="a.737W.8/6" class="indent">In calculating the percentage, people who did not answer the LFS question about flexible working arrangements have been excluded.</p>

The level of state pensions in each country reflects differences in factors, such as Government policy choices and the cost of living, making cross-country comparisons difficult. However, Eurostat data indicates that taking into account all sources of income, UK pensioners have the fifth highest median net income in the EU.</p>

	<p pid="a.742W.6/1">Average weekly payments of the state pension were estimated at approximately &pound;97 in 2007-08; this amount is comprised of both the basic state pension and additional state pension.

In view of these factors, and to strike an appropriate balance, the NHS has, since <phrase class="date" code="2002-04-01">1 April 2002</phrase>, normally met the cost of clinical staff on air ambulances. However, the exact make up of such funded clinical staff will be a matter for the NHS and the air ambulance charities to agree locally.</p>

	<p pid="a.764W.0/1">As outlined in the 1986 guidance, &quot;The Management of Private Practice in NHS Hospitals in England and Wales&quot;, the precise definition of an &quot;episode of care&quot; in this context is a judgment that must be made locally by clinicians and the local national health service, not by the Government, and so there is no reason to specify different types of episode of care. Clinicians may judge that treatments that run concurrently should be regarded as separate episodes.</p>
	<p pid="a.764W.0/2">With reference to paragraph 23, there are no restrictions on when a private inpatient may choose to become an NHS patient. However, the guidance says that private patients who change their status should have their clinical priority for treatment assessed, and should not gain any advantage over other NHS patients. This was reiterated in the 2004 guidance &quot;A Code of Conduct for Private Practice&mdash;Recommended Standards of Practice for NHS Consultants&quot;, which said that:</p>
	<p pid="a.764W.0/3" class="indent">&quot;a patient cannot be both a private and a NHS patient for the treatment of one condition during a single visit to a NHS organisation&quot;; and</p>
	<p pid="a.764W.0/4" class="indent">&quot;should a patient be admitted to an NHS hospital as a private inpatient, but subsequently decide to change to NHS status before having received treatment, there should be an assessment to determine the patient's priority for NHS care&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.764W.0/5">Copies of both documents are available in the Library.</p>
	<p pid="a.764W.0/6">Information on the number or lengths of these episodes of care is not collected centrally.</p>

	<p pid="a.765W.8/1">The Department produced the sustainable development: environmental strategy for the NHS in 2005 which advocates that national health service bodies produce locally based strategies and plans of action for a number of environmental aspects, including waste. The Department did not set targets specific for recycling but: rather adopted a more holistic waste management regime based on the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affair's (DEFRA's) 'Waste not want not report' and the waste strategy recommendations. This aims to prevent waste occurring in the first instance, then advocating a waste hierarchy approach with reduction, reuse and recycling being then addressed.</p>
	<p pid="a.765W.8/2">The Department does not retain records of those trusts that have produced recycling strategies. In recognising the importance of recycling as part of the waste hierarchy, the Department collects information about waste produced and recycling undertaken by the NHS in England. The NHS reported that on average it recycled 14 per cent. of its waste in 2006-07.</p>
	<p pid="a.765W.8/3">Health technical memorandum HTM 07-01 'Environment and Sustainability: Safe Management of healthcare waste' was published in 2006 and provides a framework for best practice waste management to help healthcare organisations and other producers to meet legislative requirements. The Department has made plans to review HTM 07-01 during 2008 and is consulting with key stakeholders in DEFRA and the Department for Transport, as well as the regulators, as part of this process.</p>

	<p pid="a.767W.3/1">The Government are investing an additional &pound;250 million to provide patients with better access to primary care services. This new investment will deliver new general practitioner (GP) led health centres in each primary care trust (PCT) area and over one hundred new GP practices targeted at under-served area. The funding for GP led health centres has been included in PCT revenue allocations, &pound;45 million in 2008-09, 120 million in 2009-10 and &pound;120 million in 2010-11. PCT allocations are deliberately not broken down into individual funding streams as it is for PCTs to decide how best to deliver these new services in view of their local circumstances.</p>

	<p pid="a.767W.6/1">There is no standard definition of a polyclinic, which is why most of the debate about them is ill informed and inaccurate. &quot;Polyclinic&quot; is usually a term used to describe a range of possible health service models characterised by the co-location and integration of different services, including those traditionally provided in a hospital setting.</p>
	<p pid="a.767W.6/2">London Strategic Health Authority has defined &quot;polyclinic&quot; service models that bring together a range of primary care services, specialist services, urgent care services and social care into either single centres or federated networks of care. However, this model is not being replicated across the country. Local commissioners will determine the scope and scale of these services in collaboration with their clinicians and patients to reflect local needs and circumstances.</p>

	<p pid="a.774W.2/1">The Government aim to raise education professionals' awareness of female genital mutilation (FGM), particularly if they work within communities where this practice may once have been adopted. Education professionals may refer to the investigating agencies in the same way they would for any type of abuse. The Professional Standards for Teachers require that anyone who is teaching, or training to teach, must be aware of current legal requirements, national policies and guidance on the safeguarding and promotion of the well-being of children; also that they know how to identify and support children and young people whose progress, development or well-being is affected by changes or difficulties in their personal circumstances, and when to refer them to colleagues for specialist support.</p>
	<p pid="a.774W.2/2">Local authorities may exercise their powers under section 47 of the Children Act 1989 if they believe that a child has suffered, or is likely to suffer, FGM.</p>
	<p pid="a.774W.2/3">&quot;Working Together to Safeguard Children&quot; (April 2006), the main inter-agency guide to safeguarding and promoting the welfare of children, contains information about FGM. This guidance explains what is meant by FGM, makes clear that it is a criminal offence, and describes the signs that may indicate that a child is being prepared for FGM.</p>
	<p pid="a.774W.2/4">&quot;Safeguarding Children and Safer Recruitment in Education&quot; came into force in January 2007 and is aimed specifically at the education sector. It also contains guidance about FGM and signposts further sources of information available on the Department's Teachernet website.</p>

It is for schools to determine if and how they teach children about the principles and practice of first aid, and my Department has provided guidance to schools on this. We welcome cooperation between schools and partners such as local ambulance services, but do not prescribe with whom schools should work to deliver education on specific issues; that is for schools to decide for themselves.</p>

	<p pid="a.780W.5/1">All children are different and each child's development pathway and rate of progress is individual to them. This principle is fundamental to the design of the Early Years Foundation Stage (EYFS), where we make it explicit that all early years settings should deliver personalised learning, development and care. We believe that every child deserves the best possible start in life, and that to deliver that we need to continue to work with teachers and practitioners in the early years to ensure that children have the best possible experience.</p>
	<p pid="a.780W.5/2">To ensure that we narrow the achievement gap that currently exists between children from different backgrounds, we are investing in targeted programmes to support professionals in the early years and help them raise quality for children, supported by the framework of the Early Years Foundation Stage (EYFS). These programmes will focus on children's early language development and social development. In summer 2007 we allocated over &pound;127 million for quality improvement to raise the number of staff in the private, voluntary and independent sectors who are qualified at level 3 as well as higher level qualifications, and to help them continue to develop their skills and knowledge in meeting the needs of young children.</p>

Up until <phrase class="date" code="2008-04-01">1 April 2008</phrase>, Connexions funding for Leeds was allocated to the Connexions West Yorkshire Partnership, which covered Leeds, Bradford, Calderdale, Kirklees and Wakefield LEAs. From <phrase class="date" code="2008-04-01">1 April 2008</phrase>, Connexions funding is being allocated directly to each local authority. The following table shows the amount of central Government funding allocated to the Connexions Service and the Careers Service in Leeds and West Yorkshire since 2001. Information on the amount spent on careers guidance is not collected centrally. However, an independent study undertaken in 2006 concluded that, on average, around 42 per cent. of a Connexions Partnership's expenditure was on information, advice and guidance. The remainder was for targeted support for young people to address specific needs.</p>

	<p pid="a.787W.3/1">For young people aged under 18 there are three disposals available that provide direct alternatives to custody. These are the referral order which is the main disposal for young defendants pleading guilty and convicted for the first time, the Intensive Supervision and Surveillance Programme which caters for serious and persistent young offenders and intensive fostering, both of which can be attached to community orders. Intensive fostering is being piloted by the Youth Justice Board in three areas and provides a highly intensive programme for serious and persistent young offenders whose home environment is contributing to their offending behaviour.</p>
	<p pid="a.787W.3/2">The Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008 introduces a new generic community sentence for young people, the Youth Rehabilitation Order (YRO). The YRO is designed to increase the options available to deal with young offenders in the community with effective and tailored interventions. Under the new order, intensive supervision and surveillance and intensive fostering are set out as specific alternatives to custody.</p>
