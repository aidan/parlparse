	<p pid="b.724W.2/1">We have carefully considered the issues that have been raised by and on behalf of a number of early retirees, including whether to change the legislation which sets a cap on the compensation payable. We have taken particular account of the need for PPF compensation to balance fairness to scheme members, and remain affordable for pension schemes paying the PPF levy. We have concluded that changing the PPF compensation rules would advantage one group of scheme members compared to other groups, and could increase the cost of the PPF. We do not, therefore, propose to change PPF legislation at this time.</p>
	<p pid="b.724W.2/2">If a pension scheme enters the PPF, early retirees who took early retirement before April 2005 will be eligible for a 90 per cent. level of compensation, which is capped, as will the majority of people below their scheme's normal pension age.</p>

I regret that it is not possible to estimate when the CPS will be in a position to make a final charging decision, although they are fully aware of the necessity to resolve the matter as quickly as possible.</p>

	<p pid="b.734W.3/1">Comprehensive statistics on woodland prices are not available. Unlike agricultural land price statistics, the value of woodland incorporates the changing value of the timber growing stock, as well as the underlying land value and specific factors that attract buyers. Since 1993 the Forestry Commission's annual reports and accounts have shown a total value for the Public Forest Estate, which has been independently valued every five years since then. This is best indication we have of the changing cost of woodland over time. The open market values and the area of forest are shown in the following table.</p>

	<p pid="b.738W.5/3">Whether any other sort of compensation is payable in the circumstances described will depend on the facts of the individual case, on which independent legal advice should be sought.</p>
	<p pid="b.738W.5/4">An instance when compensation was paid by the French authorities was in 1996 following the French lorry drivers' dispute which lasted 12 days. Compensation was paid to some UK hauliers in respect of damage to vehicles or loads and for loss of earnings.</p>

	<p pid="b.742W.13/1">The official assessment of progress towards the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) is conducted by the UN at regional level and shows that for sub-Saharan Africa as a whole, progress towards each of the MDGs is slightly or seriously off track.</p>
	<p pid="b.742W.13/2">Based on international MDG data, DFID assesses progress towards the international goals on a country-by-country basis. This year's analysis suggests that many African countries will achieve some of the MDGs by 2015, or will have made substantial progress towards the goal, even though if current trends prevail, none is likely to achieve all MDGs by 2015.</p>
	<p pid="b.742W.13/3">For example, in Uganda, the education MDG ison track, with primary enrolment (MDG2) having increased from 62 per cent. to 86 per cent. in the decade to 2002. In Rwanda, the proportion of women in Parliamentary seats (MDGS) increased from one in six in 1990 to almost 1 in 2 in 2005. And although the child mortality remains high in that country, it is estimated to have reduced from 200 deaths per thousand children aged under five in the 1990s to about 150 per thousand in 2005.</p>
	<p pid="b.742W.13/4">It is important to note that while the Millennium Declaration was signed by member states and while countries have undertaken to monitor the MDG indicators, interpretation at country level may vary. Indeed, some MDGs targets are not applicable to all countries (e.g. some countries have no forest), while others may be too ambitious (e.g. a large number of countries in Latin America and the Caribbean have already achieved the goal of reducing extreme poverty by half with respect to 1990). On the contrary, some may not be ambitious enough. Countries make their own assessment of progress in national MDG reports, following their own customisation of the MDG framework. In total, about 40 countries in Africa have produced national MDG reports, which can be found at <a href="http://www.undp.org/mdg/tracking_countryreports2.shtml">http://www.undp.org/mdg/tracking_countryreports2.shtml</a>.</p>

	<p pid="b.743W.2/1">The UK Government's July 2006 White Paper puts governance at the centre of development and commits us to adopt a new quality of governance assessment to monitor standards of governance, and to intensify our efforts to help improve governance and combat corruption.</p>
	<p pid="b.743W.2/2">The quality of governance clearly matters for development. One study found that the efficiency of governance (among other issues) was associated with better rates of investment and growth and corruption with worse rates. The World Development Report of 1997 highlighted the importance of property rights, judicial reliability and control of corruption for investment and growth. Econometric studies have shown that the benefits of public health spending on child and infant mortality rates are greater in countries with better governance and that as countries improve governance, public spending on primary education becomes more effective in increasing primary attainment. Researchers have estimated that a country which improves its governance from a relatively low level to an average level could almost triple the per capita income of its population in the long term and similarly reduce infant mortality and illiteracy.</p>
	<p pid="b.743W.2/3">Aid funded projects are less likely to succeed where there is corruption and poor governance. A 1997 analysis of the impact of governance on the performance of a large number World Bank projects found that rates of return were higher in nations with greater civil liberties. Work at the World Bank Institute has highlighted a relationship between country corruption ratings and World Bank project success&mdash;especially for infrastructure projects.</p>
	<p pid="b.743W.2/4">These general observations and findings have a particular significance for Africa, the continent with the lowest overall standards of governance, as illustrated by the World Bank Institute's worldwide governance indicators for the period 1996 to 2005.</p>
	<p pid="b.743W.2/5">DFID's allocation of bilateral aid among low-income countries takes into account the likely effectiveness of aid in reducing poverty in each country. This is assessed by reference to the World Bank's Country Policy and Institutional Assessment index, which includes governance indicators. Other factors are also taken into account, including relative need.</p>
	<p pid="b.743W.2/6">Focusing exclusively on countries with better governance and less corruption could be a way of reducing the risks of aid being wasted or misused, but would not produce the best overall impact. Since the mid-1990s, greater donor emphasis on rewarding countries with relatively effective governments and stable macro-economic policies has led to some neglect of fragile states, which have poor governance. Many of the poorest people live in these states and meeting the Millennium Development Goals will require progress there. Therefore, despite the risks and the challenges, DFID is committed to working not only in countries which are performing well, but also in fragile states and to finding ways of working more effectively in these states.</p>

	<p pid="b.745W.8/1">Once direct conflict has ended, cluster munitions, if they have been used in large numbers, are likely to affect humanitarian relief and reconstruction efforts. Certain types of cluster munitions have unacceptably high failure rates, which vary in relation to the prevailing conditions in which they are used. If they are used in large numbers, unexploded bomblets can be left scattered densely and indiscriminately over a wide area. When these are set off, the explosion can kill anyone within 50m. They represent a threat to aid workers, peace-keepers, medical services, internally displaced persons and anyone else entering an area immediately after the cessation of hostilities. The design of cluster munitions means that often children are attracted to them. The threat to returning civilians is exacerbated when cluster munitions are used over soft terrain such as recently ploughed farmland. Unexploded bomblets can lie buried just beneath the surface making it dangerous for farmers to cultivate their land.</p>
	<p pid="b.745W.8/2">Casualty figures are hard to verify but reports indicate that unexploded cluster munitions killed thousands of civilians in Laos, Cambodia and Vietnam. The UN reports around 1 million unexploded cluster bomblets in Southern Lebanon. So far,23 civilian deaths and 145 injuries have resulted from unexploded ordnance, mainly cluster munitions. It will take an estimated 12-15 months to clear this area of unexploded ordnance.</p>
	<p pid="b.745W.8/3">Under the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons (CCW) unexploded cluster munitions are classified as Explosive Remnants of War (ERW). The UK played an active role in the adoption of CCW Protocol V on ERW, which will provide increased protection for civilians from the post-conflict effects of ERW, including cluster munitions. We are taking steps to ratify Protocol V as soon as possible. UK military doctrine, operations and our use of cluster munitions are already in accordance with Protocol V.</p>

	<p pid="b.747W.2/1">The very high levels of debt owed by some of the poorest countries has raised widespread concern. It has prevented countries from investing in basic services and building the infrastructure neededto reach the millennium development goals. It has constrained economic growth, and undermines the compact between a government and its people, with large shares of the government's resources being needed to service its debt. Tackling this problem has been a top priority for the Government.</p>
	<p pid="b.747W.2/2">The right conditionality is essential to ensure thatwe can have confidence that debt relief will benefit poor people. In my view, the approach taken underthe Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative is appropriate. It specifies that there should be a track record on macroeconomic management and an established commitment to reduce poverty. Macroeconomic management is important for ensuring that government resources are used effectively, and provides the basis for sustainable economic growth.</p>
	<p pid="b.747W.2/3">The commitment to poverty reduction has been specified in terms of a government developing and implementing a national poverty reduction strategy, and through the implementation of a number of agreed actions. These actions include measures to improve public financial management, and they may include actions on education, health, or economic growth. In my view, the choice of conditions has not always been wholly appropriate. In some cases, the number of conditions has been too high, making it hard for countries to complete the process. In others, there were conditions for which there was too little government ownership and commitment. The UK has argued for the World Bank and the IMF to take a flexible approach in assessing whether countries should qualify for the irrevocable debt relief that is granted at the end of the process, and several countries have already benefited from this.</p>
	<p pid="b.747W.2/4">Given the demands of the HIPC Initiative, the Government took the view that no additional conditionally should be attached to the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative. We were successful in achieving this.</p>
	<p pid="b.747W.2/5">Both the HIPC Initiative and MDRI provide irrevocable debt cancellation. This is important to ensure that debt burden is removed and so that governments have a predictable stream of resources that they can invest. Of course, there are no guarantees that countries will remain committed to reducing poverty, but a balance needs to be struck between having confidence that debt cancellation will benefit the poor and not setting the standards unreasonably high. Debt relief remains a small proportion of overall aid provided by donors, and donors can change the form of other aid if there are setbacks, for example withdrawing budget support and providing other assistance.</p>
	<p pid="b.747W.2/6">At HIPC Decision Point, countries receive flow relief on their debt payments. This can be removed where there is evidence that a country is not committed to poverty reduction. A track record is therefore built up before qualifying for irrevocable debt relief at Completion Point.</p>
	<p pid="b.747W.2/7">Recent reports from the World Bank and IMFhave shown that countries that have qualified for debt relief have increased their spending on poverty from US$ 6 billion in 2000 to nearly US$ 15 billion in 2005. This is projected to increase further following the implementation of Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative in 2006, which is freeing up an additional US$ 38 billion. I have seen for myself the impact of some of this relief, such as schools in Ghana. Zambia is using savings (US$ 2.8 million) in 2006 to increase spending on agricultural projects on smallholder irrigation and livestock disease control, as well as eliminate user fees for healthcare in rural areas.</p>
	<p pid="b.747W.2/8">Analysis also shows that the performance of HIPCs has improved, as measured by the World Bank's Country Policy and Institutional Assessment. This looks at 16 different aspects of policy, within the categories of economic management, structural and social/poverty policies, and public sector management. And economic growth rates in sub-Saharan Africa are increasing. This cannot be attributed only to the HIPC process; however the top performers in 2005 amongst non-oil producing countries are HIPCs that have already benefited from debt relief.</p>

	<p pid="b.749W.5/1">DFID has not undertaken a specific assessment of the effectiveness of the Equator Principles in the developing world.</p>
	<p pid="b.749W.5/2">However, during 2004-05 the Department was actively engaged in influencing the formulation ofthe International Finance Corporation's (IFC) new sustainability policy, environmental and social performance standards and guidance notes. These policies and standards serve as the key reference for the Equator Principles. DFID ensured that representatives of the Equator Banks (the banks who had signed up to the Equator Principles) were involved in the public consultations that DFID carried out during this process.</p>
	<p pid="b.749W.5/3">A set of revised Equator Principles were publishedin June 2006. These broaden the application of the Equator Principles and help to strengthen the environmental and social standards they require. The revised Principles include a new commitment to reporting, thus addressing&mdash;to a certain extent&mdash;an earlier criticism that it was difficult to evaluate their effectiveness.</p>

	<p pid="b.752W.0/1">The UK and US agreed at UN General Assembly High Level Meeting on AIDS in June 2006 that comprehensive HIV prevention is essential, including expanded access to male and female condoms. For the past 10 years DFID has been the fourth largest condom provider, providing over a billion condoms since 2001. USAID was the largest individual donor for contraceptives and condoms in 2004, contributing 35 per cent. of total donor support. But in Africa there are still only enough condoms to provide eight for each man each year. The UK will continue to play its part, and work closely with the US to ensure an appropriate and effective response to AIDS, including on the provision of condoms.</p>

	<p pid="b.752W.3/1">The Government of India's National AIDS Programme (NACP) began in 1992, and the second phase of the programme (NACP 2) will run until March 2007. Key achievements under NACP2 include the establishment of 1,033 focused prevention interventions among vulnerable groups, 875 voluntary counselling and testing centres and 679 sexually transmitted disease clinics at the district level.</p>
	<p pid="b.752W.3/2">Currently, only half of the populations at greatest risk of infection (sex workers, men having sex with men and injecting drugs users) are currently covered by prevention interventions. Anti-Retroviral Therapy (ART) was introduced by the programme in 2004 but the roll out has been slow and serious issues of access, adherence, and capacity remain. By May 2006, only 32,000 people were covered by the free treatment programme.</p>
	<p pid="b.752W.3/3">Yet, there is emerging evidence that the strategy of concentrating on focused interventions among those at highest risk is having an impact in states in the south.A recent analysis of HIV data from 216 antenatal clinics and 132 sexually transmitted infection clinics for 2000-04 suggest that HIV prevalence among women aged 15-24 years in southern states declined from1.7 per cent. in 2000 to 1.1 per cent. in 2004. HIV infection levels also fell among men aged 20-29 years who attended sexually transmitted infection clinics in the south.</p>
	<p pid="b.752W.3/4">In Thailand, Government policy is to provide Anti-Retroviral Therapy (ART) to all those in need as part of the national Health Insurance scheme. This has contributed to Thailand's successful high treatment coverage rates. There has been concern that Thailand has failed to maintain initial HIV prevention successes. There are now worrying increases in infection prevalence rates in young people, married women and men who have sex with men. The Government recently announced that they would increase investment in this area with the aim of reducing new infections by 50 per cent. by 2010, but has not yet presented plans for this. Continued high levels of stigma and discrimination remain a major barrier to an effective response.</p>

	<p pid="b.753W.6/1">The province of Aceh in Indonesia was struck by an earthquake followed by tsunami that devastated an 800km coastal strip in December 2004. The tsunami killed around 170,000 people and displaced approximately 500,000 from their homes.</p>
	<p pid="b.753W.6/2">In the immediate aftermath of the tsunami DFID committed &pound;55 million to emergency relief projects in Aceh, and the neighbouring island of Nias which was also severely affected.

The evaluation of all relief projects is set out in the document &quot;Report on DFID's response to the Indian Ocean Disaster&quot;, copies of which have been placed in the Libraries of the House and can also be found on the DFID website.</p>
	<p pid="b.753W.6/3">In addition, DFID has allocated &pound;59 million to longer term reconstruction and recovery in Aceh and Nias. These funds are being channelled mainly through the following programmes:</p>
	<p pid="b.753W.6/4" class="indent">Over &pound;38 million committed to the Multi-Donor Fund for Aceh and Nias (MDF). The MDF pools the resources of 15 donors in support of the Government of Indonesia's own plans and priorities for reconstruction. It has become a proven and effective partner in the recovery process. The MDF currently supports 16 projects which provide needed assistance to four under-funded sectors: the recovery of communities; infrastructure and transport; capacity building and governance; and sustainable management of the environment.</p>

The focus is now on building sustainable livelihoods. The programme has enabled over 50,000 beneficiaries to re-engage in income generation and many of these are now self-sufficient.</p>
	<p pid="b.753W.6/6" class="indent">&pound;6 million to the World Bank's Support for Poor and Disadvantaged Areas (SPADA) programme, to provide support to strengthen governance, promote growth and improve service delivery in Aceh and Nias. This programme is just getting under way.</p>
	<p pid="b.753W.6/7" class="indent">&pound;3 million through the Decentralisation Support Facility (DSF) managed by the World Bank, to support Government and implementing partners' ability to assist tsunami-affected communities to rebuild their lives.</p>
	<p pid="b.753W.6/8" class="indent">DFID also provided over &pound;1 million to a number of smaller initiatives which aim to improve transparency in the way reconstruction funds are managed, build the capacity (particularly relating to procurement) of local governments and other agencies involved in the reconstruction effort, and activities to help consolidate peace in Aceh.</p>
	<p pid="b.753W.6/9">Both the MDF and ERTR programmes have been reviewed positively in recent independent reviews as well as by DFID's own monitoring activities. Progress has been made, but there is still a long way to go. For example, the Government of Indonesia's Rehabilitation and Reconstruction Agency for Aceh and Nias (BRR) (<a href="http://www.e-aceh-nias.org">http://www.e-aceh-nias.org</a>) estimates that 120,000 units of new housing are required, and, as of April 2006, 41,734 had been built.</p>

	<p pid="b.755W.2/1">DFID has been on the ground delivering programmes in Basra Province since theend of the conflict in 2003. We have already spent&pound;118 million on economic development and reconstruction projects in southern Iraq. Achievements to date include:</p>
	<p pid="b.755W.2/2" class="indent">Immediate infrastructure repairs to increase water supplyby up to 30 per cent. and improve the electricity supply to1.5 million residents in Basra.</p>
	<p pid="b.755W.2/3" class="indent">Repairs to local power stations which so far have added or secured 350 megawatts, equivalent to 24 hours electricity supply for 700,000 people.</p>

	<p pid="b.755W.2/6" class="indent">Created more than 400,000 days of work through our construction projects.</p>
	<p pid="b.755W.2/7">In addition, we have also helped the Provincial Councils to produce development plans, designed to helping the Iraqis to prioritise activity, unlock the substantial Iraqi funds available (around US$300 million in 2007) for reconstruction projects in the south and get the resources flowing to the provinces. This is a long term challenge, but progress is being made. The Basra Council is already putting this strategy into action by implementing over 220 projects to repair water and sewage infrastructure, and improve roads and electricity supplies. Together with other donors, such as the Australians, Japanese, United Nations (UN) and the World Bank, we need to continue to support the Government of Iraq, at both national and provincial levels, to turn Iraqi resources into viable projects so that local people can see real progress.</p>

	<p pid="b.757W.2/1">Latin America is facing the twin challenges of rapid globalisation and entrenched inequality. Poor people in the poorer and middle income countries are not always benefiting from globalisation. And the countries' needs are changing, as many can access other sources of finance for development, including private capital. The new President of the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB), Alberto Moreno, is leading efforts to transform the Bank so that it can better assist countries to meet these challenges and achieve the Millennium Development Goals.</p>
	<p pid="b.757W.2/2">One of the main changes underway is that new programmes are being designed to target the majority of the people of the region who are poor. One umbrella programme called &quot;Opportunities for the Majority&quot; represents a new way of assisting the people who lose out in the changes driven by the need to compete globally. The IDB's new initiative includes projects to help people secure and exercise their rights, for example helping poor people to establish their citizenship and get the documents they need to work in the formal economy. Other areas being looked at include housing, water and electricity for poor people. The objective is to support practical programmes which will make a difference to peoples' lives such as creating jobs and. opportunities for poor people to start their own businesses.</p>

	<p pid="b.758W.3/1">DFID promotes social inclusion in all its programmes in India.</p>
	<p pid="b.758W.3/2">DFID's programme in India operates in support of Government of India's efforts to combat caste and ethnic discrimination and social exclusion in all its forms, including by strengthening programme design and monitoring to ensure that the benefits of development reach Dalits, Adivasis and other minority populations.</p>
	<p pid="b.758W.3/3">For example, DFID is providing &pound;190 million tothe Indian Government's national programme for achieving universal primary education (Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan&mdash;SSA). A key objective of SSA, launched in 2004, was to narrow the gaps that exist between the enrolment of Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe and other children. The proportion of Scheduled Caste children in the school population has increasedfrom 30.4 million in 2003 to 39.3 million in 2006and Scheduled Tribe children have increased from16 million in 2003 to 20.5 million in 2006. This has been achieved through a range of strategies that have helped tackle discrimination at all levels.</p>
	<p pid="b.758W.3/4">DFID has also provided &pound;252 million in support of the Indian Government's National Programme to promote reproductive and child health (RCH2). The programme aims to reduce disparities in maternal and infant mortality between Dalit, Adivasi and other women and children. The programme will improve the data available to track progress and make informed decisions to achieve better health outcomes for Dalit and Adivasi women and children.</p>
	<p pid="b.758W.3/5">Although most DFID funds directly support the Government of India, DFID recognises that civil society is an important partner in achieving poverty reduction in India and holding Government to account. DFID regularly reviews the civil society programmes it supports to ensure that all programmes pay due attention to the need to tackle exclusion.</p>

	<p pid="b.759W.2/1">The UK Government are extremely concerned about the humanitarian situation in the occupied Palestinian territory. We are committed to helping the Palestinian people through the EU-led Temporary International Mechanism (TIM) and other projects. The causes of the deteriorating humanitarian situation include the conflict with Israel and amongst Palestinians; an economic downturn due to movement and access restrictions; and the Palestinian Authority's (PA) fiscal crisis, which has meant it has been unable to pay salaries.</p>
	<p pid="b.759W.2/2">The PA's fiscal crisis is mainly the result of the withholding of clearance revenues by Israel and lower tax revenues. The suspension of budgetary support by donors has played a less significant role. This is more than compensated for by an increase in aid through the TIM and other channels. European Union assistance has increased by 27 per cent. this year to &pound;439 million. Aid for Palestinian basic needs through the TIM will reach &pound;131.1 million this year in comparison with&pound;65 million through budgetary aid to the PA in 2005. Without the TIM and other aid, notably from Arab donors, the situation for Palestinians would be far worse than it is now.</p>

	<p pid="b.760W.3/1">The joint DFID and WorldBank-hosted conference on remittances held on13-<phrase class="date" code="">14 November</phrase> in London focused on the links between remittances and financial inclusion and followed up the outcomes of the first DFID-World Bank International Conference on Remittances in October 2003.</p>
	<p pid="b.760W.3/2">The conference brought together over 150 participants, including central bank governors, Government officials from developed and developing countries, academics, money transfer operators, commercial banks, credit card companies, diaspora, and representatives of the international donor community, NGOs and international organisations. Feedback from the conference participants was extremely positive. 90 per cent. of participants rated the conference either 'very good' or 'outstanding' in terms of its agenda, quality of presentations and selection of speakers.</p>
	<p pid="b.760W.3/3">The conference highlighted that remittances offer the potential for enhancing poverty reduction and growth, not least through bringing many millions of people into the formal financial sector. It was clear that:</p>
	<p pid="b.760W.3/4" class="indent">While the cost of sending remittances has been brought down, further reductions are needed,</p>
	<p pid="b.760W.3/5" class="indent">Access to remittances for poorer and more rural people is being extended, but further improvements are needed, and</p>
	<p pid="b.760W.3/6" class="indent">Those receiving remittances would benefit from better access to other financial services, such as savings accounts.</p>
	<p pid="b.760W.3/7">The General Principles for International Remittance Services were launched at this conference. These principles act as a guide for regulators, governments and remittance providers, and are designed to improve the market for remittance services in sending and receiving countries. They were formulated by an international taskforce led by the Bank for International Settlements and the World Bank, with DFID support. DFID will work with the World Bank and others to assist developing countries in implementing the general principles.</p>
	<p pid="b.760W.3/8">The conference highlighted the importance of harnessing technology and working with the private sector in order to improve the impact of remittances. DFID supports the expansion of mobile phone banking through a joint programme of work with the World Bank and the global system for mobile communication (GSM) association. This will include assessments of improvements that can be made to the regulatory framework for mobile banking in more than 10 countries. As regulatory issues can be a major constraint to the development of this technology, DFID has already worked together with regulators and mobile banking providers in Kenya and South Africa to identify and map out a positive and appropriate policy and legal framework for mobile banking.</p>
	<p pid="b.760W.3/9">DFID will continue to support the UK Remittances Task Force in helping speed up the private sector's response to the remittances and financial inclusion challenges that this conference emphasised. The UK Remittances Task Force is a positive example of the private sector setting goals for improving remittance services to developing countries that are driven by both commercial and development objectives.</p>
	<p pid="b.760W.3/10">The conference confirmed the need for controls to prevent money laundering via remittances, but in a way that also promotes financial inclusion. DFID is funding a project through the Financial Reform and Strengthening (FIRST) Initiative that will provide tools for developing country regulators to better achieve this balance.</p>

	<p pid="b.763W.3/1">DFID has been investing in social marketing and market development of insecticide-treated bednets since 1998. This was done first through the SMITN (Social Marketing of Insecticide Treated Nets) project, and later through the SMARTNET (Strategic Social Marketing for Expanding the Commercial Marketing of Insecticide Treated Nets in Tanzania) project, jointly funded with the Netherlands.</p>
	<p pid="b.763W.3/2">Recent significant falls in under-five and infant mortality in Tanzania are due in part to increased use of treated nets. Net sales per year are well over three million&mdash;far surpassing any similar programme in Africa&mdash;and the nets are available in all parts of the country. Recent data shows that almost 30 per cent. of under-fives now sleep under treated bednets&mdash;double the percentage in 2005.</p>
	<p pid="b.763W.3/3">DFID committed and spent &pound;3.9 million in the SMITN project, and committed a further &pound;10.3 million out of the total &pound;14.9 million commitment to the SMARTNET project. Of this, DFID has spent&pound;7.6 million to date.</p>

	<p pid="b.763W.6/1">Tetanus spores enter the body via deep wounds. In addition to wounds caused by accidents, mothers are susceptible to tetanus infection immediately following childbirth. Similarly, new born babies are at risk of tetanus infection where a non-sterile instrument is used to cut the umbilical cord (for example an un-trained traditional birth attendant using a piece of bamboo) and where traditional practices involve placing unclean 'dressings' over the exposed area (such as dried and powdered cow dung used to help dry the cord in parts of south Asia). Without urgent treatment tetanus is fatal, causing an estimated 200,000 newborn child deaths a year.</p>
	<p pid="b.763W.6/2">Tetanus is preventable through good hygiene and vaccination. DFID supports developing countries' efforts to strengthen the health services through which immunisation is provided, as well as to improve hygienic practices by skilled birth attendants. In 2005-06 DFID provided &pound;453.1 million as direct support to the health sector. DFID also provided&pound;12.5 million core support to the World Health Organisation (WHO) and &pound;19 million to the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) in 2005-06. Both WHO and UNICEF are key global actors in vaccine preventable diseases.</p>
	<p pid="b.763W.6/3">In addition, DFID supports the work of the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunisation (GAVI) to introduce new vaccines (such as Hepatitis B and Haemophilius influenza) into country immunisation schedules. In some cases these new vaccines are administered in combination with diphtheria, pertussis and tetanus (DPT). In these cases, GAVI also supports tetanus immunisation. In some of the world's poorest countries GAVI provides support to improve the health systems which deliver immunisation and this support has recently been linked to improvements in the rates of DPT immunisation coverage in these countries. DFID has contributed over &pound;43 million to GAVI since 2000.</p>
	<p pid="b.763W.6/4">The UK is also committed to developing innovative financing mechanisms such as the International Finance Facility for Immunisation (IFFm) which was launched in September 2005. So far this has raised US$ 1 billion which will be channelled through GAVI, allowing a major scaling-up of their immunisation work. The UK has committed a total of &pound;1.38 billion for IFFm over the next 20 years.</p>

When I met with President Museveni in November, I discussed with him Uganda's use of the Global Fund for AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria.</p>
	<p pid="b.764W.2/2">Uganda has successfully managed to reduce HIV prevalence from 18 per cent. in 1992 to 6.4 per cent. in 2005. It is a cause for concern, however, that prevalence is no longer falling and new HIV infections remain high.</p>
	<p pid="b.764W.2/3">DFID approved a major new HIV/AIDS programme for Uganda in June 2006 which will provide &pound;9 million over the next three years.

OCHA recently issued a Common Humanitarian Action Plan for the coming year in Zimbabwe. Despite good rains last year, Zimbabwe faces yet another year of crisis and food insecurity.

This support is all channelled through NGOs and UN agencies&mdash;none through the Government of Zimbabwe.

	<p pid="b.766W.3/1">The UK has regular discussions with the Afghan Independent Human Rights Commission and supports the efforts of the EU Special Representative on the implementation of human rights, including women's rights, in Afghanistan.</p>
	<p pid="b.766W.3/2">Afghan women, excluded by the Taliban, now play an active part in everyday life in Afghanistan. Their equality is enshrined in the Afghan Constitution, which also protects their right to participate in Afghan political life. 27 per cent. of seats in the Lower House of the Afghan Parliament are held by women. Women also enjoy equal access to the Afghan education system. 37 per cent. of students in Afghanistan are girls and a third of teachers are women. 19 per cent. of students enrolled in higher education are women. In addition, the Constitution requires the Government to uphold its obligations under international law. Rape and forced marriage are prohibited by Afghanistan's obligations under the Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the Convention on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women, both of which Afghanistan has ratified. That said, securing the full participation of Afghan women in all sectors of the economy and society will take time and we acknowledge that serious problems remain. We remain committed to working with the Afghan Government and their international partners to improve women's ability to exercise their rights.</p>
	<p pid="b.766W.3/3">Although the situation of women in Iran is in some respects better than in other countries in the region, we remain concerned about the discrimination faced by women in Iran. Domestic violence remains a serious problem, women's participation in the labour forceis low and women continue to face significant discrimination in the legal system. For example, the evidence of a woman is worth less than that of a man in court, and women do not enjoy equal rights in cases involving divorce, inheritance or the custody of children.</p>
	<p pid="b.766W.3/4">We raise women's rights and other human rights concerns regularly with the Iranian authorities, bilaterally and through the EU. We were pleased that all EU countries co-sponsored a draft resolution at this year's UN General Assembly, approved by Third Committee on <phrase class="date" code="">21 November</phrase>, which expressed serious concern at the continuing violence and discrimination against women and girls, and called upon the Iranian Government to</p>
	<p pid="b.766W.3/5" class="indent">&quot;eliminate, in law and in practice, all forms of discrimination and violence against women and girls&quot;.</p>

	<p pid="b.767W.2/1">The UK has regular discussions with the Afghan Independent Human Rights Commission (AIHRC) and supports the efforts of the EU Special Representative on the implementation of human rights, including women's rights, in Afghanistan. The Afghan Constitution requires the Afghan Government to uphold their obligations under international law. Afghanistan is a party to the Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the Convention on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW), which prohibit rape and forced marriage. Challenges remain but we are committed to assist the Afghan Government in the implementation of their international obligations.</p>
	<p pid="b.767W.2/2">The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO), through the Global Opportunities Fund (GOF), is sponsoring a number of projects specifically designed to empower women, by increasing their access to justice, improving their living standards, promoting their equal participation in governance, creating a professional network of women's rights organisations and promoting access to information through the radio. Through the GOF, the FCO supports the UK Bar Human Rights Committee project of human rights training for legal practitioners with a specific focus on women's rights (&pound;240,000 over three years). Other projects include Global Rights: Women's Rights Advocacy in Afghanistan, which will produce a report on violations of women's rights focusing on domestic violence, and a parallel report on CEDAW implementation (&pound;165,000); and Action Aid: Afghan Women Affecting Change, which aims to create a professional network of women's rights organisations (&pound;157,000).</p>

	<p pid="b.768W.3/1">It is vital that the Bangladesh general elections are free, fair, peaceful and accepted by the people of Bangladesh and by the international community. The legitimacy of the next Government is dependent on the conduct of these elections. Recent election evaluation missions by UN, EU and United States have consistently identified important points that need to be addressed to ensure elections reach the required standards.</p>
	<p pid="b.768W.3/2">We expect the Election Commission and all officials involved with the electoral process to operate with competence and independence. The Caretaker Government overseeing the elections have a responsibility to ensure that there is no political bias and should act in an inclusive, transparent and non-partisan way. They will be judged on their ability to do so and more generally to provide an appropriate environment for the elections. In this regard the recently announced measures to update the voter list are to be welcomed.

	<p pid="b.768W.6/1">The EU agreed a strategy against the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction in 2003, which is an important co-ordinating document. The EU action plan on biological and toxin weapons is complementary to that strategy and other EU work on the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention. Itsets out practical steps for EU member states in implementing their strategy. All EU partners, including the UK, have submitted confidence building measures mechanism returns in 2006, which enables the EU to have a firmer base for encouraging other States Parties to submit them. The EU have also agreed to submit lists of experts and laboratories to the UN Secretary-General which is in line with the UN General Assembly's encouragement to the UN Secretary-General to update the list, so as to permit timely and efficient investigation of alleged use of biological and chemical weapons.</p>

	<p pid="b.769W.2/1">We remain deeply concerned about the political situation in Burma. The people of Burma do not enjoy the most basic freedoms and there is little immediate prospect of positive change. No genuine progress towards democracy can be made while more than a thousand people are being held in prison, and many others are exiled, for their political beliefs or while the Burmese army continues its attacks on Burma's ethnic groups.</p>
	<p pid="b.769W.2/2">The democratic opposition cannot participate fully and freely in the National Convention process, which is wholly controlled by the Burmese regime. The length of this process alone, which has endured for 13 years, calls into question the regime's willingness to embark on a genuine path to democratisation and national reconciliation.</p>
	<p pid="b.769W.2/3">I have raised the political and human rights situation consistently with the Burmese regime and international partners.

I have also raised Burma with the Governments of China, India, Japan, Thailand and South Korea. I met Juan Mendes, the UN special adviser for the prevention of genocide, and have invited him to come to the House on <phrase class="date" code="">14 December</phrase> to discuss Burma.

The degree of political freedom and debate in the run- up to the election was unprecedented. We were disturbed that subsequent disputes over the election results led to civil unrest and violence, widespread arrests and allegations of human rights abuses. The main opposition leaders and some civil society representatives remain in detention facing serious charges including genocide and treason. Since the election there has been a closing down of political space for the opposition, the independent media and civil society.</p>

We continue to urge the Government to open up the political space and encourage open debate with all parts of society.</p>

However, polonium 210 is not subject to International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards and does not have to be reported to the agency, so even countries without a reactor could carry out experiments if they had a supply from a producing country.

	<p pid="b.780W.5/1">The north-eastern province of Vakaga in the Central African Republic has increasingly been used as both a conduit and base for Sudanese and Chadian rebel groups, over the last eight months. This has created further instability. Central African Republic rebel groups have become increasingly active within this region, capturing three towns within Vakaga during November, and in the north-west of the country. The Central African Republic's armed forces, assisted by forces from the French and FOMUC, the EU-funded African peace mission, have now stabilised the Vakaga region, although the situation remains tense.</p>
	<p pid="b.780W.5/2">We press the Government of Sudan regularly on the need for a viable ceasefire in Darfur, and to stop supporting Chadian rebel groups. We have pressed both the Chad and Sudan Governments to fulfil their obligations under the Tripoli agreement, and will continue to do so. Officials from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office met with the Chadian ambassador on <phrase class="date" code="">20 November</phrase> and raised our concerns over the security situation in both Chad and the Central African Republic, particularly in the border regions.</p>
	<p pid="b.780W.5/3">We also continue to raise our concerns over the situation in the Central African Republic through the EU and the UN.

	<p pid="b.783W.8/1">The latest Presidential elections in Tajikistan took place on <phrase class="date" code="2006-11-06">6 November 2006</phrase>. 170 international observers, from 32 countries, observed the voting and counting on behalf of the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe's (OSCE) Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR) and the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly.</p>
	<p pid="b.783W.8/2">We share the preliminary assessment of the ODIHR election observers. They concluded that democratic practices were not fully tested because of the absence of genuine competition, thus providing voters with only nominal choice. The ODIHR observers noted that significant improvements are required in both the legal framework and a number of technical aspects including a lack of transparency in the decision-making process of the highest level of election administration. On a more positive note, there was some recognition by ODIHR of the efficient administration of the election and some improvements in the candidates' right to media access, participation of parties in local, but not national, electoral commissions and an improved framework for observers.</p>
	<p pid="b.783W.8/3">On <phrase class="date" code="2006-11-14">14 November 2006</phrase> the Finnish Presidency issued a statement on behalf of the EU which also reflected these concerns but welcomed the peaceful atmosphere in which the elections took place.</p>
	<p pid="b.783W.8/4">We strongly encourage the Tajik authorities to take this opportunity to work with ODIHR and the OSCE Centre in Dushanbe to address the areas of concern. Along with our EU partners, we stand ready to support the authorities in adopting the necessary reforms.</p>

Specific meetings were held with Advantage West Midlands, East Midlands Development Agency and One North East. These meetings were to discuss how the then consumer goods team, within UKTI, could add value to the RDAs international agenda for consumer goods. The furniture industry was only one of the elements discussed. Officials from DTI also met Advantage West Midlands in 2004 to discuss the Birmingham furniture show and other issues.</p>

	<p pid="b.809W.0/1">The Health and Safety Commission and Executive are responsible for regulating the safety of the UK's nuclear power stations. These may only be built and operated following the granting of a Nuclear Site Licence by the Health and Safety Executive, to which it attaches standard conditions for the management of nuclear safety. The licensee is responsible for complying with these conditions and ensuring that risks to workers and the public from its operations are reduced so far as is reasonably practicable.</p>
	<p pid="b.809W.0/2">The licence conditions require the licensee to maintain safety significant plant in good condition and take appropriate action in response to any findings from maintenance or inspection of plant that indicate safe operation might be affected. This includes recording, investigating and reporting the findings. The more safety significant findings must be reported to the Health and Safety Executive's Nuclear Installations Inspectorate, which investigates them and carries out its own independent inspections and assessments of plant operation and condition. The Chief Inspector of Nuclear Installations periodically reports upon nuclear safety issues to the Health and Safety Commission and its Nuclear Safety Advisory Committee (NuSAC).</p>

	<p pid="b.809W.3/1">The 2002 Statutory Paternity Pay Regulatory Impact Assessment (RIA) estimated the annual amount of statutory paternity pay reclaimable from the Exchequer at around &pound;57 million. This assumed 70 per cent. of the total number eligible to receive statutory paid paternity leave would take it up.</p>
	<p pid="b.809W.3/2">The Maternity and Paternity Rights and Benefits Survey 2005 found around 80 per cent. of the 415,000 eligible fathers surveyed had used at least some of their statutory entitlement, suggesting a higher take-up rate than estimated in the RIA. Although the take-up has been higher than originally estimated, not all fathers take their full entitlement to two weeks paid paternity leave. Therefore we anticipate that the costs of statutory paternity pay are around the level presented in the RIA.</p>

However, the economics, in particular the amounts of energy required, to justify the investment in the High Voltage Direct Current link required needs more work. There would need to be a massive source of surplus electricity to make this worthwhile and considerable investment.</p>

	<p pid="b.813W.6/1">Digital switchover does not require disposal of any equipment, as an existing analogue television can normally be upgraded by adding a digital set-top box. However, as the Government's &quot;Regulatory and Environmental Impact Assessment on the timing of digital switchover&quot; (September 2005) acknowledges, there may be a temporary acceleration in the disposal of some secondary television sets that people choose not to adapt after switchover in each region. In light of this, the Department of Trade and Industry and the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs jointly commissioned the Market Transformation Programme to establish and quantify any changes in patterns of disposal of consumer equipment, including televisions, due to digital switchover. The results from this research should be available in early 2007.</p>

In the USA, resources will be better focused on the US states which offer real export or inward investment opportunities for the UK. Although there have been reductions in some parts of the US network, we are strengthening UKTI's teams in California and Florida, to reflect their importance for British business.</p>

For example we are using light fittings that are 30-60 per cent. more efficient than the current fittings.

	<p pid="b.819W.5/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="b.819W.5/2">The Government have analysed the performances of over 630 televisions sold in 2004, 2005 and 2006 and has concluded that the difference in energy consumption between analogue and integrated digital televisions is negligible.</p>
	<p pid="b.819W.5/3">The annual energy consumption of a television varies significantly with screen size and television type, and defining what constitutes a 'typical' television is difficult. However, for a 32 in widescreen cathode-ray television, the estimates are that the annual consumption will be 292 kWh, and 310 kWh for a liquid crystal display (LCD) screen of the same size. A 42 in (a typical size for this technology) plasma TV will consume 746 kWh per year.</p>
	<p pid="b.819W.5/4">The total energy consumption of all UK televisions has risen in recent years. However this is not a result of the development of integrated digital tuners but a function of increased TV ownership, the trend towards larger screen sizes, and the migration away from cathode ray tube (CRT) televisions to other technologies.</p>
	<p pid="b.819W.5/5">In many cases the use of an integrated digital tuner will negate the need to purchase a separate set-top digital TV adapter at digital switchover. The average consumption of a typical terrestrial set-top adapter is 60 kWh per year. Public communications about digital television switchover reinforce this point by advising consumers to purchase digital, rather than analogue, if they are upgrading a television.</p>
	<p pid="b.819W.5/6">We do not currently have sufficient information to provide a comparison between the performance of analogue and digital (DAB) radios. However, we have identified that many portable DAB radios are supplied with external power supply units which are less efficient&mdash;and therefore consume more energy&mdash;than those sold with comparable analogue products. We will work with retailers and manufacturers to seek to address this issue. As these are relatively new products, there are likely to be efficiency gains as the products mature.</p>

	<p pid="b.831W.6/1">The National DNA Database records the names of those who have been arrested and had a DNA sample taken, and the force that arrested them, but not whether they are UK citizens.</p>
	<p pid="b.831W.6/2">The mechanism for handling requests from overseas police authorities for information from the NDNAD is that those requests are sent to the UK National Central Bureau for Interpol (UK NCB), based at the Serious Organised Crime Agency, which considers whether the request is in the interest of prevention and detection of crime, national security or the data subject (i.e. the individual who is the subject of the exchange request). It also carries out a risk assessment, taking into account the justification and the proportionality of disclosure of the information in line with human rights legislation. If UK NCB clears the request, a one-off search of the DNA Database is made and information fed back to UK NCB.</p>
	<p pid="b.831W.6/3">Before 2004, no central records were kept on requests from overseas authorities for data from the NDNAD as these were very rare. Between August 2004 and May 2006,121 profiles from the NDNAD were provided to UK NCB to supplement fingerprint information (i.e. fingerprints had been supplied to an overseas authority in relation to an individual residing in their country following which that authority made a further request for the individual's DNA profile).</p>
	<p pid="b.831W.6/4">Also, during the financial years 2004-05 and 2005-06, 398 NDNAD search results were provided to UK NCB in response to requests from overseas authorities, either to see if there was anyone on the NDNAD who matched a DNA trace taken from the scene of a serious crime abroad, or to identify an unknown deceased person who may have been British. However, there is no central record of the number of cases in which these searches produced a result that led to a profile being sent to an overseas authority, and the number in which the search result was simply that there was no trace on the NDNAD.</p>
	<p pid="b.831W.6/5">The benefits of the international exchange of DNA are illustrated by a case in 2000. Sixty Chinese immigrants were found in a Dutch-registered truck in the port of Dover, 58 of whom had suffocated to death.</p>
	<p pid="b.831W.6/6">Following a complex Anglo-Dutch investigation, Perry Wacker, a Dutch lorry driver, and Ying Quo, of Essex, were sentenced to 14 and six years respectively at Maidstone Crown Court in 2001 for manslaughter and conspiracy to smuggle immigrants into the UK; another 10 individuals were convicted in the Netherlands. In both the UK and the Netherlands, exchanged DNA data was used as evidence in court and formed a key element in the case.</p>

	<p pid="b.832W.2/1">The security policy developed by the custodian of the National DNA Database is to keep the threat of both hacking into and identity theft from the NDNAD under constant review. This includes independent security penetration testing carried out by specialists approved by the national information assurance authority. Such tests are carried out on a regular basis and have shown that the NDNAD systems provide a high level of protection against the threat of external attacks.</p>

Of these, 2,317,555 (79.3 per cent.) had a conviction or caution (i.e. a criminal record). The difference between the two figures is attributable to: young persons under 18 who have a formal warning or reprimand recorded on PNC; persons who have been charged with a recordable offence where proceedings are on-going; and persons who have been arrested for a recordable offence but against whom no further action was taken.</p>

This works on a rolling 100 basis so that if a 101st set of prints is taken then the first set would be deleted. In addition, officers have been provided with a button that allows then to delete all prints from the device and they are being trained to use that function at the start and end of their shift. Prints can also be deleted with the subject watching at the end of the encounter. The Lantern device is a tool to aid officers in identifying individuals at the roadside and hence to assist them in deciding how to proceed. Once the encounter has been concluded there is no reason to retain the prints further. No demographic data (i.e. name, date of birth etc.) is input into the Lantern device, so no purpose can be achieved by storing them. Fingerprints taken at the roadside can be deleted with the subject watching. In any event, the device database is purged at regular intervals during the operating day. Fingerprints obtained at the roadside, are not collected with any identifying demographic data, and therefore remain anonymous, so no purpose can be achieved by storing them.</p>

	<p pid="b.836W.3/2">The review of Immigration and Nationality Directorate border control staffing is a continual process at airports, rail terminals and seaports. As part of our commitment to provide a secure border, staffing levels are constantly reviewed in line with risk assessments and business needs. Immigration coverage is based on a range of factors, including the nature and frequency of traffic and the numbers of passengers requiring leave to enter at each port. In addition, business targets and the associated bids to fund any additional posts are also taken into account when determining a port's staffing complement.</p>
	<p pid="b.836W.3/3">Border control staff are deployed to meet all services requiring immigration control and on a risk-assessed basis. As part of our &quot;tipping the balance&quot; initiative we are increasing the use of intelligence-led mobile teams to provide greater coverage of the border. The provision of advance passenger information by carriers under the e-borders programme is increasing the border agencies' ability to conduct informed risk assessments and deploy resources in a targeted manner.</p>

SOCA is also in receipt of circulations via the Interpol channel that refer to UK citizens.

	<p pid="b.843W.0/1">The information requested falls within the responsibility of the National Statistician, who has been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="b.843W.0/2" class="italic"> Letter from Karen Dunnell, dated <phrase class="date" code="">11 December</phrase>2006:</p>
	<p pid="b.843W.0/3" class="indent">As National Statistician, I have been asked to reply to your recent Parliamentary Questions asking:</p>
	<p pid="b.843W.0/4" class="indent">(1) what the average household income was in the City of York (a) parliamentary constituency and (b) council area in each year since 1992 for (i) working, (ii) retired and (iii) unemployed households (106679) and;</p>
	<p pid="b.843W.0/5" class="indent">(2) what the average income was of (a) males and (b) females working (i) full-time and (ii) part-time in City of York (A) parliamentary constituency and (B) council area in each year since 1992. (106680)</p>
	<p pid="b.843W.0/6" class="indent">(1) Estimates of household income which include income from earnings, benefits, pensions, investment income and other sources, are generally based on household surveys. The largest of these is the Family Resources Survey which has an annual sample in the UK of around 28,000 households. This is sufficient to produce estimates of household income at national and regional level, but not for smaller areas.</p>
	<p pid="b.843W.0/7" class="indent">However, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) has recently published estimates of household income for wards for 2001/02 only. These estimates are based on a statistical model and are experimental statistics&mdash;this means they have been developed in accordance with the principles set out in the National Statistics Code of Practice but have yet to be fully accredited as National Statistics. These ward level estimates can be used to provide estimates of average household income for areas made up of wards.</p>
	<p pid="b.843W.0/8" class="indent">The estimates are mean net equivalised incomes. Equivalised household incomes are standardized to take into account different sizes and compositions of households. The standard household is deemed to be a two adult household with no children, and so these equivalised incomes can be interpreted as indicating a standard of living that would be achieved by a standard household with that income. The estimates are net of income tax, national insurance contributions, contributions to occupational pension schemes, and council tax</p>
	<p pid="b.843W.0/9" class="indent">Using these model-based estimates of household income, it is estimated that for the City of York parliamentary constituency in 2001/02, mean net income before housing costs was &pound;360 per week, while after housing costs it was &pound;320. For the City of York council area, the mean net income before housing costs was &pound;374 per week, while after housing costs it was &pound;339.</p>
	<p pid="b.843W.0/10" class="indent">(2) ONS does not produce statistics on the average income of individuals, however, average earnings are estimated from the Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings (ASHE), and are provided for employees on adult rates whose pay for the survey period was not affected by absence. This is the standard definition used for ASHE. The ASHE does not collect data on the self employed and people who do unpaid work. ASHE is only available from 1997. The attached tables show Average Gross Weekly Earnings for the parliamentary constituency of City of York, and for the Unitary Authority council area of York, for the years 1997 to 2006.</p>

	<p pid="b.846W.2/19">VAT registration and de-registration data do not capture all business activity. Businesses are unlikely to be registered if their turnover falls below the compulsory VAT threshold, which has risen in each year since 1997. Similarly, businesses that de-register will not necessarily have closed. Only 1.8 million out of 4.3 million businesses (42 per cent.) were registered for VAT at the start of 2005.</p>

However, NHS London has advised that in May 2006 the North West London hospitals NHS trust board, of which Northwick Park hospital and Central Middlesex hospital are both part, discussed options for reconfiguring services between the two hospital sites while reviewing the strategic outline case for redevelopment of Northwick Park hospital.</p>

	<p pid="b.854W.9/1">'Fee Paying Services' are covered by schedule 10 of the consultant contract (2003) terms and conditions of service. 'Fee Paying Services' include the provision of specialist medical reports.</p>
	<p pid="b.854W.9/2">Schedule 11 of the consultant contract (2003) terms and conditions of service sets out the principles governing the receipt of fees for such services. It provides that the consultant should remit any fees to his/her employer when carrying out fee-paying work for other organisations during NHS time, unless the work involves minimal disruption and the employer agrees that it may be done in NHS time without the employer collecting the fee.</p>
	<p pid="b.854W.9/3">For fee-paying work carried out in the consultant's own time, the consultant can retain the fee.</p>
	<p pid="b.854W.9/4">The 2003 consultant contract was designed to clarify the NHS commitment and private practice commitment, and to provide stronger guarantees that private practice would not disrupt provision of NHS services or detract from NHS performance. Under the new arrangements, there is much greater transparency about consultants' contractual commitments to the NHS, and clear guidelines on private work.</p>

The bank includes staff who hold substantive posts at NHS trusts and those staff who work only as bank staff through NHS Professionals. Staff who hold substantive roles and wish to work additional shifts at the same trust are recruited to the bank on average in seven working days.

	<p pid="b.876W.2/1">The Department does not hold average costs of schools. Schools are designed and procured locally. However, a 1,000 pupil secondary school on a site without particular problems, in an area of average building prices, would typically be in the range of &pound;18-22 million. This excludes the cost of site acquisition. Many sites have circumstances that can add considerably to costs. Building prices vary significantly from one region to another.</p>

In practice, responsibility for the quality assurance of inspections and reports is discharged at a number of different levels. The first level of responsibility rests with the lead inspector who should ensure that the inspection is carried out in accordance with Ofsted's code of conduct and the relevant framework and guidance. In the case of maintained and independent schools, our National and Regional Inspection Services Providers are required to ensure that the inspectors they employ conduct inspections that are of the standard required by Ofsted. Her Majesty's Inspectors (HMI) visit a proportion of inspections to check that they are of the required standard.</p>
	<p pid="b.877W.0/6" class="indent">The lead inspector is responsible for producing an inspection report that is accurate and fair. Each report is read and its quality assessed. In the case of reports on inspections of maintained and independent schools, quality reading is undertaken by the relevant Regional or National Inspection Services Provider, but all reports must then be signed off by HMI on behalf of HMCI before publication. Reports on initial teacher training providers and local authority services are read and checked by HMI. I personally sign off all reports where a school is placed into special measures.</p>

	<p pid="b.877W.3/1">The Food Standards Agency comments as follows: &quot;On <phrase class="date" code="2006-07-06">6 July 2006</phrase>, the Food Standards Agency published the findings of a systematic review of research, which looked at the effect of nutrition and diet on performance and behaviour of children in schools. The review concluded that there was insufficient evidence to reach a firm conclusion on the effect of diet and the education or learning of the general population. The Food Standards Agency's recommendation, therefore, continues to be that we should eat at least two portions of fish a week, including one of oily fish, as part of a healthy balanced diet.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.877W.3/2">The new nutrition standards implemented from September 2006 will help to encourage children to meet the Food Standards Agency's recommendation, by stipulating regular inclusion of oily fish in school menus.</p>

	<p pid="b.879W.0/5">On <phrase class="date" code="2006-11-30">30 November 2006</phrase> we issued guidance to local authorities on performance management arrangements that will help them evaluate the services that Sure Start children's centres provide and make sure that they are responsive to the most disadvantaged groups. The guidance identifies black and ethnic minority families as one of the priority groups. We also issued revised practice guidance for Sure Start children's centres which includes evidence of effective ways of engaging with those families who are at risk of social exclusion and information on methods that have been found to work with specific groups.</p>

	<p pid="b.886W.11/2">The United Kingdom takes its disarmament obligations under the NPT very seriously and has an excellent record in this area. Over the past decade we have: reduced significantly the maximum number of operationally available warheads; ceased production of fissile material for nuclear weapons; completed the withdrawal of our maritime tactical nuclear capability and the RAF's WE177 freefall bomb, with the result that we are the only nuclear weapon state to have reduced its nuclear deterrent capacity to a single system, which is based on the Trident D5 missile. We continue to press for multilateral negotiations towards mutual, balanced and verifiable reductions in nuclear weapons.

	<p pid="b.890W.2/3">There are however, over 1,200 different products currently procured by the food supply contractor for the UK armed forces; over 800 of these are British. The remaining 400 include products such as fresh fruit and vegetables which are sourced from various countries on a seasonal basis, and others that are not produced in this country, such as coffee and bananas.</p>

Details of these floor targets, showing changes made to the targets and where targets have been rolled over or removed at each Spending Review, are available via the HMT website at the following addresses, and are made available in the Library of the House:</p>

	<p pid="b.902W.2/2">The 2007-08 Local Government Finance Settlement is the second year of a two-year settlement period. Provisional allocations for 2007-08 were therefore first published in December 2005. Multi-year settlements have been welcomed by local government.</p>
	<p pid="b.902W.2/3">For the Local Government Finance settlements, we have to use the best data that are available at the time, and that treat all local authorities on a consistent basis.</p>
	<p pid="b.902W.2/4">Therefore, for the measure of the resident population in the 2007-08 settlement, we have used the 2003-based sub-national population projection for 2007 as the key measure of population, and the mid-2004 estimate of population within other indicators used in the top-up formulae. These were the best data available at the time.</p>
	<p pid="b.902W.2/5">As multi-year settlements bring stability and predictability to local authority funding, we do not intend to change the settlement from that previously announced, other than in exceptional circumstances.</p>
	<p pid="b.902W.2/6">The next round of multi-year settlements, for 2008-09 to 2010-11, will be made in late 2007. The best data on population that will be available at that point will be the 2004-based sub-national population projections and the mid-2006 estimate of population.</p>

	<p pid="b.906W.5/1">Statistics on religiously aggravated offences in England and Wales cannot be separated from recorded crime statistics for racially and religiously aggravated offences.</p>
	<p pid="b.906W.5/2">The police treat faith hate incidents as racist incidents. Their definition when recording such incidents is, &quot;any incident which is regarded as racist by the victim or any other person&quot;. This is the definition recommended by the Stephen Lawrence Inquiry.</p>
	<p pid="b.906W.5/3">As a consequence, the statistics available do not distinguish between religiously and racially aggravated crime. The total number of racially or religiously aggravated offences recorded in England and Wales has risen from 31,035 in 2002-03 to 35,022 in 2003-04 and to 37,074 in 2004-05, according to the Home Office Statistical Bulletin &quot;Crime in England and Wales 2004/05&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.906W.5/4">Placing this rise in perspective, the British Crime Survey (BCS) put racially motivated incidents at around 179,000 based on interviews in 2004-05. The estimated number of racially motivated incidents was 206,000 based on the 2003-04 interviews, and there was a similar response in 2002-03. The BCS figures for these years were not broken down by the religion of the victim.</p>

We have said we will publish for consultation by the end of the year a new PPS on climate change.

Separate regulations are being made for Northern Ireland under Section 82 of the Equality Act because Northern Ireland's anti-discrimination framework is distinct from that which applies to the rest of Great Britain.
