The Crown Prosecution Service is working with officials from the Serious Fraud Office, the Customs and Excise Prosecution Office, the Home Office the Department for Constitutional Affairs and other partners in the criminal justice system to develop such an incentivisation scheme, for agreement with HM Treasury, to be funded from assets recovered from the enforcement of successful confiscation orders, cash forfeitures and civil recovery.</p>

	<p pid="a.16W.5/3">My right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary, John Grant (UK Permanent Representative to the EU) and I represented the UK at the General Affairs and External Relations Council (GAERC) in Brussels on <phrase class="date" code="">13 December</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.16W.5/4">Conclusions were agreed on: ESDP, Iran, Somalia, Sudan, Great Lakes, Ukraine, Afghanistan, Colombia and the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP).</p>
	<p pid="a.16W.5/5" class="italic">General Affairs Session</p>
	<p pid="a.16W.5/6" class="italic">Preparation for the <phrase class="date" code="">17 December</phrase> European Council</p>
	<p pid="a.16W.5/7">The Council examined draft conclusions prepared by the Presidency for the European Council to be held in Brussels on 16&ndash;<phrase class="date" code="">17 December</phrase>, dealing in particular with the conclusion of membership negotiations with Bulgaria and Romania and the opening of negotiations with Turkey and Croatia. Work on the draft conclusions is likely to continue in the run-up to the European Council;</p>
	<p pid="a.16W.5/8">The main items that the European Council is due to discuss are as follows:</p>
	<p pid="a.16W.5/9" class="indent">EU enlargement: decisions on the conclusion of membership negotiations with Bulgaria and Romania and on the opening of negotiations with Turkey and Croatia.</p>

	<p pid="a.16W.5/14" class="italic">Annual Programme of the Council (2005)</p>
	<p pid="a.16W.5/15">The Council took note of the presentation by the incoming Luxembourg and United Kingdom presidencies of a draft operational programme of the Council for 2005. The document is the result of a negotiation between both countries and therefore reflects the UK's views, but is not a definitive statement of what the UK will take forward in the second half of the year. Rather it is intended as a flexible menu of issues likely to be pursued next year and will form the basis of discussions with UK stakeholders and others as the UK Presidency programme is refined. It was agreed without discussion. Copies will be made available in the Library of the House.</p>
	<p pid="a.16W.5/16" class="italic">External Relations Session</p>
	<p pid="a.16W.5/17" class="italic">Iran</p>
	<p pid="a.16W.5/18">The Council gave its full support for the negotiating process, which started on <phrase class="date" code="">13 December</phrase>, on a long-term arrangement with Iran. This was in light of the IAEA's confirmation of full suspension of all enrichment-related and reprocessing activities by Tehran. The EU will resume negotiations with Iran on a draft Trade and Cooperation Agreement. As a member of the E3 (UK, Germany and France) the Government played a major part in negotiating Iran's decision to suspend fully all enrichment related and reprocessing activities. It welcomes the continued negotiations for long-term arrangements.</p>
	<p pid="a.16W.5/19" class="italic">Ukraine</p>
	<p pid="a.16W.5/20">Over lunch, Ministers gave their full support to the work of High Representative Solana and the Lithuanian and Polish Presidents. The Council welcomed the political agreement reached in Ukraine on <phrase class="date" code="">8 December</phrase> that together with the Supreme Court's ruling on <phrase class="date" code="">3 December</phrase> paved the way for a free and fair rerun of the second round of presidential elections. The EU will contribute substantially to the OSCE international election observation mission. There will be a declaration at the European Council. The Government are pleased that the situation in Ukraine remains peaceful and that a solution was reached within Ukraine's legal framework. As the Foreign Secretary said in his statement to the House on <phrase class="date" code="">29 November</phrase>, <phrase class="offrep" id="debates/.359"><i>Official Report</i>, column 359</phrase>, the Government look forward to an outcome to the elections that reflects the will of the Ukrainian people.</p>
	<p pid="a.16W.5/21" class="italic">China Arms Embargo</p>
	<p pid="a.16W.5/22">Over lunch, Ministers held an exchange of views concerning the EU arms embargo against China, following the <phrase class="date" code="">8 December</phrase> EU-China Summit at which the EU had confirmed its political will to continue to work towards lifting the embargo.</p>
	<p pid="a.16W.5/23">The Government support the decision of the European Council in December 2003 to review the EU arms embargo on China. This review is on-going&mdash;it was last discussed by EU Foreign Ministers at the <phrase class="date" code="">22 November</phrase> GAERC. The Government do not wish to exclude any options for the review, nor to pre-empt the conclusion of the review. The Government continue to implement the arms embargo as set out by the then Minister of State at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, the late Derek Fatchett, in <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/808" name="Vernon Coaker">his reply to my hon. Friend the Member for Gedling (Vernon Coaker)</phrase> on <phrase class="date" code="1998-06-03">3 June 1998</phrase>, <phrase class="offrep" id="debates/1998-06-03.240"><i>Official Report</i>, columns 240&ndash;41</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.16W.5/24" class="italic">Middle East Peace Process</p>
	<p pid="a.16W.5/25">The Presidency noted that Ministers would return to the subject at the European Council. A Declaration will be agreed.</p>
	<p pid="a.16W.5/26" class="italic">ENP</p>
	<p pid="a.16W.5/27">Ministers discussed the action plans set up within the framework of the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP) for Israel, Jordan, Moldova, Morocco, the Palestinian Authority, Ukraine and Tunisia. The Council endorsed these seven action plans, which will now be forwarded to the relevant association or co-operation councils for implementation. Ukraine's action plan will be launched as soon as possible following the completion of free and fair presidential elections. The Government agree with this course of action.</p>
	<p pid="a.16W.5/28" class="italic">Great Lakes</p>
	<p pid="a.16W.5/29">The Commission said Commissioner Michel would be visiting the region on 15&ndash;<phrase class="date" code="">19 December</phrase>. The agreed Conclusions expressed the Council's deep concern about reports of military operations by Rwandan armed forces in the DRC and condemned any threat to and violation of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the DRC. The Council underlined the importance of addressing the key problem of the ex-FAR/Interahamwe, which was undermining peace and security in the region and constituted a source of instability and a threat to the local population as well as an impediment to good neighbourly relations.</p>
	<p pid="a.16W.5/30">The Council stressed the importance of the continued transition process in the DRC, especially in the preparation of elections and in the implementation of the necessary reforms. It called upon all countries of the region to give the transition in the DRC all their support. The Government welcome the agreed conclusions. It is important that the international community speaks with one voice to dissuade Rwanda from any action contrary to international law. The current crisis highlights the need to resolve the problem of the ex-FAR/Interahamwe to prevent further crises, address Rwandan security concerns and prevent further human rights abuses in DRC.</p>
	<p pid="a.16W.5/31" class="italic">Sudan</p>
	<p pid="a.16W.5/32">The Presidency drew attention to the deteriorating security and humanitarian situation in Darfur and reminded the Council that pressure needed to be maintained on all parties, both to improve the security situation and to facilitate the rapid conclusion of the North/South process. Conclusions were agreed. These noted the latest report of the UN Secretary-General to the UN Security Council and its concern about the deteriorating security and humanitarian situation in Darfur. The Council condemns attacks and other ceasefire violations by all parties in the Darfur conflict and urges them to respect the ceasefire agreements. The Council recalls its previous conclusions and underlines that the EU will continue to monitor the situation in Darfur and will consider to take appropriate measures which could include sanctions, against the Government of Sudan as well as the rebel groups, in accordance with the UN Security Council Resolution 1556 and 1564, if no tangible progress is achieved in this respect.</p>
	<p pid="a.16W.5/33">The Government remain gravely concerned by the latest report by the Secretary-General on Darfur. It highlights the need for continued EU political pressure on all the parties to abide by the two Abuja Protocols; it also underlines the need for increased logistical, technical and financial assistance to the AU, and for the AU to expedite deployment of its civilian police component. It welcomes the UN Workplan for 2005 for $1.5 billion for the whole of Sudan. The Government welcome any analysis on sanctions, should they become necessary.</p>
	<p pid="a.16W.5/34" class="italic">AOB&mdash;EU/Africa Dialogue</p>
	<p pid="a.16W.5/35">The Council took note of a presentation by Portuguese Foreign Minster Monteiro on the question of a second Africa-Europe Summit (after the April 2000 Cairo Summit), following the exchange of views on that subject at the EU-African Union Ministerial Troika meeting in Addis Ababa on <phrase class="date" code="">6 December</phrase>. The President noted that the issue would be further discussed under the incoming Luxembourg Presidency.</p>
	<p pid="a.16W.5/36" class="italic">AOB&mdash;Libya</p>
	<p pid="a.16W.5/37">Italian Foreign Minister Fini brought to the Council's attention that in the context of an immigration mission to Libya, the Libyan authorities were willing to co-operate with the EU authorities. The Italians requested the use of the AENEAS programme (EU migration funding) to help the Libyans. The Presidency took note. The Government welcome the cooperation between Italy and Libya and Italy's request to extend the AENEAS programme to Libya.</p>
	<p pid="a.16W.5/38" class="italic">AOB&mdash; Guinea Bissau</p>
	<p pid="a.16W.5/39">The Council heard an intervention by Portuguese Foreign Minister Monteiro on the situation in Guinea Bissau as well as on the question of the resumption of the budgetary support programme. On the latter issue, the Commission reaffirmed its readiness to explore possible solutions in order to enable aid to be resumed. The Government currently provide multilateral support through the UN, EU and international financial institutions.</p>

	<p pid="a.19W.2/2">The effect of measures adopted under the Constitutional Treaty on Gibraltar's constabulary, local government powers and armed forces facilities will of course depend on the content of the measures in question.

	<p pid="a.19W.5/1">A major external Evaluation of the Pools by Bradford University's Department of Peace Studies, completed in March 2004, concluded that, although it is too soon to make an accurate assessment of impact, the Pools are funding worthwhile activities that make positive contributions to effective conflict prevention, and that the progress achieved through the Pools' mechanisms is significant enough to justify their continuation.</p>

	<p pid="a.23W.11/1">The UK has taken a number of steps to fight organised crime in Kosovo, and in the Western Balkans region as a whole. The UK works closely with governments in the region, the UN mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) and other international organisations to combat this threat.</p>
	<p pid="a.23W.11/2">Since 2002 we have committed over &pound;2.4 million to initiatives in this field throughout the region. We have provided expertise and equipment to increase the effectiveness of the Kosovo Organised Crime Unit and are currently helping UNMIK to set up a financial intelligence unit to combat money laundering in Kosovo.</p>
	<p pid="a.23W.11/3">The UK has provided around 99 officers to UNMIK to assist with law enforcement there. We also contribute almost 20 per cent. of the funding to the EU's external assistance programme to the Western Balkans (the Community Assistance for Reconstruction, Development and Stabilisation (CARDS) programme. The programme is worth &euro;4.6 billion for the period 2000&ndash;06. Of the &euro;51.5 million allocated for Kosovo for 2004. &euro;6.5 million (12.5 per cent.) is devoted to justice and home affairs issues.</p>

	<p pid="a.24W.5/1">Data on residual mines and other unexploded ordnance in Kosovo is supplied to us by the United Nations interim administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK). At present there are 37 individual dangerous areas left to clear. These areas are mostly in the Dulje Pass close to the Prizren area or along the border with Albania. However, more contaminated areas are likely to be discovered as the population returns to areas which have not been occupied since the conflict.</p>
	<p pid="a.24W.5/2">Following NATO intervention in Kosovo to avert an immediate and overwhelming humanitarian disaster, the UK was the first country to have de-miners on the ground in Kosovo. The UK Government have spent over &pound;10 million on de-mining activities in the Balkans, over &pound;5 million of which was spent in 1999&ndash;2000 on de-mining in Kosovo. Their de-mining activities have included clearance of unexploded munitions such as cluster bomb submunitions but also cover residual mines and other unexploded ordnance laid (both in set minefields and scattered randomly) during the Serbian-Albanian conflict.</p>
	<p pid="a.24W.5/3">The UK Government provide funding to the HALO Trust which is one of the agencies involved in helping to clear the remaining mined areas that have been identified. UK Government funding is also provided to a Kosovo Protection Corps (KPC) capacity building project with Handicap International through the Global Conflict Prevention Pool. UNMIK has an Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) management team whose role is one of coordination, planning and management of the ongoing clearance by all the parties involved: KFOR, KPC and NGOs. The UNMIK EOD team is in effect the primary mine clearing authority.</p>
	<p pid="a.24W.5/4">There will be a formal review in mid 2005 of Kosovo's progress in meeting the standards laid down by the UN (Kosovo Standards Implementation Plan (KSIP)). If Kosovo has made the necessary progress, then a process will begin to determine its final status in accordance with UNSCR 1244 (1999). If progress is insufficient, then there will be another review at a later date.</p>

	<p pid="a.30W.6/1">Since 1986, the &quot;no-party&quot; Movement system has banned activities by political parties. Initially the system promoted social cohesion and introduced significant local democracy based on 'individual merit'. But its continuation has inhibited democratic development.</p>
	<p pid="a.30W.6/2">We have continuously encouraged the Government of Uganda to open up political space.</p>
	<p pid="a.30W.6/3">We therefore welcomed President Museveni's call in March 2003 for this to occur in time for the next election in 2006. A White Paper proposing numerous changes to the constitution, including moving to a multi-party system and removing the limit on presidential terms, will be debated in the Ugandan Parliament shortly.</p>
	<p pid="a.30W.6/4">We hope that these changes will be handled in line with the provisions of the constitution through a process that carries the confidence of the Ugandan people and Parliament, and will enable the necessary legal amendments for a multi-party system to be enacted sufficiently in advance of the 2006 elections.</p>

	<p pid="a.40W.3/2">Following an independent audit of CABE and DCMS's own review of public appointments processes earlier this year, procedures for identifying, declaring and disposing of or managing interests so that actual or perceived conflicts are avoided were strengthened.</p>
	<p pid="a.40W.3/3">All shortlisted candidates are asked about potential conflicts of interest during the interview. Prior to appointment, detailed discussions with the successful candidate take place and an exchange of letters, documents, any agreed arrangements. Before re-appointment, the register of interests is reviewed and updated.</p>
	<p pid="a.40W.3/4">In the case of serving Commissioners, advisers and staff, CABE has its own guidance note on 'Managing Conflicts of Interest'.</p>

The ARA has also received an allocation of &pound;1,216,500 from the Community Club Development Programme for distribution amongst rowing clubs.

This plan is currently under review by Sport England's national investment panel and a decision on future funding levels will be made shortly.</p>

	<p pid="a.53W.0/1">Current available data do not allow a complete answer to this question. Many donors, including DFID, provide a significant part of their support to humanitarian agencies either as un-earmarked contributions, or on an Africa-wide basis, which does not lend itself to being broken down by specific Central African countries. Additionally, agencies often target refugees as well as other vulnerable groups within one single operation, making it difficult to isolate the support to refugees.</p>
	<p pid="a.53W.0/2">DFID channels the majority of its monetary support to refugee operations through the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). Globally, (including Central Africa), from 1997 until 2004, DFID contributions to the UNHCR have totalled &pound;145 million. For the same period, US contributions have totalled &pound;1.2 billion, EC contributions have totalled &pound;350 million, and EU member state contributions combined (not including UK contributions) have amounted to &pound;1 billion. Of the &pound;26 million provided to the UNHCR in 2003, &pound;15 million (57 per cent.) was unearmarked but certainly contributed to the Central African operations, a further &pound;1 million (4 per cent.) was earmarked for general Africa operations, and an additional &pound;1.5 million (6 per cent.) was specifically earmarked for operations in Chad and the DRC.</p>
	<p pid="a.53W.0/3">From 1997 until 2003, DFID also channelled a further &pound;11 million of support to non-UN agencies operating in support of refugee programmes across the Central and Great Lakes Regions of Africa.</p>
	<p pid="a.53W.0/4">For food assistance to refugees, DFID channels the majority of its funding through the World Food Programme (WFP). Again, it is not possible to disaggregate this support accurately by specific countries. However, from 1998 until 2004, DFID support to the WFP globally has totalled &pound;300 million, and DFID is currently the WFP's fourth largest donor. For the same period, US support to the WFP has totalled &pound;3.8 billion, EC support has totalled &pound;650 million, and combined EU member-state contributions (not including the UK) have amounted to &pound;920 million. As a Central African example, 2004 contributions to the WFP's feeding programme for Sudanese refugees in Chad have seen the UK commit &pound;2.2 million compared to the US contribution of &pound;16 million, the EC contribution of &pound;1.4 million, and the non-UK EU member state contributions totalling &pound;4.3 million.</p>
	<p pid="a.53W.0/5">Meeting the food and non-food requirements of refugee populations in Central Africa remains a humanitarian priority for DFID. In addition, DFID actively promotes local acceptance of refugees by channelling parallel support to host populations and refugee-affected areas. And ultimately, DFID supports the search for durable solutions for refugee populations, promoting and facilitating voluntary repatriation when conditions in the country-of-origin permit. At the same time, DFID also prioritises similar standards of assistance to Internally Displaced Persons.</p>
	<p pid="a.53W.0/6">Additional information on other donor contributions to refugee operations in Africa can be found on the websites of the UNHCR (<a href="http://www.unhcr.ch">www.unhcr.ch</a>), the WFP (<a href="http://www.wfp.org">www.wfp.org</a>), Reliefweb (<a href="http://www.reliefweb.int">www.reliefweb.int</a>), the US Bureau of Population, Refugees and Migration (<a href="http://www.state.gov/g/prm/">www.state.gov/g/prm/</a>), and the European Community Humanitarian Office (ECHO) (<a href="http://europa.eu.int/comm/echo/index_en.htm">http://europa.eu.int/comm/echo/index_en.htm</a>).</p>

	<p pid="a.56W.2/1">UK officials in Iraq maintain close contact with the Iraqi interim Government (IIG), and with representatives of the Multi-National Force-Iraq (MNF-I), who reported that forces had supplied water to the civilians remaining in Fallujah. In addition, the Iraqi Ministry of Health and the US Marines report that they had stockpiled supplies of water and other essential items, prior to military action. There is also an MNF-I Civil Military Operations Centre in Fallujah, which is helping to co-ordinate provision of essential supplies to civilians. Visits by DFID advisers confirm that water tankers have been operating in Fallujah, supplying the needs of the residents who remain.</p>
	<p pid="a.56W.2/2">DFID advisers are working closely with the Iraqi Interim Government Fallujah Core Group, which is responsible for co-ordinating humanitarian work in and around Fallujah. The estimate that 1,500 civilians remain in Fallujah was reached after visits to the city by DFID advisers, members of the Iraqi Ministry of Health, and British military officials. The IIG Fallujah Core Group and a UN Emergency Working Group are also monitoring the location and condition of Fallujah's displaced citizens. They have been able to estimate numbers both outside and inside Fallujah through assessment visits to the surrounding area.</p>

	<p pid="a.64W.0/1">The process of restructuring the infantry has been worked through by the Army consulting with the divisions and regiments concerned. As part of this process those infantry divisions affected by the changes were asked to suggest options for new regimental titles. Of the options put forward by the King's Division, the proposed title of the 'King's, Lancashire and Border Regiment', was felt by the Army Board to best reflect all the antecedent regiments from which it will be drawn.</p>

	<p pid="a.66W.8/2">Personnel deployed on operations are supported by either the Operational Welfare Package (OWP) or by Local Overseas Allowance (LOA). The vast majority of personnel serving overseas, receive the OWP. The OWP provides 20 minutes of publicly funded telephone calls per week. This amount will be supplemented by a further 20 minutes for the Christmas week. In addition, personnel may purchase unlimited additional time through a standing arrangement with the service provider. Furthermore, under the OWP personnel are entitled to free internet access, which includes the ability to send and receive e-mails. Personnel serving in locations where the OWP has been granted receive free aerogrammes ('blueys') delivered by the British Forces Post Office (BFPO). A concessionary rate postal service also exists for letters and packets weighing up to 2kg sent from the UK mainland or BFPO addresses. Lastly, between <phrase class="date" code="">17 November</phrase> and <phrase class="date" code="2004-12-15">15 December 2004</phrase>, family members were entitled to send, free of charge, an unlimited number of packets weighing up to 2kg to Service personnel serving in overseas operational theatres.</p>
	<p pid="a.66W.8/3">LOA is a non-taxable allowance designed to meet the additional costs associated with communication (both verbal and written) from distant or remote locations not covered by OWP arrangements. The LOA reflects the actual costs of such communications from the location concerned.</p>

Gulf veterans do not present with an identifiable and distinct pattern of symptoms or signs.</p>
	<p pid="a.73W.8/2">The consensus of the international scientific and medical community following extensive research on the matter is that there is insufficient evidence to enable the ill-health reported by 1990&ndash;91 Gulf veterans to be characterised as a unique Gulf related illness or syndrome.</p>
	<p pid="a.73W.8/3">The Medical Research Council came to the same conclusion in their report published in May 2003 following their independent scientific review of all the UK research work carried out into Gulf veterans' illnesses. We do not, therefore, refer to the symptoms reported as being &quot;Gulf war syndrome&quot;.</p>

The Royal Navy has a continuing requirement for these ships and our assessments so far suggest that the best value for money would be offered by re-negotiating our contract with Swan Hunter; so it is not true to say at this stage that we are not prepared to assist the company. However, the detailed discussions we are having with Swan Hunter and with BAE Systems&mdash;which is building the two follow-on vessels&mdash;remain commercially sensitive and I am therefore withholding any further information in accordance with Exemption 7a of the Code of Practice on Access to Government Information.</p>

	<p pid="a.97W.5/1">Development of the Government's reforms to national health service dentistry was informed by experience of the personal dental services (PDS) scheme and Options for Change pilots. A key feature of these pilot schemes, which will also be carried forward to new contractual arrangements, is the replacement of the item-for-service method of remunerating dentists with local contracts. Primary care trusts will negotiate contracts with dental practices to meet patients' overall oral health care needs. An evaluation of a sample of PDS schemes suggest that dentists may prescribe fewer intricate dental appliances under local commissioning, although this may only be a temporary effect whilst they adjust to new contractual and remuneration arrangements. Dentists should prescribe appliances for which there is a clinical need.</p>

	<p pid="a.98W.0/2">Currently the responsibility for bad debts due to non-payment of patient charges rests with the provider dentist in the general dental services and personal dental services (PDS) except where, under the PDS, the practice is owned by the primary care trust. Bad debt has not been raised as an issue by providers in the PDS. When the new contractual arrangements are implemented a new system of patient charges will be required. We have received a report from the NHS dentistry patient charges working group, chaired by Harry Cayton, which we are considering.</p>

	<p pid="a.113W.2/3" class="indent">The Secretary of State has asked me to reply to your question about the average amount of time spent on job search activities by people claiming Jobseeker's Allowance (JSA). This is something that falls within the responsibilities delegated to me as Chief Executive of Jobcentre Plus.</p>
	<p pid="a.113W.2/4" class="indent">Information about the average weekly time JSA claimants spend on job search activity is not available. However, people claiming JSA are required to actively seek work and undertake minimum levels of job search activity to maintain their entitlement to JSA. It may be helpful if I explain this, and how we monitor compliance, in a little more detail.</p>
	<p pid="a.113W.2/5" class="indent">People claiming JSA are usually required to undertake a minimum of three steps each week to look for work. These steps, which will vary depending on individual customer circumstances and the work they are seeking, are discussed and agreed at the new jobseeker interview, recorded in the Jobseeker's Agreement, and reviewed regularly. The Jobseeker's Agreement outlines the customer's job goal, the times and days they are available for work and those steps that, if taken, will offer the best chance of leading to a job. Having a Jobseeker's Agreement, signed by the customer and Adviser, is a requirement of entitlement to JSA.</p>
	<p pid="a.113W.2/6" class="indent">After the new jobseeker interview, people are usually required to attend the Jobcentre fortnightly and, if they remain unemployed, will be expected to attend more in-depth interviews with a Personal Adviser at key stages. These customer contacts provide a regular opportunity to ensure people are actively seeking work and to see what help, if any, is required. When someone does not appear to be actively seeking work or undertaking the required level of job search activity, payment of JSA is withheld and the case referred to an independent decision maker.</p>
	<p pid="a.113W.2/7" class="indent">I am sorry the specific information you have requested is not available, but I hope this response is nonetheless helpful.</p>

	<p pid="a.120W.5/1">Mr Christopher Leslie: The Government is sympathetic to the principles of individual registration and appreciates the benefits it might bring, particularly with regard to supporting remote voting. However, there are concerns about the possible impact of individual registration on registration rates and by extension the ability of eligible electors to vote. As such we are therefore considering the options to support remote voting with an approach that preserves the completeness and integrity of electoral registers.</p>
	<p pid="a.120W.5/2">The Government has made no assessment of the effects of such a system on the number of young people likely to vote, but research undertaken by the Electoral Commission following the introduction of individual registration in Northern Ireland (The Electoral Fraud (Northern Ireland) Act 2002: An Assessment of its first year of operation) has suggested that young people are among the most under registered, with 29 per cent. of 18&ndash;24 year olds not on the register. The Government is reluctant to see a fall in the registration rates of young people, already an under registered group, and any future work on registration will take this into account.</p>

	<p pid="a.131W.5/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="a.131W.5/2">Departmental proposals for, and the overall level of, efficiencies in environmental services were informed by consultation with Sir Peter Gershon's Efficiency Review team, the Local Government Association and other key organisations involved in this area. Detailed analysis was based on Defra's development of a new quantitative model, designed to support a robust, carefully modelled case for on-going government expenditure on waste as part of the 2004 Spending Review.</p>
	<p pid="a.131W.5/3">The model's primary purpose is to predict local authorities' waste management costs, flows of materials and the range of new facilities needed for waste treatment to meet the EU Landfill Directive targets and deliver increased rates of recycling and recovery. Analysis of the scope for greater efficiency in waste services identified the potential for delivering gains through: greater joint working between local authorities; encouragement and communication of best procurement practice; stimulating industry to ensure timely delivery of a wider, better designed range of facilities; improved operation of the land-use planning system; increased markets for recyclates and compost; and, shifting local authority planning from the short-term to the long-term in order to minimise overall costs.</p>
	<p pid="a.131W.5/4">Defra's Waste Implementation Programme already supports a range of activities to help local authorities drive up and re-orientate their waste management performance. Most will help deliver the improvements sought in the Efficiency Review, such as the targeted support being provided to improve procurement, and to stimulate industry to offer a wider, better designed range of facilities.</p>

	<p pid="a.133W.8/1">My Department is fully committed to providing an employment package which supports working parents and carers. DTI's provision is set within the wider context of an ambitious programme to support flexible working at all grades. DTI consults its staff and unions regularly on these issues. In a specific childcare survey DTI parents indicated that flexible working is the provision they value most highly. DTI's clear support for working parents has enabled us, over the last decade, to retain many talented parents who might otherwise have left the workplace.</p>

	<p pid="a.133W.8/3">London-based DTI staff also have access to six full-time subsidized nursery places for under 5s, currently occupied by five children. DTI is actively working with the Interdepartmental Group on Childcare to establish a more strategic and joined up approach to childcare for all civil servants, especially in London. DTI's annual budget for childcare is &pound;65,000.</p>

	<p pid="a.142W.3/2">Our research suggests that the number of vulnerable households in fuel poverty is likely to rise by a limited amount in 2004 and 2005&mdash;perhaps by up to 200,000 vulnerable households in England over this period. This figure represents the combined effects of gas and electricity price increases countered by other measures that we have put in place on incomes and benefits. The assumptions behind this estimate are set out in two DTI publications which accompanied publication of the Fuel Poverty in England: The Government's Plan for Action on November 30. These internet publications are available to view at <a href="http://www.dti.gov.uk/energy/consumers/fuel_poverty/index.shtml">www.dti.gov.uk/energy/consumers/fuel_poverty/index.shtml</a>.</p>
	<p pid="a.142W.3/3">Any potential increase in the numbers can be set against the very real progress that has been made: the number of households in fuel poverty in the UK has fallen by over three million since 1996, to 2.25 million in 2002 and further reductions are expected in the figure for 2003. In England, there has been a fall from the 1996 figure of 4.3 million households (three million vulnerable) to 1.4 million (1.2 million vulnerable) in 2002. The Government remains committed to achieving its target of seeking an end to the problem of fuel poverty in England in vulnerable households by 2010 as far as is reasonably practicable. .</p>

	<p pid="a.143W.0/2">As fuel poverty is devolved, therefore this answer covers England only.</p>
	<p pid="a.143W.0/3">My Department has considered the impacts of gas and electricity prices on fuel poverty for England. The results of this analysis were published in the Government's Fuel Poverty Action Plan, and suggests that the number of vulnerable households in fuel poverty is likely to rise by a limited amount in 2004 and 2005, perhaps by up to 200,000 vulnerable households in England over the period. We monitor the number of households in fuel poverty through the English House Condition Survey, with figures for 2003 becoming available in April 2005.</p>
	<p pid="a.143W.0/4">According to the 2001 English House Condition Survey, around 700,000 (3.3 per cent.) of dwellings in England used oil-fired central heating as their main form of space heating. Of these households, around 150,000 are likely to be vulnerable households in fuel poverty. Estimated heating oil prices for 2004 are around 20 per cent. higher than those in 2001. This will have increased the number of vulnerable households in fuel poverty who use heating oil. There are a number of uncertainties about exactly how many households will be brought into fuel poverty by changes in the price of heating oil, but it is likely to be significantly less than 50,000 vulnerable households.</p>
	<p pid="a.143W.0/5">The Government remain committed to achieving their target of seeking an end to the problem of fuel poverty in England in vulnerable households by 2010 as far as is reasonably practicable. Additionally, any potential increase in the numbers can be set against the very real progress that has been made: the number of households in fuel poverty in the UK has fallen by over three million since 1996, to 2.25 million in 2002 and further reductions are expected in 2003.</p>

	<p pid="a.145W.2/1">No. The activities of the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA) have not been declared outwith EC treaty rules on state aid. We notified the European Commission of our intention to support the creation of the NDA in December 2003. The Commission announced a formal investigation into state aid to the NDA on <phrase class="date" code="2004-12-01">1 December 2004</phrase>. This announcement confirmed that the transitional arrangements under which the NDA will start work on <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-01">1 April 2005</phrase> do not involve state aid. We will work closely with the Commission throughout their investigation.</p>

	<p pid="a.148W.2/1">Swan Hunter (Shipbuilders) Ltd went into receivership in 1993 and all records related to DTI contact with them have been archived. Consequently, information on financial support to that defunct company could only be obtained at disproportionate cost. Swan Hunter (Tyneside) Ltd was established in 1995. Since then, DTI has awarded just one grant of &pound;1.2 million in September 2000 under the Regional Selective Assistance programme.</p>

	<p pid="a.156W.0/1">The benefit of high occupancy vehicle lanes is that they facilitate the movement of more people per lane, reducing peak hour travel times while maintaining safety and reducing pollution. The introduction of the lanes should result in some drivers choosing to leave their cars at home or a convenient parking point and car share with others. This should result in a net decrease in traffic on the motorway, on the local network leading to the motorway and on the return journey home. This should help to reduce congestion associated with each of these journeys.</p>

This is intended to facilitate the identification of vehicles in international traffic and in re-registration in other member states.</p>
	<p pid="a.158W.12/2">The costs directly related to the design and preparation of the forms and project planning were approximately &pound;0.9 million, with a further &pound;5.2 million system change and development costs to accommodate the additional information now held and printed onto the new harmonised registration certificates.</p>
	<p pid="a.158W.12/3">The legislation does not require the replacement of existing documents until a reissue is requested, so that additional running costs would not have been incurred. However, it was decided to embark on an accelerated circulation of existing registration documents (V5s) and to replace these existing certificates in line with the annual registration/licensing process:</p>

This is not an absolute cap of 48 hours in any one week. This average is normally calculated over a 17-week reference period, although this can be longer in certain situations (26 weeks) and can be extended by agreement (up to 52 weeks). Workers may choose to work more than 48 hours per week over this reference period by signing an opt-out agreement, but employers cannot force a worker to sign an opt-out and workers cannot be subjected to detriment for refusing to sign an opt-out.</p>

This total reflects a number of staff changes during the course of the year. There are currently 11 staff working in ministerial private offices who have signed an opt-out. Given the changes of staff during the year, it is not meaningful to calculate this as a percentage of the total of 26.</p>

	<p pid="a.160W.3/1">Our proposals under the Animal Welfare Bill will improve significantly the welfare of all animals used in entertainment, including animals performing in circuses. The introduction of the welfare offence means that the owner or keeper of an animal is required to take reasonable steps to ensure its welfare. This will enable the courts to take action where an animal although not currently suffering is being kept in a way that will cause eventual suffering.</p>
	<p pid="a.160W.3/2">The contents of the Bill have been subject to public consultation and pre- legislative scrutiny. This has enabled a wide range of animal keepers, including the keepers of circus animals, to make their views known.</p>
	<p pid="a.160W.3/3">It is our intention, through regulations under the Bill, to license all performing animal trainers. We propose that inspectors will be given the right of entry to all premises where performing animals are kept or are performing, including winter holding quarters. The regulations would be backed up by a code of practice which would set out welfare standards. The regulations and code would be subject to public consultation and parliamentary scrutiny.</p>

	<p pid="a.160W.6/2">The value of commercial landings of bass by line gear used by the UK fleet was approximately &pound;354,000 in 2003. The proportion of this figure relating to landings in inshore waters is not available. Although a report by Drew Associates, commissioned by Defra, and published in July 2004, provided information on the economic contribution of sea angling in England and Wales, this did not provide information relating solely to bass so recent data on the value of this activity is not available. However, as part of the process of taking forward the recommendations in net benefits report from the Prime Minister's Strategy Unit, we will be reviewing the evidence for re-designating commercially caught species for wholly recreational sea angling, beginning with bass.</p>

	<p pid="a.161W.0/1">Defra-funded research identified a dolphin bycatch problem in the pair trawl fishery for bass and trials, which concluded in spring 2004, demonstrated that mitigation devices were not sufficiently developed to reduce this bycatch in the short-term. This was why I approached the European Commission for an emergency closure of this fishery and, in the light of the Commission's rejection of the UK case, announced my intention to prohibit pelagic pair trawling for bass within 12 miles of the south west coast.</p>
	<p pid="a.161W.0/2">When our request for an emergency closure was put to the Commission it was understood that the relevant population of common dolphins was approximately 120,000. More recent abundance estimates show however that the population is several times this figure. Although dolphin bycatch may not now be considered a significant threat to the conservation of the species, I intend to continue with bycatch reduction measures to comply with commitments to minimise bycatch and to reduce it to its lowest level.</p>

	<p pid="a.164W.0/2">We and our EU partners had two key objectives for the negotiations in Buenos Aires and both were successfully achieved. The Conference agreed to develop a work plan to address the adaptation needs of the developing countries most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. And the Conference, including the United States, also took the first step towards tackling the huge challenge of climate change beyond the 1st Kyoto Protocol commitment period, by deciding to hold an informal seminar next year which will discuss how we can continue to develop effective and appropriate responses to climate change.</p>

	<p pid="a.164W.3/1">The budgets are currently managed jointly as coastal processes affecting flood and erosion risks are hard to separate and such risks need to be managed together in many cases. We also see significant difficulties in separating budgets for river and sea flooding as all flood risks, including those arising in estuaries, need to be managed holistically and prioritised jointly. The Environment Agency, working though regional flood defence committees, leads in all flood risk management issues.</p>
	<p pid="a.164W.3/2">We have, however, recently consulted on a new Government strategy for flood and coastal erosion risk management in England, as part of which we are considering the future arrangements in coastal areas. We aim to publish a first response to this in spring 2005.</p>

	<p pid="a.170W.8/1">There were around 130 responses to consultation on the Bradley report, which closed at the beginning of October. A significant number of respondents argued that the Bradley recommendations should be taken forward alongside those made by the Strategy Unit in its report 'Net Benefits', which also made recommendations on the management of inshore fisheries. Many also emphasised the importance they placed on local and stakeholder input.</p>
	<p pid="a.170W.8/2">I agree with both these points, and have recently written to the Chairmen of Sea Fisheries Committees to advise them that I do not propose to make decisions about inshore management structures while a working group on which they are represented is considering the relevant Strategy Unit recommendations. Copies of the letters have been placed in the House Library.</p>

Therefore, there is no central record of warnings issued in cases where IT policy has been breached. Since Defra came into existence on <phrase class="date" code="2001-06-09">9 June 2001</phrase> six members of staff have faced disciplinary procedures for breaches of this policy.</p>

This is done by a variety of methods such as through system training programmes, published user guides and usage policies together with general security policy guidance and advice. This material is subject to regular review and is easily accessible through the Departmental Intranet. Regular Office Notices also provide reminders of key points.</p>

	<p pid="a.176W.5/1">Most emissions of nitrogen oxides (nitrogen dioxide and nitric oxide) at the point of release are nitric oxide. Under normal circumstances the emitted nitrogen monoxide rapidly reacts to form nitrogen dioxide. The National Atmospheric Emissions Inventory (NAEI) does not report separately emissions of nitrogen dioxide and nitric oxide.</p>
	<p pid="a.176W.5/2">Emissions of nitrogen oxides from road transport decreased by 45 per cent. between 1990 and 2002 from 1,295 to 711 kte. This is mainly as a result of the increase in the proportion of the vehicle fleet fitted with catalysts and improvements in the emissions of nitrogen oxides from diesel fuelled vehicles.</p>
	<p pid="a.176W.5/3">The Air Quality Expert Group (AQEG) reported in 2004 that there may have been an increase in the proportion of nitrogen dioxide emitted directly from the tailpipe of diesel vehicles as a result of increased diesel activity and the fitting of specific types of particle matter traps. AQEG's report can be viewed at <a href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/environment/airquality/ageg/nitrogen-dioxide/index.htm">http://www.defra.gov.uk/environment/airquality/ageg/nitrogen- dioxide/index.htm</a>.</p>
	<p pid="a.176W.5/4">Emissions of ammonia from road transport were only 4.2 per cent. of the national ammonia emission total in 2002. They had increased between 1990 and 2002 from 0.85 to 11.97 kte. The increase in ammonia releases from road transport is related to the growth in the number of vehicles fitted with three- way catalysts. These produce ammonia and nitrous oxide as a by-product of the catalytic process that reduces emissions of nitrogen oxides. Improvements in catalyst technology and engine management systems has reduced ammonia emissions in recent years. The NAEI reports ammonia emissions from road transport peaked in 2000 and are now starting to fall as these new vehicles penetrate the fleet. The NAEI can be viewed at <a href="http://www.naei.org.uk">http://www.naei.org.uk</a>.</p>
	<p pid="a.176W.5/5">Reduced emissions of nitrogen oxides from road transport reduces the ambient levels of nitrogen dioxide. This decreases the areas where air quality objectives are exceeded and reduces the detrimental health effects associated with high ambient levels of nitrogen dioxide. Increased primary emissions of nitrogen dioxide may have a significant impact on roadside nitrogen dioxide concentrations in areas where there is considerable diesel activity.</p>
	<p pid="a.176W.5/6">The consequences of the rise in emissions of ammonia from road transport are thought to be relatively slight. While there may, on occasion, be a detectable odour from some catalyst equipped cars. Emission of ammonia from road transport tend to occur mostly in urban locations, whereas the main ecological effects of ammonia occur to rural ecosystems.</p>

Regular meetings have been held to consult farmers and their representatives in advance of our decisions on implementation.

	<p pid="a.181W.5/1">Budget 2003 announced that, as part of the reform of the Landfill Tax Credit Scheme, approximately &pound;84/92/92 million had been allocated to the new Waste Implementation Programme (WIP) in England for the financial years 2003&ndash;04, 2004&ndash;05 and 2005&ndash;06. Currently, 80 people are employed by WIP, of which 55 work for the Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP), which is a key delivery agent for significant elements of the programme.</p>
	<p pid="a.181W.5/2">WIP has been very successful in prioritising close engagement with local authorities and the waste industry to create a stronger understanding of the opportunities and challenges that sustainable waste management presents, and to stimulate the development of essential expertise. Data from the latest Municipal Waste Management Survey show 14.5 per cent. of household waste was collected for recycling in 2002&ndash;03, up from 12.5 per cent. in 2001&ndash;02. Taking account of the growing contribution that WIP is making to improved performance by local authorities in meeting their statutory waste targets, the Government believes that the national 2003&ndash;04 target of 17 per cent. recycling or composting will now be met.</p>
	<p pid="a.181W.5/3">Specific achievements of the WIP programme include:</p>
	<p pid="a.181W.5/4" class="indent">the allocation of over &pound;100 million in challenge funding to local authorities, paving the way for new investment in recycling infrastructure, and approval of a number of major waste PFI projects capable of exceeding EU Landfill Directive targets;</p>
	<p pid="a.181W.5/5" class="indent">the launch of a new &pound;4 million programme of support for the voluntary and community waste sector, including help for the sector to develop meaningful partnerships with local government;</p>
	<p pid="a.181W.5/6" class="indent">the successful launch of a pilot scheme for new sustainable waste management technologies for dealing with those wastes which are not readily reduced, reused or recycled (with industry partners to take forward the development of the first phase of pilot plants now clearly identified);</p>
	<p pid="a.181W.5/7" class="indent">the award of &pound;1.36 million worth of funding for research focused on new ways to divert biodegradable municipal waste from landfill under a Technologies Research and Innovation Fund, which is part of WIP's New Technologies programme;</p>
	<p pid="a.181W.5/8" class="indent">publication of a new strategy for waste-related research, and the launch of a separate consultation on a 3-year strategy for better data on waste, to plug knowledge gaps across all waste streams;</p>
	<p pid="a.181W.5/9" class="indent">provision of extra funding to local authorities for specialist consultancy support&mdash;worth approximately &pound;3 million&mdash;to help in tackling specific local barriers to improved recycling performance. Nearly 300 authorities will receive support under this scheme;</p>
	<p pid="a.181W.5/10" class="indent">the launch of a new national recycling campaign, aimed at raising public awareness about recycling and pushing England's recycling rate to a higher level. WIP is also supporting over 100 local authority campaigns being delivered this year and in 2005, which are focused directly on increasing participation in local recycling facilities;</p>
	<p pid="a.181W.5/11" class="indent">ongoing delivery of a comprehensive and responsive programme of centrally co-ordinated support to local authorities that helps them to deliver their targets and other sustainable waste management objectives, including the launch of web-based advice and best practice guidance. Action at a local level is also being delivered through WRAP'S Recycling and Organics Technical Advisory Team, which provides a free advisory service to support English local authorities in the implementation and improvement of kerbside collection systems;</p>
	<p pid="a.181W.5/12" class="indent">delivery of a targeted home composting programme with selected local authority partners;</p>
	<p pid="a.181W.5/13" class="indent">the launch of a Waste Minimisation Innovation Fund, aimed at providing support for retailer-led innovation projects. The fund will provide resources (research, pilot programmes, professional services) for projects leading to a reduction in household food and packaging waste originating from the retail sector; and,</p>
	<p pid="a.181W.5/14" class="indent">providing increased support for local authorities to deliver around &pound;300 million worth of efficiency gains on waste services mainly by more effective joint working, promoting best practice, and standardisation of procurement operations.</p>

One of the main purposes of the draft regulations is to repeal the current exclusion in section 75(7)<i>(c)</i> of the Environmental Protection Act 1990 and to apply to agricultural waste the national controls that are already in place to comply with the Waste Framework Directive and the Landfill Directive. The consultation paper is available in the Library of the House and on my Department's website at <a href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/corporate/consult/agwaste-regs/index.htm">http://www.defra.gov.uk/corporate/consult/agwaste-regs/index.htm</a>.</p>
	<p pid="a.182W.5/2">Because agricultural waste is currently excluded from waste management controls the data requested are not available.

For those pesticides used in farming, there is additional general guidance on safe practices contained within the statutory Code of Practice for the Safe Use of Pesticides on Farms and Holdings.

	<p pid="a.187W.6/1">As part of the Government's commitment to modernising the adoption service, a number of changes have been introduced to improve the service from the perspective of adoptive parents by making it fairer, more transparent and more consistent.</p>
	<p pid="a.187W.6/2">National adoption standards were issued in August 2001 to ensure that looked after children, birth families, prospective adopters and the general public understand what they can expect from the adoption service.</p>
	<p pid="a.187W.6/3">The Adoption Register for England and Wales, which has been fully operational in England since April 2002, has been established as a tool for helping to match children in need of adoption with approved adopters.</p>
	<p pid="a.187W.6/4">The Independent Review Mechanism came into operation on <phrase class="date" code="2004-04-30">30 April 2004</phrase> and gives a prospective adopter the right to apply to an independent body for a review of their case if his adoption agency does not propose to approve him as suitable to be an adoptive parent.</p>
	<p pid="a.187W.6/5">In line with commitments made during the passage of the Adoption and Children Act 2002, a new national framework for adoption support services was implemented in October 2003, to encourage more people to adopt looked after children by helping to ensure the support that adoptive families need is available.</p>
	<p pid="a.187W.6/6">As promised in the White Paper, &quot;Adoption: a new approach&quot;, the Government undertook a fundamental review of the adopter assessment process and the operation of adoption panels. The review was informed by a Stakeholder Group of representatives from across the adoption field and the findings were the subject of a consultation document published on <phrase class="date" code="2002-10-08">8 October 2002</phrase>. Based on the responses to the consultation, the debates when the 2002 Act was before Parliament and the responses to the more recent consultation on draft regulations and supporting guidance on the adopter assessment process and the operation of adoption panels, the Government intends to make important changes to the way that prospective adopters are assessed and approved when the 2002 Act is implemented in full. This will enshrine the Government's commitment to remove perceived blanket bans so that every application to be approved as an adoptive parent will be judged entirely on its merits. The process of assessment, preparation and approval will be clearly set out in regulations, statutory guidance and practice guidance to ensure greater consistency across England and improved transparency for prospective adopters about the process.</p>
	<p pid="a.187W.6/7">In addition, when the Adoption and Children Act 2002 is implemented in full next year, unmarried couples will, for the first time, be able to apply to adopt jointly.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2005-01-10a.207479.r0" oldstyleid="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2005-01-10a.188W.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/965" speakername="Margaret Hodge" colnum="188W"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/vo050110/text/50110w53.htm#50110w53.html_spnew0">
	<p pid="a.188W.2/1">The Department has not made an assessment of applied behaviour analysis (ABA). The Department did publish a research report, compiled by the University of Birmingham, called &quot;Educational Interventions for Children with Autism: A Literature Review of Recent and Current Research&quot; in 1998. This found that almost all the interventions, including behavioural approaches, could point to evidence of success but that there was no well-founded evidence to show that any one approach was more effective than all the others nor which children on the autistic spectrum benefited most from which intervention. However, it did find that there were sufficiently positive findings across all studies of early intervention, including behavioural ones, to suggest that some form of early intervention is warranted.</p>
	<p pid="a.188W.2/2">The Code of Practice on Special Educational Needs (SEN) advises schools and local education authorities (LEAs) that children's needs should be assessed individually and that provision should address the particular needs of the individual child. The Department's &quot;Good Practice Guidance&quot; on autistic spectrum disorders lists ABA as one of the approaches that is available to schools and LEAs. The Inclusion Development Programme, announced as part of the Department's SEN strategy in February last year, will be looking at developing our evidence base about what works in educating children with ASDs, including evidence on ABA, and building a consensus about how to implement good practice most effectively.</p>

	<p pid="a.189W.5/1" class="holdinganswer">holding answer <phrase class="date" code="2004-12-20">20 December 2004</phrase></p>
	<p pid="a.189W.5/2">Since its inception in 2001, the Department for Education and Skills has kept under review the support it provides for young people aged 13 to 19 with the aim of ensuring that that support meets young people's current and anticipated needs.</p>
	<p pid="a.189W.5/3">Within its current areas of responsibility there have been a number of projects and initiatives intended to help young people which have begun since 1997 and which have become part of our mainstream provision. Quality Protects, launched in 1998 by the Department of Health as part of the Government's wider strategy for tackling social exclusion, focused on children and young people looked after by councils, in the child protection system, and other children in need. The programme transferred to the Department for Education and Skills as part of the machinery of Government changes in 2003. The original provision of three years had already been extended to five years, with the programme being mainstreamed from 2004. The Young Runaways Development Project, for which the Children and Young People's Unit provided funding in 2002&ndash;03 and 2003&ndash;04, transferred to DfES and has now ended. Both programmes demonstrated effective ways of meeting the needs of children and young people which are enshrined in the Children Act 2004 and the Every Child Matters: Change for Children programme, launched on <phrase class="date" code="">1 December</phrase>, and which have introduced, among other provision, a statutory duty to promote the education and wellbeing of looked after children, a statutory duty on organisations working with children and young people to safeguard them and promote their welfare, and children's trust arrangements to focus integrated, multi-disciplinary support on the needs of children and young people. Similarly, Active Citizens in Schools, an award scheme that empowers young people to get involved in projects that benefit the school and wider community, ran as a pilot project from Spring 2002 until September 2004, and is now being made available to schools nationally through a Framework and Toolkit funded by DfES. Schools can then adapt the scheme to fit their needs.</p>
	<p pid="a.189W.5/4">Other projects and initiatives have ended as they have been subsumed within other programmes: Connexions Summer Plus, which became part of the anti-crime Positive Activities for Young People programme; and New Start, which paved the way for Learning Gateway which evolved into Entry to Employment (E2E), the work-based programme for young people aged 16&ndash;18 not yet ready or able to enter an apprenticeship, sustained employment or further vocational learning opportunities.</p>

	<p pid="a.190W.2/1">The Family Resolutions Pilot Project is designed to test the effectiveness of group work and information and parent planning measures in helping separating or separated parents reach agreement about contact and residence for their children, without needing formal family court proceedings. The Family Resolutions Pilot Project does not replace any other &quot;Early Interventions project&quot;. However, its development has been informed by a set of early intervention proposals that were received by the Government in autumn 2003, which had been drawn up by an ad hoc group, chaired by a judge. The Government-led Steering Group, set up to take forward the development and delivery of a pilot project, chose the name of the project, in recognition of the focus of the intervention and the late stage in the separation of the parents at which it would take place.</p>
	<p pid="a.190W.2/2">The design of the Government's Family Resolutions Pilot Project drew on the experience of a range of similar approaches from other jurisdictions, in particular Florida, but also Scandinavia, California and Canada. However, the Florida early interventions approach differs from the Family Resolutions Pilot Project in that participation is compulsory in the Florida jurisdiction. Participation in the Family Resolutions Pilot Project could only have been made compulsory if there had first been a change in primary legislation. This would also have been necessary if we had wished to replicate the approach of other jurisdictions, in terms of any legal presumption of contact for parents and in terms of any expectation that parents must adhere to a prescribed pattern of contact, drawn from standard templates applied by the court.</p>
	<p pid="a.190W.2/3">Under the Children Act 1984 the welfare of the child is the court's paramount consideration when determining any question with respect to a child's upbringing. Case law decided under the Children Act 1989 has established that it is generally in a child's best interests to have contact with both of his parents but there is no statutory presumption of contact nor does the Children Act provide standard patterns of contact to be prescribed to parents by the court. The Parenting Plans, which we are currently revising, will provide a set of templates which seek to show in practice the sort of contact arrangements that work well for children of different ages and circumstances. These will be available at all points throughout the system&mdash;in solicitors' offices as well as through advice and mediation services. They will make clear, in practical terms, arrangements that are generally beneficial for children. They are intended to be used as practical aids, both by parents themselves as well as by solicitors, conciliators and mediators, to assist parents to reach reasonable agreements. They will seek to illustrate what the courts might well decide if the case went to a full hearing. The revised Plans will shortly be published in draft form and will be the subject of consultation. Once published in final form, they will be used in both in-court conciliation services and the Family Resolutions Pilot Project.</p>

	<p pid="a.194W.6/1">Homophobic bullying, as with any other form of bullying, cannot be tolerated and we must challenge homophobic language and attitudes wherever we find them and support our children and young people to do the same.</p>
	<p pid="a.194W.6/2">In November 2004, we organised the first ever National Anti-Bullying Week, in conjunction with the Anti-Bullying Alliance (ABA), which had a strong emphasis on combating homophobic bullying. During the week, my predecessor attended the 5th birthday celebration of the Diana Princess of Wales Memorial Award for Young People, where he announced a new Diana Anti-Bullying Award, for which we have given funding of &pound;50,000. At this event, he also launched new guidance for schools entitled &quot;Stand Up for Us: Challenging Homophobia in Schools&quot; which was prepared by the National Healthy Schools Standard with considerable input from the Department. Stand Up For Us sets out a practical approach for schools to quickly assess the scale of homophobic bullying they face. And it offers practical steps schools can take to create an environment where everyone can feel welcome and valued and where specific instances of bullying are identified, challenged and dealt with effectively.</p>
	<p pid="a.194W.6/3">During anti-bullying week, we also published &quot;Homophobia, Sexual Orientation and Schools: a review and implications for action&quot;. This review, by the Thomas Coram Research Unit, looks at three areas: behaviour and bullying; teaching and learning about sexual orientation and relationships; and employment issues. It collates, summarises and assesses both peer reviewed research material, from this country and abroad, and less formal work conducted by bodies active in this area. It also reports the views of a wide range of organisations, 28 in all, with an interest in this area to paint a picture of how the issues are currently perceived. The report is available on the DfES website <a href="http://www.dfes.gov.uk/research">http://www.dfes.gov.uk/research</a> and the findings will be used to inform future work in this area.</p>
	<p pid="a.194W.6/4">The Department's work in this critical area is ongoing and we are currently supporting Schools Out in promoting the first Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender (LGBT) History Month in February 2005, and have funded the development of a website which will raise awareness and encourage participation. It will suggest activities and events that schools, colleges, universities, libraries, museums, galleries, archives, and theatres can organise and offers teachers specific lesson plans and assembly suggestions to encourage and support schools in marking LGBT History Month. It will also provide an online notice board of events and link to current news relevant to LGBT History Month. See more at <a href="http://www.lgbthistorymonth.org.uk">http://www.lgbthistorymonth.org.uk</a>.</p>
	<p pid="a.194W.6/5">The Department has provided a further &pound;600,000 to the Anti-Bullying Alliance to sustain the momentum for change. The Alliance will link with the work of the Department and join up with the key national strategies to work with schools and local education authorities to promote anti-bullying best practice across all schools, including countering homophobic bullying.</p>

This includes deciding on the mix and balance between what is delivered within and outside of the curriculum. Guidance published by the Department for Education and Skills and the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority recommends that 75 minutes per week is required to deliver the physical education programme of study at Key Stages 1 and 2 effectively, and 90 minutes per week at Key Stage 3. At Key Stage 4 the focus is on health, fitness and wellbeing. Our ambition, by 2010, is that all children will be offered at least four hours of sport every week. This will comprise at least two hours of high quality physical education and sport at school and at least a further two-three hours of sport beyond the school day (delivered by a range of school, community and club providers). The expectation is that by 2010 schools will be delivering the two hours of high quality PE and sport at school entirely within the curriculum.</p>

	<p pid="a.199W.5/2">Science is part of the National Curriculum at Key Stage 4 (GCSE). This means that all students are required to study it unless the subject has been disapplied to enable extended work related learning. In the Government's 10 Year Science and Innovation Investment Framework, we outlined how we would increase the number of young people studying science at A level by improving science teaching, making additional incentives available to get more top quality graduates to train to be science teachers. These include increasing the value of the teacher training bursary for science graduates from &pound;6,000 to &pound;7,000 from September 2005 and raising the 'Golden Hello' for new science teachers from &pound;4,000 to &pound;5,000 for trainees entering PGCE and equivalent courses from September 2005. It is generally for universities to decide whether to offer incentives for students to study particular subjects. In the 10 Year Science and Innovation Investment Framework, we said that the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) would provide support to universities, industry and scientific societies in their science outreach activities to schools and colleges.. From 2006&ndash;07, the Institute of Physics plans to introduce a means-tested bursary scheme for students who study physics at university.</p>

	<p pid="a.200W.2/3" class="indent">access to quality information and advice material, made available through solicitors, mediators, by telephone and on websites to help parents to arrive at agreed and practicable contact and residence arrangements in the interests of the child without recourse to the courts;</p>
	<p pid="a.200W.2/4" class="indent">a telephone helpline, providing general legal advice on the implications of relationship breakdown;</p>
	<p pid="a.200W.2/5" class="indent">the development of Parenting Plans&mdash;a set of templates which seek to show in practice the sort of contact arrangements that work well for children of different ages and circumstances. These will be available at all points throughout the system&mdash;in solicitors' offices as well as through advice and mediation services. They will make clear, in practical terms, arrangements that are generally beneficial for children. They are intended to be used as practical aids, both by parents themselves as well as by solicitors, conciliators and mediators, to assist parents to reach reasonable agreements. They will seek to illustrate what the courts might well decide if the case went to a full hearing;</p>
	<p pid="a.200W.2/6" class="indent">change family legal aid to promote conciliation in the interests of the child;</p>
	<p pid="a.200W.2/7" class="indent">through the relevant professional bodies, improve accreditation for solicitors providing advice on family matters concerning children;</p>
	<p pid="a.200W.2/8" class="indent">pilot the use of collaborative law where both parents' lawyers are committed to promoting settlements without going to court;</p>
	<p pid="a.200W.2/9" class="indent">provide greater encouragement for parents to participate in family mediation that can provide an alternative to court based resolution;</p>
	<p pid="a.200W.2/10" class="indent">promote in-court conciliation and mediation services throughout the courts;</p>
	<p pid="a.200W.2/11" class="indent">development a more intensive set of interventions for more difficult cases, which seek to shift the &quot;behaviour&quot; of parents who are in dispute through understanding that their child needs and benefits from a continuing relationship with both parents, through the Family Resolutions Pilot Project, currently being piloted in three areas. It uses a video, group discussions and parent planning sessions, spread across at least three separate sessions, undertaken under the direction and authority of the court, but seeking to avoid, as far as possible, a full formal court hearing;</p>
	<p pid="a.200W.2/12" class="indent">support CAFCASS to direct resources to out of court settlements and to help parents implement their agreements;</p>
	<p pid="a.200W.2/13" class="indent">improve case management by the courts, through the earlier listing of cases, with a rapid return to court where needed, with cases being considered throughout by the same judge; and</p>
	<p pid="a.200W.2/14" class="indent">provide courts with a more flexible range of levers to promote settlements and to enforce contact orders by, for example, referring parties to specialist parenting or community based programmes or through the awarding of financial compensation where the defaulting parent has caused loss to the other parent.</p>
	<p pid="a.200W.2/15">We are currently reviewing the responses to the consultation in the Green Paper.</p>

	<p pid="a.206W.2/1">The General Sure Start Grant includes all funds made available to local authorities from the Sure Start budget with the exception of those to support local Sure Start programmes. Local authorities are required to use General Sure Start Grant funds to meet specific objectives and targets set for them by the Sure Start Unit.</p>
	<p pid="a.206W.2/2">Although schools have no specific entitlement, it is open to local authorities to allocate Sure Start funds to local schools where they consider it meets objectives. Schools in the Vale of York could potentially have access to funding related to the development of extended schools (from 2005&ndash;06) and revenue grant funding for the provision of breakfast and out of school clubs.</p>
	<p pid="a.206W.2/3">Local authorities are also encouraged to develop children's centres for families with children aged 0&ndash;5 years on school sites and can allocate funds to schools to achieve that. However, such funding is only currently available in areas&mdash;unlike the Vale of York&mdash;which are considered to be disadvantaged.</p>
	<p pid="a.206W.2/4">In December 2004 the Government published &quot;Choice for parents, the best start for children: a ten year strategy for childcare&quot;. That set out our vision for the future, whereby all families&mdash;in the Vale of York, as elsewhere&mdash;with children aged up to 14 and who need it will have an affordable, flexible, high quality child care place between the hours of eight and six, all year round. We have also said that we intend all schools to become extended schools over time and funding will be made available to all local authorities to support that.</p>

	<p pid="a.212W.3/1">The information is not available in the form requested.</p>
	<p pid="a.212W.3/2">In the Teacher Supply Model&mdash;used to inform decisions on the number of places to make available in Initial Teacher Training&mdash;we take into account teachers leaving the profession through both general wastage and retirement. If we consider total wastage (including any form of retirement) of teachers aged 50 and over, as a percentage of the teacher workforce in maintained nursery, primary and secondary schools, then&mdash;under the central scenario modelled&mdash;this rate rises from 3.7 per cent. in 2002&ndash;03 to 5.0 per cent. in 2007&ndash;08, and then falls slightly to around 4 per cent. in 2012&ndash;13. It should be noted that these figures become progressively more uncertain the further ahead they are modelled. The modelling assumptions are reviewed annually.</p>
	<p pid="a.212W.3/3">Proposed changes to the Teachers' Pension Scheme that will apply to all scheme members by 2013 are aimed at giving teachers much more choice and flexibility about the ways in which they manage the transition from work to retirement. We expect that teachers will welcome a more flexible approach that will enable them to move more gradually from work to retirement than is possible under current arrangements.</p>

The report of the independent inquiry into local government funding by Sir Michael Lyons will inform the Government's decisions on council tax bands. This report is due to be submitted by the end of this year to my right hon. Friends the Deputy Prime Minister and the Chancellor of the Exchequer. The Government have already made clear that the revaluation should not lead to a change in the overall council tax yield. There will be a transitional relief scheme to help taxpayers whose properties move to a higher band. Council tax benefit will continue to be available to help those on low incomes with their council tax payments.</p>

	<p pid="a.220W.8/1">For 2004&ndash;05, Derbyshire Fire and Rescue Authority (FRA) received &pound;17.542 million in Formula Grant. For FRAs Formula Grant is equal to the sum of Redistributed Business Rates and Revenue Support Grant. Derbyshire FRA is a combined fire authority which gained major precepting status in 2004&ndash;05. Previously, funding was received from the constituent authorities of Derbyshire county council and Derby city council. Formula Grant for these constituent authorities included provision for education, personal social services, highways maintenance and environmental, protective and cultural services as well as fire services and capital expenditure. As there are no restrictions on local authority decisions to spend Formula Grant it is not possible to say how much Formula Grant was made available for Derbyshire FRA in these years. For the purposes of calculating the 2004&ndash;05 figure, an indicative amount was calculated to show what would have happened in 2003&ndash;04 if Derbyshire FRA had been a major preceptor at that time. This amount was calculated to be &pound;16.706 million, however this is an indicative amount only.</p>
	<p pid="a.220W.8/2">For 2004&ndash;05 Derbyshire FRA also received &pound;0.456 million transitional funding in recognition that there may be a lag between costs and savings of fire and rescue service modernisation.</p>
	<p pid="a.220W.8/3">For 2004&ndash;05 Derbyshire FRA received &pound;0.875 million in Supported Capital Expenditure (Revenue). It received &pound;0.815 million basic credit approvals in 2003&ndash;04, &pound;0.873 million in 2002&ndash;03, &pound;0.727 million in 2001&ndash;02 and &pound;0.727 million in 2000&ndash;01.</p>
	<p pid="a.220W.8/4">In 2004&ndash;05 Derbyshire FRA received grants of &pound;50,544 from the Community Fire Safety (CFS) Innovation Fund and &pound;95,642 capital to establish a programme of Home Fire Risk Checks targeted on the most vulnerable households and combined with installation of free 10 year smoke alarms and, where justified, automated fire suppression systems. It also received &pound;33,796 from the Arson Control Forum Innovation Fund in 2001&ndash;02.</p>
	<p pid="a.220W.8/5">According to the provisional local government finance settlement for 2005&ndash;06 Derbyshire FRA will receive &pound;18.520 million formula grant, a 5.6 per cent. increase on 2004&ndash;05, and &pound;0.882 million SCE(R). It is also due to receive a further &pound;50,544 from the CFS Innovation Fund and &pound;95,642 capital grant for Home Fire Risk Checks.</p>

	<p pid="a.224W.5/1">It remains Government policy, as set out in the White Paper &quot;Our Fire and Rescue Service&quot;, that union participation in negotiating arrangements for the Fire and Rescue Service should be widened. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister hopes that voluntary reforms will achieve this and it is understood that negotiations about voluntary reform are continuing. However, the Government have taken reserve powers under the Fire and Rescue Services Act 2004 which would enable them to set up new statutory arrangements if voluntary reforms do not result in improvement.</p>

	<p pid="a.226W.3/21">Some of the households in temporary accommodation were being accommodated pending completion of enquiries into their application, or awaiting the outcome of an local authority review/county court appeal against the authority's decision, or had been found intentionally homeless and subsequently were being accommodated for a reasonable period as permitted under legislation. The latest quarterly Statistical Release on statutory homelessness, published by the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister on <phrase class="date" code="">13 December</phrase>, presents analyses up to the end of the third quarter of 2004. Information on decisions, and households in temporary accommodation, at local authority level is contained in an associated Supplementary Table. These have been made available in the Library of the House, and via the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister's website.</p>

	<p pid="a.228W.2/1">The Government take the issue of violent crime and the impact it has on people's lives very seriously, this includes those who are homeless. That is why we have introduced a number of measures to tackle violent crime, including violence in the streets, and are continuing to do so.</p>
	<p pid="a.228W.2/2">Examples of these measures include:</p>
	<p pid="a.228W.2/3" class="indent">Concerted action against street robbery achieving falls of 24 per cent. in the priority areas over the first two years of the Street Crime Initiative.</p>
	<p pid="a.228W.2/4" class="indent">Tackling low-level thuggery through measures to reduce alcohol-related crime and antisocial behaviour.</p>

	<p pid="a.228W.2/6" class="indent">Tackling Violent Crime Programme(a programme to help local areas reduce violent crime and improve local partnership working, which was launched in November in six police force areas who are already delivering solutions to violent crime.</p>

Rough sleeping has been reduced by over 70 per cent. since 1998, and these reductions have been sustained. Rough sleeping is now at its lowest recorded level.</p>

	<p pid="a.229W.2/1">The Government is committed to tackling homelessness and has successfully tackled the worst manifestations of homelessness&mdash;rough sleeping and the long term use of B and B hotels for homeless families with children. We have invested &pound;260 million over three years to 2005&ndash;06. This is helping local authorities and voluntary sector agencies to deliver front-line services and take forward initiatives to develop effective preventive measures.</p>
	<p pid="a.229W.2/2">Other investments include &pound;150 million revenue and capital funding to support local authorities implement their homelessness strategies and to take forward a new hostel improvement programme that will help to improve and re-design front-line services to help rough sleepers away from the streets; &pound;1.716 billion for Supporting People for 2005&ndash;06, with a further &pound;1.7 billion for 2006&ndash;07 and &pound;1.7 billion for 2007&ndash;08 and an increase in the supply of new social housing by 50 per cent. by 2008 which together with support for homelessness prevention initiatives will turn around the growth in homelessness by 2008.</p>
	<p pid="a.229W.2/3">The Homelessness and Housing Support Directorate within the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister works closely with local authorities and voluntary sector agencies (including housing associations), providing them with technical and financial support.</p>
	<p pid="a.229W.2/4">In relation to accessing housing, local housing authorities have a statutory obligation to ensure that suitable accommodation is available for applicants who are eligible for assistance, have become homeless through no fault of their own, and who fall within a priority need group (this is the 'main homelessness duty'). The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister has strengthened the statutory protection available to people who become homeless through the Homelessness Act 2002 and widened the categories of vulnerable people in priority need, who authorities must help. In addition, under the 1996 Housing Act local authorities are required to give reasonable preference for certain groups of people when framing their allocations policy. This includes people who are homeless.</p>
	<p pid="a.229W.2/5">Applicants who do not have priority need or who have made themselves homeless intentionally must be assisted by the local authority with any efforts they make to secure accommodation for themselves. Applicants can also seek advice from their local housing advice centre or Citizen's Advice Bureau.</p>
	<p pid="a.229W.2/6">The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister funds the National Homelessness Advice Service (NHAS). NHAS has been supported by Government since it was established in 1990. It is a partnership between Shelter and Citizen's Advice (formerly NACAB) to ensure that everyone has access to good quality advice on homelessness and related issues through their local Citizens Advice Bureau&mdash;more recently this has also been extended to some independent advice centres.</p>
	<p pid="a.229W.2/7">The Homelessness Act 2002 required every local authority to have a strategy in place by July 2003 to ensure that accommodation and support are available for homeless households and those at risk of homelessness.</p>
	<p pid="a.229W.2/8">In November 2004, the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister published an evaluation of 'Local Authorities' Homelessness Strategies'. It was carried out by Housing Quality Network Services (HQNS) between February and July 2004, on behalf of the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister.</p>
	<p pid="a.229W.2/9">The evaluation reports a positive response to the process of producing and adopting these reviews and strategies. The full report and the summary can be obtained via the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister's website at: <a href="http://www.odpm.gov.uk/stellent/groups/odpm_control/documents/contentservertemplate/odpm_index">http://www.odpm.gov.uk/stellent/groups/odpm_control/documents/contentservertemplate/odpm_index</a>.hcst?n=5500&amp;l=3</p>

	<p pid="a.235W.9/1">There has been no change in the way we calculate the personal social services formulae spending shares (PSS FSS) in 2005&ndash;06. FSS is used to distribute formula grant to councils. The older peoples PSS FSS formulae directs extra resources to authorities with higher than average elderly populations in two ways. Firstly, the formulae allocates a basic amount per person aged 65 or over in each local council area. Secondly, through its age top up, the formulae allocates extra resources to areas with higher proportions of very old people.</p>
	<p pid="a.235W.9/2">There have been changes in the amounts distributed through two Department of Health specific grants, namely those for Preserved Rights and for Residential Allowances. We have listened to local authority concerns about the effect of transferring the majority of the Preserved Rights grant into FSS, originally announced as part of the SR2002 settlement. In co-operation with local authorities, we have agreed an alternative funding mechanism that minimises any adverse distributional impact, and which is based on the premise that a lower proportion of the Preserved Rights Grant will be transferred into the FSS.</p>
	<p pid="a.235W.9/3">In 2005&ndash;06 the Preserved Rights Grant will be funded at &pound;348 million instead of the &pound;133 million announced in SR2002. The Residential Allowance grant will transfer into FSS more quickly. The method of allocating the Preserved Rights and Residential Allowance Grants to local authorities in 2005&ndash;06 is unchanged. This will mean less turbulence for local authority funding. We have made corresponding adjustments to the base for allocations to councils of formula grant in 2005&ndash;06.</p>

The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister cannot therefore put meaningful figures and dates on these requirements at this time.</p>
	<p pid="a.238W.0/3">I can, however, assure the hon. Member that it is the policy of this Government to ensure that future development is plan led and as such is served by services and infrastructure.</p>

	<p pid="a.239W.9/1">The Northern Ireland Office 2004 Autumn Performance Report was printed by The Stationery Office (TSO). Costs of printing and publication are met directly by TSO and do not fall to Government. The NIO is invoiced only for the 190 copies it requested. An additional cost was incurred this year on design and artwork on the report prior to printing. Overall the cost to the NIO of producing the Autumn Performance Report 2004 was slightly over &pound;5,000.</p>
	<p pid="a.239W.9/2">To date the NIO has distributed around 160 copies to a range of Government agencies and public representatives, including the Northern Ireland Members of Parliament, HM Treasury and Northern Ireland Select Committees. Distribution is almost entirely carried out by the government messenger service: details of the cost would be disproportionately expensive to obtain, but it is believed to be minimal. The Stationery Office has its own distribution arrangements.</p>

	<p pid="a.244W.5/1">The document Ending Fuel Poverty: A Strategy for Northern Ireland sets out a target of eradicating fuel poverty in Northern Ireland in all vulnerable households and the social rented sector by 2010 and in non-vulnerable households by 2016. The commitment to achieving these targets is no less simply because they are not set in legislation, and this commitment is evidenced by their inclusion in public service agreements which are, and will continue to be, publicly monitored.</p>
	<p pid="a.244W.5/2">The strategy provides for a ministerial group on fuel poverty but I believe that such an arrangement is better suited to a devolved administration.

	<p pid="a.244W.5/3">Government are determined to eradicate fuel poverty but recognise that budgets are finite and there are many competing priorities. It is vital, therefore, that the most vulnerable in our society are tackled first. To widen the eligibility criteria under the warm homes scheme would divert resources from those in greatest need. However, the qualifying criterion for the warm homes scheme has been revised to include the new tax credits and pension credit to ensure that as many vulnerable people as possible can benefit from the scheme.</p>

	<p pid="a.247W.5/2">The new agenda in the Housing Executive's homelessness strategy places a stronger emphasis on dealing with the personal and social causes of homelessness. In November 2004, a review group comprising representatives of Government Departments, statutory agencies and the voluntary sector supported by the Department for Social Development published a consultation paper entitled &quot;Promoting the Social Inclusion of Homeless People&quot;. The aim of the consultation is to identify ways in which Government and other agencies can work together to make their services accessible to people who are homeless or who are threatened with homelessness.</p>

However, the Housing Executive's records show that, during the period 2003&ndash;04, 3,118 of those accepted as homeless in Northern Ireland were single parent households (ie 36.28 per cent. of the total accepted as homeless). While a gender breakdown of those single parents is not readily available, it is known that all but a very few were female.</p>

However, a survey early this year indicated that, while there are between 20 and 30 frequent users of Housing Executive-funded outreach services, no more than 10 people are sleeping rough on any given night (all in Belfast). It has been established that the majority of rough sleepers have alcohol dependency problems and there is also evidence that misuse of drugs is increasing within this group.</p>

	<p pid="a.255W.2/1">The number of nurse endoscopists in Northern Ireland is relatively small. Where a Trust has identified the need to develop the role as part of their endoscopy service, support to undertake the relevant training outside of Northern Ireland has been provided. As the demand for endoscopy services increases, consideration will be given to the viability of establishing a local specialist practice course.</p>
	<p pid="a.255W.2/2">One of the DHSSPS funded re-design of community nursing projects is currently exploring the primary and secondary care interface with a view to the primary care based stoma nurse undertaking training to become a nurse endoscopist.</p>
	<p pid="a.255W.2/3">The recommendations arising from the Independent Review of Endoscopes and the DHSSPS Cancer Services Framework, which is currently under development, will also be explored in relation to the further development of the Nurse Endoscopist role.</p>

	<p pid="a.258W.9/1">The Department has not issued guidance specifically on the management of patients with slightly elevated PSA levels. However CMO Update No. 25, which was issued to all GPs in November 2003, contained information about prostate cancer screening. This emphasised that anyone who requested a PSA test should be informed about the probable benefits and harm of the PSA test, and gave details of where to find information developed by the Prostate Cancer Risk Management Programme.</p>
	<p pid="a.258W.9/2">Depending on the outcome of the test, the person's GP will advise them on what happens next. In the case of a raised PSA level, this may include further tests or referral to a specialist for investigation.</p>

	<p pid="a.259W.8/1">Under Local Management of Schools arrangements, decisions on the employment of teachers and support staff are for Boards of Governors to take in light of their particular circumstances including, in particular, the number of pupils at the school and their educational and social needs. My proposals for a common funding scheme for all schools are designed to ensure that schools with similar characteristics are funded consistently and equitably regardless of their geographical location. I expect that the majority of schools will see increases in their budgets as a result of the move from seven separate Local Management of Schools (LMS) funding schemes to the new common funding arrangements.</p>
	<p pid="a.259W.8/2">However, I am concerned to ensure that the impact of any budget changes arising from the introduction of common funding is managed in a way that minimises disruption to both staff and pupils. That is why the move to common funding will be phased over a transitional period in order to allow schools sufficient time to adjust, particularly those schools which may see a decrease in funding</p>

	<p pid="a.264W.6/1">The contract with Anne's Gate Property plc included the selection and provision of task chairs by the developer. It required that the chairs would:</p>

	<p pid="a.264W.6/5">From a short list of seven, the award winning Herman Miller Mirra model was chosen in a two stage process after consultation with the Department including the staff User Group.</p>
	<p pid="a.264W.6/6">The price paid by the developer to the supplier is confidential under the terms of the agreement between them. It took account of the extended warranty period and long-term maintenance costs. The developer decided that for the price paid the Mirra chairs represented the best value for money to deliver their commitment, at their cost risk, to provide and maintain office furniture for the 26 year operating period of the PFI contract.</p>

The indicative cost of the demolition provided by AGP was approximately &pound;18.8 million (March 2002 prices) but the actual cost incurred by them is commercially confidential.</p>

This is one of the purposes for which such use may be licensed under the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986, and is to meet the requirements of national and international regulatory bodies.</p>
	<p pid="a.267W.5/2">Justification and assessments of applications for licences to undertake such work are on a case-by case basis. Each application has to be approved locally by an ethical review process before being submitted to the Home Office for decision, the whole process being designed to ensure that any animal testing is licensed only after it is deemed to be justified and the related animal suffering minimised.</p>
	<p pid="a.267W.5/3">A form of cost benefit assessment of each individual programme of work has to be undertaken before the Home Office can consider granting the necessary licence. This means that the likely benefits of the work&mdash;in terms of generating data for the purposes of risk assessment&mdash;must be balanced against the expected welfare costs to the animals involved. No animal testing is licensed without an expert judgment being made on that basis. More information about the statutory cost benefit assessment used in these and all other cases can be found at Appendix I of Guidance on the Operation of the 1986 Act (HC 321).</p>
	<p pid="a.267W.5/4">The 1986 Act additionally provides that animal testing can be licensed only if there are no non-animal alternatives and, where animals must be used, their numbers and suffering are to be minimised. This means that any animal testing judged to be necessary must involve the mildest available procedures for the purpose. Where more severe procedures are unavoidable&mdash;and it is unlikely procedures of substantial severity would be needed to test household products&mdash;they must be replaced by milder methods as soon as they are validated and then accepted by the regulatory bodies concerned. On the same basis, no animal testing can be authorised once non-animal replacements are developed and generally accepted. These constraints are reflected in a standard condition of project licences, compliance with which is monitored by the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Inspectorate.</p>
	<p pid="a.267W.5/5">The information requested about the number of toxicity test procedures is contained in Table 25 of the annual publication &quot;Statistics of Scientific Procedures on Living Animals, Great Britain, 2003&quot;, and Table 12 of each annual publication of &quot;Statistics of Scientific Procedures on Living Animals, Northern Ireland&quot;, copies of which are in the Library.</p>
	<p pid="a.267W.5/6">I should add more generally that the Government recognise that there are concerns about this issue and are not complacent about it. We have regular discussions with the UK regulators concerned, and take a leading role in Europe in encouraging the development and adoption of alternatives to all forms of animal use in science. In May 2004 we established the National Centre for the Replacement, Refinement and Reduction of Animals in Research (NC3Rs), which will also be working with regulators on the acceptance of alternative methods for regulatory toxicology.</p>

Copies of the publications for 2001, 2002 and 2003 can be found in the House Library (Cm 5581, Cm 5886 and Cm 6291 respectively).</p>
	<p pid="a.269W.2/2">These publications show that 601 project licences were granted in Great Britain in 2001 under the 1986 Act. The corresponding figures for 2002 and 2003 (the latest available published data) were 695 and 774 respectively.</p>
	<p pid="a.269W.2/3">Each year licences expire or are revoked, as well as granted.

	<p pid="a.277W.3/1">The Facial Images National Database (FIND) project currently being undertaken by the Police Information Technology Organisation (PITO) is aiming to deliver a nationally available &quot;mugshot&quot; database of facial images, linked to the respective PNC records, in 2006. One key element of this project involves providing guidance to police forces on image capture standards in order to ensure that the database is populated with the best possible images.</p>
	<p pid="a.277W.3/2">Face recognition systems, with current technology, are most effective when used for &quot;one to one&quot; matching, for example to help verify that an individual is who they claim to be. Despite significant advances in the last few years, the technology still has some way to go before it is capable of reliably performing &quot;face in the crowd&quot; type searches against either a large database or a smaller &quot;watch-list&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.277W.3/3">Post-event analysis is an example of a promising area for the use for facial recognition technology. The facial recognition element of the victim-focused work with regards to child abuse images being undertaken by the National Crime Squad is proving very successful in identifying victims and perpetrators of child sexual abuse and in identifying links between cases.</p>
	<p pid="a.277W.3/4">A number of direct law enforcement applications have been implemented, including the London borough of Newham partnership with the Metropolitan Police to provide facial recognition as part of a town centre protection application.</p>
	<p pid="a.277W.3/5">PITO continues to maintain close links with both industry and academia regarding developments in this field, and are also undertaking a programme of work to evaluate the current potential for this technology in a variety of policing applications.</p>

	<p pid="a.278W.0/1">Under Section 6(1) (section 6(2) if married to a British citizen) of the British Nationality Act 1981 applicants for naturalisation must meet, among other things, a number of residence requirements which are detailed in Schedule 1, paragraph 1 (2) of the Act.</p>
	<p pid="a.278W.0/2">The residence requirements include five years residence in the UK immediately prior to application (three if married to a British citizen) and a mandatory requirement to have been physically in the UK on the actual date five years (three if married to a British citizen) prior to the date of application. There is no discretion to waive the requirement to have been physically present in the UK at the start of the five year qualifying period (three years if married to a British citizen) where an application is being made on the basis of residence.</p>
	<p pid="a.278W.0/3">These requirements have not been amended and have been applied consistently since the Act came into force on <phrase class="date" code="1983-01-01">1 January 1983</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.278W.0/4">There is scope under the Act for Crown Service overseas, on the date of application for citizenship, to act as an alternative to the residence criteria outlined above, (Schedule 1 paragraph 1(3) of the Act). However the Home Office applies very strict criteria in such cases and very few applications are ever granted on this basis. Examples of cases we have approved include applicants who had more than 20 years Crown service with British embassies, at pro- and vice-consul level and their applications were supported by current and previous ambassadors.</p>
	<p pid="a.278W.0/5">In line with the recent review into the Home Office immigration and naturalisation policy for Gurkhas, the policy for naturalisation for all servicemen has been changed. We will, generally, no longer naturalise a member of the armed forces while they are still in service. Once discharged, ex-servicemen who have served four or more years in the armed forces will be eligible to apply for settled status. Once settled they will be free to live and work in the UK indefinitely and will be able to apply for naturalisation, subject to meeting the usual residence requirements. The new policy takes account of the potential high levels of absences that ex-servicemen may have and will enable these to be waived in most cases.</p>
	<p pid="a.278W.0/6">Our policy on applications made under the Crown Service arrangements has not changed as a result of the review; we will continue to apply the same strict criteria in these cases.</p>

	<p pid="a.279W.2/1">The judgment of the Administrative Court in R (on the application of the Howard League for Penal Reform) <i>v</i>. Secretary of State for the Home Department and Another clarified the law in relation to young people in custody. The court ruled that local authorities continue to have responsibilities towards children who are detained in young offender institutions, subject to the requirements of custody. The Home Office, the Youth Justice Board and the Department for Education and Skills have taken a range of measures to implement that ruling and also to strengthen child protection and safeguarding generally for young people in custody. Most notably, the board is funding the provision of 25 new social worker posts in Young Offender Institutions.</p>
	<p pid="a.279W.2/2">Although the judgment related specifically to children in young offender institutions, the Government accept that its general principles would apply in the context of children detained under Immigration Act powers. The Immigration and Nationality Directorate is meeting the broad principles set out in the judgment to the extent that it is possible for it to do so in the context of immigration detention and the removal of failed asylum seekers and others.</p>
	<p pid="a.279W.2/3">The Children Act 2004 places legal protections for young people in custody on a statutory footing. It places a duty on prison governors or directors, and governors or directors of secure training centres, to make arrangements for ensuring that their functions are discharged having regard to the need to safeguard and promote the welfare of children. Governors or directors of juvenile young offender institutions and secure training centres also become board partners in Local Safeguarding Children's Boards, which will be established to co-ordinate, and ensure the effectiveness of, safeguarding in their children's services authority area.</p>
	<p pid="a.279W.2/4">The children of asylum seekers and refugees are not excluded from the arrangements in the 2004 Act. The arrangements under sections 10 (co-operation to improve well-being), 11 (arrangements to safeguard and promote welfare) and 13&ndash;16 (Local Safeguarding Children Boards) of the Act are intended to cover all children. This includes those seeking asylum or refugees, when they come into contact with the agencies involved in the arrangements or, more generally, through the focus of the section 10 co-operation arrangements on all children.</p>
	<p pid="a.279W.2/5">Although the statutory duty to promote and safeguard the welfare of children was not placed on the Immigration Service, the IS takes its responsibilities towards children very seriously and fully appreciates the importance of identifying vulnerable children, including those who may be detained with their families. All removal centres that may hold families with children are required to have in place child protection policies and procedures based on a national template and to maintain close ties with local agencies involved in child protection and welfare matters. In addition, while the Immigration Service is not a core member under the duty to co-operate to improve well-being or the duty to establish Local Safeguarding Children Boards, where appropriate the Immigration Service will be involved in these arrangements. This would include those areas in which removal centres holding families with children are located.</p>

	<p pid="a.287W.0/1">All organisations wishing to register with the Criminal Records Bureau (CRB) must pay a &pound;300 registration fee. Additional Countersignatory applications cost &pound;5 each. There is currently no annual minimum requirement for the number of checks submitted by registered bodies.</p>
	<p pid="a.287W.0/2">I am unable to provide a definitive list of all national governing bodies of sport, county sports associations and sports clubs that are registered with the CRB. When applying to become registered bodies, all organisations are requested to identify their business sector from a list provided by the CRB. Sports associations are categorised under the leisure services business sector, but not all organisations who are involved in sports activities identify themselves under leisure services. The CRB is therefore unable to identify from the business sector whether registered bodies belong specifically to the groups in question.</p>
	<p pid="a.287W.0/3">Furthermore, the business sector information is not a mandatory part of the registration process and the CRB is aware that a number of registered bodies have not provided this detail. This also prevents the CRB from providing a complete analysis of the business sector for its registered bodies.</p>
	<p pid="a.287W.0/4">Many organisations also use the services of umbrella bodies to access the disclosure service and the sporting bodies about whom my hon. Friend is concerned may also be using this route, which again prevents a complete analysis.</p>
	<p pid="a.287W.0/5">Consequently, the CRB cannot provide the total number of disclosures issued to the sports bodies in question. It is estimated that the leisure industry accounts for about 7 per cent. of all disclosures issued.</p>

This includes any evidence which was not presented at the trial from which the appeal lies. When considering whether to receive any evidence the Court of Appeal must have regard to various factors: whether the evidence appears to the Court to be capable of belief; whether the evidence may afford any ground for allowing the appeal; whether the evidence would have been admissible in the trial; and whether there is a reasonable explanation for the failure to adduce the evidence at the trial.</p>

	<p pid="a.289W.0/1">Precise estimates of the impact of the Drug Interventions Programme on drug-related and persistent crime are not yet available. However, the key aim of the Programme is to get drug-using offenders into treatment as there is a wealth of research evidence to show that treatment reduces both drug use and offending. For example the National Treatment Outcomes Research Study found significant reductions in offending among those entering treatment. Early figures show that around 1,500 offenders a month are now entering treatment as a result of the Programme.</p>
	<p pid="a.289W.0/2">Other early evidence also shows that acquisitive crime is falling faster in Drug Interventions Programme areas than in non-Programme areas.</p>

	<p pid="a.293W.2/3">Furthermore, as part of a package of support for families affected by domestic violence, local authorities can provide funds from the Government's Supporting People programme, to fund housing-related support.

Services for under 16s are provided in satisfaction of a statutory duty and these duties are specifically excluded from Supporting People funding. Other services for under 16s are provided by local authority Social Services departments.</p>
	<p pid="a.293W.2/4">The funding that local authorities have allocated for domestic violence services from their Supporting People budgets in 2004&ndash;05 is &pound;56,964,000.

	<p pid="a.293W.2/5">It is for local authorities to decide how best to provide support and services for all children in need in its locale, including those children affected by domestic violence. There is no current specific earmarked funding for services of this nature. Instead, Government funding is allocated to Councils with social services responsibilities on the basis of the needs of their populations. A weighted capitation formula is used to determine each body's target fair share of available resources. It is, therefore, for Councils, working in partnership with relevant local stakeholders, to determine their spending priorities on the basis of local needs.</p>

	<p pid="a.294W.0/2">The Home Office is aware of a number of products, both in development and on the market, that claim to provide a partial or whole solution to the problem of drink-spiking. The list of substances that can be used to spike drinks is almost endless, with any substance that may have a sedative effect being a possible candidate. While drugs like Rohypnol and GHB (Gammahydroxybutyrate) have received wide publicity, they are rarely found in samples. As a result, products which allow the user to test drinks for certain illicit substances, may provide a potentially dangerous false reassurance.</p>
	<p pid="a.294W.0/3">While bottle caps and drinks holders may reduce the potential for drink spiking, they too can provide a false reassurance of safety, given evidence that it is the consumption of alcohol, rather than drink spiking, which more commonly increases vulnerability to sexual crime (please refer to answer given to questions 199964/6/7 regarding FSS research on this). The Government therefore urge the public to treat such products with caution. The Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) has in the past commissioned research to look at the viability of a potential drug detecting device, such as a swizzle stick, that could be unobtrusively used by people in pubs and clubs to detect drugs in drinks. Due to the difficulty of producing a satisfactory device, the project is not being continued.</p>
	<p pid="a.294W.0/4">A message of safer and more responsible drinking, alongside increased awareness and vigilance upon the part of friends and staff, will be most effective in increasing the safety of people who feel they are vulnerable to drink-spiking. The Home Office issues guidance to licensed premises on how to deal with the effects of drug use on their premises, which is in the process of being revised. The updated version will include a section on drug assisted sexual assault.</p>

	<p pid="a.298W.5/1">The information requested is not available.</p>
	<p pid="a.298W.5/2">The Prison Service does not keep records of reunions of mothers and children in the community. All pregnant prisoners who give birth to a baby while serving a prison sentence do so in a local hospital. Some of those mothers will be able to keep the baby with them in a Prison Service Mother and Baby Unit, while others will choose to leave their infant in the care of relatives or other carers, which is likely to result in a reunification of mother and baby. In other cases, babies may be taken into the care of foster carers and Social Services on a temporary basis. The outcome in those cases depends on the decisions of Social Services and the Family Courts.</p>

The Project was established in October 2000 and is run by the Prisoner Advice and Care Trust.

	<p pid="a.300W.2/2" class="indent">breach of the curfew (section 38A(1 )<i>(a)</i> of the Criminal Justice Act 1991)</p>

	<p pid="a.300W.2/6">The table gives a breakdown of the number of prisoners who have been recalled to prison while subject to the Home Detention Curfew scheme over the past five years and a monthly breakdown for the past 12 months.

	<p pid="a.300W.2/7">The increase in the number of recalls is an expected consequence of expanding the Home Detention Curfew scheme. Of the 100,345 prisoners placed on the scheme since January 1999, a total of 8,698 have had their licences revoked, which represents 8.7 per cent. of the total.</p>

	<p pid="a.303W.11/1">There are no plans to replace the Application Registration Card (ARC) with the identity card. The ARC and its associated database provides a secure record of a person's claim for asylum and because of the use of biometric information this means that a person cannot make multiple applications using different identities. The ARC does not prove identity.</p>
	<p pid="a.303W.11/2">When the identity cards scheme is operational, a person whose asylum application was approved&mdash;and whose identity had therefore been validated&mdash;could then be issued with a new biometric residence permit card linked to a record on the National Identity Register. The use of biometric information would ensure that a person could not create one &quot;identity&quot; via the asylum system and another via the identity cards scheme.</p>
	<p pid="a.303W.11/3">Although there are no plans for the ARC to be a designated document within the terms of the Identity Cards legislation, this would not rule out the possibility that the ARC scheme and the Identity Cards programme might share some common infrastructure.</p>

	<p pid="a.308W.5/1">It is not a criminal offence for a person simply to use another identity, but false identities are used often to facilitate other offences such as deception and money laundering. The police do not record incidents of identity fraud because prosecutions are recorded for the offences facilitated by false identities. However, a Cabinet Office study published in 2002 estimated the cost of identity fraud in the UK to be &pound;1.3 billion. No estimate has been by the Home Office of the extent of identity fraud in France, Germany, Spain or Sweden.</p>

	<p pid="a.314W.6/1">Schedule 1 to the Juries Act 1974 provided that various classes of person either must not or need not serve on a jury. Those who were &quot;ineligible&quot;&mdash;that is, not qualified to serve&mdash;included the judiciary, others (including prison officers) concerned with the administration of justice, the clergy and the mentally ill. Certain other groups of people were &quot;excusable as of right&quot;&mdash;that is, they had the right to refuse to do jury service if they so wished; these included persons aged between 65 and 69, members and peers of Parliament, the armed forces, members of the medical and similar professions, and people with religious objections.</p>
	<p pid="a.314W.6/2">Sir Robin Auld argued in his &quot;Review of the Criminal Courts&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.314W.6/3" class="indent">&quot;that these exemptions and excusals deprived juries of the experience and skills of a wide range of professional people&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.314W.6/4">and he recommended that the categories of ineligibility and excusal as of right set out in the Juries Act should be abolished, with the exception of those with mental disorders, who should continue to be ineligible for jury service. These changes were brought into effect on <phrase class="date" code="2004-04-05">5 April 2004</phrase> when section 321 of and Schedule 33 to the Criminal Justice Act 2003 were implemented.</p>

The major providers have been very willing to work with us in this area, and are working toward implementation of the code of practice on new forms of content which they introduced earlier this year. Under this code operators will self-classify commercial content and will place all content deemed unsuitable for people under 18 behind access controls. Since internet content will not be self-classifiable in this way, they will offer customers the opportunity to apply a filter working to equivalent standards.</p>

The exercise and performance of the powers under Chapter II of the 2000 Act is overseen by the Interception of Communications Commissioner (currently the right hon.

	<p pid="a.324W.2/1">Oasys assessments for those sentenced to less than 12 months imprisonment, are only a mandatory requirement for young adult offenders, aged 18 to 20. However, some adult short-term prisoners will have had an initial Oasys prepared by the National Probation Service as part of a pre-sentence report, and this will be available to the Prison Service. This policy will be reviewed as we prepare for the introduction of Custody Plus.</p>
	<p pid="a.324W.2/2">Some prisons currently provide custody plans or &quot;prisoner passports&quot;, which focus on resettlement issues, for adults serving short sentences. This is good practice although not mandatory.</p>

	<p pid="a.331W.2/2">Since 1997, the Home Office has commissioned two major reports on sentencing and the management of offenders. The first of these was the Halliday Report (&quot;Making Punishments Work&quot;), which was launched in May 2000 and reported in July 2001. The author was John Halliday. The total cost of the report was &pound;56,301.</p>
	<p pid="a.331W.2/3">The second was the Carter Report (&quot;Managing Offenders, Reducing Crime&quot;) commissioned by the PM, Treasury and Home Secretary on <phrase class="date" code="2003-03-17">17 March 2003</phrase>. The author was Patrick Carter (now Lord Carter of Coles). The report was received on <phrase class="date" code="2003-12-11">11 December 2003</phrase> and published on <phrase class="date" code="2004-01-06">6 January 2004</phrase>. The cost of Patrick Carter's review was met by the three commissioning Departments. The Home Office contributed staff resources via seconded staff, and contributed &pound;55,997 to the costs of expenses, research support and publication. The total cost of the Carter report is not readily available.</p>
	<p pid="a.331W.2/4">In addition to these two major projects, the Home Office has either commissioned or published an estimated 143 projects relating to more specific issues within the area of sentencing or offender management since 1997. These mostly comprise one-off research projects, and exclude the Home Office's series of statistical publications in those areas. Some of these projects have already been completed and published, others are still in progress. These projects have been carried out by a variety of external research teams (usually from universities or commercial research organisations) and in some cases by research development and statistics staff. It would be disproportionately costly to provide information on their total costs or the dates on which they reported.</p>

	<p pid="a.335W.5/7">Through these measures, recruiters are encouraged to develop an outreach strategy that includes representation at community, religious and cultural, and lifestyle events as well as attendance at recruitment and career fares.</p>
	<p pid="a.335W.5/8">Over the last two months the Prison Service has run a national awareness advertising campaign targeting under-represented groups. The campaign is aimed at raising awareness of the diverse range of career opportunities available within the service . While it is too early to evaluate the effectiveness of the initiative, there has been a significant increase in interest in the Prison Service website (over 120 per cent.). The Prison Service has made it clear to the advertising agencies it uses, that they must consider advertising strategies that attract applications from under-represented groups.</p>

The great majority of those who attend a programme will have received a clinical intervention on first arrival in prison custody.</p>

	<p pid="a.340W.2/1">In December 2002 new procedures for reporting self-injury were introduced in prisons in England and Wales. The evidence suggests that much of the increase in reported self-harm in 2003 may result from this change rather than an actual increase in incidence of self-harm.</p>
	<p pid="a.340W.2/2">The prison population includes a large number of prisoners with a combination of psychiatric disorders, alcohol and drug dependency, family background and relationship problems, histories of self-harm and previous abuse, all of which raise their risk of suicide and self-harm.</p>
	<p pid="a.340W.2/3">A number of interventions have been introduced to support prisoners who self-harm. These include counselling, support groups, and specialised psychological interventions. A network has been established to develop this work, to facilitate evaluation and share good practice. Guidance to staff on managing people who self-harm has also been circulated to establishments.</p>

	<p pid="a.346W.0/1">The &quot;Prison Catering' magazine was a partnership arrangement between the Prison Service and Cost Sector Catering magazine published by Dewberry Boyes. The magazine was published and distributed in support of the Prison Services national catering workshop. The aim was to promote, to a wider public sector audience, some of the work and challenges being taken forward and tackled within Prison Service catering.</p>
	<p pid="a.346W.0/2">The criteria for advertisements set by the Prison Service required all advertisers to either hold a government contract or deliver to a government contract. Publication of the magazine was at no cost to the public purse and no income was generated for the Prison Service. The cost of the publication was borne by the publishers who also received the revenue raised from advertising. In addition to the publication Dewberry Boyes also organised the workshop venue.</p>

	<p pid="a.348W.0/1">The only formal review that the Prison Service is aware of relating to sprinklers was in respect of Immigration Centres. In the light of this review the Prison Service undertook technical assessments and testing of non-ligature secure sprinkler heads, as part of a continuing review of fire safety in the prison estate. No conclusions have yet been reached.</p>
	<p pid="a.348W.0/2">An independent Fire Safety Survey and Review is currently being undertaken on behalf of the Prison Service by the Building Research Establishment (Fire) across the prison estate (public and private) which will include an assessment of the suitability, or otherwise, of sprinkler systems and other appropriate fire detection/management systems.</p>
	<p pid="a.348W.0/3">The cost and time to install sprinklers is dependent upon the availability of the cell areas in which sprinklers would be installed. An initial Prison Service estimate of the cost to provide sprinklers is in excess of &pound;125 million, Owing to population pressures and the need for major decanting and relocation of prisoners to facilitate a national installation programme installation would take many years, possibly several decades.</p>
	<p pid="a.348W.0/4">The Weare (a floating facility with shore facilities) is the only prison establishment fitted with sprinklers in accommodation areas. Many other establishments have sprinkler systems installed in high-risk areas, which include parts of kitchens and parts of workshops.</p>

	<p pid="a.360W.0/38">Compliance was originally defined as the proportion of orders with no second unacceptable failure to comply (no third in licence cases). The results on this basis for 2003&ndash;04 and April-September 2004 are shown in Tables 1 and 2 for <i>(a)</i> orders and licences combined and <i>(b)</i> for orders alone. Both show that compliance has improved by three percentage points in 2004&ndash;05 compared to the previous year.</p>
	<p pid="a.360W.0/39">Since May 2004, compliance has been measured on a wider definition that includes orders which have been allowed to continue by the courts following breach action by the NPS. Columns <i>(c)</i> and <i>(d)</i> of Table 2 show the results to the end of September. On this basis, NPS is exceeding the target of 70 per cent., having achieved 79 per cent. compliance for orders and licences combined and 76 per cent. for orders alone.</p>
	<p pid="a.360W.0/40"><i>(b)</i> Offending Behaviour Programmes. The tables set out the number of completions of offending behaviour programmes achieved by the National Probation Service during 2003&ndash;04 and in April to September 2004. These are set against the monthly profiled targets (i.e. the number of completions expected at the end of each month). The data is presented cumulatively to show progress towards the annual target which was 15,000 in each year.</p>

	<p pid="a.363W.2/1">The Spending Review 2000 Public Service Agreement (PSA) target 10 is to reduce reconviction rates for all offenders sentenced to imprisonment or to community supervision and for young offenders by 5 per cent. by 2003&ndash;04 compared to 1997 baselines. Both adults and young offenders are included in the measurement of progress against the all offenders element of the target, while the measure for the young offenders element covers those given pre-court disposals (cautions, reprimands and final warnings) and those sentenced to a non-custodial penalty. Young offenders starting community penalties supervised by the Probation Service were therefore included in the measurement of both elements of the target.</p>

This represents two changes compared to the methodology adopted for SR 2000: firstly, young offenders starting community penalties or discharged from prison are not included in the measurement of the adult target, and secondly all young offenders, including those discharged from custody are included in the measurement of the young offender target.</p>

	<p pid="a.365W.5/1">Within the broad statutory limits set by Parliament, sentences in individual cases are a matter for the courts alone, taking into account all the circumstances of the offence and the offender. Prison sentences should be reserved for those who are serious, dangerous or seriously persistent offenders. Equally, offenders cannot be allowed to flout the order of the court and to default on their obligations to abide by the terms of a community sentence.</p>
	<p pid="a.365W.5/2">The Powers of the Criminal Courts (Sentencing) Act 2000, Schedule 3, contains the provisions relating to breach of community orders. Where an offender aged 18 or over and subject to a community order has failed without reasonable excuse to comply with any of the requirements of the relevant order, the magistrates court dealing with the offender must impose a sentence of imprisonment, unless either the court is of the opinion that the offender is likely to comply with the requirements of the order during the period for which it remains in force or that there are exceptional circumstances which would justify the court's not imposing such a sentence.</p>
	<p pid="a.365W.5/3">If the court does not impose a sentence of imprisonment, or if the obligation to do so does not apply, it may alternatively deal with the offender by making a curfew order, a community punishment order, or an attendance centre order, or (where it has the power to do so) by revoking the order and dealing with the offender as though he had just been convicted of the offence.</p>

	<p pid="a.366W.5/1">Each week I receive from the Governor of Prescoed prison a report on the number of sex offenders held there. This report includes details of the sentence each prisoner is serving, the offence and the time served, the progress the prisoner is making and the type of work the prisoner is doing. The report also includes the same details for any prisoners expected to transfer to Prescoed from Usk in the following week.</p>
	<p pid="a.366W.5/2">These weekly reports enable me to monitor the arrangements for sex offenders placed at Prescoed and to ensure that those transferring to Prescoed meet the criteria which the Prison Service set, and which I endorsed, namely that life sentenced prisoners should have received a Parole Board recommendation for open conditions, and that determinate sentenced prisoners should be within one year of release.</p>

We intend to publish the consultation paper shortly.</p>
