	<p pid="a.769W.5/1">European Community import rules require all products of animal origin imported from third countries to enter the Community via specified border inspection posts (BIPs) where they are subject to veterinary examination to ensure the import conditions are being observed. The system of veterinary examination is operated in the UK by local authorities and is monitored by Defra and the European Commission's Food and Veterinary Office (FVO) to ensure effective controls are in place. There are currently 29 BIPs approved to inspect animal products in the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.769W.5/2">Commission Decision 2001/881 required that each BIP listed be subject to a yearly inspection by the FVO veterinary experts, unless reduced inspections to certain BIPs had been agreed by the Standing Veterinary Committee (now the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health).</p>
	<p pid="a.769W.5/3">Commission Decision 2005/13 amended Commission Decision 2001/881 and specifies that the frequency and scope of missions by the FVO to border inspection posts should be decided on the basis of risks to the animal and public health in the Community. Factors to be taken into account include patterns of trade in the Community, statistical data available under veterinary legislation, the results of previous missions by the Office, and any identified problem areas. The UK supports this approach.</p>
	<p pid="a.769W.5/4">Veterinary experts of the Food and Veterinary Office (FVO) work to assure effective control systems and to evaluate compliance with European Union (EU) standards. The FVO does this mainly by carrying out inspections in member states. The veterinary inspectors employed by the FVO must have a degree or equivalent diploma and have a minimum of three years relevant experience.</p>
	<p pid="a.769W.5/5">We have no information on the cost of these experts as the costs of the inspection missions are met from EU central funds.</p>
	<p pid="a.769W.5/6">The number of staff working in the FVO has increased from 74 in 1997 to its present complement of 163. Of these, 81 are plant health and veterinary inspectors, who participate regularly in on-the-spot inspection missions.</p>

	<p pid="a.770W.2/1">On each occasion Defra officials are required to consider carefully what form and extent of hospitality should be offered and if it can be justified. This is considered both by the host and the authorising officer, who have to bear in mind the need for economy and the limited funds available.</p>
	<p pid="a.770W.2/2">This will take into account the extent to which participation by representatives from a variety of organisations including business, voluntary organisations and local government assists the Department in forming and testing out policy as well as distances involved and inconvenience to most taking part.</p>
	<p pid="a.770W.2/3">The figures detailed in the following table includes a variety of forms of hospitality including events such as lunch provided for participants at Defra consultative events on farming issues, environmental issues and others of the many issues dealt with by the Department.</p>
	<p pid="a.770W.2/4">Examples include the event at which the Sustainable Farming and Food Strategy was launched and a new delivery team headed by Sir Don Curry was set up.</p>
	<p pid="a.770W.2/5">The figure for 2001&ndash;02 provided is for a full year and includes three months of DETR expenditure from <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-01">1 April</phrase> to <phrase class="date" code="2005-06-08">8 June</phrase> when Defra was created. MAFF and DETR did not use the same chart of accounts to record expenditure. It was, therefore, necessary to carry out a mapping exercise to match up expenditure under the Defra structure.</p>
	<p pid="a.770W.2/6">Hospitality was not separately identified in the expenditure transfer from DETR and may have been absorbed in incidental codes. For the remainder of that year only &pound;1,953 was recorded against Environment. This would suggest that there may have been some misunderstanding on coding within the ex-DETR directorates during the transition and initial months of Defra's existence.</p>
	<p pid="a.770W.2/7">The other factor that may have had an impact on the figures for 2001&ndash;02 was the foot and mouth crisis. The Department was very focused on dealing with this crisis and this would have reduced the number of events held where hospitality expenditure would have been incurred.</p>

	<p pid="a.771W.2/1">The following reply is based on the assumption that this question is seeking information about amounts spent in relation to civil litigation.</p>
	<p pid="a.771W.2/2">Defra conducts the majority of its litigation in house with other cases being dealt with on its behalf by the Treasury Solicitor's Department and by external solicitors. Defra came into existence in June 2001 and therefore has no records prior to that date. Defra's centralised records since that date relating to the information requested show only the number of new files it has handled in each year. The information indicates the number of new files opened in each year is as follows:</p>
	<table>
		<thead>
			<tr pid="a.771W.2/5"> <th></th> <th>Number</th> </tr>
		</thead>
		<tbody>
			<tr pid="a.771W.2/8"> <td>1991&ndash;92</td> <td>449</td> </tr>
			<tr pid="a.771W.2/9"> <td>1992&ndash;93</td> <td>359</td> </tr>
			<tr pid="a.771W.2/10"> <td>1993&ndash;94</td> <td>283</td> </tr>
			<tr pid="a.771W.2/11"> <td>1994&ndash;95</td> <td>165</td> </tr>
		</tbody>
	</table>
	<p pid="a.771W.2/14">This will usually correspond to the number of new actions/cases but not necessarily so. The number will include arbitrations and other ADR resolution and also claims which were resolved prior to the issue of proceedings and did not in the event proceed to court. Information about the number of actions is therefore approximate. Defra does not hold information in a centralised readily accessible format as to the number of settlements, number of court cases and the costs of each settlement, because collectively such information would involve disproportionate effort and it is not clear that it would help performance.</p>
	<p pid="a.771W.2/15">Treasury Solicitors have records for the number of files for matters concerning Defra on which they have worked in any one year and the total sums billed to Defra including disbursements. The figures for the number of matters do not represent new cases or even new files because it is only matters on which work has been done and so some new cases will be worked on in the following (and possibly subsequent) years. The figures are as follows:</p>

	<p pid="a.773W.6/1">The Government announced in the 2004 Spending Review the Department's plan to generate efficiencies of &pound;13 million a year by 2007&ndash;08 through the Modernising Rural Delivery Programme. Establishment of the Integrated Agency will generate efficiencies from a number of sources, principally reduced estates and staff costs from the merger of the three constituent organisations and the application of Gershon principles to deliver better value for money from back office services. These will contribute at least &pound;6.5 million cumulative efficiencies by 2007&ndash;08 with further efficiencies in 2008&ndash;09 and 2009&ndash;10.</p>
	<p pid="a.773W.6/2">The total main investment costs required to implement the Modernising Rural Delivery Programme as a whole are estimated to be approximately &pound;40 million. These costs are expected to fall in financial years 2004&ndash;05 to 2008&ndash;09. Of this, it is estimated that around &pound;30 million will be needed for establishment of the Integrated Agency. There may also be an additional ongoing cost associated with providing common terms and conditions for staff in the Agency.</p>

	<p pid="a.779W.2/1">The Sixth Edition of the RAF Manual of Flight Safety, officially described as Air Publication (AP) 3207, was issued in March 1993. This was superseded by the Seventh Edition, issued in 1998, which was itself replaced by a Joint Service Publication (JSP) 551 in July 2003. It is likely that the Sixth Edition will have been subject to a number of amendments (effected by replacing loose-leaf pages) during its period of currency. It is therefore unlikely that we could reconstruct&quot; the original version of the Sixth Edition, even if a copy of its later state were to come to light. All other copies have been destroyed in line with departmental procedure.</p>
	<p pid="a.779W.2/2">It is the nature of such documents that there is no reason for anyone to retain them once they have been superseded; perhaps more so once they have been replaced a second time. Therefore it is unlikely that any systematic search would reveal a copy of the Sixth Edition of AP 3207.</p>
	<p pid="a.779W.2/3">In the case of AP 3207 the organisation responsible for its production, the RAF Institute of Flight Safety, has itself been superseded by the Joint Service Defence Air Safety Centre&quot; (DASC). We have asked the DASC whether they have a copy of the Sixth Edition, but the only version of AP 3207 they hold is a copy of the Seventh Edition, which had itself been subject to three sets of amendments before it was replaced by JSP 551. I am happy to place in the Library a copy of the Seventh Edition of AP 3207, should the right hon. Member consider it useful.</p>

	<p pid="a.784W.3/2">One of the challenges in completing digital switchover will be to make sure that residents in flats and other multi-dwelling units can access digital television services. Many residents living in multi-dwelling units already access digital television services either through communal systems that are capable of transmitting digital signals or through the use of other antennae.</p>
	<p pid="a.784W.3/3">In order to help identify the issues for residents who live in multi dwelling units, we established a dedicated Housing Communications Group as part of the Digital Television Action Plan. The Housing Communications Group includes representatives from leading housing bodies including the Chartered Institute of Housing, the National Housing Federation, the National Landlords Association, tenants groups such as TPAS and TAROE and representatives from the Digital Television Group.</p>
	<p pid="a.784W.3/4">In June 2004, DCMS and DTI wrote to all local authorities, registered social landlords and around 70 housing bodies to alert them to digital switchover and to encourage them to factor this in when preparing plans to develop new housing stock or refurbish or upgrade existing stock.</p>
	<p pid="a.784W.3/5">In August 2004 we commissioned NOP to carry out a research project to investigate the progress made by social landlords. This research will enable us to have a better assessment of what is needed and to get a representative picture of when social landlords believe they will be able to upgrade systems for digital switchover. We hope to publish the findings of this study very shortly.</p>
	<p pid="a.784W.3/6">We have also started work, in association with the Chartered Institute of Housing, to produce comprehensive new guidance later this year setting out the options available to landlords who have properties with analogue communal systems which need to be upgraded. The guidance will be aimed at both the private and social sector landlords and housing developers. We also plan to issue separate guidance for householders which will cover the issues for tenants living in MDUs.</p>

	<p pid="a.785W.5/1">The Annual Public Library Statistics, published by the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy for the years 1999&ndash;2000 to 2002&ndash;03 (the latest available) show the overall expenditure by Wakefield libraries as follows:</p>
	<table>

			<tr pid="a.785W.5/4"> <th></th> <th>&pound;</th> </tr>

			<tr pid="a.785W.5/7"> <td>1999&ndash;2000</td> <td>3,309,655</td> </tr>

		</tbody>
	</table>
	<p pid="a.785W.5/13">The expenditure will be underpinned by funding from a number of sources, national, local and self-generated. Non ring-fenced core funding for public libraries is paid to the 149 library authorities in England as part of the Local Government Finance Settlement. DCMS does not hold a precise figure but I understand that Wakefield has added some uplift to the 2004&ndash;05 libraries budget and I commend them for that. I also understand that the Library Service itself has been energetic in forming partnerships and accessing external funding; this is also highly commendable.</p>
	<p pid="a.785W.5/14">Wakefield's libraries, in common with those in the rest of the United Kingdom, are connected to the internet through a &pound;120 million national lottery grant, which established the People's Network.</p>
	<p pid="a.785W.5/15">Additionally, my Department is funding the Museums, Libraries and Archives Council &pound;5 million over the three years ending 2005&ndash;06 to implement the Framework for the Future Action Plan and Library Improvement Programme which is designed to encourage improvement across the public library sector in England generally.</p>

	<p pid="a.789W.3/1">The UK's current assessment is that there is some cause for concern regarding human rights in Bangladesh, including religious freedom and tolerance. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office maintains close contact with minority groups and together we have raised issues of religious freedom at high-level meetings with the Bangladesh Government. My hon. Friend, the Minister of State for the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (Mr. Alexander) raised the issue of minority rights during his visit in December 2004.</p>
	<p pid="a.789W.3/2">DFID's support to Bangladesh is for poverty reduction and for poor people's social and economic rights irrespective of their religious or ethnic background. Since 1997 all projects financed, planned and run by DFID have been for cross-faith and cross-ethnic populations. As DFID projects are open to all, none are explicitly cross-ethnic or cross-faith.</p>
	<p pid="a.789W.3/3">DFID monitors effectiveness on the basis of povertyreduction as measured through the millennium development goals and so do not analyse performance according to faith- based and ethnic-based categories. In addition, DFID specifically supports civil society organisations that promote the realisation and protection of social and economic rights, including for minorities. Some examples are:</p>
	<p pid="a.789W.3/4" class="indentitalic">Manusher Jonno (People for People)</p>
	<p pid="a.789W.3/5" class="indent">To enhance the capacity of, and opportunities for, poor men, women and children to demand improved governance and recognition of their rights.</p>

	<p pid="a.791W.0/1">DFID is aware of the good work undertaken by Engineers without Borders UK and also through the international network of associate organisations. Initiatives such as placements to expose engineering students to work in developing countries while making a positive impact on peoples' lives, and related small-scale research projects are welcomed. The universities and companies that support the scheme and students who volunteer are to be congratulated. DFID has not provided funding for EWB and so has not undertaken assessments of their projects including EWB's activities in Ecuador and Surinam.</p>
	<p pid="a.791W.0/2">Regarding the Sunseed Desert Technology programme in Spain, its aims of demonstrating appropriate ways of living sustainably in semi-arid environments are useful and it provides valuable exposure for the volunteers who go to work there. DFID is not involved in this programme and so has not undertaken any assessments of its activities or long term viability.</p>

	<p pid="a.792W.3/1">AIDS is a centrepiece of the British Government's agenda for the G8 presidency this year. By the end of 2005 DFID wants to have agreement among donors and the international system on a well co-ordinated and funded plan to tackle AIDS so that we can move forward on treatment, prevention, care for orphans as well as research into better treatments, vaccines and microbicides. DFID will also work to maintain momentum for HIV prevention and take forward efforts to bring together HIV prevention efforts with sexual and reproductive health services.</p>
	<p pid="a.792W.3/2">The UK supports efforts to provide increased, and eventually universal, access to treatment and care for people with AIDS. We support the WHO and UNAIDS '3 by 5' goal to provide anti-retroviral therapy to three million people in developing countries by the end of 2005, of which two million will be in Africa. DFID is advocating for equitable provision to women and children, and if appropriate, encourage a target of at least 50 per cent. of treatments being directed to women and children.</p>
	<p pid="a.792W.3/3">A recent report (January 26) of the progress of the WHO programme showed us that in the second half of 2004, the number of people on ARV therapy in developing and transitional countries increased dramatically from 440,000 to an estimated 720,000. This shows that progress can be achieved with an effective, coordinated, sustained country led HIV/AIDS response. However, ARV treatment is only one element of the treatment needs of HIV positive people in poor countries, many of whom do not have access to good nutrition, clean water, antibiotics or even testing so that they know that they are positive.</p>

	<p pid="a.793W.0/1">One third of the world's population still lacks access to essential medicines. The UK Government are committed to increasing access to medicines in developing countries, including for the treatment of HIV and AIDS. There has been significant progress in this area. A combination of increased donor financing, competition from generic medicines, offers by research-based companies and improved health systems has led to a reduction in the price of first line antiretroviral medicines of as much as 98 per cent. over the last four years.</p>
	<p pid="a.793W.0/2">The UK Government have contributed to this reduction in prices in a number of ways. We worked with our international partners at the World Trade Organisation to reach the decision of <phrase class="date" code="2003-08-30">30 August 2003</phrase> allowing developing countries with no, or insufficient, manufacturing capacity in their pharmaceutical sector to import copies of patented medicines. These can be imported from countries such as India, following the issuing of a compulsory license in both the importing and exporting country. This important decision should help to increase the supply and availability of quality medicines.</p>
	<p pid="a.793W.0/3">DFID has significantly increased its funding for AIDS related programmes, including for treatment. The Department has committed to spend at least &pound;1.5 billion on AIDS- related programmes over the next three years, and have doubled our funding to the Global Fund to fight AIDS, TB and Malaria. Increased donor financing to buy medicines has contributed to the reduction in prices by increasing demand.</p>
	<p pid="a.793W.0/4">DFID has also committed over &pound;1.5 billion since 1997 to strengthen developing country health systems. This includes support to pharmaceutical procurement systems. Good quality systems can help to reduce prices. In addition, the UK supports the World Health Organisation's (WHO)'s work on 'pre-qualification' which increases access to quality, affordable medicines&mdash;both patent and generic&mdash;in developing countries.</p>
	<p pid="a.793W.0/5">The UK Government have also worked directly with stakeholders, including the pharmaceutical industry, to increase access to medicines. In 2001 the Prime Minister established a high level UK Working Group on Increasing Access to Essential Medicines in the Developing World&quot;. This reported in November 2002, recommending more support for research and development for diseases disproportionately affecting developing countries, and a global framework to facilitate voluntary, widespread, sustainable and predictable, differential pricing by pharmaceutical companies. This was followed in June 2004 by Increasing access to essential medicines in the developing world: UK Government policy and plans&quot;, which detailed how the UK Government are working in partnership with developing country governments, donors, international agencies, NGOs and the private sector to increase access to medicines.</p>
	<p pid="a.793W.0/6">DFID has been engaging with pharmaceutical companies to develop a framework encouraging 'good practice' in the pharmaceutical industry so as to increase access to medicines. This framework seeks to recognise the good work of the many companies in the industry, and to encourage pharmaceutical companies to go further by:</p>
	<p pid="a.793W.0/7" class="indent">Engaging in widespread differential pricing of medicines in developing countries.</p>
	<p pid="a.793W.0/8" class="indent">Increasing research and development investment for diseases affecting developing countries, including through engagement in public-private partnerships.</p>

	<p pid="a.796W.2/1">DFID is planning a programme of support to UNICEF in Asia to help prepare an improved regional analysis of the needs of orphans and vulnerable children, and to enhance advocacy by Asian groups involved in this work. This will include those affected by HIV and AIDS. The bilateral programme already provides some support in this area and there are plans to extend our support to orphans and vulnerable children through our country assistance programmes. For example in India, DFID supports targeted interventions for street children, who are particularly vulnerable. DFID also provide funds for the UNICEF/Government of India school AIDS education programme. In Cambodia DFID is supporting the review of the national HIV and AIDS plans, which is expected to strengthen action for orphans and vulnerable children.</p>

	<p pid="a.796W.5/1">DFID made no direct investments in infrastructure in Kenya during 2004 and therefore made no formal assessment of the effects of its aid on infrastructure development during that period.</p>
	<p pid="a.796W.5/2">Many other donor agencies including the World Bank, the European Commission, some UN agencies, the Germans, Swedes, Japanese, French and international Non-Government Organisations contribute significantly to infrastructure development directly in Kenya. As a result, we have focused our support to other critical sectors such as health and education where we assessed our funding would have more impact. DFID has therefore gradually reduced its support to direct investment in infrastructure over the past few years and nearly all our remaining stand-alone projects in roads and water/sanitation were closed down during 2002 and 2003. DFID Kenya maintains direct support to Oxfam and Action Aid who continue to provide water and sanitation services to marginalised communities in Kenya.</p>

	<p pid="a.797W.3/1">Through our country programmes, DFID is engaged with the first round of UNICEF-led Rapid Assessment, Analysis and Action Plan (RAAAP) processes in Africa and will be providing support for the implementation of the costed national action plans in selected countries. DFID is currently in consultation with UNICEF headquarters and regional offices on plans for the further country assessments and action planning. The details of these processes have yet to be finalised, but we expect the support we announced at the Global Partners' Forum in December 2004 for UNICEF on orphans and vulnerable children to contribute to these.</p>
	<p pid="a.797W.3/2">The Global Partners' Forum meeting held at the World Bank in December 2004 demonstrated that the Framework is widely accepted, even if not all agencies have officially endorsed it. The key issue now is ensuring it is put into practice. A good start has been made in sub-Saharan Africa through the rapid assessment; analysis and action plan processes (RAAAP). This has resulted in the development of 16 national action plans for orphans and vulnerable children based on the framework. For some of these, we are considering providing support for implementation.</p>

	<p pid="a.797W.6/1">Despite the difficulties of estimating the effects of trade reform, World Bank figures indicate that eliminating all barriers to trade in goods would generate an extra US$250 billion&mdash;$620 billion in global income, up to half of which would go to developing countries. They further estimate that a pro-poor outcome to the Doha Development Round of negotiations could reduce the number of people living on less than $2 a day by 144 million, with sub-Saharan Africa seeing the greatest reduction&mdash;over 60 million.</p>
	<p pid="a.797W.6/2">We need to keep the Doha Development Agenda as ambitious as possible in order to realise these gains. The EU, along with several other World Trade Organisation (WTO) members, already provides duty free and quota free access for least developed countries under the Everything But Arms&quot; initiative; DFID would like to see other WTO members extend similar market access to these countries.</p>
	<p pid="a.797W.6/3">It is also important to tackle all distortions in world agricultural trade&mdash;tariffs, quotas and unfair forms of export competition. Progress in this area will determine the extent to which poor people, like the cotton producers of Benin, Chad, Burkina Faso and Mali will benefit from the outcome of the Doha Round.</p>
	<p pid="a.797W.6/4">However, World Bank research also emphasises that market access is necessary but not sufficient for the least developed countries to maximise the potential trade gains from multilateral trade liberalisation under the Doha Round.</p>
	<p pid="a.797W.6/5">We must also acknowledge and tackle the many supply side constraints faced by the poorest countries. This will require a combination of domestic reforms, technical assistance and capacity building, to enable their producers to take better advantage of new market opportunities abroad, for example, through meeting the stringent product standards that their exports often face.</p>

This definition replaced their earlier one which classified communities up to 6,300 people as 'rural'. The wider definition was adopted by the Post Office in the autumn of 2000 when the formal requirement to maintain the rural network and prevent avoidable closures was placed upon them by this Government.

	<p pid="a.803W.2/2">The Department is deeply concerned about the distress bullying causes and the effect it has on lives and we are determined to help schools tackle the problem. Our guidance pack 'Bullying: Don't Suffer in Silence', the anti-bullying Charter and the anti-bullying website <a href="http://www.dfes.gov.uk/bullying">www.dfes.gov.uk/bullying</a> offer detailed advice on preventing and addressing bullying.</p>
	<p pid="a.803W.2/3">In November 2003 to June 2004 we ran a series of regional conferences, part of the 'Make The Difference' campaign. These conferences, which were well attended, offered an opportunity for schools and other partners to share good practice on this issue and to learn at first hand about what has worked elsewhere. In July 2004 we funded the Anti-Bullying Alliance (ABA), a grouping of voluntary sector organisations, including Childline and the NSPCC. The Alliance works to support schools in addressing bullying behaviour. November 2004 saw the launch of the first ever National Anti-Bullying week which featured a variety of events including a Radio One campaign and a new public information film. An event on countering racist bullying will be taking place in March 2005.</p>

	<p pid="a.803W.5/1">We recognise the importance of ensuring that children are protected from domestic violence. In framing the regulations, guidance and staff training that will govern the operation of information sharing databases, or indexes, we will address protection from domestic violence. This will include the facility for certain details, such as an address, to be blocked out or not to appear on the index at all where a parent has good cause to believe that the inclusion of such information may lead to a crime being committed. It will include ensuring that training for index managers and users covers the right of the child to be protected from harm and the fact that this qualifies the right of a parent to access to information, for example, about a child's current address. We will also ensure that similar issues are addressed as appropriate in the guidance and training for introduction of the Common Assessment Framework.</p>

	<p pid="a.804W.5/1" class="holdinganswer">pursuant to his reply, <phrase class="date" code="2004-12-07">7 December 2004</phrase>, Official Report, c. 433W</p>
	<p pid="a.804W.5/2">I am reporting back on the outcome of the culture session of the Education, Youth and Culture Council, which was attended by Lord McIntosh of Haringey, Minister for Heritage and the Media, on <phrase class="date" code="2005-11-16">16 November</phrase>. My earlier response provided details of the Education and Youth parts of the council only, and indicated that colleagues at the Department for Culture, Media and Sport would be writing to you with a short summary of what happened on the culture part. However, I have since been advised that outcomes of all parts of council meetings should be provided by written parliamentary answer. As the parliamentary question was put down for reply by the Secretary of State for Education and Skills, it is, therefore, appropriate that the reply comes from this Department. I apologise for the delay in providing the information on the culture part of the council.</p>
	<p pid="a.804W.5/3">During the culture/audiovisual session, Ministers discussed the Commission's proposed 2007&ndash;13 culture programme, which will provide funding for cooperation between cultural organisations. Discussion focused on two areas of contention: <i>(a)</i> whether individual sectors should be specifically singled out in the decision and <i>(b)</i> whether and how to enable smaller organisations to participate. The UK submitted a written statement calling for an open programme and bigger projects to ensure the EU-level added value of the programme.</p>
	<p pid="a.804W.5/4">Ministers adopted a two-year work plan on culture, which will focus on five topics: contribution of culture and audiovisual industries to the Lisbon Agenda; digitisation of cultural heritage; improving the Commission's Culture Portal on the Europa site; mobility of museum collections; and improving the mobility of artists.</p>
	<p pid="a.804W.5/5">The council approved without discussion the nominations of Dr. Brian Hennessy (Ireland) and Bert van Meggelen (Netherlands) as the council representatives on the European Capitals of Culture selection panel for 2005.</p>
	<p pid="a.804W.5/6">The council gave unanimous agreement on the mandate authorising the Commission to negotiate on behalf of the EC in negotiations of the draft UNESCO convention on cultural diversity. However the UK, supported by Greece, called for a non-paper to clarify how co-ordination of an EU line would operate in practice to ensure that respective roles and responsibilities of the Commission, the presidency and the member states were clarified. The UK also took the opportunity to emphasise that the final UNESCO convention must not undermine trade negotiations in other international fora.</p>
	<p pid="a.804W.5/7">Ministers then discussed the Commission's proposed Media 2007 Programme, which provides financial support for the European film industry. Discussions focused on whether the programme should offer more support to television broadcasters and countries with limited film making capabilities.</p>
	<p pid="a.804W.5/8">The UK submitted a written statement calling for further quantified information on the effectiveness of the programme expenditure in achieving its aims, the establishment of an effective system for monitoring and evaluating the programme, and mechanisms to secure added value at a European level.</p>
	<p pid="a.804W.5/9">The council agreed without comment a general approach on a Recommendation on Film Heritage, which encourages member states to establish national archives for films.</p>
	<p pid="a.804W.5/10">The council agreed a general approach on a Recommendation on the Protection of Minors and Right to Reply. Lord McIntosh submitted a minute statement explaining that, while we agreed with the parts of the proposal aimed at improving children's media literacy, the UK objected to the parts of the recommendation which lean in the direction of content regulation of the internet and to applying right to reply to the online environment. Lord McIntosh explained that the UK felt that these elements of the recommendation would work contrary to its overall aim of improving competitiveness in the audiovisual sector.</p>
	<p pid="a.804W.5/11">During the course of a discussion on Public Service Broadcasting, which was continued over lunch, Lord McIntosh pointed out that the council should not seek to cut across European competition rules.</p>
	<p pid="a.804W.5/12">Finally, the Luxembourg Minister, Octavie Modert, presented plans for their presidency. She mentioned that they would be looking at intercultural dialogue and cultural tourism and would explore establishing an Anna Lindh foundation. She explained that there would be a culture ministerial on 26&ndash;<phrase class="date" code="2005-06-27">27 June</phrase>, a seminar on Television without Frontiers in May and a conference on high-definition television in June.</p>

Of the 46 mini Sure Start programmes intended to provide services for smaller and more scattered populations, 29 are in rural areas. As part of the first phase of the development of children's centres, we have given additional funds to local authorities containing rural wards to develop flexible ways of delivering children's centre services such as early learning and links to health care services. The Government have been encouraging the development of extended schools. Funding has been available since 2003&ndash;04, initially to the most disadvantaged urban and rural areas, but from 2005&ndash;06 all LEAs will be receiving funding to support the delivery of extended services in all schools over time.</p>
	<p pid="a.807W.3/3">The Broadband Grant includes a 'sparsity weighting' to take into account the higher costs of connectivity in rural and hard to reach areas. All schools will have a broadband connection by 2006. We recognise that local schools are at the heart of many rural communities. Guidance to School Organisation Committees on the presumption against the closure of rural schools has been strengthened. We shall be reporting fully on all our activities to the Countryside Agency as part of the annual cycle of rural proofing reporting by the Government.</p>

	<p pid="a.808W.7/1">As part of the departmental efficiency challenge we are transforming the administration of Jobcentre Plus and the Pension Service, to deliver savings and improve our service to customers. These changes will not impede or hinder access to face-to-face interviews.</p>
	<p pid="a.808W.7/2">Between now and 2008 the number of sites where Jobcentre Plus processes benefits will be reduced from the present 650 to around 77 larger benefit processing centres. However, when the rollout of Jobcentre Plus is completed in 2006 customers will still have access to services through around 1,000 sites and other channels such as telephone and internet.</p>
	<p pid="a.808W.7/3">The reduction in the number of sites where benefits are processed will, therefore, not impede access to face-to-face interviews.</p>
	<p pid="a.808W.7/4">Every customer to Jobcentre Plus benefits has access to a personal adviser at the start of their claim and local offices continue to offer advice and information on work and benefits. In some locations services are also delivered through third party premises and provision has been made for customer access telephones in a number of locations.</p>
	<p pid="a.808W.7/5">The Pension Service will move from the current network of pension centres to at least 12 modernised processing sites. These sites have been chosen from the existing network of pension centres and customers will be able to access information through existing channels, including telephone and the internet. In addition, the Local Service of the Pension Service will continue to provide a nationally managed face to face service at venues convenient to its customers.</p>

	<p pid="a.818W.8/2">Since 1997, the Home Office has allocated &pound;31,700 towards a mobile CCTV system in Warrington to ensure full coverage of the system across the town under the Closed Circuit Television initiatives, which formed part of the Crime Reduction Programme. This payment was made in the financial year 2001&ndash;02.</p>
	<p pid="a.818W.8/3">Since the completion of the Crime Reduction Programme, crime reduction funding has been allocated directly to the local Crime and Disorder Reduction Partnership through the Building Safer Communities fund and to Basic Command Unit (BCU) Commanders through the BCU fund. These funding streams finance a variety of interventions, including CCTV, to tackle local crime priorities. Exactly how funding is allocated across the area is the responsibility of Warrington borough council and the Greater Manchester police.</p>

The requirements to keep records of Government business are set out in the Public Record Act. The National Archive (TNA) produces guidance that further details the requirement so that only material of historical significance is held and transferred to it for permanent preservation. That guidance sets out how long different types of record should be held for and a process for scheduling disposal. The Department has consistently followed this guidance to ensure that records are held for as long as required to meet business needs, that ephemeral material is then destroyed and that only material of long term historic value is transferred to TNA.</p>
	<p pid="a.827W.2/2">Since 1999, the Home Office has produced 86 schedules for the disposal of records which are specific to its administrative activities. It also disposes of its records in accordance with over twenty guidance notes produced by The National Archives (TNA) over the last five years, covering disposal schedules, managing records in the electronic environment, as well as overarching record management guidance. Further details of this guidance can be found on TNA's website at:</p>

	<p pid="a.829W.0/1">The information is as follows:</p>
	<p pid="a.829W.0/2"><i>(a)</i> The Council Decision provides for certain areas covered by Title IV of Part Three of the treaty establishing the European Community to be governed by the procedure referred to in Article 251 of the treaty. That procedure provides for qualified majority voting in the Council and the application of the co-decision procedure in the European Parliament. The move to QMV and co- decision is not new. The treaty of Amsterdam, in force since 1999, provided that five years after its entry into force, member states would take a unanimous decision to move some or all immigration and asylum measures to QMV and co-decision. Within the Nice treaty, in force since 2003, member states adopted a declaration slightly amending the Amsterdam arrangements. The move to QMV and co-decision for asylum measures became automatic, once common rules and basic principles had been agreed. Member states reaffirmed that they would endeavour to move remaining immigration measures, or parts of them, to QMV and co-decision from <phrase class="date" code="2004-05-01">1 May 2004</phrase> or as soon as possible thereafter.</p>
	<p pid="a.829W.0/3"><i>(b)</i> The Government supported the move to qualified majority voting because EU co-operation on asylum and immigration issues over the last five years has been valuable to the UK and we are keen to see measures in this area adopted without the delays experienced under unanimous voting in a Council of 25 member states. The Council decision has no effect on the UK's Title IV protocol, negotiated at Amsterdam. We will continue to be able to opt-in to immigration and asylum measures which are in the UK's interest. The decision also does not affect the UK's frontiers protocol, which allows us to maintain our own border controls.</p>
	<p pid="a.829W.0/4"><i>(c)</i> Parliament is notified of developments in EU legislation via correspondence between the lead Government Department and the European Scrutiny Committees in the House of Commons and the House of Lords. The draft Council Decision, along with an explanatory memorandum, was deposited in Parliament on <phrase class="date" code="2004-11-15">15 November 2004</phrase>. A subsequent addendum to the draft Council Decision was submitted on <phrase class="date" code="2005-11-25">25 November</phrase>. The Council Decision was debated in European Standing Committee B on <phrase class="date" code="2005-12-13">13 December</phrase>. Both Committees cleared the document from scrutiny during December. The decision took effect on <phrase class="date" code="2005-01-01">1 January 2005</phrase> having been adopted on <phrase class="date" code="2004-12-22">22 December 2004</phrase>.</p>

	<p pid="a.831W.2/2"><i>(a)</i> The Department does not recognise the term Connecting Communities Network&quot;, but the budget for the Connecting Communities Grant programme was &pound;4.695 million in the financial year 2003&ndash;04, rising to &pound;5.908 million in 2004&ndash;05. The number of Home Office staff employed full-time on administering this grant was five in 2003&ndash;04, and one and a half in 2004&ndash;05.</p>

The number of staff in post (full-time equivalents) at <phrase class="date" code="2004-03-31">31 March 2004</phrase> was 3.1 and at <phrase class="date" code="2004-11-30">30 November 2004</phrase> was 4.1 (excluding the administrative head of the CJC, as he has split responsibilities and is funded by the Master of the Rolls).</p>
	<p pid="a.831W.2/4"><i>(c)</i> As the term Criminal Justice Integration Unit&quot; is unfamiliar, this question cannot be answered.</p>
	<p pid="a.831W.2/5"><i>(d)</i> The Crime and Disorder Reduction Partnerships (CDRP), although having statutory functions, are not organisations in their own right and it is not possible to quantify the staff employed. CDRPs are virtual&quot; partnerships, reliant upon the individual partners for the quality and quantity of resource available to them. Their work is largely co-ordinated by staff employed by local authorities, supplemented by seconded, or dedicated, police officers and officers from other Responsible Authorities.</p>

	<p pid="a.838W.8/1">Roll out of the probation and prison OASys IT systems has gone well. The prison service completed its roll out by the end of 2004 and all probation areas have been using OASys IT since last summer. However our plans to connect the two systems are behind schedule.</p>
	<p pid="a.838W.8/2">We decided that it made sense, first, to pilot a limited version of the software that would provide the connection between the two systems, with full deployment of the final version of the software to follow at a later date. At the beginning of 2004 our aim was to begin the pilot in July and have the final version ready for deployment in September, with a view to completing roll out across the probation service and prison service around the end of 2004.</p>
	<p pid="a.838W.8/3">The pilot began in July as planned, linking one probation area to several prisons. However the effort needed to develop and support the pilot was greater than expected, which delayed completion of the final version of the software until the end of November. The final version is now in use across the prison service and in the pilot probation area.</p>
	<p pid="a.838W.8/4">Plans for roll out across the rest of the probation service have been put back in order to give priority to work that will enable OASys to support implementation of the sentencing provisions of the 2003 Criminal Justice Act in April. We now expect to achieve full connectivity between the prison and probation OASys IT systems by autumn 2005.</p>

	<p pid="a.848W.2/1">The Sharp End&quot; magazine is for frontline police officers, Community Support Officers and police staff.

The Government have a duty to explain how its policies impact on this key audience, and our research shows they would welcome it.</p>
	<p pid="a.848W.2/2">The Sharp End complements the local information police officers receive from their Chief Constables and other sources. The first issue included articles on new antisocial behaviour powers, best practice on cutting burglary, preserving scenes of crime and using new techniques such as automatic number plate recognition, the introduction of new equipment such as non-lethal weapons ('tasers') and how officers can stay fit for their job.</p>

These costs relate largely to the launch and set up of the magazine and therefore will reduce considerably next financial year.</p>

	<p pid="a.849W.5/1">The recorded crime information collected centrally and held on the Home Office Court Proceedings, does not allow the separate identification of rapes involving drugs.</p>
	<p pid="a.849W.5/2">Results obtained by the Forensic Science Service from a study involving 1,014 cases of claimed drug facilitated sexual assault between 2000 and 2002 showed that:</p>
	<p pid="a.849W.5/3" class="indent">2 per cent. of such cases were due to a deliberate administration of drugs intended to disinhibit the victim.</p>
	<p pid="a.849W.5/4" class="indent">Alcohol was detected in 81 per cent. of cases where samples were taken soon enough to be able to detect it.</p>
	<p pid="a.849W.5/5">Findings from the 2001 BCS Inter-Personal Violence Module found that in 5 per cent. of rape cases since age 16, victims said that they were drugged in some way. The BCS IPV module also suggests that only 15 per cent. of victims of serious sexual assault report it to the police.</p>
	<p pid="a.849W.5/6">In November 2004 the Association of Chief Police Officers launched Operation Matisse, a six-month study which will assess the extent of drink spiking and sexual assault in seven police force areas. It is the first co-ordinated study on drug-facilitated sexual assault, and will provide valuable information on which effective action to tackle this particularly sinister crime can be based.</p>
	<p pid="a.849W.5/7">The Government did not fund a campaign specifically to warn against drink-spiking in the run-up to Christmas. We believe that the consumption of alcohol, whether intentional or unsolicited, is a bigger factor than drugs in sexual assault, and we intend to focus awareness raising work on this issue, as part of the Alcohol Harm Reduction Programme for England.</p>

The applicable SBA legislation governing the education of non-service children does not prohibit corporal punishment in schools. However, the education of non-service children in the SBAs is carried out on behalf of the SBA Administration by the Republic of Cyprus, whose law does not permit corporal punishment. Although this law does not have any legal status in the SBAs, the teachers in such schools are likely to consider themselves bound to follow the Republican Law when working in the SBA, and would not use corporal punishment. The European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) was only recently extended to the SBAs, and the Administration is currently auditing its laws to amend those which are incompatible with the ECHR. As part of this review, laws on education will be amended so that they are in line with those of the Republic of Cyprus: this law, once in place, will prohibit corporal punishment in schools in the SBAs. The law is expected to be enacted by May of this year. Corporal punishment in other institutions and forms of care is not expressly prohibited. This field of work is carried out on behalf of the SBA Administration by the Republic of Cyprus. At present Cyprus law. in common with existing legislation in the SBA, permits corporal punishment by those with custody of children. However, a new law under consideration in Cyprus would prohibit corporal punishment entirely. In practice, the authorities in Cyprus do not permit any form of corporal punishment to be imposed in institutions caring for children. Corporal punishment in the home is not expressly prohibited but is allowed to the extent of reasonable chastisement.</p>

Corporal punishment is permitted in schools, provided that it is not administered in a manner which is degrading or injurious. The same laws which apply to schools would also apply to other institutions. There are however no juvenile institutions other than schools in the Territory. Corporal punishment of children in the home is permitted, provided it does not go beyond reasonable chastisement.</p>

UK and US contributions have been augmented over the election period. The MNF works closely with the Iraqi Security Forces (ISF). As the capacity and capability of the ISF improves, the need for MNF support will gradually decrease. Several MNF-I partners have time-bound mandates: some of these may be renewed, other countries may prefer to switch their focus to, for example, the NATO Training Mission.</p>

Their attempts to block the passage of key EU harmonisation legislation on the death penalty and minority language rights when they were part of the previous coalition government was a matter of concern. The MHP has been particularly vehement in its rejection of any kind of cultural rights for the Kurds. The MHP was recently in the news when a crowd of its supporters disrupted a Greek Orthodox religious ceremony in Istanbul on <phrase class="date" code="2005-01-06">6 January 2005</phrase>.</p>

	<p pid="a.869W.8/1">The Government takes very seriously all allegations of abuse and corruption concerning any UN programme or activity. We are co-operating fully with the Independent Inquiry Committee (IIC) set up by the UN to investigate allegations relating to the UN's Iraq Oil for Food programme. We will study the IIC's findings and recommendations carefully. The UN and its members need to draw lessons from past experience to improve future performance.</p>
	<p pid="a.869W.8/2">The UK is also pressing for full information on recent allegations of sexual abuse and exploitation in UN peacekeeping missions. The UN Secretary-General has shown determination to deal with this problem, and appointed Prince Zeid of Jordan as a special adviser. Prince Zeid's report will produce recommendations to ensure that these issues are properly dealt with in theatre and in the UN.</p>

	<p pid="a.869W.11/1">Relations between Colombia and Venezuela are currently strained, following the capture of a member of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (PARC) on Venezuelan territory. Venezuela has recalled its ambassador to Colombia and suspended future commercial projects between the two countries. We understand that other regional governments, including Peru and Brazil, have offered to mediate in the dispute. We hope that the Colombian and Venezuelan Governments are able to resolve this dispute swiftly and amicably.</p>

	<p pid="a.885W.8/1">The information is not available in the format requested.</p>
	<p pid="a.885W.8/2">The provision of single-sex accommodation is measured as compliance with three objectives set by the Department. These objectives require national health service trusts to provide single-sex sleeping areas, separate bathroom and toilet facilities for men and women and, where appropriate, safe facilities for the mentally ill. The separation of male and female sleeping areas can be achieved in a variety of ways, including combinations of single rooms and single-sex bays.</p>
	<p pid="a.885W.8/3">Compliance with these objectives is measured at trust level and therefore ward level information is not available.</p>
	<p pid="a.885W.8/4">All NHS trusts providing services to the people of Wirral are fully compliant with the standards which we have set.</p>
	<p pid="a.885W.8/5">Nationally, as at December 2003:</p>
	<p pid="a.885W.8/6" class="indent">99 per cent. of NHS trusts provide single-sex sleeping accommodation for planned admissions and have robust operational policies in place to protect patients' privacy and dignity.</p>
	<p pid="a.885W.8/7" class="indent">99 per cent. of NHS trusts meet the additional criteria set to ensure the safety of patients who are mentally ill.</p>
	<p pid="a.885W.8/8" class="indent">97 per cent, of NHS trusts provide properly segregated bathroom and toilet facilities for men and women.</p>
	<p pid="a.885W.8/9">The small number of NHS trusts which do not yet meet our standards are building new hospitals, the construction of which is well advanced. One such NHS trust is located within the North West of England, in the area overseen by the Cheshire and Merseyside Strategic Health Authority. I am informed that the non-compliant area is one temporary ward, which is being used to accommodate patients while the redevelopment works are completed within the main hospital. This temporary accommodation will be taken out of use by May 2005.</p>

	<p pid="a.886W.2/1">To support the increase in the availability of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanning we are increasing staff and ensuring that patients can get faster and better access to neurology services.</p>
	<p pid="a.886W.2/2">Since September 1997, the number of consultants in neurology has increased by 56 per cent., and we are working towards increasing their numbers further by expanding the number of specialist registrar (SpR) opportunities in the specialty. In addition, the number of nurses employed in the national health service has increased by 77,500 since 1997 and there are now around 1,250 general practitioners with special interests providing acute services in clinical specialities, including neurology. The new national MRI mobile scanning units are also adding over 15 per cent., more diagnostic capacity to the NHS and the independent sector will provide additional staff to ease pressure on existing NHS diagnostic teams.</p>
	<p pid="a.886W.2/3">It is the responsibility of primary care trusts (PCTs), in partnership with local providers, to assess the needs of their local community, to commission services and to identify the resources and number of professional staff that they need to deliver those services. The increase in the acquisition of MRI scans is an excellent opportunity to consider different methods of delivery and different skill mix solutions.</p>

	<p pid="a.891W.2/5">It is the responsibility of primary care trusts (PCTs), in partnership with local providers, to assess the needs of their local community. PCTs have the resources to commission services as well as to be able to identify the number of professional staff that they need to deliver those services. This process provides the means for addressing local needs within the health community including the provision and development of radiography services.</p>
	<p pid="a.891W.2/6">The expectation is that the number of radiographers and radiologists will continue to increase.</p>

	<p pid="a.891W.5/2">The introduction of assistant practitioners and advanced practitioners in radiology departments is one of a range of initiatives that are contributing to an increase in workforce capacity. This is being supported by a national radiography recruitment and retention project, which is encouraging the expansion through the use of innovative skill mix and career escalator models. &pound;3.4 million has been made available to support this.</p>
	<p pid="a.891W.5/3">It is the responsibility of primary care trusts (PCTs), in partnership with local providers, to assess the needs of their local community. PCTs have the resources to commission services, and to identify the number of professional staff that they need to deliver those services. This process provides the means for addressing local needs within the health community including the provision and development of radiography services. Data on advanced practitioners is not collected centrally. However data for assistant practitioners will be available from the September 2005 workforce census. The overall radiography headcount has increased by 13,300 or 13 per cent. since 1997.</p>

	<p pid="a.892W.2/1">It is the responsibility of primary care trusts (PCTs) to assess and make provision for the healthcare needs of their local communities. PCTs have the resources to commission services and identify the number of professional staff that they need to deliver those services. The flexibilities provided by the new general medical services (QMS) and alternative provider medical services (APMS) contracts will assist PCTs in securing local workforce capacity. In addition, the Department is working closely with those PCTs who have been identified as having specific problems in general practitioner and other health professional recruitment. This work will be disseminated to share good practice across all PCTs, strategic health authorities and deaneries. NHS Employers&quot;, the new employers organisation for the national health service, will provide advice and support to local NHS organisations still experiencing recruitment difficulties.</p>
	<p pid="a.892W.2/2">A range of recruitment and retention initiatives are in place to help expand the NHS workforce across England. These include improving pay and conditions, encouraging the NHS to become a better, more flexible and diverse employer, help with accessing child care, increasing training, attracting back returners and running national and international recruitment campaigns. As a result of these measures, between September 1997 and March 2004, the total number of qualified nurses employed in the NHS has increased by 77,500. The primary care workforce has also expanded. Between September 1997 and September 2003, the number of GPs (excluding retainers) employed by the NHS has increased by 3,169, or 11.3 per cent., and the primary care nursing workforce has increased by 18,884, or 24.4 per cent.</p>
