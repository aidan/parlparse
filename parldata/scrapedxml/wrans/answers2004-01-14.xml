	<p pid=".731W.2/1">I attended the Environment Council on <phrase class="date" code="2003-12-22">22 December 2003</phrase>, together with my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs.</p>
	<p pid=".731W.2/2">The Council adopted a Regulation establishing a transitional points system applicable to heavy goods vehicles travelling through Austria for 2004 (known as 'Ecopoints'), a matter previously dealt with by Transport ministers. Agreement had been reached between the Council and the European Parliament through the conciliation process, but there was a discussion in Council as Austria was unable to support the outcome. Council approved the result of the conciliation committee, with Austria voting against.</p>
	<p pid=".731W.2/3">We held a short discussion on the proposed revision of the Directive on the management of bathing water. A compromise text prepared by the Presidency was unacceptable to the Commission and to a number of member states, including Germany, Greece and Spain, who believed it would produce an insufficiently demanding new Directive. The Secretary of State made it clear that the UK would be unable to agree to the legally binding targets to be reached by 2015, on which the Commission wished to insist. It was evident that there was no realistic prospect of reaching political agreement at this meeting, and the Italian Presidency decided to leave further negotiations to the forthcoming Irish Presidency.</p>
	<p pid=".731W.2/4">We debated the Commission's proposals concerning the Kyoto Protocol's project mechanisms in relation to the EU scheme for greenhouse gas emissions trading. Ministers expressed their views on a number of questions posed by the Presidency. Most supported early linking to the Clean Development Mechanism, although views were divided on whether such linking could be made available prior to the Kyoto Protocol coming into force. There was also a range of views on the question of qualitative standards for projects, and on the use of sinks. The Secretary of State spoke in support of quantitative limits on the use of credits.</p>
	<p pid=".731W.2/5">We agreed three sets of Council Conclusions: supporting the preparation of an EU strategy to reduce atmospheric emissions from seagoing ships; agreeing the EU's position for the 7th Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biodiversity, to be held in Kuala Lumpur in February; and noting the Commission's 2003 environment policy review.</p>
	<p pid=".731W.2/6">The Commission presented its recently-published proposal for a Regulation on the registration, evaluation and authorisation of chemicals ('REACH'), urging the Council to make rapid progress and to maintain the integrity of the Commission's proposal. There were comments from several member states concerning the significance of this dossier, and the need for appropriate input from both the Environment and Competitiveness formations of the Council. Ireland confirmed that this dossier would be a priority during their Presidency, and that they would continue to involve both industry and environment ministers. There was no UK intervention.</p>
	<p pid=".731W.2/7">There was an exchange of views on the Commission's proposal for a Regulation to extend the Financial Instrument for the Environment (LIFE) until 2006. Portugal, Spain, Finland, France, Greece and Poland all expressed support for early agreement, and a wish to see LIFE continue beyond 2006. Germany and Sweden were also supportive but emphasised the need for the extension to take place within the existing financial perspective.</p>
	<p pid=".731W.2/8">The Commission spoke briefly to note that its report on the European Environment Agency was due to be published within days.</p>
	<p pid=".731W.2/9">There was no discussion of the remaining items under Other Business, which were all written items for information.</p>
	<p pid=".731W.2/10">Over lunch we discussed the outcome of the 9th Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Climate Change, and heard from Borge Brende, the Norwegian environment minister, who is to chair the 12th session of the UN Commission on Sustainable Development (CSD12) in April. He informed the ministers present that he has asked the Secretary of State to chair the UNECE Regional Implementation Forum in Geneva on 15&ndash;<phrase class="date" code="2005-01-16">16 January</phrase>, which will help prepare for CSD12.</p>

	<p pid=".732W.2/1">The type of trawl used for survey work varies according to target species and area. In the fisheries of interest to UK fishermen, the main trawls used for surveying bottom living fish are the GOV and the beam trawl.</p>
	<p pid=".732W.2/2">The GOV is a general purpose bottom trawl with a high headline and is used for scientific surveys where the target species are the main commercially important whitefish including cod, haddock, whiting, pout and saithe. The net also samples some of the main shoaling or pelagic species including herring and mackerel. The design and operation of the GOV trawl is co-ordinated by the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea, and all countries involved in the International Bottom Trawl surveys in the North Sea use the GOV trawl with an internationally-agreed specification. In addition to the North Sea, the GOV is used in surveys in the west of Scotland and the eastern English Channel, and has recently been adopted as the main trawl for surveys in the Irish Sea and Celtic Sea.</p>
	<p pid=".732W.2/3">For flatfish species such as plaice and sole, the main gear used is the beam trawl. Scientific surveys in the North Sea, eastern and western English Channel, the Irish Sea and Bristol Channel are again co-ordinated through ICES. The survey trawls are based on the beam trawls used commercially but vary slightly in size and specification between areas.</p>
	<p pid=".732W.2/4">Scientifically, it is desirable that survey trawls remain unchanged over a relatively long time period in order to ensure consistency in the survey catch rates from year to year.</p>

	<p pid=".735W.6/1">The decision to delay the implementation of the landfill allowance trading scheme until 2005 which was announced by the Minister of State for Local and Regional Government on <phrase class="date" code="2003-11-19">19 November 2003</phrase>, was made as part of Defra's contribution to helping to reduce spending pressures on local government in 2004&ndash;05. We expect local authorities to be able to save up to &pound;10 million as a result. (On <phrase class="date" code="2004-01-06">6 January 2004</phrase> we announced that Defra will also provide a targeted grant of &pound;20 million to local authorities in 2004&ndash;05 to help address the spending pressures arising from their statutory recycling targets).</p>
	<p pid=".735W.6/2">The decision reflects the views of local authorities which we received through our consultation on the implementation of the landfill allowance trading scheme, that they needed more time to prepare for this new scheme which is a significant departure from their normal operations. The delay in starting the scheme will mean that waste disposal authorities will have to make steeper annual reductions in the amount of biodegradable waste they landfill in order to meet the first target year of 2010 but they will have more time to plan how to do this.</p>
	<p pid=".735W.6/3">The Government will use the additional time to raise awareness of the scheme within local authorities and to educate and support those who will make use of its provisions.</p>

	<p pid=".736W.2/2">Yes. During regional consultation meetings on the implementation of theLandfill Allowance Trading Scheme held in September 2003, local authorities commented that they would find it difficult to operate the scheme in 2004&ndash;05. This view has been reinforced by the written responses to the consultation that have been analysed to date. Local Authorities generally feel that they need more time to prepare for a trading scheme that is a completely new departure from their normal operations. It has already been announced that the start date will be delayed by one year.</p>

These measures include Article 8 which requires that &quot;any holder of waste has it handled by a private or public waste collector; and Article 15 which provides that &quot;In accordance with the 'polluter pays' principle, the cost of disposing of waste must be borne by.... the holder who has it handled by a waste collector.&quot;</p>

These measures include the arrangements for the collection and disposal of household waste-by-waste collection and disposal authorities. The cost of collection and disposal under these arrangements is met through taxation and charges. Most commercial and industrial waste is collected and disposed of by the private sector under arrangements which comply with the Directive. The cost of collection and disposal under these arrangement is met through charges.</p>

	<p pid=".744W.11/1">Before a bus enters into service it is a requirement, under regulation 8 of the Public Service Vehicles (Carrying Capacity) Regulations 1984, that it has to be marked with the number of passengers, both standees and seated that it may safely carry. Both children and adults are considered as the same within these regulations. If these numbers are exceeded the vehicle would be deemed as operating illegally and then it becomes a matter for the enforcement agencies to pursue.</p>

	<p pid=".745W.5/2">There are no changes to the penalties for the offence of failure to display a valid vehicle licence. Failure to display is normally enforced by fixed penalty.</p>
	<p pid=".745W.5/3">A number of changes are being introduced to strengthen the enforcement of the requirement to license a vehicle (or to make a Statutory Off Road Notification (SORN) if a vehicle is being kept off the road). The registered keeper of a vehicle for which a licence or SORN has not been renewed one month after expiry is now liable for a penalty of &pound;80 (reduced to &pound;40 if paid within 28 days of receiving the penalty notice). To ensure that vehicle keepers have sufficient notice to check that their vehicles are properly licensed, extensive publicity is being given to the changes including information leaflets to all registered keepers during the final month of licence validity. The first penalty notices are likely to be issued in March, in respect of vehicles for which licences have not been renewed from <phrase class="date" code="2004-01-01">1 January 2004</phrase>.</p>

Higher Education institutions wishing to charge higher fees will have to enter into an access agreement with the Office for Fair Access. These access agreements will set out the measures that institutions will take to ensure that students from disadvantaged backgrounds are not deterred from higher education because of higher fees.

	<p pid=".750W.2/1">The available information on the non-continuation of students beyond the first year in each university, and the projected course non-completion rate in each university is contained in &quot;Performance Indicators in Higher Education in the UK&quot;, published by the Higher Education Funding Council for England, a copy of which is available from the House Library. The latest edition, published in December 2003, gives figures for students starting full-time degree courses in the United Kingdom in 2000/01. Table 3 shows that 9 per cent. of students did not continue beyond the first year, and that the projected non-completion rate over the whole course was 16 per cent.</p>
	<p pid=".750W.2/2">No data are held covering those students who drop out of their course after two or three years. Nationally, the non-completion rate has remained broadly the same since 1991/92, a period of considerable expansion of student numbers.</p>
	<p pid=".750W.2/3">Figures published in 2003 by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) show that the UK has one of the lowest non-completion rates among OECD countries.</p>

	<p pid=".770W.6/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2002-10-31">31 October 2002</phrase>, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State announced a radical reform of tourism support in Britain aimed at building stronger, more effective and more coherent arrangements through the creation of a single lead body focusing on marketing. Functions of the British Tourist Authority and the English Tourism Council were merged on <phrase class="date" code="2003-04-01">1 April 2003</phrase> to form VisitBritain, and my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State appointed Sir Michael Lickiss as Chairman.</p>
	<p pid=".770W.6/2">VisitBritain restructured its overseas operations during 2003. In addition to promoting Britain overseas as a tourist destination, VisitBritain is taking forward its new role as lead body for the domestic marketing of England. The England Marketing Advisory Board (EMAB), chaired by Hugh Taylor, was established on <phrase class="date" code="2003-04-01">1 April 2003</phrase> to advise the Board of VisitBritain on domestic marketing, and its domestic marketing strategy was published in November 2003. With EMAB's support, VisitBritain has launched a series of domestic 'Enjoy England' campaigns.</p>
	<p pid=".770W.6/3">The merger enables VisitBritain to use in the domestic market its expertise in marketing Britain internationally, developing more effective partnerships with private investors to support tourism across Britain and building on the success of the Million Visitor Campaign. It brings economies in terms of overheads and central services and it creates opportunities for private industry and the regions to take a stronger leadership role in setting the marketing agenda.</p>

	<p pid=".771W.12/1">Reducing the number of self-inflicted deaths and instances of self-harm in prison establishments is a ministerial and Prison Service priority. A proactive three-year programme to develop policies and practices to reduce prisoner suicide and manage self-harm in prisons commenced in April 2001. The main principles of the strategy apply across all types of prisons and prisoners whether male or female. An investment of over &pound;21 million through the three-year programme is allowing physical improvements (now 75 per cent. complete) to be made at six 'Safer Local' pilot sites, one of which is the women's prison and YOI Eastwood Park.</p>
	<p pid=".771W.12/2">The learning resulting from this programme will benefit all prisoners; meanwhile, women prisoners are to benefit from a specifically targeted and separate suicide prevention and self-harm management strategy being developed for them. This builds upon a number of interventions including: internal improvements in handling population pressures; individual crisis counselling for women prisoners who self-harm; the continued development and evaluation of Dialectical Behaviour Therapy, which is currently being trialled at Durham, Bullwood Hall and Holloway prisons; investment and planning to ensure progress on the detoxification strategy in the Women's Estate; the development (in collaboration with the University of Newcastle) of a new, three-stage screening process to more effectively detect mental health problems; and the introduction of a new training pack for all staff working with women in custody, which includes a module on the health and well being of women prisoners. &pound;1 million from the Department of Health has been allocated to the Women's Estate to be spent on the recruitment of psychiatric nurses, and 11 out of the 17 prisons for women now have mental health in-reach facilities.</p>
	<p pid=".771W.12/3">Brockhill, Eastwood Park, Holloway, New Hall and Styal prisons were among the first establishments to have full-time, dedicated Suicide Prevention Coordinators (SPCs); and now all women's prisons have a designated full or part-time SPC. All women's establishments also deliver suicide awareness training to staff and it is an inherent part of all employees' jobs to observe and report behaviour that may indicate a tendency to self-harm.</p>

	<p pid=".774W.0/1">All new build affordable housing schemes funded by the Government through the Housing Corporation must meet the requirements of 'Part M' of the building regulations, which the Government revised in 1999 to improve the accessibility and convenience of new housing. The revised regulations include requirements to ensure that entrances, lifts, corridors, doorways and WCs are accessible, including to wheelchair users. In addition, all newly built affordable housing schemes funded through the Housing Corporation must comply with the Corporation's scheme development standards, which adopt criteria for accessibility and internal environments that help to make homes even more adaptable to long-term needs.</p>
	<p pid=".774W.0/2">The Government also provides resources for adaptations to existing homes to meet the needs of people with physical disabilities. Local housing authorities have a statutory duty to offer means tested Disabled Facilities Grants (DFGs) to eligible applicants in both the private and social rented sectors who require adaptations to help them live independently in their own homes. The Government meets 60 per cent. of local authority expenditure incurred on DFGs, with the remaining 40 per cent. being met from the authority's own resources. We have increased funding for this grant to &pound;99 million in 2003&ndash;04, compared with &pound;88 million in 2002&ndash;03 and &pound;56 million in 1997&ndash;98.</p>

	<p pid=".777W.8/1">The Zimbabwe Vulnerability Assessment Committee's survey in April last year estimated that approximately 4.4 million people in rural areas and 1.1 million people in urban areas would require food aid during the pre-harvest months of January, February and March 2004. However, it is now clear that this figure is an underestimate and is being revised upwards to 5.1 million people in rural areas. Results of a comprehensive urban vulnerability assessment are yet to be released, but are also expected to show a significant increase in people requiring humanitarian assistance.</p>
	<p pid=".777W.8/2">This increase in beneficiary numbers is partly due to spiralling inflation (now over 600 per cent.), which has affected food prices in shops. There is also emerging evidence of up to several hundred thousand people facing crisis in the former commercial farming areas, most of whom are former farm workers displaced by the Government's disastrous land reform programme. Additionally, the state-controlled Grain Marketing Board has proved erratic and unreliable in contributing to food supply and distribution in the country. Donors are monitoring the situation closely, in close consultation with the World Food Programme.</p>

	<p pid=".778W.2/1">Apart from being a major exporter of food to Zimbabwe, South Africa is also a donor in the on-going humanitarian relief effort. The South African Government donated approximately 58,000 metric tonnes of maize to the previous WFP emergency operation for 2002&ndash;03, and may make a further contribution to the current operation. Accordingly, representatives of the South African Government participate regularly in co-ordination meetings concerning the humanitarian programme in Zimbabwe, where issues such as food imports are discussed.</p>

	<p pid=".792W.0/1">We are awaiting the full written judgment of the Court of Appeal in the Angela Cannings case and therefore it is not possible to make a detailed statement on the implications at this stage.</p>
	<p pid=".792W.0/2">At the Court of Appeal hearing, Lord Justice Judge expressed concern about the difficulties for the trial jury in resolving issues regarding complex scientific evidence in relation to infant death when the present state of scientific knowledge is evolving.</p>
	<p pid=".792W.0/3">He went on to state that the appeal had raised a number of issues of general public interest in relation to infant deaths and the Court of Appeal would therefore need time to reflect on the terms of its judgment.</p>
	<p pid=".792W.0/4">The Crown Prosecution Service has taken note of these comments and will study the full judgment carefully when it is released.</p>
	<p pid=".792W.0/5">Since the written reasons of the Court of Appeal in the case of Sally Clark were made available, and following the acquittal of Trupti Patel, the Crown Prosecution Service has undertaken a number of actions. Interim guidance was sent to all Chief Crown Prosecutors on <phrase class="date" code="2003-06-17">17 June 2003</phrase> requesting that all cases be identified in which either Doctor Williams or Professor Meadow are witnesses and requiring them to serve a copy of the judgement in the Sally Clark case on the defence and to draw attention to sections of the judgement touching on their evidence.</p>
	<p pid=".792W.0/6">Following the appeal of Sally Clark, the Attorney General established a Group comprising representatives of the police, Crown Prosecution Service, Home Office and other relevant agencies to consider whether any cases in which Doctor Williams has given important evidence require a more in depth review.</p>
	<p pid=".792W.0/7">On <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-28">28 July</phrase>, the Group held its first meeting. Progress was made in two areas. Firstly, on how previous cases in which Doctor Alan Williams conducted a post mortem were to be identified and, secondly, what factors would be used to select the cases on which the Group should concentrate.</p>
	<p pid=".792W.0/8">Following that meeting, work commenced immediately on the identification of relevant cases. The Group met a deadline of mid-September for the conclusion of that process. By that date, approximately 50 previous cases had been identified, which dated back between five-seven years. These cases all involved charges of murder, manslaughter or infanticide where Doctor Williams had been instructed by the police to conduct the post mortem and which had resulted in a conviction. The cases themselves are now being individually reviewed. An experienced Metropolitan police officer and a Crown Prosecutor are conducting the review. This work is continuing.</p>
	<p pid=".792W.0/9">When the full written judgement in Angela Cannings is published, the same group will consider whether to extend the review to include cases involving Professor Meadow.</p>
	<p pid=".792W.0/10">The total cost incurred by the Crown Prosecution Service in the case of Sally Clark will eventually be approximately &pound;320,000. That figure comprises counsels' fees, expert witness costs and approximately &pound;50,000 is estimated as being attributable to Crown Prosecution Service staff costs.</p>
	<p pid=".792W.0/11">The costs of the Trupti Patel case are approximately &pound;183,716.63. We cannot provide an estimate of CPS costs for this case at this stage, however, I will write to the hon. Member with those details once known.</p>
	<p pid=".792W.0/12">The costs of the Angela Cannings case have not yet been settled. However, it is estimated that prosecution costs arising from the original trial and the subsequent appeal will be in the region of &pound;220,000.</p>
	<p pid=".792W.0/13">Owing to the way CPS records arc kept, figures on the number of mothers charged with infanticide and mothers charged with the murder of their own children cannot be produced without incurring disproportionate costs.</p>
	<p pid=".792W.0/14">The Crown Prosecution Service was set up by the Prosecution of Offences Act 1985 to take over the conduct of criminal cases instituted by the police (other than some minor cases). It has no statutory power to initiate a review of family court cases in which evidence was given by Professor Meadow.</p>
	<p pid=".792W.0/15">Information on the number of cases in the Family Court in which Professor Meadow has given evidence is not held centrally. The Crown is not usually party to Family Court cases.</p>
	<p pid=".792W.0/16">No guidance to Crown. Prosecutors relating specifically to mothers accused of killing their infant children has been issued.</p>

	<p pid=".796W.2/1">A number of scientific studies have investigated whether there are higher than usual levels of congenital anomalies (birth defects) in populations living near to landfill sites, but no clear picture has emerged.</p>
	<p pid=".796W.2/2">The Government commissioned the Small Area Health Statistics Unit (SAHSU) at Imperial College to carry out a national study (Elliott et al, BMJ 2001; 323: 363&ndash;8, available at <a href="http://www.bmj.com">http://www.bmj.com</a>. A full report is at <a href="http://www.doh.gov.uk/pdfs/reportaug13.pdf">http://www.doh.gov.uk/pdfs/report aug13.pdf</a>). SAHSU found a small increase in congenital anomalies in populations living close to landfill sites. The study has not shown, or indeed could show, a causal link between landfill sites and birth defects. The independent expert Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment (COT) noted that the findings for birth outcomes were not consistent, and that the study provided no evidence that the rates of anomalies increased after sites had opened. COT advised that it is inappropriate to draw firm conclusions from the results. The opinion of COT is at <a href="http://www.doh.gov.uk/cotnonfood/landfill.htm">http://www.doh.gov.uk/cotnonfood/landfill.htm</a>. SAHSU also specifically analysed the data on birth outcomes in populations living near &quot;special waste&quot; landfill sites in Scotland, and found no evidence to suggest an excess risk of congenital anomalies (Morris et al, Scottish Medical Journal 2003; 48: 105&ndash;107, <a href="http://www.smj.org.uk">www.smj.org.uk</a>).</p>
	<p pid=".796W.2/3">The Government have in place a research programme on the impacts on health of landfill sites. The report of one project, which reviewed the potential for chemicals which may be released from landfill sites to affect the unborn child, is at <a href="http://www.doh.gov.uk/landfillrep.pdf">http://www.doh.gov.uk/landfillrep.pdf</a>. The programme also includes reviews of the known causes and the geographical variation of congenital anomalies. Another project, funded by the Environment Agency, is undertaking detailed monitoring of emissions from landfill sites in order to assess the exposure of people living and working nearby. SAHSU is examining the geographical variation of congenital anomalies and is conducting an epidemiological study of Down's syndrome in relation to landfill sites in England and Wales.</p>

	<p pid=".805W.5/1">Stable iodine (of which potassium iodate is only one form) has been used clinically since the 1940s to protect the thyroid glands of patients (both children and adults) being treated with radio-pharmaceuticals which contain radioactive iodine. Potassium iodate is still routinely used in this way to this day. Its efficacy at protecting against the radiation induced thyroid cancer has been known, therefore, for over 60 years. The largest population administration occurred in Poland following the Chernobyl accident where over 9 million doses were administered. No adverse effects were reported and no increase in the rate of thyroid cancer was subsequently seen, unlike in Belorus and Ukraine were stable iodine was not administered to protect the local population.</p>

	<p pid=".806W.2/1">The first full month of daily winter reporting was December. In December, there were an average of 20 National Health Service trusts (out of a total of 155 trusts with accident and emergency departments) per working day reporting operational problems. Such operational problems include the cancellation of elective operations.</p>
	<p pid=".806W.2/2">All strategic health authorities (SHAs) have developed robust winter plans, which set out escalation procedures to cope with increased seasonal demand for health services. The decision on whether a trust should put these escalation procedures into operation is not made by ministers or the Department of Health. Instead, the locally agreed escalation procedures are activated by the trusts themselves, in agreement with local primary care trusts and the SHA. Such an approach allows the local NHS to be timely in dealing with pressures and is in line with the Government policy of Shifting the Balance of Power to the local NHS. If required, the Department of Health will support a SHA in its local management of winter.</p>

	<p pid=".807W.3/2" class="italic">The information requested falls within the responsibility of the National Statistician, who has been asked to reply. Letter from John Pullinger to Mr. Frank Field, dated <phrase class="date" code="2004-01-14">14 January 2004</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid=".807W.3/3" class="indent">The National Statistician has been asked to reply to your request for information on previous and subsequent births of mothers who had a birth registered without a father's name on the birth certificate (a sole registration) in each of the last 30 years. In particular you asked for information on <i>(a)</i> the social class and <i>(b)</i> the mother's age at her first live birth, and for information on how many of subsequent sole registered births the mother had. I am replying in the National Statistician's absence. (147176)</p>
	<p pid=".807W.3/4" class="indent">Information is readily available, from birth registration records, on sole registration births by age of mother. However under the Population (statistics) Acts 1938 and 1960, information on birth order (that is whether a birth is a first birth, second birth etc.) is not collected at birth registration for women who are not married to the father of the child. Table 1, attached, provides information on the number of sole registrations by age of mother in each of the last 30 years (1973&ndash;2002).</p>
	<p pid=".807W.3/5" class="indent">Similarly only limited information is readily available by social class from birth registration records. Social class of mother and father first became available separately from 1986. Only 10 per cent. of births are coded for social class and for around two thirds of sole registrations there is insufficient occupation data to assign a social class. Table 2 provides a summary of the readily available information on social class for sole registered births, 1986 to 2001. In 2001 the National Statistics Socio-Economic Classification was introduced, replacing social class, and from 2002 data are not available by social class.</p>
	<p pid=".807W.3/6" class="indent">To provide information on age at first live birth and on any subsequent sole registration requires successive birth records to be linked together. This can only be done using the ONS Longitudinal Study, a one per cent. sample of the population in which, since 1971, census records and vital events have been linked together. Extracting this information cannot be done in the time available to answer this Parliamentary Question. I will write to you again in two weeks to let you know whether the information available from this study is of sufficient quality to answer your question. You should note that, as there is currently only 30 years of birth registration records in the study, only a small proportion of women in the sample have a complete birth history that allows identification of sole registrations. It is therefore very unlikely that the last part of your question (on the number of subsequent sole registered births) can yet be answered reliably.</p>

	<p pid=".814W.0/1">Despite fears of outsourcing abroad having an adverse effect on UK employment, the performance of the UK labour market over recent years has been strong by both international and historical standards. The UK has the highest employment rate and the lowest unemployment rate among the G7 economies.</p>

	<p pid=".816W.8/3" class="indent">The National Statistician has been asked to reply to your Parliamentary Questions on profitability of UK companies by turnover and also by number of employees. I am replying in his absence. (148180, 148181)</p>
	<p pid=".816W.8/4" class="indent">Unfortunately the Office for National Statistics (ONS) do not produce statistics on profitability of UK companies by turnover or by number of employees. The ONS does produce a quarterly First Release called the Profitability of UK Companies, which is available on the ONS website at: <a href="http://www.statistics.gov.uk/pdfdir/profit0104.pdf">http://www.statistics.gov.uk/pdfdir/profit0104.pdf</a></p>
	<p pid=".816W.8/5" class="indent">The Release shows the profitability of all UK companies and also for United Kingdom continental shelf companies, manufacturing companies and service companies. The profits data used in calculating these estimates comes from a relatively small sample inquiry of companies. The sample is too small to enable us to produce estimates in the detail requested.</p>
