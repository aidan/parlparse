	<p pid=".1W.9/1" class="holdinganswer">holding answer <phrase class="date" code="2003-03-19">19 March 2003</phrase></p>
	<p pid=".1W.9/2">The Government asked the Advisory Committee on Consumer Products and the Environment (ACCPE) to look at environmental labelling as one of its first tasks when it was set up in 1999. Two studies were commissioned to look at the effectiveness of different labelling approaches&mdash;these were &quot;Environmental Labelling of Consumer Products: Lessons for the UK market from existing schemes&quot; (carried out by Ernst &amp; Young and Atlantic Consulting) and an in-depth study of the innovative &quot;TerraChoice&quot; scheme in Canada (carried out by the IEMA and BSI).</p>
	<p pid=".1W.9/3">ACCPE's recommendations on this subject were included in its first report, &quot;Choosing Green&quot; (available on the Department's website). The Committee concluded that it would not be worthwhile setting up a national ecolabelling award scheme for the UK, alongside the existing EU ecolabelling scheme. They considered that the Government should focus its labelling &quot;award&quot; efforts on the EU scheme, but should also develop other approaches for improving the environmental information on products. The other approaches recommended included promoting awareness of the various good quality labelling schemes on the market; raising the standard of self-declared 'green claims' by business; and making full use of the internet. The Government accepted the advice of the Committee and have been following up the detail of these recommendations.</p>
	<p pid=".1W.9/4">Our policy recognises that environmental labelling has a significant part to play in raising consumers' awareness of the environmental impacts of products and in helping them to make informed choices. We have actively supported the EU ecolabelling scheme (having invested over &pound;5 million to date in running and promoting it) and are committed to improving it as a market instrument. We have also actively supported the EU energy label and its extension to an increasing range of products in the single market, as well as looking at the scope for using it in other applications in the UK market, for example on cars and homes.</p>
	<p pid=".1W.9/5">We are also keen to promote awareness of other reliable labelling schemes which target a specific issue or sector, such as the FSC label for sustainable timber and comparative labels for the VOC content of paints. Our consumer information leaflet &quot;Hi I'm Green&quot; contains information about these and other common labels, and a new pocket-sized &quot;shopper's guide&quot; to green labels will be published soon.</p>
	<p pid=".1W.9/6">The Government are also working to improve the quality and quantity of self-declared environmental claims. These are a major source of information for consumers about the environmental impacts of products, so it is important that such claims are clear and helpful. We continue to promote the &quot;Green Claims Code&quot;, which advises businesses on good practice in making green claims, and more detailed guidance is now being prepared in consultation with the relevant business sectors.</p>
	<p pid=".1W.9/7">We are also exploring some more novel approaches to information for purchasers. One of ACCPE's recommendations was for a new Internet information service, perhaps targeted initially on public procurement, and proposals for this are being developed.</p>

	<p pid=".2W.2/1">As far as possible, the relevant enforcement bodies seeks to encourage compliance with the egg marketing legislation through good communication and advice. In common with other aspects of the rules, where a minor discrepancy is discovered, producers will be given guidance on how to comply, and a reminder may be included on the inspection report. In more serious cases, Notices of Contravention will be served requiring compliance before the product can be marketed. Prosecution is normally only considered where serious breaches are found, or where there has been non co-operation in putting things right. In the event of a prosecution, the level of penalty is a matter for the court to decide but the maximum penalty for breaches of the egg marketing regulations is &pound;5,000 per offence.</p>

	<p pid=".3W.2/1">Compliance costs will vary considerably depending on producers' individual circumstances. For producers selling their own ungraded eggs direct to consumers, there will be no additional costs as they fall outside the scope of these rules. Similarly, producers selling eggs through larger registered packing stations will be unaffected as the marking will take place at the packing station. For those producers who package eggs on farm for subsequent marketing, the cost will depend on the size of throughput and the degree of sophistication of the stamping equipment. For very small producers, a hand stamp can be purchased for a few pounds, and the time costs should be minimal. For larger producers, the cost of automated stamping machinery starts at between &pound;2,000 and &pound;3,000.</p>

	<p pid=".3W.8/1">I am determined to make progress to reduce cetacean bycatch. However, effective action to address the problem needs to be taken on the part of all member states involved in the fisheries concerned and the Commission. This is why we raised the need for urgent action to address the issue of cetacean bycatch at the January Council of Ministers' meeting. I have also raised this issue with Commissioner Fischler on a number of occasions both in writing and in personal contacts. I have also recently written to the Commission to press for urgent action to widen observer coverage off the south west coast where a number of other member states' vessels fish. I was pleased that the Commission included a commitment to take action in this area in papers produced as part of the recent reform of the Common Fisheries Policy. I am now looking for positive action in advance of 2004&ndash;05 in response to our recent approaches.</p>
	<p pid=".3W.8/2">In the meantime, DERA has also committed some &pound;140,000 for trials into the use of exclusion devices developed by the Sea Mammal Research Unit (SMRU) to reduce the bycatch of cetaceans in the offshore bass fishery. I will also, along with the devolved administrations, shortly be issuing a consultation document outlining a UK bycatch response strategy. This will set out the extent of our knowledge of bycatch in UK waters and make proposals for action to address the bycatch problem. The document will be placed in the Library of the House and I will ensure that my hon. Friend receives a personal copy.</p>

It is analysed on a monthly basis and the results are circulated to the relevant enforcement authorities. These reports are not published documents since they contain sensitive information which is relevant to the targeting of enforcement activity. We shall shortly publish the report on the risk assessment of the import of meat and meat products contaminated with foot and mouth disease virus. That report includes analysis of the overall risk by world region of origin. A copy will be placed in the Libraries of both Houses.</p>

On the second occasion they x-rayed canisters in situ. All canisters examined were found to be empty. The canisters were not of a type suitable for use as ordnance or to contain gas and they did not contain any mechanism that would allow them to disperse their contents into the environment.

	</table>
	<p pid=".8W.2/12">Main sources of offsetting income for DESO are three Government to Government project offices, where the customer country pays Ministry of Defence costs, and the Disposal Services Agency where costs are met from revenue.</p>
	<p pid=".8W.2/13">DESO raises other sources of income from charging industry for activities undertaken on their behalf where Government independence from industry is not essential and when costs can be directly identified, calculated and recovered from individual companies. On this basis charges are raised for a proportion of the costs of the following activities: demonstrations of defence equipment overseas, demonstrations of defence equipment in the United Kingdom, Market Research and Publications, DESO Symposium and Seminars, and charging for Inward Visits. Savings to the defence budget come from spreading the fixed overhead cost of equipment over the longer production runs generated by exports, from the sale of surplus military equipment to overseas governments and from Commercial Exploitation Levy receipts on exports of equipment developed using public money.</p>

	<p pid=".8W.5/1">Co-operation on military capabilities is taking place within the EU and NATO and through bilateral agreements, and is a subject of regular ministerial discussion.</p>
	<p pid=".8W.5/2">Within the EU, the European Capabilities Action Plan is fostering co-operation between member states to fill specific shortfalls against the Helsinki Headline Goal. NATO's capabilities initiative&mdash;the Prague Capabilities Commitment&mdash;also aims to strengthen European capabilities and complements the ECAP/Headline Goal process. We are working to ensure that EU and NATO capability development is closely co-ordinated and mutually reinforcing, most recently through agreement on a mechanism as part of the Berlin Plus arrangements, and the United Kingdom plays an active part in both. By encouraging co-operation in pursuit of agreed force goals, these two initiatives help to ensure the coherency of capabilities between member states and Allies. We also seek to maximize efficiencies through bilateral defence co-operation&mdash;for example, in our plan with France to harmonise activity cycles and training for our aircraft carriers.</p>

	<p pid=".9W.2/1">I have regular discussions with my NATO and European Union counterparts, both bilaterally and in the framework of each organisation.</p>
	<p pid=".9W.2/2">The current scope of EU Security and Defence Policy (ESDP) is defined in the EU Treaty as &quot;humanitarian and rescue tasks, peacekeeping tasks and tasks of combat forces in crisis management, including peacemaking&quot;, the so-called &quot;Petersberg Tasks&quot;. In the Convention on the Future of Europe, the United Kingdom has proposed modernising and extending the list, to reflect the range of roles the EU should be aiming to play in crisis management and to broaden the ESDPs proactive role in wider conflict prevention, for example by adding stabilisation, conflict prevention, and defence outreach/diplomacy. Decisions on a new EU Treaty are for the Intergovernmental Conference, and these matters have not yet been discussed internationally at ministerial level.</p>
	<p pid=".9W.2/3">The Headline Goal agreed at the Helsinki European Council in 1999 stated that member states should, within the overall target, &quot;provide smaller rapid response elements available and deployable at very high readiness&quot;. This subject was recently discussed at the General Affairs and External Relations Council in November 2002, at informal meetings of EU Defence Ministers in October 2002 and March 2003, and at bilateral meetings such as with the French Defence Minister in Le Touquet last month where we noted the need to improve further European capabilities in planning and deploying forces at short notice, including initial deployment of land, sea and air forces within 5&ndash;10 days.</p>
	<p pid=".9W.2/4">At the NATO Summit in Prague last year, Heads of State and Government agreed to create a NATO Response Force (NRF). Further work on the NRF concept is currently being undertaken by the Military Committee in NATO, aiming to achieve an initial operating capability by no later than October 2004. Each nation has a single set offerees which may be used nationally, or in NATO, EU or coalition operations, and ultimately it is up to nations to decide when and where to commit their forces. We are working to ensure that the work on NRF and on rapid response elements under the EU Headline Goal is mutually reinforcing</p>

It also allows the United Kingdom to react flexibly and more rapidly to emerging crises and to opportunities for peace building.</p>
	<p pid=".12W.8/2">Conflict prevention expenditure from the three Departments was brought together in two pooled budgets&mdash;one for sub-Saharan Africa and one for the rest of the world. Programme funds for conflict prevention in sub-Saharan Africa are included as a ring-fenced element in the Department for International Development's Departmental Expenditure Limit. Programme funds for conflict prevention in the rest of the world are included in the Foreign and Commonwealth Office's Departmental Expenditure Limit. Both pools are managed jointly by the three departments and funds are transferred between relevant Departments to cover expenditure incurred in pursuit of commonly-agreed objectives. Since the pools' inception there have therefore been a number of transfers between pool partners associated with their management. The amounts and purposes of these transfers are set out in the relevant Estimates, all of which are available in the Library of the House.</p>

	<p pid=".13W.8/1">The Urban Operations Study contract is expected to be let towards the end of April 2003 subject to completion of the competitive bid assessment and contract negotiation process. The Study is expected to last for up three years. While contract values can not be confirmed until the tender assessment process is complete it is likely that the study will be valued at about &pound;2.5 million. Supporting contracts will also be let with QinetiQ and DSTL to assist and manage the analysis of the data collected and help convert this into prioritised user requirements in order to support equipment programming action. Equipment tested and prioritised for acquisition would enter service from 2005. Future acquisition could, however, be subject to normal affordability considerations.</p>

	<p pid=".15W.2/31">In addition, over the past six months the Ministry of Defence has piloted on-line reverse auctions which are a means of buying items or services against a published specification where pre-selected industrial partners are invited to bid in an on-line auction. In the Defence Procurement Agency (DPA) the Battlefield Infrastructure Integrated Project Team has used this technique to purchase battlefield survey equipment and within in the Defence Logistics Organisation (DLO) the Non-Project Procurement Organisation has used the technique to purchase cleaning products, resilient mounts and anti-freeze. Both DPA and DLO are planning to run further reverse auctions over the coming months, and the Department's corporate requirement for utilising the technique is now being scoped with a view to introducing such a capability during the next financial year.</p>
	<p pid=".15W.2/32">The Disposal Services Agency will begin piloting an &quot;e-Trade exchange&quot; in April providing information to other Government departments on the availability of surplus MOD IT equipment which is available for purchase. The Disposal Services Agency website (<a href="http://www.disposalsservicesagency.mod.uk">www.disposalsservicesagency.mod.uk</a>) aims to provide information to explain how to purchase Ministry of Defence surpluses either as a business or a member of the public as well as to explain the Agency's role in selling MOD surplus assets.</p>
	<p pid=".15W.2/33">The MOD has recently published &quot;Defence e-Business: Understanding the Commercial Issues&quot; in collaboration with the Defence Industries Council, and this publication provides guidance on the subject for both MOD staff and industry colleagues. The guide can be viewed online at <a href="http://www.contracts.uk">www.contracts.uk</a>. A hard copy version has also been produced and I am arranging for copies of this to be placed in the Libraries of both Houses.</p>
	<p pid=".15W.2/34">The MOD is keen to embrace the technological advantages provided by e-Business to support the full range of procurement activities. To this end we are investing substantial sums of money, as well as consulting with industry, to ensure that these new technologies realise mutual benefits to the MOD and Industry.</p>

Information on the total cost of Operation Desert Fox cannot be reliably differentiated from the overall costs of military operations in the Gulf. The Ministry of Defence identifies the costs of operations in terms of the net additional costs it has incurred. The costs which the Ministry of Defence would have incurred had the operation not been undertaken for example&mdash;expenditure on wages and salaries or on conducting training exercises&mdash;are deducted from the total costs of the operation. The following table sets out the overall additional expenditure incurred by the Ministry of Defence as a direct result of operations in the Gulf in 1998&ndash;99 and 1999&ndash;2000, primarily enforcement of the No Fly Zones. Costs include operating costs for aircraft enforcing the No Fly Zones&mdash;primarily fuel and maintenance, plus the cost of maintaining personnel in-theatre. In-theatre costs include accommodation and utilities, equipment, plant, machinery, vehicles and allowances.</p>

These relate to the Ministry of Defence's nuclear operations, the contactorisation of the Atomic Weapons Establishment, the privatisation of the Dockyards at Rosyth and Devonport, the Defence Evaluation and Research Agency and the sale of Service married quarters. As the B14 statement shows, the nature of some of these liabilities makes it impossible to quantify their individual value. Accordingly, it is not possible to cost the overall value of these liabilities. The total value of those liabilities which can be quantified, is &pound;16,855.5 million.</p>

	<p pid=".22W.2/1">We meet the Association of Chief Police Officers regularly both at ministerial and official level to discuss a wide range of issues. On this issue of illegal occupation of land, the Association of Chief Police Officers were consulted. They made comments on our proposals announced in July 2002, that we intended to bring forward new eviction powers for police to deal with unauthorised encampments, where local authorities have made adequate site provision, without the preconditions found in the current legislation. We hope to bring forward the new powers once parliamentary time allows.</p>

It is important that all criminal justice agencies make progress in a joined-up and consistent way according to common standards, requirements and timetables.

	<p pid=".25W.6/1">The climate change levy is an environmental protection measure and is designed to avoid damaging the competitiveness of UK manufacturing. The levy's impact on individual manufacturing businesses will depend on the extent to which they take advantage of the various levy exemptions, the scheme of enhanced capital allowances for energy efficiency, and energy support from the Carbon Trust; and whether their sites qualify for a discount from the levy.

	<p pid=".25W.9/1">My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry represented the UK at the Competitiveness Council <phrase class="date" code="2003-03-03">3 March 2003</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".25W.9/2">Ministers at the Council reached an agreement on the Community Patent. The agreement combines new proposals on jurisdiction and distribution of patent fees with text agreed under the Spanish Presidency on languages and the role of patent offices.</p>
	<p pid=".25W.9/3">The main elements of the agreement include a unitary jurisdiction enforced by a single panel of the Court of First Instance, in Luxembourg, and a transitional period for enforcement of the patent by national courts to end by 2010 at the latest. On languages member states agreed that the regime for the Community patent should involve translations of the claims part of the patent document into all Community languages. They also agreed that the larger part of fee income should be redistributed according to measures of patent activity.</p>
	<p pid=".25W.9/4">The Presidency invited comments on the Report of the Competitiveness Council's input to the Spring European Council. Among other things, the report stresses the need for increased co-ordination between member states to create the European Research Area (ERA), a true internal market for science and knowledge, through the open method of co-ordination. This should firstly be applied to a number of research-related areas, such as the objective of raising European research spending to 3 per cent. of EU average gross domestic product (GDP), up from the current 1.9 per cent.</p>
	<p pid=".25W.9/5">The report highlighted the Competitiveness Council role as the 'guardian of competitiveness', ensuring that the effects of all measures taken on the competitiveness of European industry and services are fully taken into account in policy making. Impact assessment was the key to achieving the right balance between the three pillars of sustainable development: economic, social and environmental. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry said that the new Council formation was still building competence and credibility; there was scope for a more ambitious input next year, which should be based on an integrated framework prepared by the High Level Group for Competitiveness and Growth. In particular, this should develop the Council's horizontal role in assessing the work of other Councils for its effects on competitiveness.</p>
	<p pid=".25W.9/6">There was a public debate on entrepreneurship that allowed member states to emphasise SMEs' crucial role in job creation, growth and innovation in Europe, and the need to better integrate the different policies enhancing entrepreneurship. Several member states, including the UK, mentioned the need to organise information campaigns to improve the image of entrepreneurship, to cut red tape, to improve the access to financing and to public procurement, and to cooperate actively at the regional and local level. The Council adopted conclusions on &quot;The Promotion of Entrepreneurship and Small Firms&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".25W.9/7">The Commission presented its initiative to simplify the Community's legal acquis. Work will be divided into two stages, the first involving consolidation and codification of legal texts thereby reducing the sheer number of pages of EU law. The second stage begin to reduce legal obligations on economic operators.</p>
	<p pid=".25W.9/8">Commissioner Busquin presented the Green Paper on European Space Policy. The paper forms the basis of a consultation, to be held from <phrase class="date" code="2005-01-22">22 January</phrase> to <phrase class="date" code="2003-05-30">30 May 2003</phrase>. The Presidency announced that an in-depth discussion on European Space Policy would take place at the next meeting of the Competitiveness Council on 12&ndash;<phrase class="date" code="2003-05-13">13 May 2003</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".25W.9/9">A progress report by the Commission summarised the state of play of negotiations on the ITER (International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor) nuclear fusion energy research project. A full progress report will be presented at the Competitiveness Council on 12&ndash;<phrase class="date" code="2005-05-13">13 May</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".25W.9/10">The Spanish and French delegations underlined the importance of the ITER project. They both confirmed their application to host the ITER facility. A consensus on a draft international agreement to fulfil the ITER, including the site and the cost-sharing scheme between partners, is envisaged for the end of 2003.</p>
	<p pid=".25W.9/11">The Commission outlined a timetable for their work on the proposed Chemicals Directive. The main elements of this were: an orientation debate to be held in the college before Easter and a five-week internet consultation with business and stakeholders and formal proposals adopted before the summer break. The Commission fully recognised the need to get the right balance between the protection of the environment, jobs and innovation.</p>
	<p pid=".25W.9/12">The Council reviewed progress on the Directive on takeover bids, presented by the Commission on <phrase class="date" code="2002-10-02">2 October 2002</phrase>. This was followed by an exchange of views. The UK said the Presidency text was a good step towards reaching the necessary level playing field. Commissioner Bolkestein said the Commission would welcome any agreement that goes further than their proposal to achieve a level playing field, provided that it is acceptable both to the Council and to the Parliament.</p>
	<p pid=".25W.9/13">The Commission introduced its recently adopted proposal for a directive harmonising rules on the enforcement of intellectual property rights, aimed to combat large scale counterfeiting and actions with significant effects on right holders.</p>
	<p pid=".25W.9/14">Under other business Germany tabled a short paper on implementation of EU directives into national law. Germany suggested that the Commission should consider making a legal assessment as to whether national authorities have correctly implemented EU law when it receives notification of this implementation. The Commission argued that they already do this, when they collate information for the biannual Single Market Scoreboard. They were though willing to engage in further dialogue with Germany to improve systems.</p>
	<p pid=".25W.9/15">The Portuguese delegation presented to the Council the third &quot;EUREKA meets Asia&quot; event, to be held in Macao in May. The event aims to strengthen the relationship between European and Asian, and particularly Chinese, businesses.</p>

	<p pid=".32W.5/1">The proposed new EC public procurement Directive provides various ways for contracting authorities to take environmental criteria into account at the selection (pre-tender) stage of the procurement process. In selecting suppliers to tender on the basis of their technical capability, environmental matters may be taken into account where justified by the subject of the contract. For works and services contracts, evidence of environmental management measures that the supplier will be able to apply when executing the contract can also be required by the contracting authority, where these are relevant to the subject of the contract. In addition, contracting authorities may exclude suppliers from tendering if they have been convicted of an offence concerning professional conduct, or have been guilty of grave professional misconduct. These can include relevant environmental issues.</p>
	<p pid=".32W.5/2">Environmental issues can also be taken into account at other stages of the procurement process. For example, contracting authorities have a great deal of scope to take environmental issues into consideration when defining the subject of the contract, and drawing up the specifications.</p>

	<p pid=".38W.0/1">We have received several representations from individuals and representative bodies on a number of higher education matters, including academic pay. While pay levels are a matter for negotiation between employers and staff, the Government are concerned that higher education institutions should be able to recruit, retain and reward the high quality staff they need. That is why we announced in the recent White Paper that spending on higher education will rise from a total of &pound;7.5 billion in 2002&ndash;03 to almost &pound;10 billion in 2005&ndash;06. This includes &pound;50 million in 2004&ndash;05 and &pound;117 million in 2005&ndash;06 in addition to the total of &pound;330 million for the three years up to 2003&ndash;04 specifically to help with the recruitment, retention and reward of all staff and, in particular, to value and reward good teachers. It also includes 'golden hellos' for 1,000 new lecturers in shortage subjects worth &pound;9,000 over three years' service. We are also introducing a range of measures to raise the status of teaching in higher education. New professional standards will be agreed by 2004&ndash;05 and from 2006 all new teaching staff will be expected to have a teaching competence which meets the standards. Centres of Excellence in teaching will be established to reward good teaching at departmental level and to promote best practice, and the current National Teaching Fellowships Scheme will be increased in size to offer substantial rewards to twice as many outstanding teachers. The Government also support the proposed new teaching quality Academy being set up by the HE sector and considers that the Academy will play a major role in supporting and developing the profession of teaching.</p>

In 1999 we introduced a statutory requirement on schools to frame anti-bullying policies, in consultation with the school community. We supported that with a guidance pack for schools entitled 'Bullying: don't suffer in silence' with an accompanying video aimed at pupils, which was updated and relaunched in September 2002. We have developed a linked website at <a href="http://www.dfes.qov.uk/bullying">www.dfes.qov.uk/bullying</a>, and funded the ChildLine programme of research into children and young people's views on bullying and how to tackle it.</p>

	<p pid=".39W.9/1">The Learning and Skills Council (LSC) does not count the number of FE colleges with business partnerships. We are going to receive &quot;employer engagement&quot; as part of delivery contracts.</p>
	<p pid=".39W.9/2">However, many FE colleges have already developed effective business partnerships, most recently through the creation of Centres of Vocational Excellence (CoVE), which are focused on meeting the skills needs of employers. Currently 137 FE colleges in England have a CoVE, including three CoVEs in the Bedfordshire &amp; Luton LSC area. By March 2006 we will have created 400 CoVEs nationally.</p>
	<p pid=".39W.9/3">From April local Strategic Area Reviews will be used in part to assess the links FE colleges have with employers and to ensure that the pattern of provision matches local skill needs.</p>
	<p pid=".39W.9/4">From August, colleges will agree three year development plans with their local LSC. Funding for the sector will be allocated in return for each college meeting key headline targets, including targets for employer engagement. The targets will be specific to the mission and role each college will play in responding to local skill needs.</p>

Currently, therefore, it is not possible to offer a realistic estimate of the number of children with dyslexia.</p>

Following that study, it is proposed that from 2004, schools and local education authorities will be required to provide information on a range of SEN, including specific learning difficulties, such as dyslexia. It is expected that maintained nursery provision will be covered by the requirement as well as primary, secondary and special schools.</p>
	<p pid=".41W.2/3">Based on information taken from the individualised student records, as collected by the Learning Skills Council for the academic year 2000&ndash;01, the only year for which full data are available, there were 20,400 students in further education colleges in England indicating their main learning difficulty as dyslexia.</p>

	<p pid=".55W.2/2" class="italic">Local Transport&mdash;Centres of Excellence initiative:</p>
	<p pid=".55W.2/3">In March 2001, the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions designated 16 English local authorities, or groups of local authorities, as Centres of Excellence for Local Transport Planning. This followed a competitive process, in which the Department, with the help of independent experts, assessed bidders on the quality of their Local Transport Plans, their target-setting and monitoring abilities, and their willingness to share experience and good practice with others. All bidders were notified of the results at the same time. In a separate initiative, Cornwall county council was designated a Centre of Excellence for Rural Transport, also in March 2001. There were no additional Centre of Excellence designations during 2001 or 2002. The Department for Transport now has responsibility for both schemes.</p>
	<p pid=".55W.2/4" class="italic">Secure Station Scheme:</p>
	<p pid=".55W.2/5">The Secure Stations Scheme was launched in April 1998. The scheme awards Secure Stations status and certification to those stations that reach specified standards in crime management, station design, station management and passenger perceptions. The award is for a two year period, after which the station can apply for reaccreditation. During 2001, 60 stations were awarded either accreditation or reaccreditation; during 2002, the figure was 76. There are currently 170 stations (both mainline and underground) accredited under the Scheme. <i>The Prince Michael International Road Safety Awards:</i></p>
	<p pid=".55W.2/6">The Department is one of many partners ranging from national Governments to consumer and motoring groups involved in Euro New Car Assessment Programme (NCAP). This is an independent organisation that carries out crash tests of new cars and then publishes the results. The test programme is carried out in phases and the results are published by Euro NCAP twice a year. The cars tested are awarded between 1 to 5 stars, indicating the level of crash protection offered.</p>
	<p pid=".55W.2/7">The Department contributes to the Prince Michael International Road Safety Awards, run by the Prince Michael Trust. The Department comments on candidates for awards in its capacity as a member of the Prince Michael Road Safety Advisory Board.</p>

	<p pid=".57W.0/1">The principal cause of delays at the Dartford crossing is the capacity of the crossing and the surrounding network. Research published in August 2001 suggested that use of the Dartford crossing would grow more rapidly if there were no charge to use the crossing. Using 1997 as a base year the forecast was that traffic would be 17.6 per cent. higher in 2003 if there was no charge, compared to the situation if charging was maintained at the same level.</p>
	<p pid=".57W.0/2">A significant increase in the level of traffic could have an adverse impact on the local community and users of the crossing in terms of health, the economy and the environment.</p>

	<p pid=".67W.2/1">There are approximately 800 million hungry people in the world. In May 2001, we published our strategy in the paper &quot;Eliminating Hunger&quot;. This outlines our approach for achieving the Millennium Development Goal on hunger to reduce the proportion of hungry people in the world by half by 2015.</p>
	<p pid=".67W.2/2">It is important to increase recognition that poverty rather than a country's lack of self sufficiency in food is the principal cause of hunger. The performance of the agricultural sector is however key to improved livelihoods and sustained poverty reduction. Lack of technology is not the sole or major cause of poor productivity in the agricultural sector. In many countries, agricultural productivity has been declining while existing productivity increasing technologies remain unused. A poor policy environment and limited international market opportunities resulting from developed country trade and agricultural policies are significant factors. Improving agriculture's performance will require removing these fundamental policy impediments, in addition to technology and innovation.</p>
	<p pid=".67W.2/3">There will always be a need for improved varieties of crops, livestock and fish with characteristics that meet the needs of the poor, and modern biotechnologies and conventional approaches to selection and improvement both have a role to play in developing these. Developing countries must have the opportunity to make their own informed decisions on whether or not to adopt modern biotechnologies based on an assessment of the risks and benefits from their safe development and use. Developed countries have a responsibility to help developing countries build the capacity to make these choices.</p>

	<p pid=".67W.5/1">60 per cent. of the people of Iraq&mdash;around 16 million people&mdash;are currently totally dependent on the UN Oil for Food Programme (OFF). We have had many discussions on the continuation of the OFF programme with the UN Secretariat, Security Council members and others. I discussed this with Kofi Annan and his senior officials during my visit to New York on <phrase class="date" code="2005-03-19">19 March</phrase>. Preparations are in hand for a new Security Council Resolution to allow the UN Secretary General to take charge of the Oil for Food (OFF) programme. A draft resolution will be tabled very soon.</p>
	<p pid=".67W.5/2">The UK has been in discussion with the UN humanitarian agencies, Red Cross/Red Crescent Movement and international NGOs to determine what resources they require to procure food to cover any temporary gap in the programme. We have committed &pound;20 million to support the contingency preparations of these partners (covering food and other relief). This includes &pound;8 million for the World Food Programme. We have set aside a further &pound;70 million for the immediate humanitarian response and are considering further assistance in line with emerging humanitarian needs.</p>
	<p pid=".67W.5/3">DFID also provides 19 per cent. of EC funding for Iraq. The EC has committed 21 million euros to the immediate response, and the UK will support the Commission's request to the budgetary authorities for additional humanitarian assistance to Iraq.</p>
	<p pid=".67W.5/4">The current mandate for OFF runs until <phrase class="date" code="2003-06-03">3 June 2003</phrase>. It is too early to plan in detail what might happen beyond that date.</p>

	<p pid=".68W.2/2">The immediate responsibility for humanitarian relief lies with the military and both the UK and the US have made preparation. The UN is ready to take forward its humanitarian operations as soon as this is possible. DFID has provided funding to the UN and relevant NGO's to enable them to make preparations. A flash appeal for funds will issue from the UN shortly. Work is also in hand to provide authority to the Secretary General to put in place an Iraqi transitional government so that the international community can come together to support reconstruction. Both the IMF and the World Bank are prepared to engage but need a legally competent government in place.</p>
	<p pid=".68W.2/3">There is urgent need for a UN resolution to enable the Secretary General to keep the Oil for Food programme going. This provides $10 billion worth of relief annually. Work is in hand to secure such a resolution.</p>

	<p pid=".69W.0/1">There are a number of possible humanitarian scenarios. The UN is currently planning on a 'medium case' scenario. This assumes severe disruption to critical infrastructure and the Iraqi Government's capacity to deliver basic food and relief. Shortages of fuel and power could shut down water and sewage treatment plants. Up to half the population could be without access to potable water and up to 10 million people may require food assistance during and immediately after conflict.</p>
	<p pid=".69W.0/2">We have been fully engaged in recent months in trying to get the international community to face the humanitarian risks of military action in Iraq, and to make preparations. There has been close collaboration between DFID and the Ministry of Defence to minimise the humanitarian impact of any conflict. A key aim is to minimise damage to the infrastructure on which the Oil for Food distribution network depends, in order that it can be re-established as quickly as possible after any conflict. This is the key to the avoidance of a humanitarian crisis.</p>

	<p pid=".73W.0/1">I have no plans at present to discuss the deaths of Brian Peters and Malcolm Rennie with the Indonesian and Australian Governments.</p>
	<p pid=".73W.0/2">The Permanent Under Secretary of State at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office discussed the UN investigation into the Balibo murders with the UN Special Representative of the Secretary General (SRSG) to East Timor in November 2002. The SRSG explained that the investigation is unable to proceed until the Indonesian Government permits the interviewing of Indonesian witnesses. I refer the hon. Member to my answer of <phrase class="date" code="2003-02-25">25 February 2003</phrase>, <phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2003-02-25.434W"><i>Official Report</i>, column 434W</phrase>, to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/807" name="Ann Clwyd">my hon. Friend the Member for Cynon Valley (Ann Clwyd)</phrase>, for details of when we last raised this matter with the Indonesian authorities.</p>
	<p pid=".73W.0/3">The FCO papers from 1975&ndash;76, released in November 2002, show that the Australian Government led on this issue as all five journalists were based in Australia and were working for Australian TV stations at the time of their deaths. The Australian Government raised the case with Indonesia but their attempts to obtain clarification had only limited success.</p>
	<p pid=".73W.0/4">We are unable to provide details of when the British government first made representations to the Indonesian government about the deaths of Malcolm Rennie and Brian Peters. There would be disproportionate costs involved in researching the answer, as we would have to look through around 25 years' of files, and if, as is possible, the relevant papers were put on a consular file, these files would have been destroyed seven years after the last action they record.</p>
	<p pid=".73W.0/5">The FCO has released all its files from 1975&ndash;76 relevant to the Balibo murders. No papers were withheld from the files that were released, but minor deletions were made to a few documents in accordance with Sections 3(4) and 5(1) of the Public Record Acts. The hon. Member may wish to consult the files at the Public Record Office. I do not wish at this stage to comment on the decisions made by the then Government on their handling of the Balibo murders.</p>

	<p pid=".74W.2/1">International action against torture is a priority for the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. An anti-torture initiative to tackle torture throughout the world was launched in October 1998. Phase three of the initiative was launched on <phrase class="date" code="2002-06-26">26 June 2002</phrase>. As part of this initiative, which included diplomatic activity, support for regional organisations and practical projects, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office launched two rounds of worldwide lobbying for the universal ratification of the UN Convention against Torture. Since we began lobbying 25 states have ratified. We plan to launch a third round of lobbying this year focusing on implementation of obligations as well as ratification. Last year the UK Government also undertook a widespread lobbying campaign to support the Optional Protocol to the UN Convention against Torture. We believe the Protocol offers the best means available to establish an effective international mechanism to combat torture through mandatory visits by national and international independent monitoring committees to places of detention in signatory states. The Optional Protocol was adopted at the UN General Assembly in December 2002. The UK Government are now working to secure early ratification.</p>

	<p pid=".77W.0/1">During 2002&ndash;03, Warrington Primary Care Trust provided &pound;100,000 in respect of the rapid respiratory team. The PCT also invests in drugs for the care and treatment of asthma. These drugs are also used for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and as such it is not possible to separate the drug costs for asthma from COPD. In addition, there will also be costs associated with hospital admissions, out-patient attendance and the asthma clinics which are organised by all general practitioner practices in Warrington. However, a breakdown of these costs is not available.</p>
	<p pid=".77W.0/2">Data for the number of practice nurses trained in asthma management for the north-west area are not held centrally. A survey was undertaken by Warrington PCT in December 2002. 22 practices, or 73 per cent. responded and confirmed that between them there were 30 asthma trained nurses. This represents 0.15 nurses per 1,000 total population for the Warrington area based on the Warrington PCT December 2002 survey.</p>

	<p pid=".82W.2/1">In the early 1990s, there was considerable concern about the use of confidentiality clauses in commercial leases. However, the University of Reading 2000 report for the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions on leasing flexibility found that use of confidentiality clauses in commercial leases was rare.</p>
	<p pid=".82W.2/2">Banning confidentiality clauses in commercial leases would be a serious interference with freedom of contract, which the Government would not undertake lightly. Nevertheless the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister would be concerned at any re-emergence of this practice, under which landlords concealed concessionary terms given to tenants from the general market in order to sustain unrealistically high rents.</p>
	<p pid=".82W.2/3">The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors have issued guidance to surveyors that parties to commercial leases should avoid unnecessary secrecy in their transactions, in the interests of market transparency. In the first instance the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister would look to the professional bodies to discourage the use of confidentiality clauses.</p>

	<p pid=".95W.2/1">The information is as follows:</p>
	<p pid=".95W.2/2">LOCCS (various court-based IT systems): The EDS (LOCCs) contract was awarded to EDS in September 1996, to provide IT systems to Crown and county courts. The lifetime cost of the contract is assessed at &pound;124 million, and expenditure in 2001&ndash;02 totalled &pound;33 million.</p>
	<p pid=".95W.2/3">The initial rollout of equipment to courts was completed in August 2001. The contract was fully functional from award. The contract includes provisions to test software prior to release, and to fix software 'bugs' which are attributable to supplier software.</p>
	<p pid=".95W.2/4">The LOCCS rollout was completed to time, and subsequent major work programmes have been delivered to time.</p>
	<p pid=".95W.2/5">ARAMIS (Resource Accounting and Management Information System): This is a PFI contract for the provision of accounting, financial, HR/payroll and management information services. It was awarded in December 1997 and runs until January 2007. Its current anticipated life-time cost is &pound;192 million, which includes enhancements to the service.</p>
	<p pid=".95W.2/6">Most services have IT elements and are delivered across an IT infrastructure provided through the contract. However, the IT system elements of the contract are not separated out from the main business functions. All the services are being provided within the lifetime of the contract, and major work programmes have been delivered to time. Debugging of the IT system elements is a process which continues through the lifetime of the contract.</p>
	<p pid=".95W.2/7">Libra (magistrates courts IT systems): The contract signed in July 2002 varied from the original contracts. It included the provision of Libra infrastructure and Office Automation only. These have been successfully rolled out to over 90 per cent. of the magistrates courts. Five (of 42) MCCs remain in the rollout programme and these will be completed by spring 2003. The Office Automation software consists of 'off-the-shelf' Microsoft Office software which does not require debugging.</p>
	<p pid=".95W.2/8">The original contracts for Libra included provision for a bespoke case management software application for magistrates courts. This is now being sourced through two other contracts, the combined value of which is expected to be &pound;86 million. These contracts include provisions to test the software prior to release, and to fix software &quot;bugs&quot; which are attributable to supplier software.</p>
	<p pid=".95W.2/9">The contract with Fujitsu Services for the delivery of Libra has been varied twice since initial completion in December 1998. This has resulted in changes to the baseline making it inappropriate to compare spend to date across an original and two variants of the contract. The actual spend against the contract can be summarised as follows:</p>
	<p pid=".95W.2/10" class="indent">Original ICL Contract Dec 1998: Total contracted charges expected to arise over contract life of 10.5 years&mdash;&pound;184 million.</p>
	<p pid=".95W.2/11" class="indent">Negotiated ICL Contract May 2000: Total contracted charges expected to arise over contract life of 14.5 years&mdash;&pound;319 million</p>
	<p pid=".95W.2/12" class="indent">Negotiated Fujitsu Services Contract July 2002: Total contract charges expected to arise over contract life of 8.5 years&mdash;&pound;232 million</p>

	<p pid=".97W.2/1">The costs of the Libra project are set out in the National Audit Office's report: &quot;New IT systems for Magistrates Courts: The Libra project&quot; published on <phrase class="date" code="2003-01-29">29 January 2003</phrase> as ISBN:0102920362. Officials gave evidence on this report to the Public Accounts Committee on <phrase class="date" code="2003-02-10">10 February 2003</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".97W.2/2">The headline costs are published in the report and show the original total project cost as at December 1998 to be &pound;194 million. The fully delivered project is expected to cost &pound;390 million. This &pound;390 million breaks down as:</p>
	<p pid=".97W.2/3" class="indent">Contract costs: &pound;318 million (&pound;232 million for the infrastructure contract with Fujitsu Services and an estimated &pound;86 million for the two separate contracts for core application services and system integration.</p>
	<p pid=".97W.2/4" class="indent">Internal project costs: &pound;12 million</p>
	<p pid=".97W.2/5" class="indent">Additional costs: &pound;60 million (required for staff, legal and procurement advisers, costs for migration, extended legacy system costs and other enhancements to the infrastructure service which are yet to be contracted for)</p>
	<p pid=".97W.2/6">The project cost at December 1998 cannot be directly compared with the current proposal; since December 1998 the contracts underpinning the project have been subject to a number of changes in costs, timescales and scope, and these are described in the NAO Report. The project's current costs have been subject to independent, external, benchmark assessments providing assurance that they are in-line with other comparable projects in the public sector and private industry.</p>

	<p pid=".104W.2/4" class="indent">As Jobcentre Plus is an Executive Agency, I have been asked to reply to your question concerning the placing of mystery shopping reports in the Library, and the use of mystery shoppers by Jobcentre Plus. This falls within the responsibilities delegated to me as Acting Chief Executive of the Agency.</p>
	<p pid=".104W.2/5" class="indent">It may be helpful if I explain how the mystery shopping programme is used within Jobcentre Plus, and how our performance is currently reported internally and externally.</p>
	<p pid=".104W.2/6" class="indent">Mystery Shopping is a recognised process used in both public and private sector organisations, as a method of providing an independent measure of the service received by customers.</p>
	<p pid=".104W.2/7" class="indent">Within Jobcentre Plus we have a Customers' Charter based not only on the 6 Whitehall Service standards, but also after consultation with our customers, includes elements of service that are important to them. We use a mystery shopping programme to measure how well we deliver service against the standards and commitments we have set, and results are used by my managers to direct improvements in their performance.</p>
	<p pid=".104W.2/8" class="indent">The Jobcentre Plus programme is one of the biggest in the UK and all main parts of delivery are included. Each quarter every Jobcentre Plus location receives a number of different mystery shopping contacts. This means that nationally we produce in excess of 6,500 individual reports every quarter.</p>
	<p pid=".104W.2/9" class="indent">These reports are then aggregated into individual site performance summaries and District and national reports. In accordance with Jobcentre Plus overall performance reporting arrangements, we publish details of District results on the Jobcentre Plus website each quarter (<a href="http://www.jobcentreplus.gov.uk">www.jobcentreplus.gov.uk</a>) and a copy of this has been placed in the Library. The individual office reports provide detailed feedback from the shoppers that managers will use to identify areas for improvement. The content of the questionnaires used in the mystery shopping programme are commercial in confidence and I am therefore unable to place copies in the House of Commons Library.</p>
	<p pid=".104W.2/10" class="indent">I would also like to reassure you that while we use the Mystery Shopping programme to measure service delivery against defined standards, we regularly review those standards and seek the views of our customers and other stakeholders.</p>
	<p pid=".104W.2/11" class="indent">We have just completed the first National Customer Satisfaction survey, which explicitly asks customers to comment on their level of satisfaction with the different elements of customer service. It also asks them to tell us what is important and where we are not meeting their expectations. We expect to be publishing the findings from this survey in the late spring and will use the information this gives us to focus our improvement efforts.</p>
	<p pid=".104W.2/12" class="indent">I hope this information is helpful.</p>

They were sent letters to inform them that they could be better off paying standard rate National Insurance contributions because of the proposed change to the National Insurance structure. The criteria used to select these women were that their National Insurance account showed an open reduced rate election, they had paid reduced rate National Insurance contributions in the 1986&ndash;87 and/or 1987&ndash;88 tax years and that they were generally low earners in which case the standard rate contributions would be less than the reduced rate.</p>
