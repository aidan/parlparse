	<p pid="a.1398W.2/1">The Treasury's projection for the trend growth rate of the economy is built up from projections of growth for the different components that drive trend growth, one of which is the population of working age. As referred to in the 2004 pre-Budget report, the trend growth assumption is 2&frac34; per cent. over the current economic cycle, with growth in the working-age population contributing around &frac12; percentage point. Included in this &frac12; percentage point is a contribution from net migration of slightly over &frac14;percentage point. The paper &quot;Trend Growth: Recent Developments and Prospects&quot; published alongside Budget 2002 explained the Treasury's approach to assessing trend growth, and further relevant material is published in the economy chapter of each pre-Budget and Budget report.</p>

	<p pid="a.1398W.14/1">The Inland Revenue's Code of Practice 26 (&quot;What happens if we have paid you too much tax credit?&quot;) sets out their approach to handling overpayments of tax credits. It describes a number of measures the Revenue has put in place to protect against hardship being caused by the recovery of an overpayment, which I can summarise as follows:</p>
	<p pid="a.1398W.14/2">Where possible, the Inland Revenue will collect an overpayment from a previous year from a continuing award. There are automatic limits on the amounts that will be deducted from payments and these are designed to prevent hardship.</p>
	<p pid="a.1398W.14/3">Where a claimant's circumstances change, the Inland Revenue adjust their payments for the rest of the year with the aim of paying the right amount of tax credits for the year as a whole. The Inland Revenue may make additional tax credits payments to prevent hardship where payments are reduced following the adjustment of an award. The effect of these payments is that only part of an expected overpayment being collected is recovered by the end of the year, leaving the balance to be recovered in later years.</p>
	<p pid="a.1398W.14/4">In exceptional cases, where claimants still feel that recovery of an overpayment is causing hardship, the Inland Revenue will consider the facts of the case and may decide not to collect all or part of the overpayment, or allow more time to pay.</p>
	<p pid="a.1398W.14/5">Where claimants have no award for the current year, they receive a &quot;Notice to Pay&quot;. This advises them to contact the Inland Revenue if they want to arrange to pay back their overpayment in 12 monthly instalments, or to request repayment over a longer period.</p>

	<p pid="a.1400W.2/1">Self-Assessment was introduced in 1996 to modernise and simplify the assessment and payment processes. The new system also produced staff savings worth over &pound;450million within the first four years. The success of the project was confirmed in an independent post-implementation review.</p>
	<p pid="a.1400W.2/2">Since 1996 many improvements and changes have been made in the light of experience and they have also produced savings. One of the most significant has been the ability to file online (via the internet or the electronic lodgement service). More than 1.6 million online tax returns have been received in 2004&ndash;05 (for tax year 2003&ndash;04). These will generate targeted savings of more than &pound;14 million in 2005&ndash;6, which as take-up continues to rise will increase to over &pound;40 million per annum from 2011&ndash;12.</p>

	<p pid="a.1402W.3/1">In 2003, detecting devices were triggered in Portcullis House on 73 occasions, of which 18 were caused by fire and smoke, 17 were activated for other reasons such as steam, and 38 were faults in the system. The corresponding figures for 2004 are 86, 18, 14 and 54. The fire alarm sounded and as a result there was a full evacuation of the building on two occasions in 2003 and seven in 2004. Records are not kept of the length of each evacuation.</p>

	<p pid="a.1402W.7/1">Gun crime, internet crime and alcohol-related violent offences are offences which cannot be separately identified on the Home Office Court Proceedings Database. Snatch theft is categorised as theft from the person. The table sets out the relevant figures for the other requested categories. The figures relate to persons for whom these sentences were for the principal offences for which they were found guilty. When a defendant has been found guilty of two or more offences it is the offence for which the heaviest penalty is imposed. Where the same disposal is imposed for two or more offences, the offence selected is the offence for which the statutory maximum penalty is the most severe.</p>

	<p pid="a.1403W.5/1">The HMCPSI and HMIC joint thematic inspection into the investigation and prosecution of cases involving allegations of rape was published in April 2002. The report set out concerns regarding levels of victim satisfaction, high attrition rates and low conviction rates in cases of rape.</p>
	<p pid="a.1403W.5/2">In July 2002, the Government published a Rape Action Plan. It accepted nearly all the recommendations put forward by the HMCPSI and HMIC report.</p>
	<p pid="a.1403W.5/3">Implementation of these recommendations has been ongoing since the publication of the Rape Action Plan. The measures implemented by the Crown Prosecution Service following the Rape Action Plan include each CPS Area having a rape co-ordinator to provide and disseminate good practice within and across areas; that rape cases are reviewed by specialist lawyers; that decisions to drop or substantially reduce the prosecution case, or to advise the police to take no further action, are discussed with a second specialist lawyer before a final decision is made; that instructions are given to prosecuting advocates that offensive and seemingly irrelevant cross-examination should be challenged, and inappropriate cross-examination about previous sexual experience should be challenged; and that the Crown Prosecution Service has published its policy statement on rape explaining to the public how the Crown Prosecution Service deals with rape cases.</p>
	<p pid="a.1403W.5/4">There will be an audit of the Rape Action Plan of police forces and CPS areas by a working group comprised of Home Office, CPS and ACPO officials. The audit of the Rape Action Plan will take into account forthcoming research in attrition rates and other recent publications, both in terms of assessing progress, and identifying any further recommendations that may follow. It is planed to carry out this audit in the spring/summer of this year.</p>
	<p pid="a.1403W.5/5">The work of the audit will tie in with the Home Office research planned to look in detail at the decline in detection rates in rape and sexual assault cases and current variation in detection rate performance.</p>

	<p pid="a.1406W.3/1">The cost of works in 2002&ndash;03 to restore four ministerial suites, the offices of the Permanent Secretary and two Special Advisers and associated private office areas (including those for the ministerial support unit and the parliamentary branch) was &pound;145,660 plus fees plus VAT. This work was undertaken as part of a consolidation package to co-locate Ministers and DfT staff in the same building and has resulted in an annual saving of some &pound;220,000 in accommodation costs to the Department.</p>

At this stage it is difficult to predict precise numbers. There are already just under 1,200 wind turbines currently in operation. Generating 10 per cent. of UK electricity from renewables could mean an increase of possibly another one and half times that number. There will also be a rather smaller number of offshore turbines.</p>

	<p pid="a.1415W.9/1">Durham North has two Sure Start local programmes; Sure Start Stanley and Sure Start Chester-le-Street.</p>
	<p pid="a.1415W.9/2">Sure Start Stanley was approved as a local programme in October 2000 and supports around 940 young children and their families living in the Stanley area of North Durham. The local programme provides a wide range of services to support local families including: access to good quality and affordable childcare, cr&egrave;che provision, playgroups and parent and toddler groups; improved local health care and family support and an extensive range of training and work related courses.</p>
	<p pid="a.1415W.9/3">Since opening Sure Start Stanley has worked toward improving the quality of life for local families. The number of women smoking during pregnancy has fallen from 36 per cent. to 28 per cent.; the usage of libraries by young children and their families is 7 per cent. above the national average; there has been a significant improvement in the personal and social development of children at school-age. The programme has contacted 869 children out of the total of 943 under 5s in the catchment area and has seen 100 per cent. of newborns within two months of birth.</p>
	<p pid="a.1415W.9/4">There is strong parental involvement in this programme through the Parent Communications Group, (a decision-making group of 18 parents), training programmes facilitated by Sure Start Stanley (340 training places taken up by parents) and parents involved as volunteers delivering a range of Sure Start activities and services.</p>
	<p pid="a.1415W.9/5">Sure Start Chester-le-Street was approved as a local programme in April 2001 and has a semi rural catchment area. It supports around 800 young children living in the Chester West area and surrounding villages. The local programme provides a range of services from its main centre including: high quality daycare, parent and toddler and cr&egrave;che facilities; successfully integrated health services and a wide range of work based training courses.</p>
	<p pid="a.1415W.9/6">Sure Start Chester-le-Street is working toward delivering a rotating service to the outlying villages within its boundary to ensure regular access to Sure Start activities and services for those families living in remote areas.</p>
	<p pid="a.1415W.9/7">The local programme has been successful in improving the quality of life for young children and their families. Following the programme being established, breastfeeding has increased by 5 per cent., a storyline and Bookstart service has promoted the use of libraries by 100 per cent. and a successful baby massage service has led to an extension of the programme to include baby yoga and training for parents for them to deliver the service in the future.</p>
	<p pid="a.1415W.9/8">There is strong parental involvement in Sure Start Chester-le-Street. A Parents' Committee (14 elected parents) is represented on the Management Committee (two parents) and Partnership Committee (two parents), the decision making bodies for this local programme. Parents are actively involved in a childcare NVQ level 2/3 training programme run jointly by Sure Start Chester-le-Street and The Bridge, a local women's charity.</p>
	<p pid="a.1415W.9/9">Durham North has six neighbourhood nurseries. Durham city council is developing four children's centres from these settings that are delivering 169 integrated early learning with childcare places. Around 700 three-year-olds and 830 four-year-olds are receiving free nursery education in maintained nursery and primary schools and other maintained schools.</p>
	<p pid="a.1415W.9/10">The Sure Start local programmes have received DfES funding of &pound;2,286,323 revenue and been allocated &pound;2,075,000 in capital grants since being opened in October 2000 and April 2001 respectively. The neighbourhood nurseries have been allocated a total revenue grant of &pound;777,062 and have received a total of &pound;255,528 in capital grants.</p>
	<p pid="a.1415W.9/11">These programmes are developing into children's centres and will contribute towards achieving our goal of a children's centre in every community by 2010.</p>
	<p pid="a.1415W.9/12">A well thought-through careers advice service has enabled 49 parents to complete the Parent Employability Programme.</p>

	<p pid="a.1421W.2/1">In the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister's &quot;Homes for All&quot; public service plan, launched on <phrase class="date" code="2005-01-24">24 January 2005</phrase>, a competition was announced that would invite organisations to bid for the right to construct one or more new developments on English Partnerships owned sites. This &quot;Design for Manufacture&quot; competition aims to demonstrate that it is possible to build a home that reaches good standards of accessible design and environmental performance for &pound;60,000.</p>
	<p pid="a.1421W.2/2">This target cost of &pound;60,000 for constructing a home relates solely to construction costs. In setting this target, the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister looked at a series of data sets, including those produced by RICS Building Costs Information Service and the Tender Price Index of Social Housing, as well as real-life case studies, to identify what might be a challenging but achievable figure for the core costs of constructing a home.</p>
	<p pid="a.1421W.2/3">One of the main purposes of the competition is to encourage greater efficiency in the construction process. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister anticipates that the creativity and innovation that exists within the industry will mean that this could be achieved in different ways. Thus it is not possible at present to break down anticipated dwelling building costs.</p>
	<p pid="a.1421W.2/4">It is important to note that competition entries will be expected to include a range of dwellings of different types and sizes. While it is anticipated that approximately 30 per cent. of all the dwellings built through the competition will meet a target construction cost of &pound;60,000, the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister will expect all of the dwellings built through the competition to achieve equivalent cost-efficiency.</p>

	<p pid="a.1423W.2/1">The local government Public Service Agreement targets require the improved delivery and value for money of local services. A key part of this will be to ensure that authorities are able to plan their budgets effectively. The introduction of the three-year settlements for individual authorities from 2006&ndash;07 onwards, as announced in Spending Review 2004, will greatly assist this process. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister is currently consulting on the implementation of three-year settlements and will announce the outcome later this summer.</p>
	<p pid="a.1423W.2/2">It is also clear that the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister should review some aspects of the grant distribution system before the 2006&ndash;07 settlement in order to ensure that the system continues to distribute grant in a fair way between authorities. We will be conducting this review in partnership with local government.</p>
	<p pid="a.1423W.2/3">The existing spending plans for 2006&ndash;07 onwards provide continued investment in local government which reflect the work to identify pressures and enable local government to deliver high quality services with low council tax increases. It builds on the 33 per cent. real terms increase in Government grant which the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister has been able to provide to councils since taking Office. We will continue to work closely with local government to ensure that levels of central grant are based on a realistic assessment of the service commitment pressures faced by councils.</p>

Public opinion around badger culling is one area of interest. Defra strives to ensure that its policies are based on the best available scientific evidence, and that they are cost effective and sustainable. Any future decision on badger culling will need to take account of the way the general public perceives badgers and acceptability of culling them to control TB in cattle.</p>

	<p pid="a.1427W.2/1">The research programme for producing an effective vaccine remains broadly in line with the timetable outlined in the Krebs report (1997). This estimated:</p>
	<p pid="a.1427W.2/2" class="indent">Years 1&ndash;5: Identification of candidate vaccines and development of differential diagnostic tests;</p>
	<p pid="a.1427W.2/3" class="indent">Years 5&ndash;10: Experimental investigations of vaccination protocols;</p>
	<p pid="a.1427W.2/4" class="indent">Years 10&ndash;15: Field trials.</p>
	<p pid="a.1427W.2/5">Vaccination of cattle with BCG remains a problem because it affects skin test readings. Work is in progress on a differential diagnostic test. The sequencing of the <i>Mycobacterium bovis</i> genome in 2002 has led to the development of an experimental test to distinguish between vaccinated and unvaccinated cattle, but more work is required to validate the test under field conditions. Defra is funding research at the Veterinary Laboratories Agency, in collaboration with New Zealand workers, to experimentally vaccinate cattle with BCG and to differentiate vaccinated animals from infected animals. The current project is due to end in 2005. New research proposals taking the work forward on new candidate vaccines and neonatal vaccination are currently being appraised by independent referees. Future plans to look at the performance of vaccine candidates under natural infection conditions are also being drawn up.</p>
	<p pid="a.1427W.2/6">Collaborative research with the Republic of Ireland has shown that parenteral BCG vaccination provides a degree of protection against experimental challenge with <i>M. bovis</i> in badgers. Some work has already been done on requirements for a field trial. Further work is still required on vaccine delivery, immunological monitoring of effective immunisation of badgers and effect of exposure of non-target species. This work is addressed in the current research requirements for 2005.</p>

	<p pid="a.1427W.5/1">There is no evidence to suggest that the resumption of reactive culling would reduce the incidence of bovine TB in cattle. The ISO has continued to collect data from the reactive areas and recent analyses are consistent with results presented in late 2003, with the confidence limits providing no evidence for a beneficial effect of the reactive strategy over the time scale under study. Further detailed investigations based on the distribution of TB breakdowns in space and time are under way to investigate whether the observed increased incidence was linked to proximity to reactive culling. In addition, as further TB incidence data are obtained, the ISG will continue to analyse data from reactive areas. If the TB incidence rates in reactive and survey areas become more similar over time, this finding would indicate that the observed increase in TB breakdowns in reactive areas, compared with survey-only areas, was associated with reactive culling.</p>

	<p pid="a.1430W.12/1">The Gangmasters (Licensing) Act 2004 gives the Secretary of State responsibility for enforcing the criminal offences set out in the legislation. These include the offences of operating as a gangmaster without a licence, using an unlicensed gangmaster and the possession or use of false documents.</p>
	<p pid="a.1430W.12/2">These offences will be brought into effect once gangmasters who require a licence have had the opportunity to apply for one.

	<p pid="a.1430W.12/3">A new team of enforcement officers will be appointed by the Secretary of State to enforce the criminal offences created under the Act. Enforcement officers will have wide ranging powers including the power of arrest, the right of entry and the power to obtain information or the production of records.</p>

This is to reflect changing priorities in part governed by financial constraints. Throughout the process of strategic planning the IAH management have been mindful to ensure that the Institute will be able both to maintain the depth of its research activity and to develop the financial capability to work on important new areas of science as they arise.</p>

	<p pid="a.1433W.9/1">The costs of the UK belonging to the International Organisation of Wine and Vine (OIV) have been variable and have depended on the number of proposals under consideration within the organisation, the degree of UK involvement, the resources attached to that involvement, as well as the level of annual membership fees that have been set. Where the OIV chooses to hold its meetings, for example France or Australia, will also affect the cost. In 2003&ndash;04, the latest year for which figures are available, the meetings attended by the UK were in Paris alone, and the costs estimated to be about &pound;25,000. A cost-benefit analysis of UK membership of OIV is not available but the UK's ability to produce, import and trade wine is not conditional on membership. Proposals emerging from OIV need to be implemented in European Community law in order to have practical effect in the UK, so our withdrawal from OIV will continue to ensure a consequence of reprioritisation of the Department's budgetary resources to focus public spending where it is most needed to meet Government objectives. The decision will not interfere with the UK continuing to play an active role in the development of European Community policy and legislation on wine and the interests of the UK wine industry and consumers are fully represented at that level.</p>

	<p pid="a.1434W.9/2">The large majority of recent attacks have been directed at political and civil society rather than against British or other foreign nationals. There is a danger, however, that British citizens could get caught up in the growing number of indiscriminate attacks. We monitor the situation closely, our high commission maintains close contacts with the British community and we update our travel advice on a regular basis, most recently on <phrase class="date" code="2007-02-14">14 February</phrase>. But we do not advise against travel to the country, other than against all but essential travel to the Chittagong Hill Tracts because of the risk of being caught up in clashes between rival tribal groups, settlers and the military in that area.</p>

	<p pid="a.1435W.2/1">We have serious concerns about the security situation in Bangladesh. Attacks using explosive devices have been taking place in locations throughout the country with increasing frequency. Some of these attacks have been targeted at high profile political gatherings; others have targeted cinemas, shrines, cultural events, markets and most recently the offices of NGOs. There has also been a marked increase in the number of discoveries of illegal arms and explosives. We monitor the situation carefully and make our concerns clear to the Bangladeshi authorities. I did so with the Bangladeshi Prime Minister in Dhaka on <phrase class="date" code="">21 December</phrase>. The British High Commissioner maintains a regular dialogue on these issues with the Bangladeshi authorities at a senior level, emphasising the need to address the security situation effectively, with full regard to human rights, in order to bring to justice those responsible for such attacks.</p>

	<p pid="a.1436W.2/1">Strengthening governance and civil society remains a key part of UK bilateral assistance for Cambodia. The UK is helping the Cambodian Government undertake critical reforms that aid this process particularly in areas such as transnational crime, public financial management, health services and strengthening local governance.</p>
	<p pid="a.1436W.2/2">For example, the UK is giving ongoing support to the Government to enable the elected Commune Councils to become increasingly involved in local planning of infrastructure and local services.

Their aim is to agree long-term arrangements for Iran's nuclear programme based on objective guarantees that the programme is exclusively for peaceful purposes; and they provide for co-operation in other areas. The groups meet every three or four weeks in Geneva. The group on political and security issues has discussed, for example, export controls, counter-narcotics co-operation and other subjects of mutual interest. The working group on technology and co-operation is looking at issues in a range of economic sectors. But in view of the need to build mutual confidence and trust, the two sides have agreed not to disclose details of the discussions, which are continuing.</p>

	<p pid="a.1442W.3/1">UN reports last year estimated that around 157,000 acres of land, some 11.5 per cent. of the West Bank and home to over 93,000 Palestinians would lie between the completed separation barrier and the 1949 Armistice Line (excluding East Jerusalem). This land includes some of the West Bank's richest agricultural land and covers part of the aquifer system which is a major source of water resources for the West Bank. The barrier also affects Palestinian access to groundwater wells in the West Bank which had previously supplied water for both drinking and agriculture. Precise figures on this are not available. The proposed route of the barrier has recently been altered by the Israeli Cabinet in response to calls from the international community and the Israeli judicial system to minimise the impact on Palestinian livelihoods. There has been no authoritative analysis yet of the impact of the changes. While some improvement is expected there will continue to be inevitable and significant disruption to the lives of Palestinians living near the route of the barrier.</p>

	<p pid="a.1447W.3/1">The Department for International Development (DFID) welcomes the forthcoming publication of the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MA), the first public release of which will be at the end of March. We will look for opportunities to publicise the launch of this report internally to DFID staff.</p>
	<p pid="a.1447W.3/2">The MA focuses on ecosystem services and how changes in ecosystem services affect human well-being. Building on this, the MA will identify policy, institutional, or technological changes that could not only improve the management of ecosystems, but also contribute to development and to long-term sustainability.</p>
	<p pid="a.1447W.3/3">DFID has been involved in consultations with a number of MA working groups, providing comments and suggestions on the draft stages of the report. DFID also funded two co-ordinating lead authors through the provision of financial support to the International Institute for Environment and Development. One of the main financial contributors to the MA process has been the Global Environment Facility (GEF) to which the UK is currently contributing &pound;103 million over four years from 2002. The UK is the fourth largest donor to the GEF.</p>
	<p pid="a.1447W.3/4">DFID uses the results and recommendations of reports such as the MA to inform thinking on issues of poverty-environment linkages and the continual development and improvement of tools to support work to integrate environmental considerations into development co-operation. DFID is particularly interested in the findings of the MA that seek to highlight effective policies and interventions that respond to environmental challenges while bringing financial and livelihood benefits to the poor. Examples of these options include payment for ecosystem services such as catchment management and forest certification schemes.</p>
	<p pid="a.1447W.3/5">DFID will also be encouraging those agencies involved in commissioning the report, including the Food and Agriculture Organisation and the Secretariats of the Conventions (in particular the Convention on Biodiversity and the Framework Convention on Climate Change), to use the analyses and results of this major study to inform their future policy and implementation work.</p>

	<p pid="a.1448W.3/1">No. Entitlement to disability living allowance is not linked to particular disabling conditions. It depends on either the extent to which a severely disabled person has long-term personal care needs and/or walking difficulties as a result of their disabilities, or on whether a person has a progressive disease from which their death in consequence of that disease can reasonably be expected within six months. In either case, there is no entitlement to the allowance for periods before the date on which a claim for it is made.</p>

	<p pid="a.1461W.2/1">A decision to use buprenorphine or opiates other than methadone for opiate substitution treatment requires knowledge and understanding of the use of these drugs in the management of addiction, as well as their limitations. Such treatment would normally be initiated by a specialist or a general practitioner with additional competence in this area of practice.</p>
	<p pid="a.1461W.2/2">To support effective prescribing of a range of opiates, the Department has issued the clinical guidelines, &quot;Drug misuse and dependence&mdash;guidelines on clinical management&quot; (1999). The Department issued additional guidance on the availability of buprenorphine by instalment dispensing in 2001. In addition, the Department has funded the training of 800 GPs in a range of substitute opiates through funding of the Royal College of General Practitioners certificate course between 2002 and 2005.</p>
	<p pid="a.1461W.2/3">The national treatment agency (NTA) for substance misuse has produced clinical guidance, &quot;Prescribing services for drug misusers&quot; (Research into practice briefing No. 2, January 2003), that includes a review of the evidence base concerning a range of pharmacological treatments for drug misusers, including alternative opiate substitute drugs. Further clinical guidance, &quot;Injectable heroin (and injectable methadone)&mdash;potential roles in drug treatment&quot; (May 2003), also gives advice on alternatives to methadone substitution therapy.</p>

The need for procurement from the independent sector arose following that exercise. Ten contracts for independent sector treatment centres (ISTCs) have been signed to date with seven remaining. Full business cases, confirming the activity to be commissioned from the independent sector have been signed off by primary care trust boards, as have final agreements. The local NHS is expected to manage referrals to ensure that extra capacity available from ISTCs is used.</p>

	<p pid="a.1464W.8/2">The penalty charge was introduced in August 2001 as a civil fine for patients who wrongly obtain help with national health service charges for themselves or someone else. The penalty is five times the amount owed, up to a maximum of &pound;100, plus the original unpaid NHS charge. If the penalty charge is not settled within 28 days from the date of posting, a surcharge will be applied. The surcharge is calculated as 50 per cent, of the penalty charge.</p>
	<p pid="a.1464W.8/3">Since the penalty charge was introduced, 164,133 penalty notices have been issued. Up to 9,000 cases are currently going through the debt recovery process. 9,954 cases have already been dealt with by judgments in county court. The rest have been paid or concluded without recourse to court proceedings. Repeat offenders are subject to criminal prosecution where that is appropriate.</p>

	<p pid="a.1467W.6/1">It is assumed that the question refers to animals used in scientific procedures. It is not possible to estimate the total number of genetically modified animals that will be used in that way over the next few years as a result of the Human Genome Project. That will be largely dependent on strategic research and funding decisions by the funding councils and the private sector, and the nature and quality of the resulting scientific proposals. Any impact the Human Genome Project does have may be offset by a reduction in the use of non-genetically modified animals.</p>
	<p pid="a.1467W.6/2">During 2003&mdash;the latest year for which figures are available&mdash;genetically modified animals were used in 764,000 regulated scientific procedures representing 27 per cent. of all procedures for 2003 compared with 26 per cent. in 2002 and 8 per cent. in 1995. Rodents&mdash;nearly all mice&mdash;were used in 98 per cent. of these procedures. It is likely that this trend of a gradually increasing use of such animals over the last decade will continue as advances in genetic science open up new avenues of research, and this may well include work arising from the Human Genome Project.</p>
	<p pid="a.1467W.6/3">At present there is no use of genetically modified non-human primates licensed under the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986, and we do not expect that to change in the foreseeable future. Any applications for licences to conduct such work would be referred for advice to the Animal Procedures Committee.</p>
	<p pid="a.1467W.6/4">Whatever the impact of the Human Genome Project, we will continue, in administering the 1986 Act, to license use of animals only when we consider there is no alternative, and then only when both the number of animals to be used and any resulting suffering are minimised.</p>

	<p pid="a.1468W.2/2">The Home Office is supporting the Treasury in meeting the ambitious targets this Government have set on child poverty. Children born into poverty are more likely to be victims of crime and more likely to offend. The Child Poverty Review highlighted the strong associations between youth crime, parental crime and child poverty.</p>
	<p pid="a.1468W.2/3">In order to tackle the poor outcomes associated with child poverty, and to improve the life chances of poor children, the Home Office has invested in a number of prevention programmes for children at risk of involvement in crime or substance misuse.</p>
	<p pid="a.1468W.2/4">To break the cycle of youth offending and deprivation, the Home Office Strategic Plan includes a commitment to increase youth crime prevention programmes. This includes multi-agency Youth Inclusion and Support Panels, targeting high-risk, children and their families, providing them with support and improving their access to mainstream services. It also includes the Youth Inclusion Programme, which targets the 13 to 16-year-olds most at risk of crime in 72 of the most deprived neighbourhoods. The numbers of both will be increased by 50 per cent. by 2008. We have also increased the coverage of the Intensive Supervision and Surveillance Programme (ISSPs).</p>
	<p pid="a.1468W.2/5">Children living in poverty are a key risk group for substance misuse. We are targeting young people in the most deprived neighbourhoods at risk of substance misuse through &quot;Positive Futures&quot;, a national sports-based social inclusion programme aimed at marginalised 10 to 19-year-olds. Positive Futures aims to &quot;have a positive influence on participants' substance misuse, physical activity and offending behaviour&quot;. The Positive Futures projects have proved successful in building relationships, engaging and providing developmental opportunities for young people living in deprived areas.</p>

	<p pid="a.1469W.0/1">The Drug Interventions Programme (formerly Criminal Justice Interventions Programme) is a critical part of the Government's national strategy for tackling drugs. Its implementation is being phased and delivery at a local level is through community-based Criminal Justice Integrated Teams (CJITs) which adopt a case management approach to offer access to drug treatment and support for drug misusing offenders.</p>
	<p pid="a.1469W.0/2">With the creation of the National Offender Management Service (NOMS) we envisage the drugs case manager acting as the link to and, in some areas, provider of drug treatment services. Regional Offender Managers will be responsible for ensuring that effective links are established within their regions between offender managers and CJITs. This will avoid duplication and ensure a fully integrated package of support and management for drug misusing offenders before, during and after sentence.</p>
	<p pid="a.1469W.0/3">Research shows that engaging offenders in drug treatment significantly reduces offending and impacts on crime. The successful co-operation of the Drug Interventions Programme and NOMS will contribute to the planned overall reduction of 15 per cent. in offences recorded by the British Crime Survey by the end of 2007&ndash;08.</p>

	<p pid="a.1470W.2/2">The extradition treaty signed between the US and the UK in 2003 is a completely new treaty, and requires the advice and consent of the US Senate Foreign Relations Committee before it can be ratified by the US Government. We have been advised by the US State Department that, although the Committee has a heavy schedule, the US State Department has asked it to consider the treaty at the earliest possible time.</p>
	<p pid="a.1470W.2/3">Some of the important, modernising provisions of the new treaty were given effect in the Extradition Act 2003 (and are therefore available generally in extradition, and are not linked solely to the US-UK treaty.) Secondary legislation was required under the new Act to designate all our extradition partners for the purposes of extradition to those states. The United States was, of course, included in that legislation.</p>

	<p pid="a.1480W.5/1">In 2003&ndash;04 attrition rates within the National Probation Service (NPS)&mdash;the number of staff who leave the NPS, not including those who transfer within the service&mdash;stood at 8 per cent. for professional staff and 15 per cent. for support staff.

At the same time, the NPS has experienced little difficulty in recruitment, with total staff numbers rising by over 5,000 since 1997.</p>

As an interim solution, a National Nominal Index (NNI) gives police forces access to data held by the Criminal Records Bureau's Interim Police Local Cross-Check (I-PLX) system, which flags which forces hold information in specified systems about an individual. The NNI is currently being piloted in three forces and will be rolled out to other forces during 2005. The aim is to complete the IMPACT Programme by March 2007.</p>

	<p pid="a.1482W.0/1">The Government recognise that helping to keep families together during sentence can contribute to successful resettlement and is firmly committed to promoting family ties. The Prison Service has a statutory obligation to encourage and assist prisoners to maintain contacts with their families and the wider community. It has strengthened its partnership with the voluntary and community sector, recognising the invaluable contribution it makes to services to families. There are now over 100 visitor centres and conditions have improved significantly in recent years, with more prisons adopting an imaginative approach in providing for extended family visits and play areas for children. The Assisted Prison Visits Scheme, funded by the Prison Service, also provides help with travel costs to prisoners' families and partners.</p>
	<p pid="a.1482W.0/2">Prisoners' families are involved in sentence planning at certain establishments, where family members and outside probation staff are invited to attend sentence planning boards, in preparation for release. Family members are also invited to attend post-course reviews following the completion of offending behaviour programmes such as PASRO, a cognitive behavioural programme for substance misusers. The DfES Offenders' Learning and Skills Unit also supports a range of family literacy and parenting programmes within prisons, working closely with the voluntary sector to provide support to prisoners and their families.</p>
	<p pid="a.1482W.0/3">The Government are seeking to develop a more strategic approach to engaging the children and families of offenders, both to maintain family ties and to support resettlement. Work is being taken forward under the Reducing Re-offending National Action Plan to establish best practice within a regional pathfinder. This is being taken forward in partnership with a wide range of voluntary and statutory organizations. In support of this collaborative working, the Probation Service is developing a national framework for working effectively with children and families of offenders.</p>

	<p pid="a.1483W.11/1">Plans are under way to develop a Sexual Assault Referral Centre (SARC) in Leeds which would provide forensic examination and link in with the support and counselling offered by the STAR (Surviving Trauma After Rape) project. STAR was established in 1994 by the Police and the four health authorities in West Yorkshire to provide co-ordinated support and counselling for victims of sexual assault. In addition, I understand that the voluntary and community sector are considering developing a SARC in Halifax.</p>
	<p pid="a.1483W.11/2">We are committed to increasing the number of SARCs in England and Wales and Home Office funding from the Victims Fund is to be made available for the establishment of new SARCs in 2005&ndash;06. Projects in Leeds and in Yorkshire will be invited to apply for grants along with all other areas of England and Wales. Details of the application process will be made available in March.</p>

	<p pid="a.1484W.5/1">The Greater London area is not serviced by one individual Victim Support scheme. Victim Support services are organised by individual London boroughs and the London Crown Court Witness Service is managed by Victim Support's National Office.</p>

Several London boroughs and the London Crown Court Witness Service have been reviewed since the new inspection process was introduced in 2003. Victim Support's inspection reports are public documents and can be viewed on their website.</p>
	<p pid="a.1484W.5/3">The Home Office also reviews Victim Support's statistical information for the Metropolitan area on an annual basis. In 2003&ndash;04 Victim Support schemes and Witness Services in the Metropolitan area received a total of 236,683 referrals. The community-based services made 249,905 successful contacts and achieved a personal contact rate which exceeded the national average.</p>
