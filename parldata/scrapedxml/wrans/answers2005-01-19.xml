	<p pid=".934W.0/1">Defra annually monitors the numbers of a whole range of birds, through the Breeding Bird Survey. This survey, conducted and funded jointly by the British Trust for Ornithology, the RSPB and the Joint Nature Conservation Committee, assesses trends in the numbers of common species of birds across the country. A range of other surveys, funded by these organisations, assesses trends in scarcer species. Annual reports are produced for each of the surveys, but summary information derived from them is contained in the report The State of the UK's Birds 2003 <sup>1</sup> , which was published in July 2004.</p>
	<p pid=".934W.0/2">This report revealed:</p>
	<p pid=".934W.0/3" class="indent">The UK wild bird indicator, a barometer of the fortunes of breeding birds in the UK, for all species showed a slight decline between 2000 and 2002, but has stayed relatively stable since the early 1980s.</p>
	<p pid=".934W.0/4" class="indent">Continuing decreases in species such as the lesser spotted woodpecker, willow tit and wood warbler.</p>
	<p pid=".934W.0/5" class="indent">Considerable mixed fortunes in the trends in commoner breeding birds with decreases in populations of turtle doves, corn buntings, house sparrows and starlings, but short term increases in tree sparrows, stone chats and kingfishers.</p>
	<p pid=".934W.0/6">The report recognised encouraging progress towards meeting species' targets in the UK Biodiversity Action Plan where concerted conservation action has resulted in increases in numbers of bitterns, corncrakes, stone-curlews and cirl buntings&mdash;all species that were at serious risk of extinction as recently as the mid-1990s. Whilst there is no reason for complacency, indications are that the dramatic rate of long-term decline in overall bird populations may have been halted.</p>

Officials knew about Mr. Dring's statement prior to and during the period of the FMD 2001: Lessons to be Learned Inquiry, chaired by Dr. Iain Anderson</p>
	<p pid=".936W.0/2">Mr. Dring's personal statement was not submitted to the Lessons to be Learned Inquiry, as there was concern that the contents would have been prejudicial to Mr. Waugh's trial at which Mr. Dring was a witness of fact, rather than an expert witness, had the statement received publicity beforehand. The contemporaneous notes of Mr. Dring's visits to Burnside were given to Dr. Anderson. Mr. Dring also contributed fully to the investigations on the origins of the foot-and mouth (FMD) outbreak 2001, submitted by the then Chief Veterinary Officer to the Inquiry. This Origins of FMD report was based on wide-ranging evidence and rigorous investigation and was published by Dr. Anderson. Defra has no record of minutes of informal meetings being made or submitted to the inquiry.</p>
	<p pid=".936W.0/3">Ministers and Dr. Anderson have said it was regrettable that the Mr. Dring's statement was not sent to the inquiry. However, Dr. Anderson has stated that had he seen Mr. Dring's statement at that time it would not have changed any conclusions or recommendations of his inquiry.</p>

	<p pid=".936W.0/5">Defra has known about the video since it was first being made in so far as a Veterinary Officer was present on Burnside Farm on <phrase class="date" code="2001-02-24">24 February 2001</phrase>, when filming took place. We have no record of Ministers being expressly informed of the existence of the video until recently. The Under-Secretary of State (Lords) became aware of the video when extracts were shown in the television news media at the time of Robert Waugh's trial in May 2002. It was brought to Ministers' attention again as a result of the media and parliamentary interest in the video that was generated by the <i>Farmers Weekly</i> in October this year. I am not aware of any associated report written by Northumberland county council.</p>

On <phrase class="date" code="2005-02-24">24 February</phrase> further sampling was carried out when FMD experts from the Institute for Animal Health, Pirbright and an epidemiological team from Defra visited the farm. 88 per cent. of the 241 pigs blood sampled on that day were seropositive for FMD Type O antibodies.</p>

It is an aggregated indicator that aims to weigh together many components into a single overall measure of &quot;environmental sustainability&quot;, an approach that as yet is not scientifically robust. The choice of the components, and the way in which they are weighted together is largely subjective. A different choice of components or weights would give different results&mdash;amply illustrated by the fact that the previous edition of this index, based on a different selection of components, placed the UK 16th. Furthermore, there are still many areas where data are not sufficiently comparable between countries, or are simply not available and have been imputed. It should also be noted that the variables in this index tend to measure circumstances at a single point in time rather than trends or changes, therefore to the extent the index measures anything at all, it is based on the environmental situation which a country faces rather than its progress or performance in improving environmental Sustainability.</p>

	<p pid=".945W.8/1">In July 2000 the Government made a commitment that its central Departments and their executive agencies would seek to purchase their timber and timber products from legal and sustainable sources. Since then the Government has commissioned research and advice on implementing this policy, undertaken consultation with stakeholders, raised the awareness of central Departments, promoted the policy to the wider public sector, published guidance and commenced the development of a central point of expertise on timber (CPET).</p>
	<p pid=".945W.8/2">The Sustainable Development in Government Reports provide an indication of the progress being made by central Departments in England. The Third Annual Report 2004 reveals that certified products accounted for 71 per cent. of the money spent on construction timber and 78 per cent. of the money spent on manufactured timber products during the financial year 2003&ndash;04. Much of the uncertified timber purchased was supplied with some evidence of legal and sustainable sources. For the preceding financial year 2002&ndash;03 Departments reported that certified products accounted for approximately 50 per cent. of their spend on all timber products and that there was some evidence that much of the uncertified timber came from legal and sustainable sources.</p>
	<p pid=".945W.8/3">The CPET is being developed in phases. Phase 1 was completed in November 2004 and provided an assessment of the extent to which five forest certification schemes provide Government buyers with assurance that legal and sustainable timber has been procured. Phase 2 of CPET will provide a help line service for public sector buyers and their suppliers. A pilot scheme is currently in operation and will provide information that will assist the Government in developing a full service. The Government expects the Phase 2 Help Line service to be operational before autumn 2005.</p>

	<p pid=".946W.2/1">The Government's timber procurement policy is aimed, in part, at helping to improve the well being of forest dependent peoples throughout the world. The Government is asking its timber suppliers to provide independent verification that their timber was legally harvested and preferably grown in well-managed forests. In many producing countries the forest laws will help to protect indigenous people's rights, customs and livelihoods. The application of certification scheme standards and equivalent standards that provide assurance of sustainable forest management will add to that protection in many instances.</p>
	<p pid=".946W.2/2">The Government does not place contractual obligations on its suppliers to take direct action to protect indigenous people because the Government understands that to do so would be in contravention of EU procurement directives. EU procurement law prohibits the specification of criteria that are not strictly relevant to the performance of a contract. Specifications must relate to what is being procured rather than to the people or undertakings that produce what is being procured.</p>

The Department of Health was also one of a number of Departments which contributed to <i>Walking and Cycling: an Action Plan</i>, published by the Department for Transport in June last year.

Summaries of these market studies are published on the SRA freight customer website <a href="http://www.railfreightonline.com/news/marketresearch">http://www.railfreightonline.com/news/marketresearch</a>, and will be made available in the Libraries of the House.</p>

	<p pid=".958W.11/1">The Government's consultation paper&mdash;&quot;Devolving Decision Making: A Consultation on Regional Funding Allocations&quot;&mdash;set out our proposals to establish regional transport funding allocations.</p>
	<p pid=".958W.11/2">The consultation paper explained that the proposed regional transport funding allocations would initially bring together capital funding projected for major schemes (generally costing over &pound;5 million each) under the Local Transport Plan (LTP) system and for major Highways Agency schemes, other than those on routes of national and international significance. To be regarded as being of national and international significance, a route has to satisfy all of the following criteria:</p>
	<p pid=".958W.11/3" class="indent">To have average daily traffic flows, along the length of the route, of more than 60,000 vehicles</p>
	<p pid=".958W.11/4" class="indent">To link at least two of the top 20 English cities by population; or link one of the top 20 cities with an airport/seaport or Wales/Scotland</p>
	<p pid=".958W.11/5" class="indent">To carry heavy goods vehicle traffic equal to or in excess of 15 per cent. as a percentage of all traffic, as an average along the length of the route</p>
	<p pid=".958W.11/6" class="indent">To be represented on the European Union's trans-European transport network</p>
	<p pid=".958W.11/7">In some cases these criteria were applied with a degree of flexibility.</p>
	<p pid=".958W.11/8">A map illustrating the application of these criteria to the trunk road network was provided as part of the current consultation exercise.</p>
	<p pid=".958W.11/9">These proposals will not lead to a downgrading in the importance of certain routes. The proposed regional funding allocations will give regions a far stronger base on which to plan, and will enable them to contribute to decisions that better reflect regional priorities.</p>

	<p pid=".979W.5/1">The provision of a museum in the Titanic Quarter is being dealt with as part of the development of a strategy of the Titanic area being taken forward by the Northern Ireland Tourist Board (NITB) and Belfast city council (BCC). NITB in their Strategic Framework for Action listed Titanic (Maritime) Belfast as one of their five signature projects for tourism development in Northern Ireland. BCC and NITB have established a Titanic Forum comprising all the main stakeholders, including the Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure (DCAL) and the National Museums and Galleries of Northern Ireland (MAGNI), and have commissioned consultants to prepare and agree a vision for the Titanic Project, prepare a business plan for the delivery and implementation and undertake an economic appraisal of the project which will include quantification of the social and economic impact. This is due to be completed in April 2005.</p>

	<p pid=".984W.6/1">The Government are committed to introducing a distance-based lorry road-user charge, with offsetting tax cuts for those who buy their fuel in the UK. We have been developing proposals in consultation with the haulage industry and, as announced in the pre-Budget report (Cm 6408), we have today issued a discussion paper, which considers various details of how the charge might operate in practice. The discussion paper is available in the Library of the House.</p>

	<p pid=".992W.0/1">Donations to charity are not themselves taxed. The Gift Aid scheme allows individual donors to make a declaration allowing the charity to reclaim the basic rate tax they have paid on the money they donate, adding 28 pence to every &pound;1 donated. In some cases tax will not have been paid on the money donated so there is nothing for the charity to claim back. It is important that charities claim tax only where they have a declaration from the donor allowing them to do so.</p>
	<p pid=".992W.0/2">The Disasters Emergency Committee has announced that, as of <phrase class="date" code="2005-01-06">6 January 2005</phrase>, &pound;100 million has been donated to the Tsunami appeal. This figure is increasing on a daily basis. It is estimated that Gift Aid tax repaid on donations will be over &pound;15 million. The precise amount will depend upon the final total donations and the number of donors using Gift Aid. Gift Aid declarations may be made retrospectively, so donors who have made donations without making a declaration can go back to the charity and do so. The more donors use Gift Aid the more government will be able to add to their donations.</p>
	<p pid=".992W.0/3">The Inland Revenue website contains information for donors and charities and there is also a link from the Treasury website to this information. Inland Revenue is actively promoting tax effective methods of giving such as Gift Aid and Payroll Giving. In addition Inland Revenue is offering advice and guidance to charities and the organisers of fundraising events to help them in encouraging their donors to make use of Gift Aid and Payroll Giving.</p>
	<p pid=".992W.0/4">In addition the Treasury will make a special donation to the Disasters Emergency Committee to offset the VAT costs associated with the proposed charity concert, charity records and other events designed to raise money specifically for the tsunami appeal.

	<p pid=".995W.9/2">The Anti-social Behaviour Act 2003 included powers to issue Fixed Penalty Notices for graffiti on public property, enabling local authorities to issue such notices to people who commit &quot;minor&quot; acts of graffiti and to allow all local authorities to retain income from Fixed Penalty Notices issued for graffiti for use in local environmental improvements.</p>
	<p pid=".995W.9/3">In the case of graffiti on private buildings owners are expected to remove it.

	<p pid=".1000W.0/1">The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister has always been clear that we would issue an Amending Report for the 2003&ndash;04 settlement to incorporate the revised 2001 population estimates. It is only fair that authorities should receive the correct amount of grant relative to the updated population estimates. Indeed, we consulted on options for the 2003&ndash;04 and 2004&ndash;05 Amending Reports last summer.</p>
	<p pid=".1000W.0/2">However, the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister appreciates that it is not possible for authorities that receive less grant under the Amending Report than they did under the original Local Government Finance Report to reopen their budgets for 2003&ndash;04. For this reason we will pay, or recover, any changes in 2003&ndash;04 grant amounts during 2005&ndash;06; and we have proposed amending the floor damping scheme for 2005&ndash;06 to ensure that all authorities should receive at least the floor increase in their formula grant after paying back any money owed under the 2003&ndash;04 Amending Report.</p>

	<p pid=".1001W.2/1">In calculating the area cost adjustment (ACA), authorities are grouped together to make sure that there is enough wage data in each area to produce ACA factors which are robust and stable from year to year. Hampshire and the Isle of Wight are grouped together and so receive the same area cost adjustment. On balance, the New Earnings Survey sample size for the Isle of Wight is such that their labour costs cannot be estimated with the same degree of precision as other, more populous, areas. The Isle of Wight sample size is no larger than other unitary, metropolitan or London boroughs that we have combined together in order to avoid small samples.

	<p pid=".1001W.5/1">The provisional local government finance settlement for 2005&ndash;06 provides an increase in formula grant of 5.6 per cent. and we have been able to guarantee that, for the third successive year, all authorities receive a grant increase which is at least above the rate of inflation. Overall grant increases by &pound;3.5 billion or 6.2 per cent., which means that since we took office we have increased Government grant to local government by 33 per cent. in real terms.</p>
	<p pid=".1001W.5/2">Given this substantial investment in local government and scope for efficiency gains, the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister expects to see significantly lower council tax increases next year. We expect all authorities to budget prudently and minimise demands on council taxpayers. Average council tax increase in England in 2005&ndash;06 should be less than 5 per cent. We are prepared to take even tougher capping action than we did in 2004&ndash;05. This applies to all authorities, including police and fire authorities.</p>

The Government made a commitment to limit any decrease in grant to individual authorities to no more than 7.5 per cent. The majority of authorities received the average reduction of 5 per cent.

The UK also played a key role in drafting last year's UN General Assembly Human Rights Resolution on Burma. The Resolution, adopted by the UN in December, condemned the many human rights abuses in the country, including against ethnic groups.</p>

	<p pid=".1017W.8/1">I am deeply concerned that the Burmese military government has formally extended Daw Aung San Suu Kyi's house arrest for another year. As I made clear on <phrase class="date" code="2004-11-30">30 November 2004</phrase>, her continued detention is completely unjustified and unacceptable. A copy of my statement is available on the Foreign and Commonwealth Office website: <a href="http://www.fco.gov.uk/policy/news/press-releases">www.fco.gov.uk/policy/news/press-releases</a>. We have repeatedly called for her immediate release, most recently when I met the Burmese Ambassador on <phrase class="date" code="2004-11-29">29 November 2004</phrase>, and we will continue to raise the issue with the Burmese authorities. We and our EU and international partners as well as the UN and other international agencies and the Association of South East Asian Nations have all called for the restrictions on her to be lifted.</p>
	<p pid=".1017W.8/2">In the meantime our Embassy in Rangoon monitors the situation closely and maintains contact with the National League for Democracy, including in regard to Daw Aung San Suu Kyi's state of health. Her doctor is able to visit her occasionally and I agree with the hon. Member that the State Peace and Development Council is responsible for her safety and health, as it is for the safety and health of all political prisoners in Burma.</p>

	<p pid=".1021W.12/1">No formal research has been conducted on consistency among UK embassies in applying the requirements for granting student visas. However, Entry Clearance Officers at the UK's visa-issuing posts assess each visa application on its own merits according to the requirements of the UK Immigration Rules. To ensure that Entry Clearance Officers apply the Immigration Rules correctly and consistently, they receive thorough training and are given extensive and detailed guidelines as well as being managed by an experienced Entry Clearance Manager.</p>
	<p pid=".1021W.12/2">Most student visa refusals (those for studies of more than six months) attract an automatic right of appeal. If the applicant decides to appeal the decision to refuse, the Entry Clearance Officer will review the application. If the decision to refuse is upheld, the appeal proceeds to the Immigration Appellate Authority where it is assessed. If the adjudicator determines that the refusal decision was not made in accordance with the requirements of the Immigration Rules then the appeal will be allowed. In this way, the appeals process is an additional safeguard against any inconsistent decision making.</p>
	<p pid=".1021W.12/3">In addition, the Independent Monitor for Entry Clearance annually reviews a random sample of entry clearance refusals that do not attract a right of appeal, including those relating to student applications for visits of less than six months, and reports to my right hon.

	<p pid=".1031W.8/1">The Department has given a clear commitment to improve patient privacy and dignity, and has set three objectives for national health service trusts, which require them to provide single-sex accommodation for hospital in-patients.</p>
	<p pid=".1031W.8/2">We use the term &quot;accommodation&quot; rather than &quot;wards&quot;, as this expands the scope of the requirement to segregate men and women to areas which do not fall within the traditional definition of a ward, for example to care environments which are residential in design.</p>
	<p pid=".1031W.8/3">Single-sex accommodation is defined as single-sex sleeping areas, separate bathroom and toilet facilities for men and women and, for those trusts delivering mental health services, safe facilities for the mentally ill. The separation of male and female sleeping areas can be achieved in a variety of ways, including the use of single rooms and combinations of single-sex bays.</p>
	<p pid=".1031W.8/4">The NHS has worked hard to achieve our standards. By December 2003,</p>
	<p pid=".1031W.8/5" class="indent">99 per cent. of NHS trusts provided single-sex sleeping accommodation for planned admissions and have robust operational policies in place to protect: patients' privacy and dignity;</p>
	<p pid=".1031W.8/6" class="indent">99 per cent. of NHS trusts met the additional criteria set to ensure the safety of patients who are mentally ill; and</p>
	<p pid=".1031W.8/7" class="indent">97 per cent. of NHS trusts provided properly segregated bathroom and toilet facilities for men and women.</p>
	<p pid=".1031W.8/8">The small number of NHS trusts who have yet to achieve the objectives have hospital development works underway, the completion of which will bring them to the required standard.</p>
	<p pid=".1031W.8/9">In some circumstances, such as emergency admissions, the use of mixed-sex accommodation may be unavoidable. This is regrettable, but no hospital will turn a patient away because a bed appropriate to their gender is not immediately available. Good practice indicates that patients in this situation be moved to appropriate single-sex accommodation within 48 hours.</p>
