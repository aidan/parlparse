	<p pid=".1331W.3/1">The Municipal Waste Management Survey of local authorities in England for 2002&ndash;03, shows that 14.28m tonnes of biodegradable municipal waste was disposed of to landfill, and 1.2m tonnes composted. In addition 1.1m tonnes of paper and card were recycled. As yet there is no method of measuring the amount recycled through home composting.</p>
	<p pid=".1331W.3/2">From the Environment Agency's National Waste Production Survey of a sample of 40,000 businesses, conducted in 1998, it is estimated that 2.78m tonnes of biodegradable industrial and commercial waste was disposed of to landfill, 0.85m tonnes composted and a further 4.75m tonnes of paper and card recycled.</p>
	<p pid=".1331W.3/3">The Government are taking a number of steps to increase the amount of biowaste composted. For example, we have established the Waste Implementation Programme (WIP), to support local authorities in achieving the UK's Landfill Directive targets to divert biodegradable municipal waste from landfill. The Government have also established the Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP) to create stable and efficient markets for recyclates, including organic material. WRAP is also running a home composting programme and has already organised distribution of over 60,000 composting bins to households in England. In addition Defra, through the Environmental Action Fund (EAF), has provided the Composting Association with &pound;282,000 over three years to raise awareness of composting.</p>
	<p pid=".1331W.3/4">These and other measures have seen the proportion of municipal biowaste composted rise to 32 per cent. of all municipal waste recycling in England in 2002&ndash;03.</p>

	<p pid=".1331W.6/1">Waste is a devolved issue. The Government have taken numerous steps to increase recycling in England. For example, national household waste recycling targets have been set, supported by statutory recycling and composting targets with an increase in funding for local government waste activities for each local authority. Government have also established the Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP) to create stable and efficient markets for recycled materials across the UK.</p>
	<p pid=".1331W.6/2">This specific action on recycling is supported by steps to move municipal waste management up the waste hierarchy. For example, in England, a Landfill Allowances Trading Scheme for local authorities is being developed and the Waste Implementation Programme (WIP) has been established, to support authorities in achieving the UK's Landfill Directive targets to divert biodegradable municipal waste from landfill. In addition, the Government have committed to increasing the UK Landfill Tax rate to &pound;35 per tonne of active waste in the medium term.</p>
	<p pid=".1331W.6/3">As a result of these and other actions the proportion of municipal waste being recycled in England has increased to 15.6 per cent. in 2002&ndash;03 and we expect to meet our 2003&ndash;04 national household waste recycling target of 17 per cent.</p>
	<p pid=".1331W.6/4">Steps taken to increase recycling of non-municipal waste include amending the Producer Responsibility Obligations (Packaging Waste) Regulations 1997: new UK targets were set last year to raise overall recovery by obligated companies from 59 per cent. in 2003 to 63 per cent. this year and 70 per cent. by 2008, with the percentage to be achieved through recycling rising to 95 per cent. in 2007&ndash;08. We will also be announcing shortly a package, funded by Landfill Tax escalator receipts from business more resource efficient, to help business in England become more resource efficient.</p>

	<p pid=".1334W.3/1">The original decision to close the Exeter office was based on a recommendation made by PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) in its report on the organisation and regional structure of the Consumer Council for Water. PwC recommended that the offices in Exeter and Bristol currently serving the south west and Wessex regions should be merged into one office and located either in one of the existing offices or at a new site in Taunton.</p>
	<p pid=".1334W.3/2">However, we have since given very careful consideration to a number of representations received and reviewed the decision to close or relocate regional offices. We concluded that against the background of the representations and the current periodic review of water prices, the benefits for water customers in maintaining the existing regional system of consumer representation outweighs the benefits of rationalisation at this time.</p>
	<p pid=".1334W.3/3">We now intend to leave it to the new CCW to consider PwC's recommendations and to decide, in the light of future circumstances what changes, if any, it wishes to make to its regional structure.</p>

	<p pid=".1336W.6/1">We have significantly improved the concessionary fares scheme for older and disabled people who are now entitled to at least half-fare travel on local buses. We have also introduced a half-fare for people aged 60 and over on many long-distance scheduled coach services.</p>
	<p pid=".1336W.6/2">Given the close correlation between disability and age, the regulations we have introduced to require new trains, buses and coaches to provide a range of features to improve access are also benefiting many older people. During the last three years over 1,400 new fully accessible rail vehicles have entered service and there will be over 1,000 more within the next year. Around 29 per cent. of buses seating over 22 passengers are already accessible, and in major cities the proportion is much higher.</p>

Following the announcement that the current Serjeant at Arms, Sir Michael Cummins, would shortly retire, the Speaker decided that the post should be advertised both internally and externally, in the national press. A recruitment board was set up under the chairmanship of the Clerk of the House. It included an external member, drawn from the Office of the Commissioner for Public Appointments' central list of independent assessors, and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/948" name="Oliver Heald">the hon.

The board agreed a long list of candidates for preliminary interviews by external recruitment consultants and, subsequently, a short list for final interviews, conducted by the board.

His appointment was announced to the House on <phrase class="date" code="2004-07-20">20 July</phrase> and he will take over from Sir Michael on <phrase class="date" code="2005-01-01">1 January 2005</phrase>.</p>

	<p pid=".1339W.6/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply</p>
	<p pid=".1339W.6/2">The Government do not collect figures on the cost of credit card fraud but the Association for Payment Clearing Services (APACS) estimates the cost of plastic card fraud on UK-issued cards in 2003 to have been &pound;402.4 million, a decrease of five per cent. over the previous year.</p>
	<p pid=".1339W.6/3">The Home Office provided &pound;1.4 million over two years (towards a total cost of &pound;5.6 million) to fund, jointly with the banking industry, a specialist police unit, the Dedicated Cheque and Plastic Crime Unit (DCPCU). The pilot, which ran from April 2002 to April 2004, was successful in detecting or preventing significant fraud on the banks and card issuers. The Unit is continuing with full financial support from the industry. The Home Office continues to chair the Steering Group.</p>
	<p pid=".1339W.6/4">We are also providing significant extra resources for fraud policing more generally. The Home Office and the Corporation of London have each agreed to contribute &pound;1 million towards the cost of an expanded City of London Police fraud squad. The Home Office has also met capital start up costs of the new unit. This funding will enable the City of London Police to expand its fraud squad significantly and take a lead role in the investigation of fraud in London and the south east, including providing police resources for the majority of Serious Fraud Office cases.</p>
	<p pid=".1339W.6/5">A great deal of fraud can be prevented if organisations have proper fraud prevention measures in place. Prevention initiatives therefore complement fraud investigation and prosecution.</p>
	<p pid=".1339W.6/6">We have encouraged the financial and retail sectors to work towards early implementation of more secure systems to combat fraud, including the introduction of microchips into payment cards to help authentication, and the use of PIN codes in place of signatures.</p>
	<p pid=".1339W.6/7">The Home Office has launched a website to combat internet fraud. The &quot;e-tailing mini site&quot; (part of the Crime Reduction Website) provides information to help both businesses and consumers protect themselves when using the internet.</p>
	<p pid=".1339W.6/8">We have also recently published, jointly with the Association of Payment Clearing Services (APACS), a leaflet for members of the public about safe credit card use. Supplies of the leaflet have been sent to all police forces and Crime and Disorder Reduction Partnerships in England and Wales.</p>

Of these, 35 orders have been imposed as a result of individuals being intercepted by the police en-route to Portugal on the basis of evidence of previous involvement in violence or disorder, while three orders have been imposed on the basis of violence and disorder during the tournament. In addition, 48 individuals are currently subject to unresolved banning order proceedings as a result of being intercepted en-route to the tournament and eight individuals are subject to proceedings prompted by conviction of offences of violence and disorder in Portugal.

	<p pid=".1354W.12/1">Following the charging pilots in 2002&ndash;3, and the legislative changes in the Criminal Justice Act 2003, the Crown Prosecution Service, in partnership with the police, arc implementing the charging arrangements.</p>
	<p pid=".1354W.12/2">Shadow Charging arrangements have been implemented in all police force areas in England and Wales, and crown prosecutors now provide charging advice at 248 of the 373 operational units during normal office hours.</p>
	<p pid=".1354W.12/3">A Commencement Order (under the Criminal Justice Act 2003) was issued on the <phrase class="date" code="2004-01-29">29 January 2004</phrase>, which allows the Director of Public Prosecutions to apply Statutory Charging arrangements. The statutory scheme was first applied at Longsight in Greater Manchester. The scheme has since been rolled out across West Yorkshire, Kent, South Yorkshire, Cleveland, Lancashire, Northumbria, Avon &amp; Somerset, Nottinghamshire, Humberside and Greater Manchester.</p>
	<p pid=".1354W.12/4">It is expected that the benefits will be a reduction in the rate of discontinuances to 69 per cent. guilty plea rate to increase by 30 per cent. and the conviction rate to increase by 15 per cent.</p>
	<p pid=".1354W.12/5">Early consultation between police officers and crown prosecutors will assist in getting the charge right first time, and reducing remedial work often required to bring cases up to appropriate quality standards. Weeding out weak prosecutions at an early stage will save further effort for both the police and the Crown Prosecution Service. In addition, an increase in guilty pleas will result in fewer trials, with benefits for not only the police and the Crown Prosecution Service, but also the courts. These improvements will result in an estimated 3.2 per cent. efficiency gain on contested cases going through the criminal justice system.</p>

	<p pid=".1359W.11/1">Clinical trials submitted at the time of licensing have examined the safety and efficacy of the human insulin analogues (insulin glargine, insulin aspart and insulin lispro) in diabetic patients treated for up to 12 months. Generally, the side effects observed with the human insulin analogues were similar to those seen with existing human insulins, with the most commonly observed side effects being hypoglycaemia, visual disturbance and injection reactions.</p>
	<p pid=".1359W.11/2">The longer term safety of the use of human insulin analogues in routine clinical practice is closely monitored by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency. Any possible new safety issue to emerge is evaluated and, if necessary, product information for prescribers and patients is updated.</p>
	<p pid=".1359W.11/3">Full guidance on prescribing and use of human insulin analogues, including possible side effects is provided in the summary of product characteristics (the product information for prescribers) and the patient information leaflet. Key prescribing information is also included in the British National Formulary, which is made available by the Department to doctors and pharmacists.</p>

	<p pid=".1362W.5/1">We are taking the following measures to stop the illegal removal of organs from deceased adults and children.</p>
	<p pid=".1362W.5/2">The Retained Organs Commission (ROC) was set up in April 2001 to oversee the return of organs and tissues to families, and where requested, to provide advocacy to families and to advise trusts. The ROC issued its final report in March 2004 and this can be found at <a href="http://www.nhs.uk/retainedorgans">http://www.nhs.uk/retainedorgans</a>.</p>
	<p pid=".1362W.5/3">The Government's Human Tissue Bill, which had its second reading in the House of Lords in July 2004, provides the regulation of removal, storage and use of human organs and tissue. The Bill also makes provision for the creation of a new body, the Human Tissue Authority (HTA), which will prepare statutory guidance on all matters within its remit, as set out in the Bill.</p>
	<p pid=".1362W.5/4">Pending completion of the Bill's passage through Parliament and the establishment of the HTA, the Department published two documents in April 2003: &quot;The Use of human organs and Tissue, An Interim Statement&quot; and &quot;Families and post mortems, A Code of Practice&quot;. These provide guidance on the use of human organs and tissue and recommended practice for ensuring consent is obtained for hospital post-mortems and for the retention and use of organs following a hospital or coroner's post-mortem. These publications can be found on the Department's website.</p>
	<p pid=".1362W.5/5">The Department has also provided Section 64 grant funding to the National Bereavement Partnership to set up a helpline to support families and the general public affected by issues around post mortems and the possible retention of organs or tissues. This helpline will be able to provide essential information and advise those affected how they might take an inquiry forward with their local national health service trust.</p>

The GDC has published &quot;Standards of Dental Practice&quot;, which requires that dentists give full information on proposed treatment and costs to patients to enable them to make well-informed decisions on the type of treatment they are to receive. We will also be amending the Dentists Act 1984 to give the GDC new powers to ensure the fitness to practise of dentists and to establish a scheme to investigate and resolve complaints about private dental treatment.

The Health and Social Care (Community Health and Standards) Act 2003 provides the commissioning of general dental services is to be delegated to primary care trusts from October 2005. This will ensure that the developing dental specialities in primary care, including orthodontics, are given the right opportunities to contribute more to NHS patient care. Provision of more specialist dental care in a high street setting will mean that practitioners no longer need to refer patients who could be treated in a primary care setting to hospital. In this way, staff at hospital dental departments will be able to concentrate on more complex treatments.</p>

During the current three year period (2003/04&mdash;2005/06) we expect to give over &pound;200 million in aid to Pakistan. There have been several high level visits to and from the UK.</p>
	<p pid=".1381W.8/3">We warmly welcome the ongoing progress in Pakistan's transition to democracy. The decision by the Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group in May this year to readmit Pakistan to the Councils of the Commonwealth was taken in recognition of the progress made in restoring democratic principles. The recent election of Shaukat Aziz to the National Assembly and his subsequent confirmation as Prime Minister is a further positive development. We look forward to working closely with the new Prime Minister of Pakistan and his government.</p>

They made clear in the White Paper published in September 2003 (Cm 5934) that they favoured moves to reduce barriers in international trade, provided that this did not lead to an increase in the internal powers of the Union, and that, as now, voting arrangements for such agreements mirrored those required for the adoption of equivalent rules internally. Both principles are set out in the treaty. The latter principle is set out at III-217(4). III-217(6) makes clear that the CCP does not affect the division of competences between the Union and the member states, and cannot in itself lead to legislative or regulatory harmonisation among the member states.</p>

Over 3 million refugees have been helped to return to Afghanistan. 4.5 million children are in school this year and over 30 per cent. are girls. A vaccination campaign has led to the near eradication of polio and the immunisation of 9 million children against measles saving over 35,000 lives. Progress has also been made in economic recovery with the International Monetary Fund estimating economy growing by 30 per cent. last year.</p>
	<p pid=".1386W.4/3">At the international conference in Berlin, donors pledged $8.2 billion over three years to help rebuild Afghanistan. Finance Minister Ghani said donors met Afghanistan's target for this year, pledging $4.5 billion, and covered more than two thirds of its expectations over the next three years. On October 9, the first-ever direct presidential elections in the post-Taliban country will be held. Voter registration has now closed with over 10.5 million Afghans registered (42 per cent. are women). This is hugely encouraging result, which we hope will lead to the successful conclusion of the Bonn Process.</p>

	<p pid=".1387W.0/1">The Department for International Development's (DFID) support for water and sanitation is predominantly channelled through our country programmes and support to multi-lateral institutions. Expenditure allocations reflect developing country governments' own priorities, and our assistance is co-ordinated with that of other donors. DFID works to assist countries to use their budgets for greatest impact on reducing poverty and achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). For these reasons, DFID has not made a forward commitment specifically for the water sector.</p>
	<p pid=".1387W.0/2">However, DFID significantly supports the water sector providing the UK's bilateral expenditure of approximately &pound;90 million (the last period for which precise data are available is 2001&ndash;02 when bilateral water expenditure was &pound;87 million), which represents approximately 6 per cent. of the bilateral aid budget. This includes programmes in which water and sanitation and hygiene promotion are the main aims, and those where water and sanitation are components associated with wider objectives such as better health or education or improved urban management. DFID's contribution to multilateral expenditure on water and sanitation is estimated to be in excess of &pound;40 million per year. As a result, the UK was the fourth largest contributor of financial aid to the water sector in 2000 and 2001, and fifth in 2002. DFID is in the process of updating projections of bilateral and multilateral water-related expenditure through to 2007&ndash;08, taking into account the autumn 2004 resource a location round.</p>
