	<p pid="a.1059W.8/2">There were 189 responses to the policy review. A summary of the responses received is included in the Explanatory Memorandum published alongside the draft specific duties regulations on <phrase class="date" code="2011-06-27">27 June 2011</phrase>. The discursive nature of the responses means that giving exact proportions in favour or against is not possible. But in general terms:</p>
	<p pid="a.1059W.8/3">virtually all respondents supported the stated aims of reducing unnecessary processes and bureaucracy, and promoting greater transparency and accountability;</p>
	<p pid="a.1059W.8/4">there was also widespread agreement that the revised regulations would achieve the first of these aims;</p>
	<p pid="a.1059W.8/5">there was a more mixed response in regard to the latter aim. Around 40% of the public bodies supported the proposed approach, while around 80% of respondents overall raised concerns of one sort or another.</p>
	<p pid="a.1059W.8/6">The Government strongly believes the approach set out in the policy review is the right approach, and that the draft regulations strike the right balance between prescription and flexibility. This approach will help public bodies comply with the Equality Duty and understand what constitutes good practice through guidance, not regulation.</p>
	<p pid="a.1059W.8/7">But we have listened to the concerns raised and will review the operation of the regulations in two years time, to ensure they are delivering the transparency and accountability we expect.</p>

	<p pid="a.1061W.2/1">The Child Maintenance and Enforcement Commission is responsible for the child maintenance system. I have asked the Child Maintenance Commissioner to write to my hon. Friend with the information requested and I have seen the response.</p>
	<p pid="a.1061W.2/2" class="letterfrom">Letter from Noel Shanahan, dated <phrase class="date" code="2011-09-08">8 September 2011</phrase></p>
	<p pid="a.1061W.2/3">In reply to your recent Parliamentary Question about the Child Support Agency, the Secretary of State promised a substantive reply from the Child Maintenance Commissioner as the Child Support Agency is now the responsibility of the Child Maintenance and Enforcement Commission.</p>
	<p pid="a.1061W.2/4">You asked the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, whether he has any plans to amend the Child Support (Information Evidence and Disclosure) Regulations 1992 to enable the Child Maintenance and Enforcement Commission to confirm a child's attendance with a school or college in order to verify the parent with care's entitlement to child benefit.</p>
	<p pid="a.1061W.2/5">The Child Support (Information Evidence and Disclosure) Regulations 1992 were replaced by the Child Support Information Regulations 2008. The Child Maintenance and Enforcement Commission (the Commission) has no plans to amend these regulations as mentioned in the question.</p>
	<p pid="a.1061W.2/6">Under child support legislation, children under the age of 16 are considered a child for child maintenance purposes regardless of their attendance at a school or college. However, for children between the ages of 16 and 19, the criterion used for deciding whether they are considered a qualifying child for child maintenance purposes is if child benefit is in payment for that child.</p>
	<p pid="a.1061W.2/7">Whilst matters relating to child maintenance are the responsibility of the Commission; matters relating to the entitlement and payment of child benefit are the responsibility of HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC).</p>
	<p pid="a.1061W.2/8">The Child Maintenance and Other Payments Act 2008 (the 2008 Act) provided for a new child maintenance scheme. The Commission is developing plans for the new child maintenance scheme and the 2008 Act provides for the maximum age of a child under the new scheme to be 20 years of age, which will align with the maximum age for the payment of Child Benefit and Child Tax Credits. Detailed rules about the new scheme will be contained in regulations which will be subject to public consultation before the new scheme goes live. The consultation process will be publicly announced, although the date for this process to begin is still to be confirmed.</p>
	<p pid="a.1061W.2/9">Where a child benefit claim is cancelled with retrospective effect, then the Commission, upon notification, can close the case from the date that the child benefit claim ceased, and the Commission can then consider, refunding, the non-resident parent or reducing any arrears balance as appropriate. Additionally, if the non-resident parent believes that child benefit is not lawfully in payment, they should contact HMRC who may investigate this claim.</p>
	<p pid="a.1061W.2/10">I hope you find this answer helpful.</p>

	<p pid="a.1063W.2/1">The Department for Work and Pensions does not produce labour market forecasts. The independent Office for Budget Responsibility has forecast a net increase of around 1 million in total employment between 2011 and 2015, but does not break down its forecasts by household type</p>
	<p pid="a.1063W.2/2">The latest estimate published by the Office for National Statistics is that in April-June 2011, among UK households including at least one person aged 16 to 64 years, 370,000 households (1.8% of the total) contained no-one who had ever worked. A household is defined as having never worked if all adult members are not currently in employment and state that they have never had paid work (apart from casual or holiday work, or a job they are waiting to begin).</p>
	<p pid="a.1063W.2/3">The number of households where no-one has ever worked illustrates part of the wider problems of workless households and long-term unemployment that the UK currently faces. The Government are committed to tackling these urgent problems. This is why we launched the Work programme this summer, which will give tailor made support to help people get off benefits and into work, and through universal credit we are overhauling the benefits system to ensure that people are always better off in work.</p>
	<p pid="a.1063W.2/4">We have also begun to reassess 1.6 million of the people who claim incapacity benefits to see if they are fit for work. Around 10,000 people a week are being asked to take part in a process that will focus on what they can do, not what they cannot. In return we will give them the specialist help they need to get back to work.</p>

	<p pid="a.1063W.5/1">Since October 2008, new claims to incapacity benefits have been made to employment and support allowance so the only flows to old-style incapacity benefits&#8212;incapacity benefit (IB) and severe disablement allowance (SDA)&#8212;have been from linked claims. Information on flows to incapacity benefits and other benefits can be found on the Department's tabulation tool at the following link:</p>
	<p pid="a.1063W.5/2"><a href="http://83.244.183.180/flows/flows_on/tabtool.html">http://83.244.183.180/flows/flows_on/tabtool.html</a></p>
	<p pid="a.1063W.5/3">For example, the following link shows flows onto old-style incapacity benefits for people of working age by region. This shows the number of flows in the year to February 2011 was 26,500 in Great Britain, of which 2,050 were in Yorkshire and the Humber.</p>
	<p pid="a.1063W.5/4"><a href="http://83.244.183.180/flows/flows_on/ibsda/cdquarter/ccgor/ccclient/a_carate_r_cdquarter_c_ccgor_p_ccclient_working_age.html">http://83.244.183.180/flows/flows_on/ibsda/cdquarter/ccgor/ccclient/a_carate_r_cdquarter_c_ccgor_p_ccclient_working _age.html</a></p>
	<p pid="a.1063W.5/5">The number of flows onto old-style incapacity benefits in York unitary authority is around 60. This is calculated from further breakdowns available using the tabulation tool.</p>
	<p pid="a.1063W.5/6">Information tracking people claiming old-style incapacity benefits and what happened to them at the personal capability assessment (PCA) is held only from October 2008 onwards. At this stage most assessments related to existing longer-term incapacity benefit claims and not new incapacity benefit claims, (i.e. repeat PCAs and not the initial PCA). We have therefore presented information relating to both initial and repeat PCAs combined.</p>
	<p pid="a.1063W.5/7">Table 1 shows information on the number and outcomes of PCAs carried out between March 2010 and February 2011 (the latest data available). Note that the information in Table 1 cannot be directly compared to data on new claims to IB as the data contain information on repeat PCAs which make up the vast majority of PCAs carried out in this time period.</p>

	<p pid="a.1065W.5/1">The independent &#8216;Making Automatic Enrolment Work&#8217;<sup>(1)</sup> review, which reported last October, recognised that facilitating transfers is critical to success of reforms. The review concluded that these issues are not restricted to how transfer rules apply to NEST, but apply across the pensions market. The review also recognised the importance of the transfer restrictions on NEST during the roll-out of the reforms and recommended that the Government address the issue of transfers with a view to relaxing the restrictions on NEST once the reforms were fully rolled out.</p>

These statistics are based on Households Below Average Income (HBAI) data sourced from the Family Resources Survey (FRS). This uses disposable household income, adjusted using modified OECD equivalisation factors for household size and composition, as an income measure as a proxy for standard of living. Family Resources Survey figures are for Great Britain up to 1997-98, and for the United Kingdom from 1998-99 onwards. 2. Net disposable incomes have been used to answer the question. This includes earnings from employment and self-employment, state support, income from occupational and private pensions, investment income and other sources. Income tax, payments, national insurance contributions, council tax/domestic rates and some other payments are deducted from incomes. 3. Figures have been presented on an After Housing Cost basis. For After Housing Costs, housing costs are deducted from income. 4. All estimates are based on survey data and are therefore subject to a degree of uncertainty. Small differences should be treated with caution as these will be affected by sampling error and variability in non-response. 5. The reference period for HBAI figures is the financial year. 6. Numbers of pensioners have been rounded to the nearest 100,000 pensioners. 7. Proportions of pensioners in low-income households have been rounded to the nearest percentage point.</td> </tr>

Employers pay statutory sick pay (and in some cases occupational sick pay) but are not required to submit this information to the Government unless they are seeking reimbursement for monies paid under the percentage threshold scheme. Consequently there are no comprehensive centrally recorded administrative data. Sample sizes from survey data are also too small to address the specific question raised.</p>

When there is sufficient reliable information about an offender's mental health, the CPS will take this into account when making the decision whether to charge. Evidence that the defendant has a significant physical or mental illness is a factor that the CPS will take into account when deciding if a prosecution is required in the public interest. However, the defendant's health must always be balanced with the seriousness of the offence and the need to safeguard the public.</p>

There is an Inter-Departmental Ministerial Group on Human Trafficking to co-ordinate work on trafficking across Government which includes Ministers from the devolved Administrations. The next meeting is scheduled for mid-autumn.</p>

	<p pid="a.1075W.6/1">The vehicle entrance at Derby Gate is scheduled to close from November for a period of about six months while works are carried out to install the perimeter security measures. The Curtis Green entrance offers the most practical solution for vehicles access and egress during the work. As the principal vehicle entry point, improvements to the existing entrance were needed. While upgrading the entrance, the opportunity was identified to improve traffic management in the long-term when Derby Gate re-opens by establishing a one-way traffic flow system. This one-way system has been in operation since the new facility was completed in August to resolve any problems in advance of Derby Gate's temporary closure. Planning consent was required, which included an assurance that there would not be disruption to the public road network. The business case for the Curtis Green entrance improvement works was approved in accordance with set procedures. Decisions on the authorisations of works and operations are made under delegations given by the House of Commons Commission, and in line with criteria set by Member committees where appropriate. It is not the Commission's practice to publish names of individual staff who took particular decisions.</p>
	<p pid="a.1075W.6/2">Subject to the agreement of the final account with the contractor, the total cost of the works to improve the Curtis Green entrance is estimated currently to be approximately &#163;627,000.</p>

This is in line with other cost efficiencies we are making and reflects decreasing staff numbers in the Department.

DFID support to PBS is protected by a range of systems and safeguards, including: quarterly audits; fairness tests that ensure that funds are distributed fairly across the regions and districts of Ethiopia; and the posting of budgets at local levels&#8212;to promote transparency and enable citizens to hold the authorities to account. We also provide funding to local civil society organisations to help citizens provide feedback on the quality and priorities of basic service delivery. And we are designing with other PBS contributors an independent grievance mechanism for citizens to report any wrongdoing.</p>

	<p pid="a.1087W.2/2">A moratorium exempting micro businesses from new regulation applies to new employment law, and the recent Modern Workplaces proposals take this into account. However, no new regulations in relation to redundancy are currently planned, and no assessment has therefore been made in this specific area.</p>
	<p pid="a.1087W.2/3">More widely, the Employment Law Review is considering how to reduce the burden of existing regulation on businesses of all sizes, to make it easier for them to take on staff and grow. Any proposals for reform would need to assess the impact on the economy as a whole, including on all-sized firms, workers and Government. Where relevant, proposals would also need to consider whether an exemption for micro-businesses would be appropriate.</p>

	<p pid="a.1088W.7/1">As part of a package of measures to help local communities and businesses to recover from these disturbances, we have set up the &#163;20 million High Street Support Scheme. Working with local authorities, the scheme provides business rate hardship relief, building confidence and helping affected businesses get back up and running.</p>
	<p pid="a.1088W.7/2">The scheme is specifically designed to help as many businesses as possible get back in business as quickly as possible, rather than as a compensation fund for direct loss of earnings or business income.</p>
	<p pid="a.1088W.7/3">This does not mean that the scheme will not help small and medium-size enterprises in other related ways. The grants will cover many other costs of re-starting the business, including, for example, staff costs incurred while the business is affected by temporary closure, many of the costs not covered fully by insurance and help with cash flow while insurance claims are being made.</p>
	<p pid="a.1088W.7/4">It will also fully reimburse local authorities for their costs in providing hardship relief for businesses affected by the disturbances. I hope that local authorities would take full account of this in taking the decision to offer relief to affected businesses. I know that some local authorities have already decided to do this and as business rates are a significant aspect of a businesses operating costs, this should make a real difference to businesses.</p>

We are removing the national brownfield target, as this had a distorting effect in some areas, driving up land prices and resulting in high density, unpopular development.</p>

Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40116" name="Eric Pickles">the Member for Brentwood and Ongar (Mr Pickles)</phrase>, set out proposals to allow local retention of business rates in his oral statement to the House on <phrase class="date" code="2011-07-18">18 July 2011</phrase>, <phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2011-07-18.662"><i>Official Report</i>, columns 662-64</phrase>. The Government's proposals will ensure a stable starting point, so that no local authority will be worse off as a result of its business rates base at the outset of the new system.</p>
	<p pid="a.1101W.2/2">The precise impact of the Government's proposals upon individual local authorities will depend on a range of factors, including future business rates growth at the local level, the behavioural response to the changes, and the final design of the scheme following consultation. The Government have sought views on their proposals and, on <phrase class="date" code="2011-08-19">19 August</phrase>, published eight technical papers which provide further details on the proposals, together with an interactive calculator. The calculator enables users to explore the possible effects of certain scheme design options based upon their own assumptions about local circumstances.</p>
	<p pid="a.1101W.2/3">The proposals incorporate a range of protections to ensure councils can meet local needs, including a safety net for places in need of additional support, funded by a levy recovering a share of disproportionate gain, while at the same time ensuring that councils always benefit from encouraging business growth in their area.</p>

	<p pid="a.1105W.0/1">The Secretary of State has received two representations. The British Olympic Association (BOA), as the National Olympic Committee for Great Britain and Northern Ireland, is responsible for allocating accreditation for the Olympic Games for media based in the United Kingdom. The British Paralympic Association (BPA), as the National Paralympic Committee, is similarly responsible for UK media allocation to the Paralympic Games. The process for the Paralympic Games has yet to be finalised.</p>
	<p pid="a.1105W.0/2">I understand from the BOA that the International Olympic Committee (IOC) has awarded the BOA far more accreditations than in the past and more accreditations than any other National Olympic Committee. Over 3,000 applications have been received for the approximately 400 accreditations available.</p>
	<p pid="a.1105W.0/3">To assist with the allocation process, the BOA established a Media Accreditation Committee composed of representatives from a broad spectrum of the written and photographic press respected for their knowledge and experience from Olympic Games or understanding of the UK media.</p>
	<p pid="a.1105W.0/4">For 2012 the IOC awarded BOA the following number of accreditations:</p>

	<p pid="a.1105W.0/16">When determining the allocation of accreditations BOA has taken into account, among other things, continuous editorial commitment to Olympic sport throughout the four-year Olympic cycle; history of attending Olympic Games; circulation numbers; publication frequency. Throughout this process the BOA's primary purpose has been to ensure that the allocations made are fair given the limited number of accreditations available. The Press Association has been appointed by the IOC as the National Host News Agency for the London 2012 Olympic Games (and has also been appointed by the International Paralympic Committee as the National Host News Agency for the 2012 Paralympic Games) to service the local and regional press in the UK and they have committed to covering every British athlete at the games. The BOA has also agreed that regional written and photographic press who applied for accreditation should benefit from a small number of passes to be allocated on a pool basis. The distribution of these will be decided by the BOA with guidance from the Newspaper Society, in consultation with regional publishers. The Newspaper Society will be in touch with representatives of regional newspaper groups in the next few months to set up a meeting to discuss practical arrangements over operation of the pool.</p>
	<p pid="a.1105W.0/17">I will shortly be writing to the BOA on this matter and I will ensure the outcome of this correspondence is passed on to my hon. Friend.</p>

	<p pid="a.1113W.0/4">Local authorities have told us that the requirement (under Section 11 of the Childcare Act 2006) to publish nationally prescribed sufficiency assessments every three years is burdensome. The Government considers that a local annual report would be a more effective way of enabling parents to hold their local authority to account. The Government have therefore also decided to consult on bringing forward legislation to repeal the Section 11 duty. This consultation will be published on the Department for Education's website later in the autumn.</p>

	<p pid="a.1116W.0/1">The current Special Educational Needs (SEN) Code of Practice sets out the duties, rights and entitlements associated with the SEN framework in England. When changes to that framework, following the SEN and disability Green Paper, are being made a revised SEN Code of Practice will consulted on and laid before the House for approval.</p>
	<p pid="a.1116W.0/2">The revised Code will set out the timescales and processes which attach to the proposed single assessment process and Education, Health and Care Plan and the more multi-agency approach which will be inherent in these new features of the framework. It will set out schools' continuing duty to appoint a qualified teacher as a Special Educational Needs Coordinator, to whom children with SEN can have access. It will remind schools of their duty to do their best to make special educational provision for all children with learning difficulties, including those children identified with SEN but whose needs do not exceed what is normally available in schools and may not therefore have an Education, Health and Care Plan. It will also give advice to schools on identifying children with SEN and the approaches they can use to set targets for children and review progress without increasing bureaucratic burdens.</p>
	<p pid="a.1116W.0/3">The revised Code will set out the expectations of all parties to an Education, Health and Care Plan and the arrangements for accountability, with the local authority having a duty to make the special educational provision. The new plans will provide the same statutory protection to parents as SEN statements including the right to appeal to the First-tier Tribunal (SEND) about local authority decisions in relation to SEN and provision to meet children's SEN. This will be reflected in a revised Code. The Green Paper gave a commitment that the Department will run pilots on giving children the right to appeal to the Tribunal.</p>

Adequately screened means the return of a testing kit that produces a definitive test result. It should be noted that these figures include people who have been invited by the programme for screening more than once on separate screening rounds.</p>

The National Treatment Agency took over full responsibility for managing NDTMS in 2004-05.

	<p pid="a.1122W.2/15">NICE recommends that substitute prescribing should always be accompanied by psychosocial interventions. In addition &#8220;Drug Misuse and Dependence: UK Guidelines on Clinical Management&#8221; (2007), a copy of which has already been placed in the Library, states that any decision to maintain a patient on long-term prescribing should be an active one agreed between the clinician and patient, reviewed at regular intervals, and part of a broader programme of care-planned social and psychological support.</p>

We are also promoting centres of excellence in departments where others are best placed to lead for the Crown.

Those who are detained have always been able to apply to an independent immigration judge for bail. Where the UK Border Agency believe there is a risk to the public we will vigorously oppose bail applications or ask the court to impose reporting and electronic tagging restrictions if bail is granted.</p>

The new sponsor must issue a Confirmation of Acceptance for Studies and the student must apply for new leave to remain. We would expect colleges to have insurance in place in order to repay fees if necessary, and students should check the position before accepting an offer.</p>

In 2011-12, the Home Office has allocated approximately &#163;36 million for policing and domestic Prevent activity, and the FCO has allocated approximately &#163;10 million for overseas activity. As delivery of the new Prevent strategy progresses, the balance of funding will be reviewed to ensure it remains proportionate to the threats we face, is targeted to deliver Prevent objectives, reaches people who are most vulnerable to radicalisation and provides value for money.

	<p pid="a.1145W.5/2">The Strategic Defence and Security Review called for one Queen Elizabeth (QE) class aircraft carrier to be converted to operate the more capable and cost-effective carrier variant of the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. The National Audit Office's report on Carrier Strike, published on <phrase class="date" code="2011-07-07">7 July 2011</phrase>, estimated the cost of converting a single carrier at &#163;800 million to &#163;1.2 billion, a reasonable estimate based on the maturity of information currently available. We are developing more detailed cost estimates as part of our ongoing work.</p>

	<p pid="a.1147W.2/1">The Army Foundation College Harrogate (AFC(H)) is a non-academic college and students undertake a vocational apprenticeship, designed to enable young recruits to prepare for military training and life. This includes the opportunity to work on key skills such as communication, application of numbers, working with others and problem-solving. Students have the opportunity to attain qualifications in numeracy, literacy and information technology.</p>

Nor is training in any of these specified categories delivered in the AFC(H) syllabus. However, during the course, recruits receive a range of educational development including: qualifications in numeracy and English; Level 2 Diploma for IT Users. They also have the opportunity to complete the European Computer Driving Licence (ECDL) and advanced ECDL; a critical thinking package, bolstered by three weeks of personnel and team development training, the aim of which is develop the recruits' ability to analyse and solve problems.</p>

	<p pid="a.1148W.0/1">We do not comment on the payment made to individual service personnel. However, the Armed Forces Compensation Scheme (AFCS) was reviewed by Admiral the Lord Boyce in 2010. He re-examined the increases made to the tariff levels in 2008 and concluded that the top level lump sum of &#163;570,000 remained appropriate.</p>
	<p pid="a.1148W.0/2">Having a maximum lump sum payable recognises that when considering individuals who are very profoundly injured, there comes a point where distinguishing between level of injury becomes impossible and the only equitable way to assess the amount payable is to treat individuals in this category in the same way.</p>
	<p pid="a.1148W.0/3">The guaranteed income payment element of an AFCS award, which is paid upon discharge to those who sustain serious illness or injury, can be the most financially beneficial part of the compensation package. This tax free, index linked, monthly income stream is paid from the point of service discharge for life, to recognise the effect of the injury on the future employment prospects of an individual and can be worth many hundreds of thousands of pounds.</p>

	<p pid="a.1148W.3/2">The difficulties in reconciling inventory system records with the accounting systems does not mean that we have lost any of these items.

	<p pid="a.1148W.3/9">C&amp;AG has acknowledged that some progress has already been made in the way that the MOD controls inventory and capital spares and welcomed the way in which the MOD has responded to previous recommendations. However, C&amp;AG also recognises that the MOD is only two years into a longer term programme to resolve the underlying issues and that benefits arising from approved new systems will only start to have an impact in 2014.</p>

	<p pid="a.1151W.2/1">After HMS Polar Circle was leased by the Ministry of Defence in November 1991 and prior to the ship's first deployment, modifications were made to the Ship's aviation, communications and hydrographic systems utilising equipment from the previous HMS Endurance where feasible. This included putting non-slip surfaces on the Ship's hangar deck, improved flight aids, improved aviation fuelling systems, encrypted satellite communication and a new echo sounder.</p>
	<p pid="a.1151W.2/2">In January 1992, the decision was made to purchase HMS Polar Circle and the ship was renamed as HMS Endurance in October 1992. At this stage, a further series of planned modifications were made to the vessel, including enlarging its hangar and the fitting of additional communication and hydrographic equipment. Until its flooding in 2008, all other maintenance or refit work conducted on HMS Endurance had been anticipated and was conducted as part of the ship's routine programme.</p>

The RFA continues to operate in the Gulf, in both the North and South Atlantic, as well as in UK waters in vital support of the UK national interests. In addition they continue to play a role in support of disaster relief operations, such as in February 2010 when RFA LARGS BAY was deployed to Haiti, delivering vital relief supplies and providing specialist capabilities to assist with the wider United Nations-led relief effort.</p>

If the circumstances of the incident merit it, a separate investigation will be conducted by ISAF. If necessary, the UK chain of command will report the incident to the service police for further national investigation. Service police can also independently launch an investigation in certain circumstances.</p>

These include the EU Emissions Trading System, which is a market-based approach based on the emissions associated with historical production, Climate Change Agreements, which offer reduced levels of tax in return for meeting energy efficiency targets related to product output, and the CRC Energy Efficiency Scheme, which uses a range of measures to drive behaviour change including robust reporting, a competitive league table and attaching a price to the carbon that businesses emit. In addition the Green Deal will enable businesses to carry out energy efficiency improvements to their buildings at no upfront cost, through a framework established by Government. This innovative financing mechanism will allow businesses to repay costs through a charge in instalments on their energy bill.</p>

	<p pid="a.1157W.3/1">We intend to launch a public consultation shortly on proposals for banded support under the renewables obligation for the period 2013-17. The Government will issue a formal response and lay draft legislation before Parliament as soon as possible after the consultation ends. Subject to parliamentary and state aids approval, the new bands will come into effect on <phrase class="date" code="2013-04-01">1 April 2013</phrase> as planned (<phrase class="date" code="2014-04-01">1 April 2014</phrase> for offshore wind).</p>

	<p pid="a.1158W.0/1">Onshore wind farms receive a subsidy of one renewable energy certificate (ROC) per MWh of electricity generated.</p>
	<p pid="a.1158W.0/2">According to the figures published in Ofgem's most recent RO annual report:</p>
	<p pid="a.1158W.0/3"><a href="http://www.ofgem.gov.uk/Sustainability/Environment/RenewablObl/Documents1/RO%20Annual%20Report%202009-10.pdf">http://www.ofgem.gov.uk/Sustainability/Environment/RenewablObl/Documents1/RO%20Annual%20Report%202009-10.pdf</a></p>
	<p pid="a.1158W.0/4">the subsidy awarded to onshore wind power under the RO in 2009-10 was approximately &#163;380 million. This figure uses the nominal value (equal to the buyout price + recycle value) of a renewable obligation certificate (ROC) for 2009-10. The nominal value represents the maximum worth of a ROC to a generator but is not necessarily the amount paid by a supplier, which is dependent on bilateral negotiations between supplier and generator</p>
