But we also support the work of non-governmental organisations, trade unions and business, for example through the Ethical Trading Initiative.</p>

	<p pid="c.470W.8/1">The international community is providing support to the Iraqi Government to help rebuild Iraq and improve the quality of life for its people. At the Madrid Conference in October 2003, 37 bilateral donors, the European Community, the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) pledged a total of US$32 billion for Iraq's reconstruction. Since 2003, the amount pledged for Iraq's reconstruction has risen to over $40 billion. As of October 2005, over US$14 billion of these pledges has been spent.</p>
	<p pid="c.470W.8/2">The UK pledged &pound;544 million for humanitarian and reconstruction work in Iraq, of which more than &pound;350 million has been spent to date. DFID's programme of assistance this year, focuses on macro-economic reform, strengthening Iraqi institutions at the centre of government and in the south, improving power and water supplies in the south, strengthening Iraqi civil society and encouraging broad participation in the political process. Reconstruction activities in Iraq are also funded by the Ministry of Defence (MOD), the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO), and the Global Conflict Prevention Pool for Iraq (jointly funded by MOD, FCO, and DFID).</p>

	<p pid="c.470W.8/20">The Iraqi Government are leading on the reconstruction and development of Iraq and have presented a National Development Strategy outlining its reconstruction priorities. The Iraqi Government co-ordinates their own and international reconstruction funding by means of Sector Working groups that meet regularly in Baghdad, chaired by Iraqi Ministries with support from the United Nations, the World Bank and a range of donors. Iraq has huge potential, and increasingly, oil sales, tax revenues and foreign investment will be able to finance reconstruction costs, so that Iraq will rely less on external donors.</p>
	<p pid="c.470W.8/21">In spite of the obvious challenges, reconstruction is continuing and progress has been made. For example, there has been continued economic growth, power generation is higher than before the conflict, more Iraqis now have access to drinking water and sewerage systems, thousands of healthcare and education facilities have been rehabilitated, transport and telecommunications systems are improving and civil society groups and the media are flourishing and finding ways of engaging in the political process.</p>

	<p pid="c.474W.2/1">The primary responsibility for the protection of vulnerable people lies with their Government. This was endorsed at the 2005 Millennium Review Summit, to which the Government of Sudan was party. The UK Government continues to press the Government of Sudan on its responsibilities in Darfur, and we press all parties to abide by their commitments they have made. We have done this both directly to the Government of Sudan, and in our role as EU presidency. The UK also played a leading role in securing six recent UN Security Council Resolutions on Sudan, including resolutions 1591 and 1593, which extended the Darfur arms embargo to cover the Government of Sudan, allowed targeted sanctions on individuals responsible for the worst abuses, and referred the situation in Darfur to the International Criminal Court.</p>
	<p pid="c.474W.2/2">The African Union (AU) mission in Darfur is also playing an important role in protecting the people of Darfur. Despite the recent worrying upsurge in violence in Darfur, including the attack on the Aro Sharow camp on <phrase class="date" code="2005-09-28">28 September</phrase>, attacks on civilians have decreased where the AU is deployed. DFID welcomes the ongoing expansion of the force to more than 7,700. The UK has provided &pound;32 million to support the AU mission since its inception. The EU has provided &euro;92 million (&pound;63 million) so far, and has recently committed a further &euro;70 million (&pound;48 million).</p>
	<p pid="c.474W.2/3">The humanitarian community also supports the protection of civilians. This year the UK channelled &pound;45 million through the UN Humanitarian Co-ordinator in Khartoum for humanitarian operations across Sudan, &pound;2.4 million of this was allocated for UN and non-governmental protection work in Darfur, such as advocacy on child protection, victim counselling, work on sexual and gender-based violence, and the monitoring of agreements preventing force returns.</p>

	<p pid="c.475W.6/1">DFID has spent approximately &pound;120 million in Zimbabwe since September 2001. Almost all of this relates to humanitarian assistance, tackling HIV/AIDS and emergency support to the health sector.</p>
	<p pid="c.475W.6/2">Approximately &pound;65 million has been spent in response to the crisis of food insecurity, resulting from a combination of poor Government policies, adverse weather and the HIV/AIDS crisis. DFID has recently pledged a further &pound;10 million to the UN World Food Programme's operations in Zimbabwe. DFID has been one of the major donors supporting the annual humanitarian appeals made through the United Nations. We also provide substantial resources through direct funding of non-governmental organisations (NGOs). Activities which DFID has supported include monthly food distributions to food insecure families, food for families affected by AIDS through home based care programmes, school feeding programmes and supplementary clinic feeding for underweight children.</p>
	<p pid="c.475W.6/3">To date, some &pound;25 million has been spent on health programmes, predominantly for HIV prevention and care. Other health-related support includes basic vaccinations for children, emergency obstetrics care for women, provision of water treatment chemicals, emergency response to cholera outbreaks, provision of commodities to the National Blood Transfusion Service and provision of insecticide-treated bed nets for the prevention of malaria.</p>
	<p pid="c.475W.6/4">Some &pound;20 million has been allocated to agricultural support to small-scale farmers in communal areas, aimed at increasing productivity and food security at the household level. Other smaller humanitarian programmes include support for displaced people, including those made homeless and destitute by the Government of Zimbabwe's recent slum clearances, and those in danger of HIV/AIDS, exploitation and abuse through irregular migration.</p>

	<p pid="c.476W.3/1">The overall number of abattoirs has declined dramatically in Britain in the last few decades, reflecting an increase in slaughtering capacity in fewer and larger abattoirs. Much of this has been due to logistic requirements of the major supermarket chains. Regulatory impacts of measures to improve food safety have also played a part. Some businesses, particularly in older premises, may be faced with investment costs if they are to continue to comply with EU-wide standards for hygienic production.</p>
	<p pid="c.476W.3/2">The Government are nevertheless keen that an appropriate network of abattoirs and cutting plants continue to support sustainable livestock production in Britain. To this end we are encouraging our Regional partners (Government Offices, Regional Development Agencies, Rural Development Service) to develop Regional Red Meat Strategies which recognise the importance of an appropriate red meat infrastructure (abattoirs, cutting plants and marketing).</p>

	<p pid="c.478W.9/1">There is little hard evidence on the volume of illegal trade as by its nature only an uncertain proportion is detected. We do not have EU figures for seizures of illegally imported birds.</p>
	<p pid="c.478W.9/2">Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs (HMRC) seize imported live birds where import is in contravention of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Flora and Fauna (CITES).

	<p pid="c.480W.8/1">Since its establishment in 2001 Defra has put in place a comprehensive programme of action on issues including sustainable development, climate change and energy, sustainable consumption and production, natural resource protection, sustainable rural communities, and a sustainable farming and food sector. A summary of some our achievements to date can be found on the Defra website (<a href="http://www.defra.gov.uk">www.defra.gov.uk</a>) I am confident that the Gateshead, East and Washington, West constituency will have benefited from these.</p>
	<p pid="c.480W.8/2">For example, we are committed, through our national strategy for waste, to achieving a massive shift in sustainable waste management, including tough national targets to recycle or compost 25 per cent. of household waste in 2005&ndash;06. To help contribute towards this target, each local authority in England was set a statutory recycling target for household waste in 2003&ndash;04 and 2005&ndash;06. In 2002&ndash;03, the recycling rate for Gateshead and Sunderland was just 5 per cent. and 2 per cent. respectively. They are now both expected to reach or exceed their statutory targets set for them of 18 per cent. by the end of 2005&ndash;06. In total over the past three years, Defra has given Gateshead over &pound;2.5 million and Sunderland over &pound;2 million for waste management and recycling. Many north-east councils have recently made significant progress on recycling from historically low levels, through the support of Defra's Waste Implementation Programme and Waste and Resources Action Programme. Defra's Municipal Waste Management Survey 2003&ndash;04 records that the north-east region quadrupled the amount of household waste recycled from 3.8 per cent. in 1996&ndash;97 to 12.3 per cent. in 2003&ndash;04.</p>
	<p pid="c.480W.8/3">Through English Nature, we have provided &pound;76,000 to Gateshead council for a 'Wildspace' project, including a community liaison officer, which has resulted in five new local nature reserves (LNRs) being designated in the east of the borough, and the project has involved local people in caring for and enjoying the sites. Regular litter removal and maintenance of entrances and paths has ensured they appear well managed and welcoming. Along with management plans for the sites, this is maximising biodiversity, and there is a strategy to secure long term gains for local people. Due to the success of the project, Gateshead council have continued to employ the officer to carry on the good work.</p>
	<p pid="c.480W.8/4">We also provide grants through our agencies to voluntary groups such as the Friends of Princess Anne Park in Washington and have provided funding for a wildlife survey to identify potential for enhancing wildlife and creating habitats. This has drawn in additional funding from Sunderland city council for a park ranger. The park runs along the Oxclose and Biddick Burns, and Environment Agency field teams are carrying out targeted pollution prevention work with relevant local businesses, advising them on managing environmental risk, so improving water quality and associated habitats to prevent pollution through run off.</p>
	<p pid="c.480W.8/5">In my hon. Friend's constituency, forestry grants to the Woodland Trust, the local councils and a private company have created around 10 hectares of new woodland, including screening for Springwell Quarry. Altogether over &pound;16,000 has come through the Forestry Commission for woodland maintenance and improved public access.</p>
	<p pid="c.480W.8/6">We have invested &pound;10,000 in Durham Wildlife Trust, whose area includes Gateshead and Washington. The trust use this Environment Agency money to employ a community wildlife officer to work directly with communities in Washington, encouraging residents to prevent pollution in household drains and to recycle more, and speaking to schools and community groups around pollution hot spots. The aim is to reduce or prevent fly tipping and other contamination in watercourses, and enable other habitat improvements.</p>

	<p pid="c.482W.5/1">Support and encouragement for collaboration and co-operation among farmers is one of the elements of the Government's Strategy for Sustainable Farming and Food. As part of the Strategy we actively supported the establishment of English Farming and Food Partnerships (EFFP) which was set up to promote and encourage co-operation and collaboration between farmers and between farmers and the rest of the food chain, We have also undertaken to provide EFFP with funding of &pound;0.5 million per annum for five years from 2004&ndash;05.</p>

A number of other projects concerned with collaborative activity have also been awarded grant.</p>

This assistance will include a licensing system designed to identify products and license them for export to the EU. It will be reinforced by powers for Customs to take a range of actions relating to unlicensed products from partner countries.

	<p pid="c.489W.8/1">Cross-compliance conditions involve two main elements: specific requirements in relation to 19 EU directives and regulations that apply in all member states, with many of these having been law for a number of years; and keeping agricultural land in Good Agricultural and Environmental Condition (GAEC) as defined at member state, or as the case may be, regional level within an EU framework. Given the requirement in the EC regulations to define GAEC to reflect the specific character of the areas concerned including the condition of the land, environmental conditions and agricultural activity, it is to be expected that a variety of standards will have been set within the EU. Whether those standards fulfil member states' EU regulatory obligations will be considered by the European Commission, which has already begun a programme of audits covering cross-compliance. In the meantime, DEFRA officials continue to liaise closely with the European Commission and other member states, both to ensure a common understanding of the EU regulatory obligations and to share practical experience of implementation.</p>

	<p pid="c.498W.9/1">European Council Directive 69/169/EEC sets a tax and duty free allowance for all travellers bringing goods for personal use (excluding wine, spirits, tobacco and perfume) from outside the EU into the UK. This allowance applies equally to visitors to the United Kingdom and to British citizens.</p>
	<p pid="c.498W.9/2">When the directive was first agreed in 1969, the allowance was set at 45 Euros (&pound;36). In 1994 it was increased to 175 Euros (&pound;136), and the UK conversion was revalorised from &pound;136 to &pound;145 in 1995 to reflect exchange rate fluctuations. Since then the allowance has not been revised.</p>
	<p pid="c.498W.9/3">In order to change the tax and duty free allowance, the European Commission would have to make a proposal and unanimous agreement among member states would have to be reached. The Chancellor of the Exchequer wrote to the Commission at Budget 2005 proposing that the allowance be increased to &pound;1,000. The Commission has expressed support in principle for the Government's proposal that the allowance should be raised, and it is hoped they will soon come forward with draft legislation to increase the allowance and thereby reduce unnecessary restrictions on travellers bringing goods into the EU for their own use.</p>
	<p pid="c.498W.9/4">Separate quantitative limits apply for wine, spirits, tobacco and perfume. These have not been revised since the directive was first agreed and are listed as follows:</p>
	<p pid="c.498W.9/5" class="italic">Quantitative limits for exemptions from tax and duty for travellers bringing goods for personal use from outside the EU into the UK:</p>
	<p pid="c.498W.9/6" class="indent">200 cigarettes; or 100 cigarillos; or 50 cigars; or 250g of tobacco</p>

	<p pid="c.507W.11/1">Fully electric vehicles are exempt from vehicle excise duty (VED). New electric hybrid vehicles (i.e. those that are powered by a combination of electricity and another fuel) registered since March 2001 enjoy a VED discount over conventionally fuelled vehicles.</p>
	<p pid="c.507W.11/2">The company car tax system includes an incentive to encourage take up of low and zero emission technology. Cars that are capable of running solely on electricity and other alternative fuels benefit from a discount from the equivalent petrol company car tax percentage charge.</p>
	<p pid="c.507W.11/3">Electric vehicles also enjoy a number of other local benefits, including free parking in some areas and an exemption from the central London congestion charge.</p>
	<p pid="c.507W.11/4">All current and proposed grant programmes to encourage the take up of low emission vehicles are technology neutral. The eligibility criteria for the programmes focus on reducing emissions, irrespective of the technology used. Applications for electric cars and technology will be assessed against technology-neutral criteria and considered equally alongside other technologies.</p>

	<p pid="c.511W.2/1">International obligations do not allow us to require, unilaterally, levels of equipment that exceed the requirements of agreed international standards. However, we have agreed, with European partners, a directive that will require large goods vehicles to be fitted with additional mirrors that provide a wider angle of vision along both sides of the vehicle and also a better downward view of the traffic adjacent to the side of the vehicle. This directive will apply to newly registered vehicles within the European Community and will start to take effect from January 2007.</p>

We will continue to be prepared to support trams, where they are the right solution but we will not do so at any cost, and in many cases a well designed and promoted bus based system is likely to provide a more cost effective solution.</p>
	<p pid="c.511W.5/2">Where trams are promoted, they will need to be developed as part of an integrated approach to tackling an area's problems, and they will need to be supported by commitments to complementary measures to deliver the benefits of increased public transport usage and reduced congestion. We will continue to work closely with promoters and the industry to seek to ensure that these benefits can be realised, and that the costs of tram systems are minimised and properly controlled.</p>

	<p pid="c.514W.6/1">Not at present. Locally, from time to time and for particular kinds of traffic, demand might exceed existing port capacity. In the short to medium-term the port sector will adjust contracts and prices to balance supply with demand. In the longer term, current and proposed investments in new facilities&mdash;for example, new dry bulk quays at Immingham and new container cranes at Tilbury&mdash;are an indication of the commodity sectors where the ports industry expects demand to grow in excess of current capacity.</p>
	<p pid="c.514W.6/2">Consultants working for the Department, MDS Transmodal, are currently developing demand forecasts to support the forthcoming ports policy review.</p>

	<p pid="c.515W.3/1">We are working with the bus industry and local authorities to ensure that all communities have the effective bus services they need. The Bus Partnership Forum brings together senior representatives of the industry, central and local government to find practical ways of improving local bus services. The forum has, for example, published guidance on improving the punctuality of bus services and has encouraged bus operators and local authorities to form local punctuality improvement partnerships to help bring about improvements in performance.</p>
	<p pid="c.515W.3/2">Local and central Government provides funding of over &pound;1.6 billion annually to support bus services. This includes &pound;53 million this year provided by the Department in the form of Rural Bus Subsidy Grant to assist local authorities to support bus services in rural areas. Since 1998 we have also allocated a total of &pound;110 million to 300 rural transport projects under the Rural Bus Challenge scheme.</p>
	<p pid="c.515W.3/3">On <phrase class="date" code="2005-11-01">1 November</phrase> we announced Kickstart&quot; support, totalling &pound;20 million, for 43 projects involving new and improved bus services which will become viable through growth in passenger numbers after an initial period of pump-priming from Government funds. 11 of these schemes will serve areas which are mainly rural in character.</p>
	<p pid="c.515W.3/4">Finally, we are expecting all local transport authorities to include accessibility strategies in their next Local Transport Plans, due in March next year. These strategies should be based on evidence and analysis of the problems people face in accessing jobs and essential services and facilities. They should include consideration of the accessibility and availability of local public transport. Our guidance to authorities makes clear that the strategies should take account of the particular needs of rural communities.</p>

	<p pid="c.515W.6/1">This Government has invested in long term public transport improvements in Leeds and West Yorkshire as a whole. Funding provided to local authorities for local highways and public transport capital projects in West Yorkshire has increased by 46 per cent. in real terms over the last five years, from &pound;34 million in 2000&ndash;01 to &pound;54 million in 2005&ndash;06.</p>

	<p pid="c.515W.6/3">With regard to rail, 16 new four-coach Class 333 electric trains have been introduced on the Airedale and Wharfedale lines, which have seen a significant increase in patronage. This success story has helped rail patronage in West Yorkshire to rise from 16.3 million passengers in 1999&ndash;2000 to 21.1 million in 2004&ndash;05, an increase of 30 per cent. The new TransPennine franchise began in February 2004. It will deliver more than &pound;250 million worth of investment, with a brand new fleet of 50 trains due to be introduced in 2006. Also benefiting Leeds and West Yorkshire is a 44 per cent. increase in East Coast main line services since 1996&mdash;currently 53 services per day, rising to 66 services per day in December 2007.</p>

	<p pid="c.518W.6/1">The Department has not undertaken such an assessment. Local planning authorities are responsible for the control of outdoor advertisements. They are required by the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 to consider public safety before giving consent to display an advertisement. Advice to them is to consider the effect of the advertisement on the safe use and operation of any form of traffic when considering an application for consent to display any advertising billboards at road junctions.</p>

	<p pid="c.521W.2/1">The Secretary of State for Transport plans and funds through his Department and its agencies a variety of capital and revenue projects. He also funds projects which are planned by others, particularly local authorities, through the Local Transport Plan (LTP) process and Revenue Support Grant allocations.</p>
	<p pid="c.521W.2/2">The LTP system provides capital funding to local authorities to cover expenditure on major schemes (those costing more than &pound;5 million) and minor improvement works and maintenance by way of block allocations.</p>
	<p pid="c.521W.2/3">In terms of the block allocations, the guideline figures for the five years from 2006&ndash;07 are in the order of:</p>
	<p pid="c.521W.2/4" class="italic">(a) The Houghton and Washington East Constituency</p>
	<p pid="c.521W.2/5" class="indent">&pound;25 million <sup>1</sup> for Sunderland city council. It is not possible to provide this information for the constituency.</p>

	<p pid="c.521W.2/9" class="indent">&pound;410 million <sup>1</sup> .</p>
	<p pid="c.521W.2/10" class="indent"><sup>1</sup> Exact figures are confirmed annually and relate to the assessments of progress in delivering the LTPs.</p>
	<p pid="c.521W.2/11">In terms of Local Authority and Highways Agency capital transport infrastructure improvement projects costing more than &pound;5 million, it should be noted that, in July 2005, regions were provided with indicative annual capital allocations to 2015&ndash;16 for transport (excluding rail funding) in order that they could prioritise schemes and provide advice to the Secretary of State in January 2006. Highways Agency trunk road projects in the North East included in this process are all bar those on the A1 in the region to its junction with the A19 from the south.</p>
	<p pid="c.521W.2/12">There are a number of major schemes in the region which have recently been completed or are currently under construction:</p>

	<p pid="c.521W.2/20">There are currently two major schemes in the region which are planned to commence construction in early 2006:</p>

	<p pid="c.521W.2/22" class="indent">Pegswood Bypass, Northumberland</p>
	<p pid="c.521W.2/23">In addition, the Department is involved with its regional partners in the planning or funding of the following major projects.

	<p pid="c.529W.0/1">The Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) has, since 1997, introduced a range of policies which:</p>
	<p pid="c.529W.0/2" class="indent">Foster science and innovation,</p>
	<p pid="c.529W.0/3" class="indent">Champion business in Government, Europe and across the world,</p>
	<p pid="c.529W.0/4" class="indent">Raise UK productivity and promote high performance workplaces,</p>
	<p pid="c.529W.0/5" class="indent">Build flexible labour markets,</p>
	<p pid="c.529W.0/6" class="indent">Ensure that citizens' and employees rights are protected,</p>
	<p pid="c.529W.0/7" class="indent">Increase consumer choice by opening up markets to fair competition,</p>
	<p pid="c.529W.0/8" class="indent">Ensure that all our regions and nations contribute fully to the UK's economic performance,</p>
	<p pid="c.529W.0/9" class="indent">Deliver, and plan for the future delivery of, secure and sustainable energy.</p>
	<p pid="c.529W.0/10">Since 1997 the Department has applied policies which have resulted in there being some 300,000 more businesses than in 1997. We have made life easier for business by cutting corporation tax, simplifying VAT registration and setting the highest VAT threshold in Europe. We have simplified company law and introduced reforms removing the preferential creditor status of the Crown, freeing up &pound;70 million more each year for business. The Company Law Reform Bill will generate deregulatory benefits of some &pound;250 million a year (including &pound;100 million for small companies), and we are pursuing a &pound;1 billion deregulatory target over the lifetime of our five year programme.</p>
	<p pid="c.529W.0/11">In 2001 we undertook a review of our direct business support measures and subsequently introduced a range of streamlined and simplified products, which include grants and loans for capital investment and research and development, knowledge transfer, and support for the implementation of best practice. The annual business support measures budget is some &pound;400 million, and many of the DTI services have been delivered through strong and effective regional development agencies since their creation in 1999.</p>
	<p pid="c.529W.0/12">Recognising the importance of manufacturing to the UK economy, the DTI launched its Manufacturing Strategy in 2002. The strategy sets out the actions needed to create a high value, high skill manufacturing sector capable of introducing new products and processes into our economy, creating new markets, and delivering a huge boost to our prosperity. The Manufacturing Advisory Service, which provides expert advice to manufacturers, has to date generated over &pound;155 million of added value for UK firms.</p>
	<p pid="c.529W.0/13">The DTI is working to significantly strengthen the links between higher education and industry, and will continue to build on the UK's outstanding science base. Between 1997 and 2007, the science budget will have more than doubled, rising to &pound;3.3 billion.</p>
	<p pid="c.529W.0/14">The Department seeks to work closely with all our stakeholders. We have introduced independent members to the DTI board, enabling us to function better with input from business people, trade unionists, academics and others.</p>
	<p pid="c.529W.0/15">Although the policies and initiatives mentioned above have benefited individuals, businesses and communities in every part of the United Kingdom, it is not possible to quantify precisely all of the benefits accruing directly to individual constituencies.</p>

Much of this can be done through the electricity generating industry switching to coal or other fuels. In a competitive market such as that in the UK we would expect this to take place on a commercial basis in response to price signals indicating tightness in the gas market.</p>

	<p pid="c.531W.0/1">Since the implementation of the Utilities Act 2000 licensing schemes and standard licence conditions in October 2001, Ofgem has had the power to appoint a Supplier of Last Resort (SoLR) for all customers, domestic and non-domestic, in both the gas and electricity markets. This power is essential to ensure that all of a failed supplier's customers have continuity of supply.</p>
	<p pid="c.531W.0/2">Under the current licence conditions Ofgem can require any licensed gas supplier to become a SoLR and take the responsibility for supplying gas to customers of another supplier whose licence has been revoked. For customers whose annual consumption is reasonably expected to be less than 73,200 kWh the authority can direct a supplier to be a SoLR. For customers whose annual consumption is reasonably expected to be between 73,200 kWh and 2,196,000 kWh the authority can only direct a supplier to be a SoLR with that supplier's consent. There is no provision for appointing a SoLR (by consent or otherwise) for customers whose annual consumption is reasonably expected to be more than 2,196,000 kWh.</p>
	<p pid="c.531W.0/3">Once appointed, a SoLR will initially be supplying the customer on a deemed contract. This deemed contract will cover the period from appointment until customers have agreed a replacement contract with the SoLR or another supplier of their choice. There are licence obligations to ensure that the prices charged under a deemed contract are not excessive. A SoLR's deemed contract must also allow for its termination when the customer chooses to take a supply from another supplier.</p>

From 2003, the survey is being carried out on a continuous rolling basis. Prior to 2001, however, this survey was conducted on a five-yearly basis. Hence, the number of households in fuel poverty is not available for all of the last five years. The figures for 2001 and 2003 are available, with an estimate being available for 2002.

	<p pid="c.533W.0/2">I understand that Powergen's recent errors in billing some of its customers arose from its introduction of a single billing system across its operations. The migration of former customers of TXU Energi, which has now been completed, was the cause of particular difficulties affecting customers in Eastern England. Energywatch, which is responsible for investigating complaints against gas and electricity suppliers, is currently exploring with Powergen both any further action required to address billing errors and the company's proposals for dealing with customers who have been distressed or inconvenienced by those errors.</p>

These sources include intergovernmental organisations, governmental sources and human rights organisations. Full account is taken of the ability of the individual concerned to safely reside in other parts of Somalia. caseworkers have access to the Somalia Country report produced by the Immigration and Nationality Directorate's (IND) Country of Origin Information Service as well as the Somalia Operational Guidance Note which assesses the most common types of asylum claims received and the circumstances in which they are likely to prove well founded or unfounded.

Families with children represent only a small fraction of the total on section 4 support. Failed asylum seekers who have children in their household generally retain access to regular NASS support provided under section 95 of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999 and have no need to seek section 4 support. Access to section 95 support is only usually lost if they fail to comply with removal directions or fail to take steps to leave the United Kingdom voluntarily and therefore fall to be considered under the provisions of section 9 of the Asylum and Immigration (Treatment of Claimants, etc) Act 2004.</p>

This does not prevent failed asylum seekers being sectioned under Mental Health legislation or receiving after-sectioning care. Failed asylum seekers who have been discharged from compulsory detention under the Mental Health Act 1983 are entitled to receive continuing residential support in the community. Failed asylum seekers with mental health problems, identified as in need of care and attention as a result of being destitute, may be supported by the local authority under the National Assistance Act 1948.</p>

This initiative is part of the commitment made by Action Areas to raise levels of action and to make services more accessible to the public.

Nearly three in five (57 per cent.) said they were satisfied with this new service.</p>

	<p pid="c.543W.6/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="c.543W.6/2">In March 2000, the Government launched the road safety strategy, Tomorrow's roads&mdash;safer for everyone&quot;, establishing new long-term 10 year casualty reduction targets to be achieved by the end of 2010. These are:</p>
	<p pid="c.543W.6/3" class="indent">a 40 per cent. reduction in the number of people killed or seriously injured (KSI)</p>
	<p pid="c.543W.6/4" class="indent">a 50 per cent. reduction in the number of child (under 16) KSIs</p>
	<p pid="c.543W.6/5" class="indent">a 10 per cent. reduction in the rate of slight casualties, expressed as the number of people slightly injured per 100 million vehicle kilometres</p>
	<p pid="c.543W.6/6">(compared with the average for 1994&ndash;98).</p>
	<p pid="c.543W.6/7">The Department for Transport has a road safety public service agreement (PSA) target to reduce the number of people killed or seriously injured and children killed or seriously injured as outlined above. In 2002 the PSA target was strengthened to include a commitment to</p>
	<p pid="c.543W.6/8" class="indent">tackling the higher incidence of casualties among disadvantaged communities&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="c.543W.6/9">The first review of the road safety strategy was published in April 2004 and concluded that good progress was being made. It highlighted issues of particular concern, such as the levelling out of road deaths and the potential under reporting of slight casualties. The Department for Transport has commissioned research to investigate both of these issues. The second review of the strategy will commence in spring 2006.</p>
	<p pid="c.543W.6/10">A comprehensive Road Safety Bill is currently progressing through the House of Lords, to give effect to several elements of the road safety strategy and support the casualty reduction targets.</p>
	<p pid="c.543W.6/11">There is continued good progress towards our targets. Full 2004 data (published <phrase class="date" code="2005-09-29">29 September 2005</phrase>) show KSI casualties 28 per cent. down on the 1994&ndash;98 baseline, and child KSIs down 43 per cent. 2004 saw the biggest annual drop (8 per cent.) in both deaths and serious injuries since the road safety strategy was launched. Provisional data for Q2 2005 show a continuing decline in KSIs, down 33 per cent. on baseline.</p>

Moreover, it is thought that for some police force areas, the reporting of court proceedings, in particular those relating to motoring offences and to TV licence evasion may also be less than complete; the extent of under-reporting may vary from year to year and this could be responsible in part for the annual variations.</p>

	<p pid="c.547W.2/4" class="indent">The reduction in referrals reflects lower numbers of customers on Jobseeker's Allowance (down 11.3% since April 2001) and the increased focus on programmes for our most disadvantaged customers.</p>

The high frequency radio works in the 1.8&ndash;30 MHz frequency band; its maximum bandwidth is 9.6 kbps, and depends on the quality of the communications link. The high-capacity data radio works in the 225&ndash;400 MHz frequency band; its data bandwidth is up to 500 kbps, but it automatically adapts this to suit the quality of the communications link and the distances between radios. Voice and data communications within vehicles, and between vehicles grouped in headquarters, is provided by using standard 10/100 mbps Ethernet interfaces.</p>

	<p pid="c.561W.0/1">Reverse auctions are considered as a routine competitive procurement process by the Ministry of Defence and internal departments, such as Integrated Project Teams, are encouraged to utilise them wherever they are appropriate.

	<p pid="c.561W.0/2">Reverse auctions are normally appropriate where there is an effective field of competition and a robust specification.

	<p pid="c.563W.10/1">The Government's National School Sport Strategy aims to increase participation in physical education and sport in schools, which includes athletics.

	<p pid="c.564W.2/1">The Department's aim is to improve the quality of life for everyone through cultural and sporting activities, to support the pursuit of excellence and to champion the tourism, creative and leisure industries. The Department's policies and actions have had a significant impact on Houghton and Washington, East since <phrase class="date" code="1997-05-02">2 May 1997</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="c.564W.2/2">In 2002 we launched the first ever comprehensive national physical education, school sport and club links strategy with an investment of &pound;459 million. A further &pound;519 million was announced by the Prime Minister for the strategy in December 2004. In addition, the Government have provided funding for 3,000 Community Sports Coaches to be in place across England and Wales by the end of 2006. As a result of this investment the following initiatives have been implemented in Houghton and Washington, East.</p>
	<p pid="c.564W.2/3">There are two School Sports Partnerships in Houghton and Washington, East&mdash;Biddick and Houghton Kepier. The 2004&ndash;05 school sport survey showed that 78 per cent. of pupils in Biddick and 76 per cent. of pupils from Houghton Kepier received two hours of high quality PE and out of hours school sport during the academic year. In addition, 14 per cent. of pupils from Biddick and 7 per cent. from Houghton Kepier have been actively involved in sports volunteering in the same period and 27 per cent. from Houghton Kepier and 17 per cent. from Biddick have participated in community sports activities through school club links.</p>
	<p pid="c.564W.2/4">Through the Community Sports Coach scheme a full time health and fitness coach will start at the beginning of December to deliver after school sessions to partnerships with Sunderland (including Biddick and Houghton Kepier) and five part time multi skill coaches are currently being recruited to start in the new year to assist with the development of basic Moves clubs and academies. Biddick partnership currently has access to three part time Community Sports Coaches and Houghton partnership to one.</p>
	<p pid="c.564W.2/5">The Government's investment in the Biddick School Sport Partnership has resulted in the partnership piloting the multi skill club programme (a multi skill club was implemented in every primary school). The success of this pilot has enabled multi skill clubs to be rolled out across the country and the aim is to provide 1,600 clubs by 2008. Multi skill clubs provide children with the opportunity to develop basic physical skills in order to lead to sporting success.</p>
	<p pid="c.564W.2/6">To achieve our challenging targets for increased participation in sport and physical activity, we have invested in over 4,000 new and refurbished public sports facilities. Sports facilities in the Gateshead and Sunderland area have benefited from 42 awards from Sport England and the Big Lottery Fund to the total of &pound;19.7 million.</p>
	<p pid="c.564W.2/7">We have increased our national funding to the arts in real terms by 60 per cent. from &pound;199 million in 1998&ndash;99 to &pound;367 million in 2004&ndash;05. Between 1998&ndash;99 and 2005&ndash;06 funding to Arts Council England, North East increased from &pound;5.7 million to &pound;14.4 million. In 2005&ndash;06 the total Arts Council England investment in the North East, including grant in aid and lottery expenditure, will be &pound;17.7 million. Houghton and Washington, East has benefited from grants to arts projects, organisations and individuals in the area, ranging from the BALTIC Centre for Contemporary Art to the Gatehead NHS Trust which received &pound;30,000 for public art commissions for the new NHS treatment centre in Gateshead.</p>
	<p pid="c.564W.2/8">Houghton and Washington, East is part of the Durham and Sunderland Creative Partnership area, which was set up in phase 1 of the programme in 2002. Creative Partnerships aims to give school children and their teachers the opportunity to explore their creativity by working on sustained projects with creative organisations and individuals, including artists, theatre companies, dance studios, museums, orchestras, film-makers and historic buildings. Funding of &pound;65 million was allocated for the period 2002&ndash;05 to develop Creative Partnerships, and the programme will receive at least a further &pound;86 million in 2005&ndash;08.</p>
	<p pid="c.564W.2/9">Culture Online was launched in 2002 to increase access to, and participation in, arts and culture. Many of its projects are aimed at children of school age and at audiences that might not otherwise participate in arts and culture, including those who do not easily have access to arts and culture, people from deprived communities and people with particular educational or physical needs. People in Houghton and Washington, East will be among those who benefit from Culture Online. Between 2002 and 2004, &pound;13 million was allocated to fund 20 Culture Online projects.</p>
	<p pid="c.564W.2/10">In 2002 the Department, working through the Museums, Libraries and Archives Council, began investing in regional museums for the first time with the Renaissance funding programme. Since 2003, the North East Regional Museums Hub, led by Tyne and Wear Museums, working in partnership with the North East Museums, Libraries and Archives Council (NEMLAC) has invested &pound;4.7 million in museums in the North East. As a result, 88 per cent. of schools in Gateshead LEA, and 68 per cent. in Sunderland LEA have participated in museum based learning at Tyne and Wear Museums. And since April 2005, museum hub outreach officers in Gateshead and Sunderland have worked with 2,073 people.</p>
	<p pid="c.564W.2/11">Through our commitment to public service broadcasting we have helped to foster an environment in which a creative, commercially successful broadcasting industry provides a wide range of UK-made, high quality original programmes catering for all viewers and listeners. We have ensured a secure funding base for the BBC and Channel 4, while giving them the freedom to develop commercial operations which complement and support their public service remit. The Communications Act 2003 includes provisions to ensure that public service broadcasting will continue to have a key role to play in the digital future.</p>
	<p pid="c.564W.2/12">In November 2000 we introduced free television licences for people aged 75 or over. Information on the number of beneficiaries by constituency is not available. However, according to Department for Work and Pensions records, the number of households in Houghton and Washington, East with at least one person aged 75 or over claiming the winter fuel payment in 2004&ndash;05 was 4,490.</p>
	<p pid="c.564W.2/13">We have changed the licensing laws to allow people to hold and attend commercial dances on Sunday, to make it easier for restaurants to open an hour later, and to relax the alcohol licensing hours from 11 pm on new year's eve to 11 am on new year's day in all future years; and we have given the police greater powers to take action against under-age drinking and disorderly and noisy licensed premises. The Licensing Act 2003, when fully implemented, will introduce a streamlined, consistent and fair licensing regime for the provision of alcohol, public entertainment and late night refreshment. It will provide greater choice for consumers, bring regeneration and increased employment opportunities and protect local residents whose lives have been blighted by disturbance and antisocial behaviour.</p>
	<p pid="c.564W.2/14">The Gambling Act 2005 will, when implemented, transfer responsibility for licensing gambling premises to local authorities. Local people and businesses will be able to make representations about applications for licences and local authorities will be able to decide not to issue licences for casino premises. These changes will give local communities, including those in Houghton and Washington, East, a greater say in the regulation of gambling in their area.</p>
	<p pid="c.564W.2/15">Tourism in Houghton and Washington, East has benefited from Government-funded marketing activity. In April 2003 we established VisitBritain with a new domestic marketing remit for England, and we gave strategic responsibility for tourism development to the regional development agencies, including One North East. These changes, together with VisitBritain's successful marketing activities in promoting Britain abroad as an attractive tourist destination, benefit all parts of the country, including Houghton and Washington, East.</p>
	<p pid="c.564W.2/16">In common with all those in the United Kingdom, the public library branches in Houghton are connected to the internet through the People's Network which was funded through a &pound;120 million lottery grant and which has put all the United Kingdom's public libraries on-line. In addition, the Department is funding the Museums, Libraries and Archives Council with &pound;5 million over three years to implement the Framework for the Future Action Plan and Library Improvement Programme, which is designed to encourage improvement across the public libraries sector in England.</p>
	<p pid="c.564W.2/17">Information from the national lottery distributors indicates that since <phrase class="date" code="1997-05-02">2 May 1997</phrase> Houghton and Washington, East has benefited from over 230 awards totalling over &pound;9.8 million. Of these, 27 awards worth over &pound;5.2 million were made by the New Opportunities Fund which was established by the Government in 1999. The New Opportunities Fund merged with the Community Fund in June 2004 to form the Big Lottery Fund.</p>

	<p pid="c.567W.2/1">Apart from the National Museums and Galleries, The Department for Culture, Media and Sport does not allocate funding directly to any of our sectors. Instead money allocated to us by Parliament is channelled through our various non-departmental public bodies who are responsible for deciding how and where it is spent. For instance Arts Council England, East has allocated &pound;184,339 to the Old Town Hall in Hemel Hempstead over the last eight years. Similarly between 1995 and 1999 English Heritage allocated &pound;92,108 to the constituency and a proportion of its &pound;170,618 in strategic grants to Hertfordshire would also have benefited the town. According to the Department's Lottery Award database (using information supplied by the Lottery distributors) a total of just over &pound;8 million in lottery has been awarded to Hemel Hempstead since 1997.</p>

	<p pid="c.571W.8/2">We judge that our current system for managing carbon emissions already covers the main elements of the Carbon Trust's Carbon Management Programme, we have not yet signed it but are considering whether to do so carefully.</p>

Since its publication in July, Operation Murambatsvina has made 700,000 Zimbabweans homeless and destitute, and new constitutional amendments allowing for passports to be withdrawn, thereby denying individuals their right to free movement, have underlined the Government of Zimbabwe's continued lack of respect for human rights. We will continue to work for the restoration of the rule of law and good governance in Zimbabwe.</p>

	<p pid="c.576W.6/1">The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) prosecutes a substantial number of cases, a proportion of which are abandoned. It is not known how many may have been abandoned in error.</p>
	<p pid="c.576W.6/2">Since April 2004, the CPS has recorded the reason for each decision to abandon proceedings on its Compass Case Management System. The attached table gives information drawn from the system for 2004&ndash;05 and for 2005&ndash;06 to date, showing outcome reasons numerically, and expressing each as a proportion of all cases completed during the year. Also shown are the number and proportion of cases acquitted by the courts, and the number and proportion resulting in conviction.</p>
	<p pid="c.576W.6/3">The various reasons are divided into: administrative finalisations (where the defendant cannot be traced by the police, has died, or has been found unfit to plead); evidential reasons; public interest reasons; cases in which a prosecution cannot proceed; and all other reasons.</p>
	<p pid="c.576W.6/4">The figures show that the proportion of abandoned prosecutions has fallen year on year, from 17.4 per cent. of completed cases in 2004&ndash;05, to 15.4 per cent. in 2005&ndash;06 to date.</p>
	<p pid="c.576W.6/5">It will also be seen that substantial numbers of cases are dropped unavoidably: for example where the victim, or another witness, refuses to give evidence, or fails to attend court, where key legal elements arc missing from the prosecution case; or where there is a conflict of evidence.</p>

We do not set and monitor specific DSA processing times, but we have given advice to local authorities to prioritise DSA applications and speed up the referral process with the aim of achieving payment of DSA in advance of the start of term for those who need it, wherever possible.</p>

	<p pid="c.593W.5/1">Her Majesty's chief inspector of schools has a duty to keep the Secretary of State informed about school failures and the reasons for failure. Inspectors look at the overall effectiveness of a school, teaching, standards and attainment, leadership and management, governance, value for money, improvement since the last inspection and the school's capacity to improve.</p>
	<p pid="c.593W.5/2">The Government have introduced new legislation and a number of successful initiatives, including the Fresh Start programme and Academies, to address failure since 1997. The recent Schools White Paper sets out proposals for further measures to ensure local authorities take rapid and decisive action.</p>

	<p pid="c.594W.2/1">This is a fundamental responsibility of local authorities, and we have challenged them to use their powers of intervention to tackle failure quickly and effectively. When a school fails an Ofsted inspection, authorities may appoint additional governors, or replace an entire governing body with an interim executive board. The authority may also suspend the school's right to a delegated budget. In addition we have encouraged federation and collaboration with other schools, and emphasised that there may be a need to change the head teacher or other senior staff. In cases of severe failure, schools may be closed and replaced under the Fresh Start initiative, or as Academies.</p>
	<p pid="c.594W.2/2">The recent Schools White Paper announced the Government's intention to require local authorities to consider taking radical options as soon as schools are placed in special measures and to re-consider their use after 12 months if schools are making inadequate progress.</p>

	<p pid="c.597W.3/1">Administration costs of local council's are a matter for the Learning and Skills Council. LSC's chief executive, Mark Haysom will write to the hon. Member with further information and a copy of his reply will be placed in the Library.</p>
	<p pid="c.597W.3/2">The LSC's core administration costs have fallen steadily from 3.4 per cent. of total funding in 2001&ndash;02, to 2.5 per cent. of its planned total budget in 2005&ndash;06.</p>
	<p pid="c.597W.3/3">The LSC is embarking upon a major transformation programme that will make it a smaller, more dynamic and more customer-focused organisation. This will build upon its existing strengths; further develop its relationships with providers and with its partners, and help push the highest proportion of its funding out through colleges and providers into front line delivery. At local level, the LSC will develop small teams of professional staff who will support the delivery of its priority objectives through strategic relationships with colleges, providers and other key stakeholders and so ensure that the needs of local employers and learners are met. I fully support the changes the LSC is making as I believe it will help bring about an organisation that is fit for purpose.</p>
	<p pid="c.597W.3/4" class="letterfrom">Letter from Mark Haysom to Mr. Michael Wills, dated <phrase class="date" code="2005-11-09">9 November 2005</phrase></p>
	<p pid="c.597W.3/5" class="indent">I write to provide further information on your recent Parliamentary Question in which you asked the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what the administrative costs of <i>(a)</i> the Learning and Skills Council in Swindon and Wiltshire and <i>(b)</i> all the Learning &amp; Skills councils were in 2003, (ii) 2004 and (iii) 2005.</p>
	<p pid="c.597W.3/6" class="indent">The Learning and Skills Council (LSC) financial year covers the period <phrase class="date" code="2004-04-01">1 April 2004</phrase> to <phrase class="date" code="2005-03-31">31 March</phrase>.</p>

	<p pid="c.601W.3/31">The support received by employers, via the pilots, was mainly indirect with payments going to a skills broker, learning provider and Information, Advice and Guidance adviser, rather than directly to the employer. However in some, though not all, pilots employers did receive a wage compensation payment aimed at reimbursing them for the time their participating employees spent on training. The rate of wage compensation varied between pilots, from between zero to 150 of pay, but averaged &pound;260 per learner. Based on an average of eight learners per employer over the period of the pilots, the average payment received per employer for wage compensation equates to &pound;2,080. From Phase 3 of the Pilots (September 2004), employers only receive wage compensation for time off actually taken when a learner successfully completes their learning.</p>

	<p pid="c.602W.5/2">NETP will give employers real choice over the training they offer their employees, and will respond directly to their business development needs, whether for basic or high level skills. Training will be delivered flexibly, including in the workplace. The Government will fully fund the training of employees undertaking basic skills and first full Level 2 qualifications. Therefore most training up to and including Level 2 will be free to employers and employees.</p>
	<p pid="c.602W.5/3">By September 2005, over 25,000 employers had participated in ETP. A report by the Institute for Employment Studies (IES) published in March 2005, Platform for Progression: Employer Training Pilots Year 2 Evaluation Report&quot;, found that half of the employers taking part in ETP had a previous involvement with either a business support agency, a training provider, or a national training initiative. One-third had been involved with at least one agency, provider or initiative. The remaining 14 per cent. had no previous involvement and could therefore be classified as harder-to-reach employers.</p>
	<p pid="c.602W.5/4">The IES evaluation found that ETP employers have a relatively positive approach to training compared with average employers. Most adopt a strategic approach to training, express positive attitudes, and say that they provided at least some training to low-skilled employees.</p>

	<p pid="c.604W.2/5" class="indent">Wave 1: Bradford, Bristol, Gateshead, Greenwich, Knowsley, Lancashire, Leicester City, Leeds, Lewisham, Manchester, Newcastle upon Tyne, Newham, Sheffield, Solihull, South Tyneside, Southwark, Stoke on Trent, Sunderland, and Waltham Forest.</p>
	<p pid="c.604W.2/6" class="indent">Wave 2: Birmingham, Hackney, Haringey, Islington, Kingston upon Hull, Lambeth, Liverpool, Middlesbrough, Nottingham City, and Tower Hamlets.</p>
	<p pid="c.604W.2/7" class="indent">Wave 3: Barnsley, Durham, Derbyshire, Kent, Luton, North Lincolnshire, Salford, Sandwell, Tameside, and Westminster.</p>
	<p pid="c.604W.2/8">For those projects in BSF waves 1 to 3, 12 schools in South Tyneside and Gateshead and 39 other schools in the north-east region will benefit from BSF investment. Nationally projects in waves 1 to 3 will cover around 350 schools.</p>
	<p pid="c.604W.2/9">In addition, from 2008&ndash;09 we will be launching a new primary programme, with the aim of renewing at least half of primary school buildings over 15 years. We will be launching a consultation on that early in the new year.</p>

	<p pid="c.605W.2/1">A fast-track for the expansion of successful and popular secondary schools was introduced in August of this year. At the same time, statutory guidance reinforced the presumption that such proposals should be approved. Expansion of schools is a matter for the schools themselves and the local education authority, and we have no targets for the numbers that should expand. However, over 1,300 secondary schools currently have no spare capacity, and we estimate that some 80 schools a year might wish to expand.</p>

	<p pid="c.605W.5/1">All maintained schools may publish their own proposals to expand, and local authorities may also publish proposals for the expansion of community and foundation schools. Local authorities may decide their own proposals if there are no objections. Proposals are otherwise decided by the local School Organisation Committee or, where the Committee cannot agree unanimously, by the Schools Adjudicator. Statutory guidance to the decision-makers says that there should be a presumption in favour of approval of proposals to expand by successful and popular schools, and we have made capital available to support the expansion of such schools.</p>
	<p pid="c.605W.5/2">Local authorities may object to proposals by a governing body to expand their school, as may governing bodies to proposals by the authority if they do not agree. Four proposals by schools to expand have been rejected since the presumption in favour was introduced in June 2003.</p>

The number of schools in each authority used in the calculation of the mean and deciles is also provided as each authority has varying numbers of primary and secondary schools which should be borne in mind when interpreting these deciles&mdash;as a decile for an authority with very few schools can be somewhat meaningless.</p>

On the <phrase class="date" code="2002-04-01">1 April 2002</phrase> Isles of Scilly amalgamated all their maintained primary and secondary schools into one school which is treated as a primary school for the purposes of Section 52.</p>
	<p pid="c.606W.3/323"><sup>(23)</sup> The lower decile budget share (plus grants) per pupil is calculated such that 10 per cent. of schools within that authority have per pupil figures below this amount.

	<p pid="c.606W.3/324"><sup>(24)</sup> The mean amount for an authority is calculated as the sum of all that authority's primary or secondary schools budget share plus grants divided by the total number of pupils at the primary or secondary schools within that authority.</p>

	<p pid="c.606W.3/326">1. Budget share (plus grants) is the combination of the schools individual budget share plus any devolved standards fund and Excellence in Cities (EiC) grants allocated to the school. In 2005&ndash;06 the Schools Standards Grant is also included and this contributed &pound;856 million to the money allocated to primary and secondary schools in England.</p>
	<p pid="c.606W.3/327">2. The amount of money delegated to schools depends very much on the individual local authorities own policy for funding their schools. Different authority's retain varying amounts of funding centrally to spend on behalf of their schools while others chose to give schools more autonomy over how they spend their money by devolving more funding to the individual school.</p>
	<p pid="c.606W.3/328">3. The pupil numbers used to calculate the per pupil amounts are as reported by the local authority on their section 52 budget statement comprising the full time equivalent number pupils registered at the school used for the initial determination of the school's budget share under the local authority's allocation formula.</p>

The Secretary of State's speech underlined the important role that education can play in improving life chances for all individuals, and it set out the forward looking context for our programme of reform across the system.</p>
	<p pid="c.620W.5/2">Education has an important role to play in promoting social mobility. For example analysis by researchers at the London School of Economics in their report published by the Sutton Trust: Intergenerational Mobility in Europe and North America&quot; estimate that measures of education account for 35 to 40 per cent. of the intergenerational income mobility for cohorts born in 1958 and 1970.</p>

Our recent White Paper Higher Standards, Better Schools for All&quot; set out our plans for a new professionalism&quot; for teachers, in which career progression and financial rewards will go to those who make the biggest impact on pupil progress and those who show commitment to their own professional development and that of their colleagues. A thorough reform of all teachers' professional standards, with more stretch at every level, will set out what can be expected of teachers at each stage in their career. More effective performance development&mdash;which includes performance management&mdash;will help focus teachers on effective classroom practice and ensure that they are involved in the professional development that best meets their personal needs and the specific needs of the school and its pupils.</p>

	<p pid="c.623W.7/4">These other factors include pre-school, neighbourhoods and schools which can mitigate or offset the impact of family level factors in a substantial way. Parental beliefs, values, aspirations and attitudes, as well as parental well-being, have an independent effect on pupil attainment. Parental skills in terms of warmth, discipline and education behaviours are all major factors in the formation of school success. These behaviours can be adopted by parents no matter what their background.

However, the authors noted that when effects such as parental education and income were controlled the findings show that what parents do is as important as who they are:</p>
	<p pid="c.623W.7/6" class="indent">parental involvement in the form of 'at-home good parenting' has a significant positive effect on children's achievement and adjustment even after all other factors shaping attainment have been taken out of the equation&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="c.623W.7/7">This suggests that parental involvement is particularly important for children from low socio-economic backgrounds. (<a href="http://www.dfes.gov.uk/research/data/uploadfiles/RR433.pdf">http://www.dfes.gov.uk/research/data/uploadfiles/RR433.pdf</a>)</p>

	<p pid="c.624W.2/1">We aim to support such parents through the development of Sure Start with 3,500 children's centres planned by 2010. All centres will provide information, advice and support for parents. Those in the most disadvantaged areas will provide more intensive programmes of family support and parental outreach. These services can help parents to access the wide range of courses in further and adult education designed to help people attain the platform of employability through improving their language, literacy and numeracy skills and studying for a full level 2 qualification (equivalent to five GCSEs at A*-C). Help is also available through family learning programmes funded by the Learning and Skills Council with budgets in 2005/06 of &pound;37 million. As part of this, extended schools can offer family learning sessions to enable children and parents to learn alongside each other. Adults from low socio-economic groups, including parents, are already eligible for a wide range of support to improve their skills, including full fee remission for those on means-tested benefits. The Government's Skills Strategy will roll out implementation of further targeted support for adults to improve their skills, including the level 2 entitlement which gives free tuition for a first full level 2 qualification.</p>

	<p pid="c.625W.2/1">Improving life-chances for all lies at the heart of the principles behind our 5-year Strategy for Children and Learners&quot;:</p>
	<p pid="c.625W.2/2" class="indent">Early intervention to support very young children and families to lay the foundations for later success&mdash;not just in education, but in supporting the welfare of the whole child, carrying through into better services for all children and young people;</p>
	<p pid="c.625W.2/3" class="indent">A continuing drive to ensure that every child leaves primary school with the basics in reading, writing and maths; and an enjoyment of learning, built through an enriched curriculum including the arts, music, sport and a foreign language;</p>
	<p pid="c.625W.2/4" class="indent">Creating secondary and further education which widens choice, stretches and engages the underachieving and prepares young people better for working life;</p>
	<p pid="c.625W.2/5" class="indent">Reducing the historic deficit in adult skills, not just by greater participation and attainment by 16&ndash;19 year olds, but by addressing the needs of those in the work force to update their skills; and</p>
	<p pid="c.625W.2/6" class="indent">Sustaining an excellent university sector, capable of high quality teaching, world class research and increasing responsiveness to employers.</p>
	<p pid="c.625W.2/7">The Department remains committed to creating a system of education that allows all children to achieve, regardless of family circumstances. For example our recent White Paper Higher Standards, Better Schools for All&quot; sets out reforms to improve our school system and encourage greater personalisation, enabling all children to achieve. Curriculum reform is important too. The White Paper 14&ndash;19 Education and Skills sets out how we will build a system of 14&ndash;19 education to enable every child to reach their potential by providing better vocational routes; ensuring that all young people have a sound grounding in English and Maths and the skills they need for employment; and providing a stretching curriculum for all while re-engaging the disaffected.</p>
	<p pid="c.625W.2/8">We continue to analyse the impact of socio-economic factors upon under-achievement. Following the publication by the Department of the paper Has the Social Class Gap Narrowed in Primary Schools&quot; in July (IPPR/2005), further analysis will be carried out over the coming months. In particular, we will look at key stages 1, 3 and 4, to the extent that data for these phases can be tracked over time on a comparable basis.</p>

	<p pid="c.625W.5/1">Tackling poverty and exclusion is well embedded in the Department for Education and Skills policies. Through our Five Year Strategy for Children and Learners&quot; (July 2004), we are committed to giving children and families the best possible start in life, reducing the number of young people who leave school with low qualifications and providing opportunities through widening participation for the number of young adults with low and poor skills.</p>
	<p pid="c.625W.5/2">DfES policies place particular emphasis on tackling child poverty and investing in high quality early years services because we know that this improves outcomes for children and that those benefits are greatest for children from disadvantaged backgrounds. Many of these programmes, including Sure Start local programmes, neighbourhood nurseries and the early children's centres, are concentrated in the most disadvantaged areas. By promoting children's development, supporting parents and helping build strong local communities, early years provision particularly tackles deprivation and social exclusion by benefiting vulnerable families and disadvantaged neighbourhoods.</p>
	<p pid="c.625W.5/3">We recognise, though, that the life chances of children and young people are still strongly determined by their parents' background. Through the recently published Schools White Paper we aim to break completely the cycle that makes under-achievement (and not 'lack of ability') and low expectations a regular hand-me-down from parent to child.</p>
	<p pid="c.625W.5/4">Well-organised, safe and stimulating activities before and after school make a real difference to children's chances at school. We have committed additional funding to support the development of extended services in schools by making approximately &pound;160 million of funding available to local authorities since 2003 and we will be making a further &pound;680 million available from 2006&ndash;08. Deprivation levels will be a factor in distributing funding.</p>
	<p pid="c.625W.5/5">The 14&ndash;19 White Paper sets out our priorities for those aged 14&ndash;19, including new opportunities for young people to enjoy new styles of learning, in different settings and with more opportunities for practical and applied learning. Those at most risk of dropping out will get extra support, including progression. Financial support and a number of learner support funds will be available for those who need it.</p>

	<p pid="c.626W.2/1">The Department is putting in place a range of measures to reduce the rate of exclusion of pupils from school, including that of children from low socio-economic backgrounds. In particular, since 2002 the Department's Improving Behaviour and Attendance Programme has provided all schools with high-quality guidance and training materials on managing behaviour, backed by advice from expert teachers; and has targeted extra resources on schools facing the greatest challenges, particularly those in disadvantaged areas.</p>
	<p pid="c.626W.2/2">In addition, by September 2007 we expect all secondary schools to be part of a partnership to improve behaviour and attendance. Partnerships will have funding devolved from their local authorities to enable them to commission a range of support and provision for pupils at risk of exclusion, persistent truants and excluded pupils. Evidence from existing partnerships shows that they are effective in reducing the rate of exclusion.</p>
	<p pid="c.626W.2/3">Head teachers will have a direct interest in ensuring that the alternative provision available to partnerships is of good quality and is value for money, whether this is provided by a pupil referral unit or is contracted externally. We are committed to developing a more vibrant, diverse and effective alternative provision market. Over the next six months we shall be carrying out a survey of alternative provision to establish a clear picture of the provision that is available and whether it meets the needs of pupils. This information will help us to guide school partnerships, and enable them to commission and procure good quality, effective, and value for money provision that suits the needs of their pupils</p>

	<p pid="c.627W.2/1">Departmental data shows that schools with higher levels of permanent exclusions tend to have lower levels of attainment and that young people who have been excluded from school also have lower levels of attainment. For example, only one in five young people who was reported as having been excluded from school in years 10 or 11, permanently or for a fixed period, achieved 5 A*-C GCSEs compared to almost three in five young people who had not been excluded. However, a direct causal link between exclusion and attainment has not been established.</p>
	<p pid="c.627W.2/2">As well as having lower levels of attainment, in general schools with higher rates of permanent exclusion also tend to have higher percentages of pupils who are eligible for free school meals. However, there is a lot of variation at individual school level. Data from the Department for Work and Pensions shows that children who have been temporarily excluded from school are more likely to come from lone-parent families or from families where both parents are working less than 15 hours per week.</p>
	<p pid="c.627W.2/3">In the recently published White Paper, Higher Standards, Better Schools For All&quot;, we committed to requiring schools and local authorities to provide suitable full-time education for all excluded pupils from the sixth day of their exclusion, rather than from the sixteenth day as at present. This should help to raise levels of attainment among excluded pupils.</p>

	<p pid="c.627W.5/1">Analyses of national data show that there is a correlation between both authorised and unauthorised absences from school and pupils' levels of achievement. On average, pupils in schools with lower levels of absence tend to perform better at key stage 2, key stage 3 and GCSE than pupils in schools with higher levels of absence.</p>
	<p pid="c.627W.5/2">Analyses of national data also show links between higher levels of pupils in receipt of free school meals and higher levels of absence. Recent research on behalf of the Department by the National Foundation for Educational Research An analysis of pupil attendance data in Excellence in Cities areas and non-EiC EAZs: final report&quot; reports that the highest levels of attainment at key stage 3 and GCSE, once all other pupil characteristics, prior attainment and school variables were taken into account, were associated with, among other things, pupils who lived in areas of relatively less deprivation compared with the cohort. On average, these pupils also tended to have fewer absences from school than other pupils in the cohort.</p>
	<p pid="c.627W.5/3">The associations identified do not in themselves prove that there is a direct causal relationship between pupils' absences and their attainment. However, we believe that every pupil should attend school regularly if they are to achieve their full potential and our strategy aims to reduce the overall level of absences from school, including those due to persistent truancy.</p>

This includes Leading Edge Partnership Programme schools that are funded to work with other schools to share their best practice, and a Secondary Performance Project which draws on the expertise of successful schools and the Specialist Schools Trust to work in partnership with schools that while not below the floor target have nevertheless been underperforming in value added terms.

Clinical guidelines are covered by the developmental standards, standards which the national health service is expected to achieve over time. The Healthcare Commission has responsibility for assessing progress towards achieving these standards. Clinicians are expected to take full account of NICE guidelines because they are based on the best available evidence and have been put together after wide consultation, drawing on the views of patients and carers as well as the experts in the field.</p>

The study ran for five years, and was funded by the Medical Research Council and National Health Service research and development. The results of the study were published in May 2005. The NICE guideline noted that several MRI studies, including MARIBS, would be published over the next few years. When the information from these studies becomes available, the recommendations in the guideline will be reviewed by NICE.</p>

	<p pid="c.638W.3/1">The Department commissioned the Health Protection Agency in 2004 to undertake a bi-annual, and now quarterly, audit of waiting times in genito-urinary medicine (GUM) clinics. The latest data, from a survey undertaken in May 2005, show that 45 per cent. of patients are seen within 48 hours at GUM clinics. Primary care trusts and strategic health authorities have already developed plans on how they will meet the target of 48-hour access through the local delivery planning process. To support this, the Department is investing an additional &pound;130 million for GUM services and infrastructure in 2006&ndash;07 and 2007&ndash;08 to enable clinics to expand their services and reduce waiting times. An additional &pound;15 million capital funding has also been recently allocated.</p>
