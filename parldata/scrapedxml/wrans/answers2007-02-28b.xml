	<p pid="b.1303W.3/2">Rail season ticket prices provide a discount on the cost of the daily peak return. This incentivises passengers to buy season tickets and benefit from the flexibility that they bring. For example, the standard class weekly season ticket from Oxford to London costs &pound;92.80, which is less than three times the &pound;39.30 cost of the daily peak return. Season ticket holders who work at home up to two days a week still save money over the cost of daily tickets. The Department is not currently reviewing this structure.</p>

The estimated UK taxpayer contribution to the CAP includes payment through the EU budget plus the direct cost of co-financed expenditure under Pillar II of the CAP.

	<p pid="b.1306W.2/1">Agricultural waste is waste from premises used for agriculture within the meaning of the Agriculture Act 1947 which provides that:</p>
	<p pid="b.1306W.2/2" class="indent">&quot;Agriculture includes:</p>
	<p pid="b.1306W.2/3" class="indent">horticulture, fruit growing, seed growing, dairy farming and livestock breeding and keeping, the use of land as grazing land, meadow land, osier land, market gardens and nursery grounds, and the use of land for woodlands where that use is ancillary to the farming of land for other agricultural purposes, and 'agriculture' shall be construed accordingly.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.1306W.2/4">There is no definitive list of what is or is not agricultural waste. However, agricultural waste can include materials such as discarded pesticide containers, plastics such as silage wrap, bags and sheets, packaging waste, tyres, batteries, clinical waste, old machinery and oil.</p>
	<p pid="b.1306W.2/5">Modelling carried out by the Environment Agency, based on the DEFRA Agricultural Census, showed that agricultural waste arisings in the UK were estimated to be 544,000 tonnes in 2004. This estimate does not include manure and slurry as these are considered to be important nutrient resources that are applied to land as a fertiliser for the benefit of agriculture.</p>
	<p pid="b.1306W.2/6">Agricultural waste was included as a &quot;controlled waste&quot; only when the Waste Management (England and Wales) Regulations (S.I. 2006 No. 937) came into force on <phrase class="date" code="2006-05-15">15 May 2006</phrase>. These applied the same national waste management controls to agricultural waste that have long applied to other sectors of industry. Data on agricultural waste arising and its disposal routes, are, therefore, not yet available.</p>

We also compensate for eggs or other property that is seized and destroyed. Valuation tables are available on the DEFRA website.</p>

	<p pid="b.1307W.2/1">Defra contracts with the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology generally include a risk assessment and, where relevant, these include an assessment of the risks of staff changes to the success of individual projects. New contracts which span the anticipated period of re-structuring will include such an assessment. The Government have not made a specific assessment of how staff changes at Monks Wood and Winfrith research stations will affect progress towards the 2010 target on biodiversity loss. The Centre for Ecology and Hydrology is one of very many organisations which contribute to achievement of the 2010 target, many of which undergo staff changes and re-structuring from time to time.</p>

	<p pid="b.1313W.2/1">The Environment Agency (EA) is the principal operating authority with responsibility for managing flood risk in England and undertakes an annual National Flood Risk Assessment. The 2004 assessment (NaFRA 2004) identified 1.9 million domestic and commercial properties at risk of flooding in England, with 285,000 being at significant risk (defined as a probability of flooding in any one year greater than 1.3 per cent. or one in 75). NaFRA 2005 identified 2.1 million properties at risk of flooding with 517,000 being at significant risk. The results from NaFRA 2006 will be published shortly&mdash;indicative results suggest a similar number of properties at risk of flooding, but a slightly lower number at significant risk compared to 2005.</p>
	<p pid="b.1313W.2/2">This estimation is a complex process and, although techniques are developing rapidly from research to operational methodology, they are not yet able to track real annual changes in flood risk on the ground. Any changes between annual assessments are almost entirely due to changes in data and analysis techniques. An improvement in the 2005 assessment was that the number of houses in the 'no data' category was significantly reduced from the 2004 assessment to less than 1 per cent. of the total. This inevitably added properties to each of the identified risk bands.</p>
	<p pid="b.1313W.2/3">Funding for flood risk management has increased significantly in recent years and the Department remains on target to achieve the spending review 2004 target of improving the standard of protection for at least 100,000 households over the period 2005-06 to 2007-08. The NaFRA estimates are one factor informing spend on flood risk management within the overall departmental funding allocation set in the 2004 spending review up to 2007-08.</p>

	<p pid="b.1314W.0/1">Local authorities and internal drainage boards are currently forecasting to spend &pound;12.7 million of DEFRA grant on capital flood risk improvement projects in 2006-07. This excludes local authority spend on coast protection projects which also often provide significant benefits in terms of reducing flooding from the sea.</p>
	<p pid="b.1314W.0/2">The original allocation of &pound;15.7 million has, therefore, been reduced by &pound;3 million which has been transferred to the Environment Agency's capital flood risk budget. There has been no overall reduction in capital spend on flood risk management as a result. No specific assessment of the impact of this transfer has been made, but overall flood risk management should not be adversely affected.</p>

	<p pid="b.1314W.3/1">The Government's 2004 Foresight Future Flooding report estimated that average annual flood damages could increase by between two and 20 times by the end of the century. This takes into account the likely effects of climate change and increased development and economic wealth. However, changes will be highly dependent on the actual impact of climate change and sea level rise, patterns of growth, development and future flood risk management activity.</p>
	<p pid="b.1314W.3/2">Effective flood risk management remains a priority for the Government and we have increased funding significantly in recent years. Overall departmental funding in future years, of which spending on flood risk management is a large part, is being considered in the 2007 comprehensive spending review and we continue to work with the Environment Agency in preparation for this.</p>

	<p pid="b.1316W.6/1">In December 2005, the European Council agreement on future financing for 2007-13 fixed the amounts for the EU rural development budget. This was set at &euro;69.75 billion for the seven- year period, through Council Decision 493 of 2006. The EU rural development budget allocations for each member state (including price adjustments) were confirmed in Commission Decision 636 of 2006. The UK receives approximately &euro;1.9 billion, of which &euro;1 billion will be allocated to England.</p>
	<p pid="b.1316W.6/2">However, the total size of the rural development budget cannot be confirmed at this stage. Any decisions about national exchequer co-financing will be made once the EU regulation governing the use of voluntary modulation has been adopted.</p>

	<p pid="b.1320W.5/1">Poverty creates the conditions in which children are vulnerable to trafficking. DFID's purpose is to support long-term programmes to help eliminate the underlying causes of poverty, including lack of education for children as well as lack of livelihood opportunities and social security for their families. Getting children into school is key to protecting them from trafficking and improving their life chances. DFID is committed to ensuring all children receive primary education and has a commitment to spend over &pound;8.5 billion to support education over the next 10 years. DFID is also a major supporter of UNICEF and non-governmental organisations working for children's rights and protection.</p>

	<p pid="b.1320W.8/1">Because of the devastation Afghanistan suffered through decades of conflict up to 2001, it is currently off-track on all the millennium development goals (MDGs). The Afghan Government therefore decided to set themselves a revised target of 2020 to meet the MDGs, and the country has made significant progress since 2001. Economic growth is strong and legalGDP increased by almost 85 per cent. in real terms between 2002-03 and 2005-06. School enrolment has quadrupled in the last four years. Nearly 6 million Afghan children are now in school, a third of them girls. Over 13,000 primary and secondary schools have been reconstructed, and some 1.2 million illiterate people are participating in literacy courses. Since 2001 the number of functioning health clinics has increased by 60 per cent., and the immunisation of over 16 million children against childhood diseases has saved around 35,000 lives. Afghanistan has one of the highest incidences of tuberculosis in the world, but the proportion of cases detected and cured increased from almost zero in 2000 to nearly 25 per cent. in 2005.</p>
	<p pid="b.1320W.8/2">DFID's programme in Afghanistan is focused on state-building, economic management, and improving livelihoods. Over 70 per cent. of our aid goes directly to the Government of Afghanistan to support its own development priorities in pursuit of the MDGs. The vision for achieving the revised 2020 targets is set out in the interim Afghanistan National Development Strategy.</p>

The number of health locations offering treatment has grown from 3 to 110 in Zambia and from 3 to 60 in Malawi over the past two years.

They agreed to set in 2006, through inclusive, transparent processes, ambitious national targets, including interim targets for 2008 that reflect the urgent need to scale up significantly towards the goal of universal access.</p>

	<p pid="b.1322W.2/1">In the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), we are supporting humanitarian agencies to provide medical assistance to victims of sexual violence, particularly in Eastern DRC, including funding the Norwegian NGO Christian Relief Network to support Panzi hospital (South Kivu) in constructing and running a 100-bed wing specialised for treating women suffering from fistula&mdash;which is one of the most serious and devastating consequences of sexual violence. Their programme includes outreach to encourage women to seek medical support and psychological support for patients, as well as medical treatment. We are also continuing our support to the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), which has extended its programme of medical and psychological support to victims of sexual violence in North and South Kivu. The UK will be spending more than &pound;35 million this financial year on humanitarian and health service delivery projects in the DRC through the UN and NGOs and many of these contain an element of assistance to victims of sexual violence.</p>
	<p pid="b.1322W.2/2">It is also vital to tackle the underlying causes of sexual violence, particularly conflict and impunity. Conflict reduction is a major focus of the UK's work in the DRC, and at a local level in eastern DRC we support NGOs who are promoting dialogue and peace building work between communities previously in conflict. DFID is also funding training of justice sector workers and the police on gender and sexual violence and children's rights. We are also making a &pound;2 million contribution to a major project in eastern DRC to restore the justice system so it is able to address the most serious crimes. We are working with the Government and other donors to develop a long-term programme of justice reform.</p>
	<p pid="b.1322W.2/3">In Uganda we support NGOs working to change attitude and behaviour on domestic violence and undertaking local and national advocacy for new laws on domestic relations and sexual offences. We have committed &pound;117,000 over three years to the Centre for Domestic Violence and Prevention to help communities and civil society organisations to end domestic violence. We are also providing &pound;180,000 for three years to MUFUMI Human Right Defenders Network which is working on similar issues.</p>
	<p pid="b.1322W.2/4">In the last two years in northern Uganda we have provided &pound;1.6 million to UNICEF to work with women and young people on issues around protection and sexual violence in camps for internally displaced people. This year we have also provided &pound;240,000 to Save the Children Fund for similar activities.</p>
	<p pid="b.1322W.2/5">In Pakistan, DFID committed &pound;6 million to the UNDP Gender Support Programme in December 2006. The programme supports the Government of Pakistan in reducing poverty in Pakistan by enabling women, especially the poor, to participate more equally in economic, public and domestic life. &pound;2 million of DFID's contribution will be used to establish a Gender, Justice and Protection Fund, with the specific aim of supporting joint Government and civil society efforts to tackle violence against women.</p>
	<p pid="b.1322W.2/6">DFID has also committed &pound;3.5 million, to the Gender and Education Policy Support Project (GEPSP), a joint initiative with the Government of Pakistan and UNICEF to generate better understanding of security concerns and to strengthen capacity to do something about them. Security is critical to female participation in education. Good practice includes locating schools within reasonable distances (primary but also middle and secondary schools once girls have reached puberty), promoting safe access to schools for girls and female teachers (e.g. via travel allowances and school buses), building boundary walls (and in some cases providing security guards), enforcing the ban on corporal punishment and developing a culture among teachers where this is not seen as necessary.</p>
	<p pid="b.1322W.2/7">The DFID-funded Gender Support Project which came to an end in 2006 supported 57 projects aimed at women's empowerment. 10 of these focused on the issue of violence against women. An example is a project aimed at ending violence against women in the southern part of North West Frontier Province through legal empowerment. The project focused on raising awareness among young people of the issue of violence against women, and providing legal aid and skills to women.</p>

	<p pid="b.1332W.5/1">I am unable to make a statement or comment substantially at this time on Colonel Mendon&ccedil;a's acquittal as to do so could be prejudicial to the ongoing court-martial in the case of Payne and others. I would remind my hon. Friend however that in February 2005 the then Chief of the General Staff announced what was, and is, to be a wide-ranging review that would involve extensive consultation, both within and beyond the Army and the Ministry of Defence. The review is looking at three main strands: doctrine (particularly the preparation of personnel for all tasks and scenarios they may face); secondly, officer and non-commissioned officer training and performance; and the disciplinary system. The review will also examine issues surrounding recent and current investigations into individual training. We said in 2005 that we will publish our findings when we are no longer constrained by legal process.</p>

	<p pid="b.1334W.3/1">The military managed ward (MMW), located in the main body of Selly Oak hospital (which is the primary reception hospital for service casualties from operations overseas), reached initial operating capability just before Christmas 2006. It provides clinical care, by a combined team of military and civilian personnel, for military patients whose clinical condition allows for them to be nursed in this ward. There are military managers involved at every level on the MMW, with a military ward manager responsible for all aspects of the military presence on the ward, whether staff or patient issues, and for liaising with appropriate authorities. The MMW ward manager is assisted by three military deputy ward managers who are responsible for the planning and delivery of patient care to both military and civilian patients, although they primarily focus on military activity. An enhanced military nursing structure is in place for this ward, comprising military nurses and military health care assistants, and military nursing staff are on duty on every shift on the ward.</p>
	<p pid="b.1334W.3/2">Wherever possible, military patients are allocated to one of the 12 military consultants who work at RCDM, although by far the largest proportion of specialist care is provided by NHS consultant staff, which reflects the range and capabilities of the knowledge, skills and resources the NHS makes available to our patients. Each military patient in the Birmingham area now has a named military nurse whom he or she can contact at any time on clinical and other issues, and a military nurse team member visits every military patient being treated at a Birmingham hospital three times a day. This is in addition to the work of the Defence Medical Welfare Service (now reinforced by the Army Welfare Service), who visit patients regularly, and each deployed task force provides military liaison officers on the ward.</p>
	<p pid="b.1334W.3/3">Community psychiatric support to our patients has also increased, and there are now two full-time community psychiatric nurses in post at Selly Oak.</p>
	<p pid="b.1334W.3/4">Furthermore, additional funding has been provided to help meet the travel and accommodation costs of patients' families who need to travel to Selly Oak. Transport and drivers have been made available from HQ5 Div resources to enable the transfer of patients and dependants between railheads, accommodation and the various hospital locations. Six rooms have been allocated in the Alexander Wing at Selly Oak for relatives of service personnel who are listed &quot;very seriously ill&quot; (VSI) or &quot;seriously ill&quot; (SI), where relatives can stay whilst visiting a patient. These rooms are provided free, and (depending on availability) may also be used by families/relatives of non-VSI/SI listed patients. The Alexander Wing has wi-fi connectivity and six laptops have been provided from HQ5 Div resources to enable internet access for visitors and patients.</p>

	<p pid="b.1336W.3/2">The Government follows the Department of Health's definition of binge drinking, which is drinking more than double the daily recommended limit of three-four units for men and two-three for women in a single session.</p>
	<p pid="b.1336W.3/3">The most recent assessment the Home Office has made of the impact of binge drinking on crime is from the 2003 Offending, Crime and Justice survey on alcohol-related crime and disorder which defined binge drinking as &quot;feeling very drunk at least once a month&quot;. This survey identified 44 per cent. of young adults (18-24 year olds) as binge drinkers. Among this age group, 27 per cent. of binge drinkers admitted that they had committed an offence in the past 12 months. The Home Office no longer uses the definition of binge drinking that was used in this report and now follows the Department of Health's guidelines. The Offending, Crime and Justice survey is currently under review and a decision is yet to be made on whether or not it will be continued.</p>
	<p pid="b.1336W.3/4">According to the 2005-06 British crime survey published on <phrase class="date" code="2006-07-20">20 July 2006</phrase>, victims believed the offender or offenders to be under the influence of alcohol in 44 per cent. of all violent incidents, approximately the same level as for 2004-05. The offender was judged to be under the influence of alcohol in 54 per cent. of incidents of stranger violence, a decrease from 60 per cent. in 2004-05.</p>

That remains the case and may apply to both failed asylum seekers and other immigration offenders. In addition, individual foreign nationals who have been convicted for criminal offences in the United Kingdom may be held in prison accommodation pending deportation or transfer to the immigration detention estate on release from their prison sentences. No specific guidance has been issued but the Home Secretary has instructed the Immigration and Nationality Directorate to work closely with the National Offender Management Service and HM Prison Service.</p>

	<p pid="b.1346W.2/2">Only the courts can give a definitive interpretation of legislation. However, the Government's view is that a person, whether or not they are an offender, who has been diagnosed as having a personality disorder would have a mental disorder within the meaning of that definition in section 1(2) of the Mental Health Act 1983. It is not possible to say categorically whether that personality disorder could properly be classified as mental illness within the terms of that Act. Mental illness is not defined and there is some uncertainty about its boundaries. It may also depend on the particular clinical presentation of the person in question.</p>

	<p pid="b.1357W.5/1">The Director and the Home Office have had regular discussions about the work of the Agency since its inception. There has been a general recognition that it would not be possible for the Agency to pursue civil recovery action in certain cases because of the 12-year limitation period. We have no record of the Director having made representations to the Home Office that the 12-year rule was an impediment to the operation of the Agency or affected performance against its published targets. The Government made a number of changes to the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 in the Serious Organised Crime Act 2005 in response to proposals from the Agency, although there was no proposal to amend the 12-year rule. In evidence to the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee in March 2006, the Agency referred to the 12-year limit among a range of other subjects. We keep the legislation under review and we will be looking further at this matter.</p>

	<p pid="b.1359W.0/2">The Government remain concerned by the humanitarian situation in the refugee camps. The UN World Food programme (WFP), which has been providing assistance to the camps since 1986, has raised concern over the nutritional status of the refugees. The UNHCR and WFP have been focusing on the 90,000 most vulnerable beneficiaries of aid. The WFP also reported a decline in contributions causing serious breaks in food distributions over the last six months. In response, the EU donated a further US$1.3 million to provide food aid to Western Saharan refugees at the end of January 2007, supported by the UK whose share of the contribution will be over US$200,000. Saharawi refugees started arriving in Algeria in 1976, and have been totally dependent on outside assistance for the past 30 years. Estimates vary as to the number of refugees. Algeria and the Polisario refuse to allow a census in the camps. They say they will do so once there is movement in the political process.</p>

	<p pid="b.1361W.2/1">This work arises out of the EU's Global Approach to Migration strategy. The strategy identified four migration routes from Africa and called for member states to develop initiatives for operational co-operation among countries of origin, transit and destination along these routes. We are, with EU partners, supporting activity along route four (East Africa: Kenya, Ethiopia, Egypt, Libya). We have called this the East Africa Migration Routes Initiative. To date, this has entailed work to establish a network of EU Immigration Liaison Officers in East Africa and a survey of member states' activities in the region. The UK and Italy have also submitted a joint application to the European Commission for funding for projects that address irregular migration in East Africa.</p>

I am arranging for further copies to be placed in the Library. Both documents have also been circulated as documents of the UN Security Council.</p>
	<p pid="b.1362W.5/2">The E3+3 proposals are far-reaching and intended as the basis for a long-term agreement. They would give Iran everything it needs to develop a modern civil nuclear power industry, including active support for the building of new light water reactors; co-operation in nuclear research in areas that are not proliferation sensitive and the possible provision of a light water research reactor; and legally binding assurances relating to the supply of nuclear fuel. They would also give Iran political and economic benefits, including assistance with Iran's application to join the World Trade Organisation and the possible lifting of US sanctions in some areas of great benefit to the Iranian economy such as civil aircraft and telecoms.</p>
	<p pid="b.1362W.5/3">In return, the E3+3 has asked that Iran should refrain from all uranium enrichment related and reprocessing activities until international confidence in the exclusively peaceful nature of its programme has been restored. Such activities are not essential for Iran to develop a modern civil nuclear power programme, but would allow Iran to develop know-how that could be used to produce fissile material for nuclear weapons. The suspension is a requirement of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Board of Governors and the UN Security Council.</p>
	<p pid="b.1362W.5/4">The E3+3 has made clear that in order for talks to begin, Iran needs to address the requirements of the IAEA Board and the UN Security Council, including the requirement that it should suspend all uranium enrichment related and reprocessing activities. We have said that if Iran does so, we are prepared to suspend further action in the Security Council and the implementation of sanctions.</p>
	<p pid="b.1362W.5/5">We remain committed to a negotiated solution and the E3+3's proposals remain on the table. At the same time, the Security Council has made clear that if Iran does not comply with its obligations, the Council will impose further sanctions.</p>

	<p pid="b.1363W.8/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2006-06-06">6 June 2006</phrase>, the EU High Representative, Javier Solana, presented generous proposals to Iran on behalf of the 'E3+3' (France, Germany, UK plus China, Russia, US). The proposals would give Iran everything it needs to develop a modern civil nuclear power industry, as well as political and economic benefits. In return, the E3+3 asked that Iran should suspend all uranium enrichment related and reprocessing activities, as required by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Board of Governors and the UN Security Council, until international confidence in the exclusively peaceful nature of its programme has been restored.</p>
	<p pid="b.1363W.8/2">Despite persistent efforts by Dr. Solana, the Iranians declined to engage substantively on the proposals during June and July 2006, including at a meeting in Brussels on <phrase class="date" code="2006-07-11">11 July 2006</phrase> between Dr. Solana (supported by E3 and Russian Political Directors) and the Secretary-General of Iran's Supreme National Security Council, Ali Larijani (and the full Iranian negotiating team). Dr. Larijani did not ask any serious questions about the proposals and would not say whether Iran was prepared to suspend uranium enrichment activities. Iran formally responded to the proposals on <phrase class="date" code="2006-08-22">22 August 2006</phrase>. The lengthy response did not indicate that Iran would be prepared to meet the IAEA Board and Security Council requirements.</p>
	<p pid="b.1363W.8/3">The E3+3 continued to show flexibility. Despite the passing of the Security Council's <phrase class="date" code="2006-08-31">31 August 2006</phrase> deadline, Dr. Solana had a series of exchanges with Dr. Larijani in September 2006 to see if Iran could be persuaded to take the steps that would allow negotiations to begin. But Dr. Larijani made clear to Dr. Solana that Iran was not prepared to do so and President Ahmadinejad also said publicly that Iran would not suspend enrichment. The E3+3 therefore decided that there was no choice but to seek measures under Article 41 of the UN Charter, targeted on Iran's sensitive nuclear and missile activities.

	<p pid="b.1364W.2/1">Iran's nuclear programme is of serious concern. The nature of the programme, Iran's history of concealment, its failure to co-operate fully with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and its refusal to take essential confidence-building steps have added to international concerns that Iran's ambitions may not be, as it claims, entirely peaceful.</p>
	<p pid="b.1364W.2/2">Iran continues to pursue uranium enrichment related activities, in defiance of the requirement of the UN Security Council and the IAEA Board of Governors that it should suspend these activities fully. They would enable Iran to develop the capability to produce fissile material that could be used in nuclear weapons. Iran has produced small quantities of enriched uranium at its pilot fuel enrichment plant at Natanz, but is still some way from mastering the technology. Once it has done so, the time it would require to produce enough highly enriched uranium for a nuclear weapon, should it go down that course, would depend on a variety of factors including the scale and efficiency of the centrifuge cascade being used.</p>
	<p pid="b.1364W.2/3">It is imperative that Iran should take the steps required by the UN Security Council and the IAEA Board, including suspending fully all enrichment related and reprocessing activities. The Security Council made clear in resolution 1737, adopted unanimously on <phrase class="date" code="2006-12-23">23 December 2006</phrase>, that if it failed to do so, the Council would adopt further sanctions. The latest report by the IAEA Director-General on <phrase class="date" code="2007-02-22">22 February</phrase> shows that Iran has failed to do so; we therefore expect to discuss possible measures with other members of the Security Council shortly. We remain committed to a negotiated solution and continue to urge Iran to meet its obligations and return to talks on the basis of the generous proposals presented to Iran on <phrase class="date" code="2006-06-06">6 June 2006</phrase> by EU High Representative Javier Solana.</p>

	<p pid="b.1368W.2/1">Article IX of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) states:</p>
	<p pid="b.1368W.2/2" class="indent">&quot;For the purposes of the Treaty, a nuclear-weapon state is one which has manufactured and exploded a nuclear weapon or other nuclear explosive device prior to <phrase class="date" code="2007-01-01">1 January</phrase>, 1967&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.1368W.2/3">The UK successfully tested its first atomic bomb in October 1952 and is therefore classified as a nuclear weapon state under Article IX of the NPT. The NPT remains the principal source of international legal obligations relating to the possession of nuclear weapons. It is entirely lawful for the UK to possess nuclear weapons.</p>

The men were then flown to the UK on a routine RAF flight. There are no direct flights from Somalia to the UK.

	<p pid="b.1373W.5/1">Islamic terrorist activity in Thailand stems largely from separatist groups in the southern provinces. There have been numerous attacks since 2004, which have been aimed at the majority Buddhist population. As public places are frequently targeted, there is a risk that westerners can get caught up in the violence. Our travel advice is that tourists should avoid all but essential travel through or to the far southern provinces of Thailand. We have a good relationship with the Thai Government on issues relating to counter terrorism and where appropriate we have provided them with advice and assistance to help them combat the terrorist threat.</p>

	<p pid="b.1374W.7/4" class="indent">In the financial year 2006-07: the ongoing fire safety campaign delivered a rise in recognition of the new fire prevention advertising from 27 per cent. in July/August 2006 to 45 per cent. in October/November 2006; the research into the local e-gov advertising campaign showed that 51 per cent.. of those who recognised the campaign intended to visit their local council website in the next 12 months; the campaign to encourage women to apply for posts in the fire and rescue service delivered a 20 per cent. increase in the number of applications from women when the campaign was running; the campaign to inform business of their new responsibilities under the Fire Order Reform delivered a rise in recognition from 14 per cent. in April to 61 per cent. awareness in September 2006; and the home information pack trade sector campaign is delivering over 80 per cent. awareness of the introduction of the packs amongst those in the industry.</p>
	<p pid="b.1374W.7/5">The reduction in the number of fire deaths is also significant, since these are at their lowest since 1959. The most recent figures (for 2005) show a fall of 8 per cent. on the previous year, from 230 to 212. The Fire Kills campaign is one part of the strategy which has achieved this, supporting the proactive community fire safety work of the fire and rescue service at the national level.</p>

	<p pid="b.1380W.0/1">For 2006-08, &pound;3 billion has been allocated to local authorities (LAs) through the General Sure Start Grant (GSSG). LAs have the flexibility to use this funding to create, sustain and support both childminders and childminder networks, as well as other Sure Start activities.</p>
	<p pid="b.1380W.0/2">LAs had similar flexibility in using the &pound;1.2<sup>(1 )</sup>billion GSSG for 2004-06. Included in this allocation was a specific element of funding to support the recruitment and retention of childminders. &pound;4.6 million was spent from this element in 2004-05 only. LAs also spent an additional &pound;0.79 million for childminder start up costs in 2004-05. From April 2005 we increased the flexibilities LAs had in spending the GSSG, which means that data on spend specifically for childminders are not available for 2005-06.</p>
	<p pid="b.1380W.0/3">For 2003-04, the GSSG allocation included specific funding allocations for childminder start up costs, childminder sustainability and childminder networks. LAs were not restricted to these allocations however and had the flexibility to use other elements of the grant to meet local needs. Spend reported against these activities for 2003-04 were &pound;5 million for childminder start up costs, &pound;1.9 million for childminder sustainability and &pound;2.9 million for the creation of childminder networks.</p>

	<p pid="b.1383W.0/1">The Government have no such policy and have received no representations on the subject. Funding is, however, available through the General Sure Start Grant to local authorities to support the sustainability of child care in ways that they consider appropriate.</p>
	<p pid="b.1383W.0/2">Ensuring that child care provision is sustainable and able to meet the needs of parents and children is an important aspect of local authorities' role, and will be vital in relation to their new duty in the Childcare Act 2006 to ensure the sufficiency of child care for working parents. Authorities are free, if they choose, to use some of their General Sure Start Grant funding for business development support and training, in order to ensure that settings are viable over the longer term. This could include support and encouragement in relation to the production of business plans.</p>

	<p pid="b.1383W.3/2">The way in which professionals should inquire into and take action to tackle cases of suspected child abuse or neglect is set out in the core statutory guidance document &quot;Working Together to Safeguard Children&quot;. The Government received representations on these issues during the consultation process carried out in 2005 on draft revised guidance, when 302 written responses were received. Specifically, the consultation asked if social service functions under the Children Act 1989 such as section 47 inquiries should be led by qualified social workers rather than other professionals such as health visitors, teachers, or school nurses. The majority of respondents agreed that section 47 inquiries should be led by qualified social workers rather than other professionals. A substantial majority of respondents also agreed that the Working Together guidance should specify that social workers carrying out section 47 inquiries should be suitably trained and qualified.</p>

	<p pid="b.1384W.2/6" class="indent">I attach the list of the Islamic schools inspected over the last five years. Inspections of non-association independent schools are undertaken by Ofsted at the request of the DfES, which is the registration authority for independent schools. Since September 2003, inspections have been undertaken in accordance with section 162A of the Education Act 2002 (as amended by the Education Act 2005). Those that provide a full assessment of the school's compliance with the statutory regulations for independent schools (made under the provisions of the 2002 Act) are published. Other visits made at the request of the DfES result in advice notes to the DfES which are not published; you would need to contact the DfES if you require these, or details of the action taken as a result of them. Unlike inspections of maintained schools, inspections of independent schools do not result in grades for the school's overall effectiveness, and so we cannot provide such outcomes to you.</p>
	<p pid="b.1384W.2/7" class="indent">The published reports can be found on our website (<a href="http://www.ofsted.gov.uk">www.ofsted.gov.uk</a>) under the section 'Inspection reports', then 'Independent Schools'.</p>

The intention was that the research work would provide background that would assist in the scoping phase of the Panel's work. While the report was not received in time for this, the report contributed to the background information available to the Panel, but as the Panel made clear they did not rely on it in reaching their conclusions.</p>

The data come from cases, instituted by HSE's Field Operations Directorate, which were heard subsequently in magistrates' or Crown courts in each of these years. The range reflects the different circumstances of each case. Some may be relatively simple, whereas others can be very complicated, with complex technical issues, with a number of dutyholders to investigate, and with complex evidential and legal issues to be considered. Necessary and inevitable delays may arise in cases involving deaths, due to the necessity for the police and CPS to investigate and consider possible manslaughter charges, and for an inquest to be arranged and held, before any possible health and safety charges can be taken forward. These delays can be significant.</p>

	<p pid="b.1395W.5/1">HSE has not made any estimate of the number of fatalities and accidents at work involving immigrant workers in the last five years. Available data sources do not allow such estimates to be made.</p>
	<p pid="b.1395W.5/2">However, HSE has published the findings of research on the health and safety of migrant workers in England and Wales. This concluded that migrant workers are at no more risk than any other workers doing the same job. However, migrant workers tend to work in higher-risk sectors of the economy, Since the greatest risk factor for an accident at work is the job workers do, migrant workers as a group face disproportionately higher risks. HSE already targets its activity towards those at greatest risk, which will therefore target migrant workers working in high-risk sectors or occupations.</p>

In order to qualify, they generally must have worked legally for at least 12 months. If eligible for JSA(IB), they may also qualify for housing benefit and council tax benefit.</p>
	<p pid="b.1398W.3/2">A8 and A2 nationals who come to the UK to look for work or who have worked for less than 12 months cannot normally access benefits. This is because their right to reside in the UK is subject to them being self-sufficient.</p>

	<p pid="b.1398W.6/1">We recognise that not only does voluntary work make an invaluable contribution to society and local communities, but it can also help improve an individual's readiness for employment. As long as people continue to satisfy the rules of the benefit, volunteers receiving any benefits can continue to perform their voluntary activity for as many hours as they wish, without affecting their entitlement in any way. Last year we made changes to make it clear that volunteers could be provided with, or expenses for, meals taken away from home while engaged in voluntary work without their benefit being affected.</p>
	<p pid="b.1398W.6/2">Jobseeker's allowance recipients are required to be able to take up employment immediately of up to 40 hours per week. However, there is an exception to this rule for people undertaking voluntary work. Volunteers must be willing and able to take up employment with one week's notice and to attend a job interview within 48 hours. These arrangements allow volunteers to continue to receive benefits while being engaged in voluntary work. Voluntary work is also treated as one of the steps a jobseeker must take to look for work where that improves their chance of securing work.</p>
	<p pid="b.1398W.6/3">Voluntary work will also be appropriate for some claimants of our new employment and support allowance (ESA) and the current rules on voluntary work will be carried forward into both strands of ESA. Voluntary work will count as work-related activity for a customer where it is making it more likely that they will be able to obtain remunerative work in the future.</p>
	<p pid="b.1398W.6/4">Jobseeker's allowance customers on new deal for young people who have not found work by the end of the gateway stage of the programme must enter one of the four mandatory options. One of the four mandatory options available is the voluntary sector option.</p>
	<p pid="b.1398W.6/5">This option offers a combination of job search, high quality work projects and job placements and consists of activities, which deliver benefits to local communities in line with the Government's social policies and objectives.</p>

Bays would only be mixed sex in exceptional circumstances such as Intensive Care Unit/High Dependency Unit beds or to allow a patient to be admitted to a ward rather than wait on a trolley in accident and emergency. In such cases, patients would then be moved to a suitable bed, in either a single sex bed or single sex bay, as soon as practically possible.</p>

After a period of co-existence when both national and European standards can be used, the former will be withdrawn and no longer maintained by BSI. It is important to note that Companies who fail to adopt the structural Eurocodes will inevitably be prejudiced from bidding for European work and unable to tender for projects here in the UK which fall under the Public Contracts Regulations 2006.</p>

	<p pid="b.1408W.6/2">Now that the announcement has been made on the recommended final offer for Corus, the Pension Trustees will be meeting with Tata once again in order to develop the constructive discussions on pensions held earlier in the bidding process. These earlier discussions resulted in a memorandum of understanding on pensions which will need to be looked at in the light of the revised offer. The memorandum includes various commitments to the schemes including security measures to address the financing structure of the takeover arrangements. As regards the Corus Engineering Steels Pension Scheme, Tata has offered to make an immediate cash injection of &pound;126 million to clear the accounting deficit. Normal expectations would be for staged payments over a period of time. On the British Steel scheme, Tata will increase payments from 10 per cent. to 12 per cent. until March 2009.</p>
	<p pid="b.1408W.6/3">During these lengthy discussions, the Trustees have been supported by a team of professional advisers. So far as The Pensions Regulator is concerned, they have been kept closely informed of developments by the Trustees throughout the process.</p>

	<p pid="b.1409W.5/1">The Employment Equality (Age) Regulations 2006 provide an exemption from challenge on age discrimination grounds for employers making redundancy payments under the statutory redundancy scheme, or those who have more generous individual schemes which nevertheless mirror the structure of the statutory scheme. If employers had age discriminatory individual redundancy schemes which did not come within these exemptions, they should either have made the necessary amendments to their schemes or stand ready to justify them in the event of legal challenge. In the period since the Employment Equality (Age) Regulations came into force, we have met the Employers Forum on Age, the Confederation of British Industry and the Engineering Employers Federation to discuss this subject.</p>

This makes it more successful than the previous mechanism, the non fossil fuels obligation, under which the proportion of renewables rose from 0.2 per cent. of electricity sales in 1992 to 1.8 per cent. in 2002. We wish to build on this success with an approach that increases the deployment of renewable generation, maintains investor confidence and increases value for money for the customer.</p>

	<p pid="b.1417W.0/1">Customer reviews are a normal part of the PAYE process. They are needed where either an incorrect amount of tax has been paid or where there are inconsistencies on the record. Such inconsistencies often arise as a result of changes in a taxpayer's circumstances such as moving jobs from one employer to another. This means that pay and tax details cannot be matched automatically to the customer's account so a manual review by our operators is required.</p>
	<p pid="b.1417W.0/2">The number of outstanding customer reviews or 'open cases' therefore shifts on a daily basis as returns come in and are processed or identified for review.

	<p pid="b.1423W.11/1">The Department does not set outcome targets for dentistry for primary care trusts (PCTs). The Department provides strategic health authorities with indicative annual numbers of units of dental activity (which are a weighted measure of courses of treatment) that might be commissioned by PCTs from within their devolved dental allocations, but these are not fixed targets. It is the responsibility of PCTs to agree appropriate service levels for the dental providers in their area, which could include service outputs that cannot be measured through courses of treatment. PCTs are also free to draw upon their wider national health service resources to commission additional dental services if they consider this appropriate in the light of local circumstances and priorities. Full data on the volume of services commissioned by PCTs and the levels delivered by dental providers in 2007-08 will not be available until after the year end.</p>

This guidance advised that health care providers should actively manage the use of radio frequency spectrum on their own sites, and consider the potential effects of communication equipment on all medical devices.</p>
