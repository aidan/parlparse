	<p pid="b.413W.5/1">The UK carries out an annual programme to monitor pesticide residues in food and drink. The purpose of the programme is to: support the statutory approvals process for pesticides by checking that no unexpected residues are occurring; check that residues do not go above statutory maximum residue levels (MRL); and check that the residues in food and drink are within acceptable levels. The sampling is reflective of the food supply chain and in particular the places where people buy food.</p>
	<p pid="b.413W.5/2">This monitoring programme and its results have been overseen by the independent Pesticide Residues Committee from 2000 to <phrase class="date" code="2011-03-31">31 March 2011</phrase>. From <phrase class="date" code="2011-04-01">1 April</phrase> this Committee has been replaced by an Expert Committee of DEFRA, which will carry out the same role of providing scientific and technical advice. The results of the monitoring programme, including full details of the brand-name and manufacturer of each sample taken, and the detailed risk assessments considered by the Committee, are published in quarterly reports. The Committee also publishes an annual report summarising each year's work and giving information on those samples where residues were found above the MRL and on follow-up action taken. These reports are available on the Committee's website.</p>
	<p pid="b.413W.5/3">The monitoring programme indicates that pesticide residues in food are almost always within the MRL limits. These are not safety limits but are set under EC regulation to represent the largest amount of pesticide expected to be found in a crop when it has been treated in accordance with good agricultural practice. Where residues are found, case by case assessment demonstrates that the vast majority involve no risk to consumers. For 2009 (the most recent full year of data), out of 3,835 samples tested 42 (1.1%) contained a residue exceeding the relevant MRL. Seven samples contained residues that could be a risk to health. These were notified to the Food Standards Agency which took action to inform the European Commission under the Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed.</p>
	<p pid="b.413W.5/4">It can be misleading to make simple comparisons of the annual survey results as different foods are tested each year, analytical capability increases over time (so more pesticides can be tested for at lower levels), and the statutory MRLs change to reflect changing agricultural practice.</p>

As part of the Waste Policy Review we are looking at how we can support councils to reward householders for recycling. A number of local authorities have entered into contracts with Recyclebank to provide rewards for recycling, and we support them taking this initiative. It is for individual local authorities to decide whether a reward scheme is appropriate in their area and what type it should be.</p>

	<p pid="b.417W.11/1">The Ministry of Defence has always been clear that the Strategic Defence and Security Review (SDSR) was the start of a process and that there were still difficult decisions that would need to be taken as it was implemented as a result of the situation inherited from the previous Labour Government. We will also need to ensure that for usual budgetary purposes&#8212;due to changes such as fuel prices, foreign exchange, inflation, changes in valuations in our estate, and armed forces pay awards&#8212;that we match our resources to our highest priorities. This we do on an annual basis utilising the Department's Planning Round process. I will make a statement to the House on the progress of implementing the SDSR and the Department's finances shortly.</p>

It is not the practice of the Government to make public details of all discussions with foreign Governments and I am therefore withholding further details as this would, or would be likely to, prejudice relations between the UK and other states.</p>

This details the information that should be placed on the front and the back of a badge. The information that is included on the back is personal and many blue badge users do not want this on display, including overnight in some parking bays, for personal security reasons. The badge clearly indicates the side that should be displayed in the vehicle.</p>
	<p pid="b.419W.15/2">I plan shortly to bring forward legislative amendments to the badge design to make it harder to copy and to forge. One of these amendments will require the badge number and the expiry date to be included on both sides of the badge.

The guidance is due to be reviewed in the future to ensure that it continues to be useful to local authorities in assessing applicants against the disability eligibility criteria defined in legislation.

Following public consultation in 2005, a modular qualification approach enabling new drivers to obtain their driving licence and DCPC as part of the same process was adopted to allow maximum flexibility for those caught by the new requirements. This effectively harmonised the requirements of licence acquisition driver testing with the requirements for DCPC.</p>

	<p pid="b.425W.5/2">We are continuing to invest across the UK rail network, with around &#163;14 billion planned to be spent within this spending review period to 2014-15 to enlarge capacity and improve performance.</p>
	<p pid="b.425W.5/3">We will provide 650 additional carriages by 2014 to meet the rising peak demand in our major cities and on our long distance routes. Platforms are already being lengthened and stations enhanced for this. We will electrify routes in the North West and the Great Western Main Line to Cardiff by 2017 and expect to buy new Intercity Express Trains for the latter and for the East Coast Main Line. We are going ahead with the Crossrail and Thameslink projects which will provide substantial extra capacity into London from all four points of the compass by 2019. Only last month the Chancellor of the Exchequer announced a further &#163;200 million for railway improvements in the regions including the Ordsall Chord in Manchester and the redoubling of the Swindon-Kemble route in the south-west.</p>
	<p pid="b.425W.5/4">However, the single biggest contributor of additional capacity to the rail network would be the proposed High Speed 2 network which would transform capacity between Britain's major cities, providing approximately 230,000 seats per day on the new line in Phase 1, rising to more than 500,000 seats per day once the second phase to Manchester and Leeds is operational, as well as releasing capacity for regional, commuter and freight services on existing lines.</p>

Termination benefits include the costs of severance payments and redundancy payments including employer costs of redundancy retirement. This amounted to &#163;266,000 for strategic health authorities, &#163;6,825,000 for primary care trusts and &#163;15,142,000 for NHS trusts. Date is not available for NHS foundation trusts.</p>

	<p pid="b.438W.14/1">Subject to the passage of the Health Bill through Parliament, general practitioners (GPs) will be given real responsibility to ensure that commissioning decisions are underpinned by clinical insight and knowledge of local healthcare needs. GPs, in partnership with other local healthcare professionals such as therapists and community nurses, are best placed to understand the health needs of local populations and how to work with their local populations to design services that meet those needs.</p>
	<p pid="b.438W.14/2">The GP role is particularly prominent for people with long-term conditions, and in helping patients to access wider or more specialised national health service services through the thousands of referral decisions they make on a daily basis. The quality and availability of primary care services also has a wider impact on accident and emergency attendances and emergency admissions. GP Commissioning should also provide consortia with incentives to invest in interventions in community based services that keep people healthier for longer and prevent or delay treatment that is more expensive.</p>

	<p pid="b.440W.2/1">The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) considered the cost-effectiveness of a human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination programme against cervical cancer, which included assessment of the impact of vaccination on genital warts. A summary of the evidence considered is set out In the JCVI statement on HPV vaccines that is published at:</p>

	<p pid="b.440W.2/3">A copy of the JCVI statement has been placed in the Library, The cost-effectiveness study produced by the Health Protection Agency (HPA) used by the JCVI was published in the <i> British Medical Journal</i> in July 2008:</p>

	<p pid="b.440W.2/5">This cost-effectiveness paper did not specifically report what proportion of genital warts cases in women or men aged under 25 would be prevented by using a quadrivalent HPV vaccine in the national HPV immunisation programme and catch-up programme.</p>
	<p pid="b.440W.2/6">The HPA in the modelling paper noted on the epidemiological impact of vaccination-that the</p>
	<p pid="b.440W.2/7" class="indent">'model results predict that vaccinating 12 year old girls in a screened population at 80% coverage with a quadrivalent human papillomavirus vaccine that protects for an average of 20 years reduces the incidence of cervical cancer by 24-93% and anogenital warts by 22-100% after 100 years of an ongoing vaccination programme. Catch-up campaigns reduce incidence in the first 30 years of vaccination but have little effect beyond that. Extending vaccination to boys provides only a small additional reduction in incidence of cervical cancer and anogenital warts, with the greatest benefit when the duration of vaccine protection is short.'</p>
	<p pid="b.440W.2/8">In 2010, the Department commissioned an update to the cost-effectiveness study. This study is taking into account new data on the potential protection provided by the HPV vaccines against cancer and non-cancer diseases, including genital warts. The study, which has not yet been published by the HPA, will support the next procurement exercise for the HPV immunisation programme in 2011.</p>

	<p pid="b.443W.2/1">The Government launched the Independent Public Service Pension Commission chaired by Lord Hutton, last June to conduct a fundamental structural review of public service pension provision which produced its final report in March 2011.</p>
	<p pid="b.443W.2/2">Ahead of the spending review, Lord Hutton produced an interim report which found that the value of public service pensions has been increasing following dramatic increase in life expectancy at retirement. Current pensioners are expected to spend over 40% of their adult lives in retirement, compared to 30% for pensioners in the 1950s. Most of these extra costs have fallen to employers and taxpayers.</p>
	<p pid="b.443W.2/3">In this report the Commission concluded that there is a clear rationale for public servants to make a greater contribution if their pensions are to remain fair to taxpayers and employees, and affordable for the country. At the spending review, in response to Lord Hutton's interim report and to ensure a fairer distribution of cost between taxpayers and scheme members, the Government announced that they would implement progressive changes to the level of employee contributions to public service pensions that lead to an additional saving of &#163;1.8 billion a year from 2014-15, to be phased in from 2012-13. This is equivalent to three percentage point increase on average.</p>
	<p pid="b.443W.2/4">Public service pension schemes are not trust based and so do not have trustees, however the Government are committed to engaging with trade unions and other groups to discuss implementation of this policy. In these discussions the Government have confirmed their commitment to the changes being progressive, and that low earners should be protected.</p>

All operational procurement decisions are matters for the ODA, and not for departmental Ministers. The ODA adheres to the Government Buying Standards for Cleaning Products and Services. It promotes and encourages environmental awareness and requires contractors to meet various environmental criteria through its procurement procedures.</p>
	<p pid="b.448W.8/2">The London Organising Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games (LOCOG) is the private company responsible for staging the 2012 Games. It is currently procuring for cleaning and waste contractors for London 2012 venues. Within the tender process, potential contractors will provide details of which cleaning and consumable products they propose to use at Games-time. LOCOG is not imposing any single mandatory labelling scheme, but sustainability of products and services will be a key component of the assessment. All supplier materials need to adhere to LOCOG's Sustainable Sourcing Code.</p>
	<p pid="b.448W.8/3">Within the Department EU Ecolabel products are not currently used, instead our facilities contractor use super concentrated cleaning products which are diluted on site. This enables less packaging and fewer deliveries, thus reducing our carbon footprint. All kitchens within the Department use 'Ecover' washing up liquid. The Department will discuss with the facilities management supplier the possibility of using EU Ecolabel products in the future.</p>

Ofcom has investigated 219 incidents, with one still to resolve, but has not concluded that PLT products fail to comply with the essential requirements of the EMC Regulations. The essential requirements require that equipment shall be designed and manufactured, having regard to the state of the art and good engineering practice, so as to ensure that the electromagnetic disturbance generated does not exceed the level above which radio and telecommunications equipment or other equipment cannot operate as intended.</p>
	<p pid="b.449W.5/4">The technical solution to ensure the essential requirements of the Regulations are met will vary with the state of the art, latest good engineering practice, extent of knowledge and similar variables and no revision of the technical requirement is currently foreseen.</p>

Different professional groups also have different training and development requirements. The Commission only has staff meetings where there is a specific business purpose. The purpose may be to review strategy, decide on and disseminate the business plan for the year, improve communications, improve organisational cohesion, address a specific operational issue, or for training and development, including keeping up-to-date with developments in and government policies for health, housing, local government and police authorities.

The costs for training events or staff meetings include room hire, food and beverages, equipment hire and delegate rates. The Commission's long-standing policy is that external venues should only be booked if meeting rooms on Commission premises are either unavailable or unsuitable, for example they cannot accommodate the numbers involved. Pressure on Commission rooms has eased since last May with the abolition of Comprehensive Area Assessment and the ending of other inspection programmes with a consequent reduction of some 600 staff employed by the Commission.</p>

The Fire Kills campaign has for some time conducted high profile campaigns promoting smoke alarms and maintenance messages.</p>

	<p pid="b.474W.0/1">Following publication of The Office of Fair Trading's (OFT) compliance review findings report in September 2010 and its warning to 129 debt management firms, 42 debt firms have surrendered their licences, action has been taken to revoke licences in 10 cases (two companies have subsequently surrendered their licences), four are under further investigation and 75 further cases are currently in the process of being reviewed.</p>
	<p pid="b.474W.0/2">The review process is ongoing and the OFT will be in contact with each of the 75 businesses to discuss its analysis. Those who fail to meet compliance standards may also find themselves subject to licensing action, and where enforcement action is taken, the OFT will announce this in the usual way.</p>

	<p pid="b.474W.3/1">All who provide debt management services are required to be licensed under the Consumer Credit Act 1974. The Office of Fair Trading (OFT) has a duty to ensure that applicants for licences are fit to engage in the activities for which they wish to be licensed, and to monitor the continuing fitness of those to whom licences have been granted. Where the OFT has evidence of unfair practices, action can be taken to refuse or revoke or place conditions on the consumer credit licence of those concerned.</p>
	<p pid="b.474W.3/2">The OFT's Debt Management Guidance sets out minimum standards for debt management companies in the marketing of their services, pre-contract contact, the provision of pre-contract information, contract terms, advice and the nature of the debt management service provided. The OFT take enforcement action where it has evidence that licensees are acting in breach of this guidance. As part of the OFT's compliance strategy for this sector it will also issue a revised version of the guidance for consultation in the summer, which will provide additional clarification on unfair practices.</p>

	<p pid="b.486W.5/1">The Government published an impact assessment alongside the &quot;Resolving Workplace Disputes&quot; consultation on <phrase class="date" code="2011-01-27">27 January</phrase>. This set out the major evidence underpinning the proposals, and is available at:</p>
	<p pid="b.486W.5/2" class="indent"><a href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/assets/biscore/employment-matters/docs/r/11-512-resolving-workplace-disputes-impact-assessment.pdf">www.bis.gov.uk/assets/biscore/employment-matters/docs/r/11-512-resolving-workplace-disputes-impact-assessment.pdf</a></p>
	<p pid="b.486W.5/3">On the specific areas, application of the Employment Tribunal (ET) Rules of Procedure is a matter of judicial discretion, and will vary depending on the particulars of each case. In 2009 the Department for Ministry of Justice (MoJ) jointly invited the former Employment Tribunal System Steering Board to consider whether there were issues of inconsistent application of practice and procedure across the system; we have published their report alongside the &quot;Resolving Workplace Disputes&quot; consultation, and have included some of the recommendations made within the package of proposals we are consulting on. We have received comments from various stakeholders related to consistency, considered them in the context of developing our consultation proposals and will be evaluating those further as part of the continuing process.</p>
	<p pid="b.486W.5/4">This Department has not commissioned any research in relation to case management training of ET Chairs. My officials hold regular discussions with the judiciary, facilitated through HM Court Service and the Tribunal Service /MoJ, as well as speaking to stakeholders more widely, on issues such as this.</p>
	<p pid="b.486W.5/5">As part of the impact assessment supporting the &quot;Resolving Workplace Disputes&quot; consultation we estimated the average (median) unit costs to employers and claimants of employment tribunal hearings at &#163;3,800 and &#163;1,500 respectively. The estimates were based on information from the Survey of Employment Tribunal Applicants commissioned by this Department in 2008:</p>

	<p pid="b.497W.6/16">The Department invited proposals from the voluntary sector to encourage couples to take up preventative support to develop and sustain their relationship and, where relationship breakdown does occur, to put in place effective parenting arrangements so that any negative impacts for children are minimised. The areas of work for which proposals were invited included: cultural change to encourage families to seek help earlier; training of key practitioners, particularly in Sure Start Children's Centres, to recognise and respond appropriately to relationship distress in order to minimise any negative impacts for children; evaluation of effective practice to build the evidence-base of effective interventions; and innovative approaches to relationship support-including provision of relationship support which meets the needs of those lower-income families who might struggle to pay and who are at most risk from breakdown.</p>
	<p pid="b.497W.6/17">Service delivery will be monitored through key performance indicators. In addition the Department plans to commission evaluation which will consider the effectiveness of relationship support interventions.</p>
	<p pid="b.497W.6/18">All of the services funded by the relationships support grant are expected to make their provision accessible to black and minority ethnic couples. In addition the Asian Family Counselling Service (AFCS) has been funded to provide counselling and support to members of the Asian community whose relationships are under stress and who find it hard to access mainstream services.</p>

	<p pid="b.498W.2/2">The Secretary of State for Education and his ministerial team have ongoing discussions with colleagues at the Department of Health about areas of common interest school nurses are employed by the national health service and currently provide a number of services. These include carrying out developmental screening, undertaking health interviews, administering immunisation programmes, and providing health and sex education within schools.</p>
	<p pid="b.498W.2/3">Schools have long valued the contribution school nurses make to the health, well being, and achievement of the children and young people in their care. The school nursing service can have a pivotal role in both providing and arranging specific training for schools in the management of long-term conditions, for example asthma and diabetes.</p>
	<p pid="b.498W.2/4">It is currently for primary care trusts (PCTs) and their partners to determine, on the basis of a local health needs assessment, how many school nurses there should be and how they should be deployed. The Government wants to increase local flexibility, and therefore has no plans to change these-arrangements.</p>

	<p pid="b.499W.2/1">Sure Start children's centres are at the heart of the Government's vision for supporting families with young children and intervening early to prevent problems from becoming crises. The Government have ensured there is enough money in the system to maintain a network of Sure Start children's centres.</p>
	<p pid="b.499W.2/2">The Department for Education collects data on the number of Sure Start children's centres in each local authority area in England, but does not collect data on local authority plans for changes to children's centres. It is for local authorities, in consultation with local communities, to determine the most effective way of delivering future services to meet local need. Local authorities continue to have duties under the Childcare Act 2006 to ensure sufficient provision of children's centres, so far as is reasonably practicable, and to consult before opening, closing or significantly changing children's centres.</p>

	<p pid="b.499W.5/1">In her response to the hon. Member's previous question, the Minister for Children and Families said that wards with high rates of teenage pregnancies were found in virtually every local authority in England. We do not classify wards by their rate, but would regard a high rate ward as being one of the 20% of wards with the highest rates. In 2006-08 this means wards with a rate of at least 53.1 conceptions per 1,000 women aged 15-17.</p>
	<p pid="b.499W.5/2">The Office for National Statistics (ONS) produces statistics on conceptions, which are estimates based on the number of live births, stillbirths and legal abortions, but not including miscarriages and illegal abortions. Ward under-18 conceptions data are not publicly available, to protect the privacy of individuals. However, under a Service Level Agreement (SLA) between ONS and my Department, local authorities in England can request ward level under-18 conception figures, aggregated over three years, from ONS to enable them to target their early intervention services to prevent teenage pregnancies in the areas with the highest rates. This information enables local areas to plan their approaches to reducing teenage pregnancies which they are best placed to determine.</p>
	<p pid="b.499W.5/3">The list names all those wards in England where in 2006-08:</p>
	<p pid="b.499W.5/4" class="indent">the ward was one of the 20% of wards with the highest rates (a rate of at least 53.1 conceptions per 1,000 women aged 15-17);</p>
	<p pid="b.499W.5/5">and in addition</p>
	<p pid="b.499W.5/6" class="indent">the rate was statistically significantly higher than the England average (41.0 conceptions per 1,000 women aged 15-17). This is to exclude wards where the rate is based on a very small number of conceptions where the rate may change considerably from year to year.</p>
	<p pid="b.499W.5/7">Wards defined as being &quot;high rate&quot; are found in nearly all top-tier local authorities (138 out of 152).</p>
	<p pid="b.499W.5/8">I will place a copy in the House Libraries.</p>
	<p pid="b.499W.5/9">As some wards have very small populations of women in the 15-17 age group, their under 18 conception rates can fluctuate by chance from year to year and may not indicate a consistently high incidence of teenage pregnancy. For this reason, ward rates are aggregated over three years. Ward population estimates, which are used in the calculation of ward-level conception statistics, are also experimental statistics and as such have not yet been assessed against the rigorous quality standards normally applying to National Statistics. The estimates are made available to users as the best population estimates for these small geographical areas and to allow user feedback on the quality of the statistics.</p>
	<p pid="b.499W.5/10">Further information about conception statistics produced by ONS can be found on their website at:</p>

	<p pid="b.500W.2/2"><i> </i>The voluntary and community sector plays, and will continue to play, a significant role in delivering and improving services for children, young people and families. Through the grants programme announced on <phrase class="date" code="2011-02-25">25 February</phrase> DFE will invest around &#163;120 million over the next two years to help support the delivery of key national priorities for children, young people and families. This grant is just one of a range of funding streams from DFE to the voluntary sector and represents a significant investment in a tough financial climate.</p>
	<p pid="b.500W.2/3">Following an open competition, 118 bidders were successful with their applications and grants have been awarded from <phrase class="date" code="2011-04-01">1 April 2011</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.500W.2/4">As expected, the bidding process was highly competitive and the total amounts of funding bid for by organisations significantly exceeded the level of funding available. We therefore had to make tough decisions in order to live within the available funding and this inevitably led to a need to scale back some of the successful bids to ensure the best use of public funding. In a very small number of cases, we awarded more funding to organisations than they requested in their bid document in order to secure additional high quality provision to meet national priorities. We also undertook an equality impact assessment to ensure that our funding decisions did not impact disproportionately on children, young people and families in respect of gender, ethnicity and special educational needs and disabilities.</p>
	<p pid="b.500W.2/5">Information on how much funding was bid for by these organisations at each stage of competition and the amount of indicative awards is provided in the following table. Please note that final negotiations are still taking place and indicative amounts may vary slightly from the final amount awarded.</p>

	<p pid="b.509W.9/1">The objective of EU Careers month was to increase awareness of opportunities in the EU Civil Service and increase the number of applications from key target groups of UK nationals to the EU's recruitment competitions. It was the start of what must be a multiannual campaign if we are to stand any chance of redressing the declining number of UK nationals entering the EU Institutions. The campaign achieved some measure of success. In this year's main graduate selection procedure, which closed on <phrase class="date" code="2011-04-14">14 April 2011</phrase>, the UK saw the largest proportional increase in numbers of applicants of all the member states, through a rise from 1.5% in 2010 to 2.4%. In the last week of the registration period the EU Careers Month's webpages were the third largest external referrers to the European Personnel Selection Office's landing pages-behind only Google and Facebook. The next measure of success is whether we have succeeded in attracting the right applicants. Evidence for this will come later in the year when we hear how many have been successful in the first assessment phase. On that basis we will re-assess the campaign.</p>

	<p pid="b.511W.6/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="b.511W.6/2">As the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the EU does not create any new justiciable rights or change the current status of EU fundamental rights as they already apply in EU law, the Government do not believe it would be a cost effective use of resources to assess the proportion of UK residents that do not feel well informed about the Charter.</p>
	<p pid="b.511W.6/3">The Charter and the Lisbon treaty have not changed the content or effect of EU fundamental rights as they apply in EU law. It has long been recognised that fundamental rights, as guaranteed by the European Court of Human Rights and as they result from the constitutional traditions common to the member states, constitute general principles of EU law (as confirmed by Article 6 (3) TEU). The Charter and the Lisbon treaty do not give the European Court of Justice or national courts any new powers to strike down national laws and practices for breaching fundamental rights. Furthermore, the UK is required to comply with the fundamental rights restated in the Charter only when it is giving effect to EU law, reflecting the long-standing case law of the European Court of Justice. These limits on the effects of the Charter are confirmed by both Protocol No 30 to the treaties and the terms of the Charter and the treaties themselves.</p>

	<p pid="b.514W.2/1">&#163;9 million was made available for the Office for Civil Society's Strategic Partners Transition programme (&#163;4 million in 2011-12; &#163;3 million in 2012-13; and &#163;2 million in 2013-14). After an intensive selection process, a very small proportion of the total &#163;9 million available remains unallocated-around 8%. The unallocated amounts are: &#163;324,161 in 2011-12; &#163;243,121 in 2012-13; and &#163;162,080 in 2013-14.</p>
	<p pid="b.514W.2/2">I do not intend to use these amounts to fund organisations selected to be strategic partners as part of the programme running until 2015. I am currently considering the best use of this unallocated funding and there are a number of pressing priorities. I am keen to work with some unsuccessful interviewees on what big society policies and programmes mean for some of the groups they represent. Any commissions to these groups would be carried out this year.</p>
