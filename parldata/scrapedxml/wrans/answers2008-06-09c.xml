	<p pid="c.1W.3/1">In May 2007 Malalai Joya was suspended for three years (until the end of the legislative term) by her peers in the Afghan parliament for contravening Article 70 of the Afghan parliament's rules of procedure. Article 70 states that members of parliament who insult others are subject to disciplinary action. Action was taken against Ms Joya after a media interview in which she said that the Afghan parliament was worse than a 'stable or zoo'. Ms Joya has the right to challenge the decision and has indicated her intention to do so. Together with EU partners, we regularly raise the issue of freedom of expression in Afghanistan and look forward to Ms Joya and the Afghan parliament resolving this internal parliamentary issue.</p>

We are discussing DFID's contribution for 2008-09 with TBBC and Christian Aid, through which this funding is channelled. DFID also provides support from within Burma to people living in and near conflict and ceasefire areas in the border regions, many of whom have been displaced. In all, about 20 per cent. of DFID's regular programme of assistance for Burma (which is doubling from &pound;9 million in 2007-09 to &pound;18 million in 2010-11) benefits people in areas affected by conflict. The &pound;17 million which DFID has pledged so far in emergency assistance following Cyclone Nargis is additional to the regular programme.</p>

	<p pid="c.10W.2/2">The Government of Yemen (GoY) has not published overall donor disbursement figures for the period since the Yemen CG meeting. The most complete and recent data shows donor disbursements of $292.18 million to Yemen for calendar year 2007. This does not cover all those donors who made pledges at the CG meeting notably Arab donors who made significant pledges. All donor funds pledged were multi-annual and spread over several years so we would not expect full disbursement at this stage.</p>
	<p pid="c.10W.2/3">The UK continues to support GoY efforts to encourage donors to disburse their pledges against agreed timetables through our ongoing engagement in GoY-donor dialogue, for example, the twice yearly 'Consultative Group Stocktake Meetings'. The UK has played a particular role in encouraging greater dialogue between Arab donors and OECD donors to promote all donors to deliver their CG pledge commitments. We are supporting the Aid Harmonisation and Alignment (AHA) Unit within the Ministry of Planning and International Co-operation which leads on Consultative Group pledge follow-up within its broader mandate to promote greater aid effectiveness in Yemen.</p>

However it contains no specific targets for 2008. A mid point review of the SEDPPR is due to be completed by September 2008, and will show whether Yemen is on track to meet its 2010 targets.</p>
	<p pid="c.12W.5/2">The UK helped to fund a poverty assessment based on a household budget survey which was undertaken in 2005-06 by the Government of Yemen, the World Bank and the United Nations Development Programme&mdash; UNDP. This assessment demonstrated that poverty rates have declined from 40.1 per cent. in 1998 to 34.8 per cent. in 2005. However recent World Bank figures estimate that these gains may have been fully reversed due to inflation and high food prices.</p>

	<p pid="c.14W.10/1">There will be five permanent venues in the Olympic Park: the Olympic Stadium, Aquatics Centre, Handball Arena, the VeloPark and Eton Manor.</p>
	<p pid="c.14W.10/2">The Olympic Stadium is being constructed by Team McAlpine, a consortium made up of Sir Robert McAlpine, HOK Sport and Buro Happold, and the budget&mdash;as announced in October 2007&mdash;remains at the contract price &pound;496 million. This venue will host all Olympic and Paralympic track and field events as well as being the finish point for the Marathon and the start and finish points for the Racewalk. Construction of the Olympic Stadium commenced in May 2008.</p>
	<p pid="c.14W.10/3">The Aquatics Centre is being constructed by UK firm Balfour Beatty and the budget, as announced in April, is &pound;242 million. The venue will host Olympic swimming, diving, synchronized swimming, modern pentathlon swimming events and Paralympic swimming events. Planning permission has been granted for the Aquatics Centre. Balfour Beatty took possession of the site in June 2008 and construction work is on track to commence in the next two months.</p>
	<p pid="c.14W.10/4">The Handball Arena will host handball events, as well as modern pentathlon fencing during the Olympic Games and goalball events during the Paralympic Games. The budget for the Handball Arena is in line with the overall venues budget already announced but further budget details cannot be released as sensitive commercial negotiations continue. The Olympic Delivery Authority expects to appoint a contractor for the Handball Arena in early 2009, ready for construction to start in the summer of 2009.</p>
	<p pid="c.14W.10/5">The Eton Manor site will host the Paralympic archery and wheelchair tennis events programme and provide athletes training facilities during the Games. As a contractor is yet to be appointed, budget details for this venue cannot yet be released but it remains within the budget for venues already announced. Stanton Williams were awarded the contract to design the venue in April 2008 and construction is due to begin in early 2010.</p>
	<p pid="c.14W.10/6">The VeloPark, of which the Velodrome is the main component, will host the Olympic and Paralympic indoor track cycling events and the adjacent BMX circuit will host the BMX events. The budget for the VeloPark is &pound;80 million. A consortium made up of Hopkins Architects, Expedition Engineering, BDSP and Grant Associates has been chosen to design the VeloPark and construction is due to begin in 2009. The contract for the Velodrome was awarded to ISG InteriorExterior in May 2008.</p>
	<p pid="c.14W.10/7">A number of sports, including basketball, waterpolo, wheelchair basketball and wheelchair rugby, will take place in temporary venues on the Olympic Park. The budgets for these facilities are included in the venues budget as announced at the end of 2007 and building contractors have yet to be appointed.</p>
	<p pid="c.14W.10/8">LOCOG '-London Organising Committee of the Olympic Games and Paralympic Games-' have responsibility for the construction of a temporary hockey centre on the Olympic Park that will host hockey and paralympic football competitions.</p>

However, within a fortnight of my appointment as Secretary of State, I, together with my ministerial team hosted a breakfast seminar to which representatives from all of the Department's non-departmental public bodies were invited. In addition, since I have been Secretary of State, Ministers from this Department have met with representatives from the majority of our non-departmental public bodies and hope to meet with the remainder in the near future.</p>

	<p pid="c.21W.2/3" class="indent">In reply to your recent Parliamentary Question about the Child Support Agency, the Secretary of State promised a substantive reply from the Chief Executive. As the Chief Executive is currently on annual leave, I am responding, with his authority, on his behalf.</p>
	<p pid="c.21W.2/4" class="indent">You asked the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions what the average length of a repayment schedule agreed with the Child Support Agency is.</p>
	<p pid="c.21W.2/5" class="indent">Robust information on the length of arrears repayment schedules is not held centrally and to obtain it would involve additional examination of all relevant cases. The information required to answer this question cannot therefore be obtained without incurring disproportionate cost.</p>
	<p pid="c.21W.2/6" class="indent">The Agency has introduced tougher enforcement measures through its Operational Improvement Plan, launched in April 2006. If the Agency cannot secure immediate repayment in full from the non-resident parent, it aims to reach agreements that will see arrears paid back within two years wherever possible.</p>
	<p pid="c.21W.2/7" class="indent">The Agency collected or arranged more than &pound;1 billion in maintenance in the twelve months to March 2008, of which &pound;126m was arrears. This is almost twice the &pound;68 million of arrears collected in the year to March 2006 before the full introduction of the Operational Improvement Plan.</p>

	<p pid="c.21W.5/2">Our priority is to increase take-up of council tax benefit (CTB) by pensioners.</p>
	<p pid="c.21W.5/3">People applying for pension credit by telephone can access CTB (and housing benefit) at the same time, using a shortened three-page claim form which is completed for them during the phone call. Customers only have to provide information once. The income and savings information supplied for the pension credit application is used for the CTB claim.</p>
	<p pid="c.21W.5/4">From October 2008, we will dispense with even the short claim form for claims made in this way. The Pension, Disability and Carers Service will collect the CTB claim information and pass it direct to the local authority for assessment.</p>
	<p pid="c.21W.5/5">The Department for Work and Pensions has also run promotional campaigns in each of the last five years to increase awareness of CTB. In March 2008, regional press advertising was used to promote uptake of CTB, with greater focus in areas where our data suggests take up may be low. We also provided marketing materials promoting CTB to local authorities to be included in council tax bills.</p>

This is something which falls within the responsibilities delegated to me as Chief Executive of Jobcentre Plus.</p>
	<p pid="c.22W.5/4" class="indent">Jobcentre Plus has undergone significant transformation over the last 5 years. During this transformation our approach to closure of a customer-facing Jobcentre Plus office has been to take into account, for example, the impact closure may have on customer service, whether the work and staff can be relocated and what the savings might be in relation to the costs of closure. Consultation with local stakeholders is an integral part of the planning process and we are committed to full consultation with our customers, partner organisations, Local Authorities, Trade Unions and staff, and local Members of Parliament in advance of implementing site closures.</p>
	<p pid="c.22W.5/5" class="indent">I attach a list of Jobcentre Plus offices that received ministerial approval for closure following consultation and a copy has been placed in the Library. The list includes the relevant Local Authorities consulted.</p>

Guidance requires the decision-maker in a case to judge whether the planning applicant has successfully argued that &quot;very special circumstances&quot; would justify an exceptional grant of planning permission in green belt.</p>
	<p pid="c.28W.3/2">The courts have directed that the words &quot;very special circumstances&quot; be given their ordinary and natural meaning, and it is for each applicant to demonstrate their existence to the local planning authority in relation to the individual circumstances of their case.

	<p pid="c.36W.2/1">The Department for Transport makes a judgment about the appropriate length of each franchise while the specification is being developed. The key factors will usually be milestones in the wider franchising programme, and the impact of any major rail projects. The new South Central franchise is planned as a five-year, 10-month franchise, ending in July 2015, with a further possible two-year extension at the department's discretion. This gives maximum flexibility to the Department to align the end dates of the Thameslink Greater Northern and South Central franchises with the completion of major infrastructure work on the Thameslink Programme, and any major franchise remapping that may result.</p>
	<p pid="c.36W.2/2">The Department consulted franchise owning-groups on the length of the South Central franchise. Responses were mixed, with some preferring a short franchise with relatively high levels of certainty about the outputs, and others preferring a longer franchise, where the impact of the Thameslink Programme on the business would be dealt with as the franchise progressed.</p>
	<p pid="c.36W.2/3">Franchise length is decided on a case-by-case basis. However recent franchises have generally been around seven to 10 years in length, with the last part of the franchise dependent on achieving performance targets. This is a balance: it provides operators with an incentive to plan in the medium term, but allows the Department to return regularly to the market to seek value for the taxpayer and further improvements for passengers.</p>

	<p pid="c.36W.5/1">The Department has not carried out a formal assessment of this kind. In our view any such analysis would be inconclusive, as there is no clear way to isolate the effect of franchise length.

	<p pid="c.38W.2/2">No. This would not be sensible as we are seeking to reduce emissions across the economy not just within road transport. Stern highlights the need for flexibility to take action where it costs least to ensure the cost of mitigation is manageable. Imposing targets for particular sub-sectors will reduce those flexibilities and increase costs.</p>
	<p pid="c.38W.2/3">In the carbon budgets, to be established under the Climate Change Bill, the UK's emissions will be split into those sectors of the economy that participate in emissions trading schemes (the traded sector) and those that do not (the non-traded sector). A similar approach has been proposed by the European Commission in order to meet the EU's 2020 greenhouse gas reduction targets. The European Commission has proposed a 16 per cent. reduction target over 2005 levels for the UK's non-traded sector.</p>
	<p pid="c.38W.2/4">About half the UK's emissions are in the non-traded sector. Over half of these are from transport, with most of the remainder coming from domestic heating. Under the EU proposal and the UK's own carbon budgeting system, the level of effort for emissions reduction will be set for the whole non-traded sector. This will cover all of the UK's road transport emissions.</p>

	<p pid="c.39W.0/77">The DCSF national estimates for 16 to 18 NEET cannot be disaggregated to regional level. Local figures are usually estimated using the Connexions Service's data system, the Client Caseload Information System. However, since this data is not available for the 19 to 24 group, or for 1997, estimates derived purely from the LFS are provided here.</p>
	<p pid="c.39W.0/78">It is important to note that as with all survey estimates, these estimates from the LFS are subject to sampling error. Nationally, the margin of error around the LFS 16 to 18 NEET estimate is around +/- 1.4 per cent., and when broken down by region and gender, the margin of error will be much larger. The figures should, therefore, be treated with caution.</p>

	<p pid="c.43W.6/2">Alcohol consumption is one of the key factors associated with young people committing offences as well as being victims of crime, and is an important focus of the Youth Alcohol Action Plan the Government published on <phrase class="date" code="2008-06-02">2 June 2008</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="c.43W.6/3">Parents are a crucial influence over young people's attitudes and behaviours towards alcohol. This is why the Youth Alcohol Action Plan drives forward actions to develop a partnership with parents on young people and alcohol.</p>
	<p pid="c.43W.6/4">As part of the Action Plan, we will be issuing guidance to parents around young people and alcohol as well as targeting them with a communications campaign which aims to equip them with the knowledge they need to guide their children towards low-risk drinking.</p>
	<p pid="c.43W.6/5">The Action Plan also sets out measures to tackle young people drinking in public places&mdash;particularly when this is associated with antisocial behaviour.</p>

	<p pid="c.44W.2/1">The Government's 10-year childcare strategy, Choice for parents, the best start for children, aims to ensure that every child gets the best start in life and that parents have more choice about how to balance work and family life. It will help to reduce child poverty and the achievement gap between the most disadvantaged children and their peers.</p>
	<p pid="c.44W.2/2">The strategy will transform services by creating a strong, multi-agency, high quality universal infrastructure for all young children and families, but with additional help and support targeted on disadvantaged families who benefit most from high quality early years and childcare provision.</p>
	<p pid="c.44W.2/3">Just a third of the way into the Strategy, we are ahead of schedule in establishing a new infrastructure. 2,907 multi-agency Sure Start Children's Centres have opened, offering services to over 2.2 million young children and their families. Almost all of those living in disadvantaged communities now have access to one. There are over 10,500 extended schools (two in five of the total) delivering access to the full core offer with many more schools delivering parts of the offer. 95 per cent. of three and four-year-olds are taking up the free part-time early education entitlement and some 13,000 disadvantaged two-year-olds in 32 local authorities have benefited from access to free early education. The assessments of childcare sufficiency that all local authorities have completed under the Childcare Act 2006 have given them a clear idea of the demand for childcare in their areas, its supply and any gaps between the two, to meet their duty of securing sufficient childcare for working parents.</p>
	<p pid="c.44W.2/4">We regularly evaluate the effectiveness of our policies through research and have a number of ongoing evaluations and data collections to monitor progress and inform the development of new policies. The latest National Evaluation of Sure Start research, published on <phrase class="date" code="2008-03-04">4 March</phrase>, highlighted very clearly that Sure Start programmes are having a positive impact in some of the country's most disadvantaged communities, improving young children's development and strengthening the skills of parents so that they can provide a better home learning environment, helping prepare children to do well at school and make the most of their talents.</p>

Grandparents in these circumstances are also entitled to claim child tax credits and child benefit in the same way as other parents.

This showed a clear relationship between the two, with every additional point achieved at the FSP stage increasing the chance of doing well at KS1.</p>
	<p pid="c.45W.5/2">The analysis shows that communication, language and literacy (CLL) has the highest correlation with KS1 outcomes, meaning that children who are developing well in their reading, writing, and spoken language are particularly likely to continue to do well in primary school. Of those pupils who achieve at least six points in all the personal, social and emotional development and CLL scales, a very high proportion go on to achieve the expected level and above KS1 maths (99 per cent.), reading (98 per cent.) and writing (97 per cent.). The analysis is due to be published on <phrase class="date" code="2008-06-20">20 June</phrase>, I will send a copy to the hon. Member and place copies in the House Library.</p>
	<p pid="c.45W.5/3">In addition, in 2007 the National Assessment Agency commissioned a small piece of research in six schools on the relationship between FSP scale points and later attainment at KS1. The outcomes from this research were not reliable and therefore it was not published.</p>

Much of the NPEU's work on the compromised foetus and baby focuses on or is linked to pre-term birth, as is a series of reviews the NPEU is undertaking on infant mortality. The MRC is funding a number of relevant projects, including a &pound;3 million population-based study of survival and later health status of infants of 25 weeks gestation or less; and a &pound;2.4 million randomised controlled trial investigating which oxygen saturation level should be used for very premature infants.</p>

There will also be a Child Health Strategy, which will not supersede the NSF but be about ensuring the implementation of the standards already set out in the NSF. Increasingly, local authorities and primary care trusts will be judged on their implementation of the NSF. Copies of both the NSF and the Children's Plan are available in the Library.</p>

Research project R0145, carried out at the Centre for LIFE at Newcastle, involves deriving stem cells from poor quality embryos which are not suitable for treatment. Patients donating embryos to this research project would have given consent for their embryos to be used in stem cell research.

	<p pid="c.63W.5/1">The development of the MOD Pandemic Flu Guide (renamed the Framework in 2008) has been an ongoing activity since November 2005, and was first issued in May 2006. The requirement is to ensure that the MOD has a robust approach to its contingency planning to deal with the general pandemic risk and to reinforce this with selective measures to protect critical activities or those judged to be especially at risk. As the Guide/Framework is a live document, it has been subject to continuous updates and revisions, with the latest version issued in February 2008. Updated versions of the Framework (together with supporting leaflets) are distributed to top level budget holders (TLBs) and trading funds as and when these become available. A &quot;work in progress&quot; copy of the Framework (and some supporting leaflets) has recently been placed in the Library.</p>
	<p pid="c.63W.5/2">Development of the MOD Pandemic Flu Guide/Framework has been undertaken by the Flu Sub-Group (composed of expertise drawn from different organisations across the Central TLB and wider Defence community) and the participation of MOD personnel (civilian and military) in activities, work streams and exercises co-ordinated by the Cabinet Office Civil Contingencies Secretariat (CCS). MOD personnel also support the Department of Health (DH) and Health Protection Agency (HPA) Programme Board in creating the national framework for responding to an influenza pandemic. Taken together this involvement ensures MOD influenza pandemic planning accords with cross-Government influenza contingency preparations.</p>

	<p pid="c.70W.2/2"><i> </i>While the Government recognise the benefits that have been demonstrated by the 101 single non-emergency number service in the initial live areas, it is vital that we target our resources to those areas which will have the greatest impact and which will contribute most to the protective of the public and security of the country. It was on that basis and in the context of significant pressure on resources and competing policing and security priorities, it was decided not to continue to fund centrally the ongoing live operation.</p>
	<p pid="c.70W.2/3">However, the Home Office is continuing to provide funding for the national 101 infrastructure, which the Cardiff Partnership are continuing to use, and we have also made available a 101 Delivery Toolkit which captures the learning and good practice from 101 service to date. It is hoped that this toolkit will help and encourage local areas to embed the benefits in local services and to develop locally funded 101 services wherever possible.</p>
	<p pid="c.70W.2/4">The annual cost to the Home Office of maintaining the national 101 telephony infrastructure will be &pound;950,000. This funding will ensure that the 101 number continues to be available for all local areas to maintain or develop their own locally funded 101 services, informed by the benefits and good practice successfully demonstrated in the initial live areas.</p>

	<p pid="c.70W.5/1">The Government have made a number of such assessments. These include; the assessment of the impact of the Licensing Act 2003 on levels of crime and disorder, the evaluation of a multi-agency approach to tackle violence and disorder in the night-time economy, as well as reviewing the results of the British Crime Survey.</p>
	<p pid="c.70W.5/2">The Home Office conducted an assessment of the impact of the Licensing Act 2003 on levels of crime and disorder. A report: The impact of the Licensing Act 2003 on levels of crime and disorder: an evaluation (2008) by Hough et al was published early this year.</p>
	<p pid="c.70W.5/3">The main conclusion to be drawn from the evaluation is that licensing regimes may be one factor in effecting change to the country's drinking culture&mdash;and its impact on crime&mdash;but they do not appear to be the critical factor. The overall volume of incidents of crime and disorder remains unchanged, though there were signs that crimes involving serious violence may have reduced. There was, however, evidence of temporal displacement, in that the small proportion of violent crime occurring in the small hours of the morning had increased.</p>
	<p pid="c.70W.5/4">In surveys, local residents were less likely to say that drunk and rowdy behaviour was a problem after the change than before it, and the majority thought that alcohol-related crime was stable or declining. Police, local authorities and licencees generally welcomed the Act and the new powers it gave them once implementation teething problems were solved . In general they did not think that alcohol related crime had got worse.</p>
	<p pid="c.70W.5/5">In July 2007 the Home Office published findings from an analysis of data collected from a self-selecting sample of police forces (Violent crime, disorder and criminal damage since the introduction of the Licensing Act (2007) Babb et al).</p>
	<p pid="c.70W.5/6">The key finding from this study was when comparing the 12-months before and after the implementation of the Licensing Act 2003, there was a 1 per cent. fall in recorded incidents involving violence, criminal damage and harassment; and a 5 per cent. fall in serious violence. The findings also showed the timing of offence had changed; with a 1 per cent. increase in offences occurring between 6pm and 6am, and a steep rise in the small minority of offences occurring in the small hours between 3am and 6am&mdash;an increase which was large in proportional terms (25 per cent.) but relatively small with regards to the number of incidents (236).</p>
	<p pid="c.70W.5/7">The evaluation of a multi-agency approach to tackle violence and disorder in the night-time economy was assessed in the 'Reducing alcohol-related violence and disorder: an evaluation of the TASC (2003) Macquire et al report. This report presented findings from a police-led multi-agency scheme launched in July 2000 under the Home Office with the aim of reducing alcohol-related crime and disorder in central Cardiff.</p>
	<p pid="c.70W.5/8">The findings from this study showed that there were significant reductions in violent and disorderly incidents occurring in or just outside individual pubs and clubs which were the subject of carefully targeted policing operations. The most successful of these, lasting eight weeks, was followed by reductions of 41 per cent. and 36 per cent. in such incidents in and around the two clubs targeted. The reductions were also sustained over time.</p>
	<p pid="c.70W.5/9">The Home Office also monitors the levels of alcohol-related violent crime and the perceptions of alcohol crime on an annual basis via the large-scale British Crime Survey (BCS). The results show that in 2006-07 46 per cent. of victims of violent crime perceived the offender to be under the influence of alcohol; a similar proportion to the previous year (45 per cent.). Additionally, the proportion of adults who perceived drunk and rowdy behaviour in public places to be a fairly/very big problem in the year ending December 2007 was the same compared to the year ending 2006.</p>

	<p pid="c.73W.6/1">A bilateral UK/UAE extradition treaty was signed by the then Home Secretary and the UAE Minister of Justice on <phrase class="date" code="2006-12-06">6 December 2006</phrase>; instruments of ratification were exchanged on <phrase class="date" code="2008-03-03">3 March 2008</phrase>; and the treaty came into force on <phrase class="date" code="2008-04-03">3 April</phrase>. However, before extradition can be operated in a general way and without a special arrangement between the two countries it is necessary to designate the UAE under Part 2 of the Extradition Act 2003. This requires secondary legislation under the affirmative resolution procedure, and debates in each of the Houses of Parliament are scheduled for <phrase class="date" code="2008-06-10">10 June</phrase>. The provisions of the treaty are consistent with those in the Act.</p>
	<p pid="c.73W.6/2">Currently the UK has extradition arrangements with the UAE for some categories of offence covered by international conventions, for example the Vienna Convention against drugs. The Extradition Act 2003 also enables &quot;ad hoc&quot; extraditions to take place if a special arrangement is set up. The designation of the UAE under the Extradition Act 2003 as a part 2 territory will be an improvement on the current arrangements, as the extradition of persons wanted for any offence punishable in both states with at least 12 months' imprisonment will be possible, providing extradition is not barred by any of the safeguards in the Act.</p>

This commences section 44 of the Mental Health Act 2007 and recognises the importance of using a police station on an exceptional basis and that when it is used, there is the ability to transfer a person to a more suitable place at the earliest available opportunity.</p>
	<p pid="c.79W.5/2">The Independent Police Complaints Commission is looking to publish a report later this year on the use of police stations as places of safety under Section 136 of the Mental Health Act. Initial findings from the research show that 11,500 people were detained in police custody under section 136 during 2005-06. The average amount of time spent in police custody was 10 hours, with the vast majority of detainees leaving within 18 hours.</p>
	<p pid="c.79W.5/3">The arrests information held by the Ministry of Justice covers persons arrested for recorded crime (notifiable offences) only. Summary offences of 'being drunk and disorderly' are non-notifiable and as a result are not covered by the collection. The Home Office has not made any assessments of the use of custody suites in relation to drunk people. However we are aware that a significant number of people rendered incapable by alcohol are being referred for medical treatment instead of being detained in custody suites.</p>

	<p pid="c.80W.5/2">The Home Office concluded an internal review of the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 in 2007. It found that there were instances of unnecessary application of legislation and unnecessarily bureaucratic processes, including where the police service had imposed some bureaucracy on itself. This was mainly caused by uncertainties over what the law required. Since then the Home Office has been working with police and others to raise understanding of what RIPA is for and how it should be used appropriately. Some progress has already been achieved, including improved guidance for practitioners from the new ACPO Covert Investigation Steering Group and from a new statutory code of practice for the acquisition of communications data which came into force on <phrase class="date" code="2007-10-01">1 October 2007</phrase>. Codes on covert surveillance and human intelligence sources are in the process of similar revision, including whether a set of standard forms on what RIPA requires would reduce misunderstanding and cut paperwork further. The Home Office has estimated that the reduction in form filling so far has freed up, at least, the equivalent of 24 man hours of police time every day of the year.</p>

	<p pid="c.89W.6/2">In many areas, third sector organisations play a key role in addressing the issue of sexual exploitation. Their role can include preventative work, intervention in cases where someone is at risk of or suffering sexual exploitation, the provision of therapeutic work with children and young people who have suffered sexual exploitation and long-term intervention. They can also play an important role in gathering information and evidence to support the prosecution of those exploiting the children and young people, working in partnership with the police and the Crown Prosecution Service.</p>

	<p pid="c.90W.5/1">The Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 puts under statutory control public body use of covert investigatory powers, including interception, access to communications data, surveillance and the use of undercover officers and informants. It covers the spectrum of interference with privacy, from the most serious&mdash;such as an intelligence agency planting microphones inside the house of a suspected terrorist&mdash;to local councils' use of telephone company subscriber data to identify and prosecute those involved in unhygienic meat supply or benefit fraud. It ensures that in the case of both ends of the spectrum, authorisation is consistent with the human rights principles of necessity and proportionality. As part of the statutory safeguards built into RIPA, the authorisation of covert investigatory powers is subject to the oversight of independent Commissioners who carry out their remit by regular inspection visits, reporting to the Prime Minister and publishing annual reports on their findings. The Act also establishes an independent Investigatory Powers Tribunal to hear complaints.</p>

	<p pid="c.90W.8/1">The Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 (RIPA) balances public authority intrusion into individual privacy with the need to protect the wider public by ensuring that use of covert investigatory powers is authorised only when this is necessary and proportionate. As part of the statutory safeguards built into RIPA to make sure the powers are used properly, the authorisation of covert investigatory powers is subject to the oversight of independent Commissioners who carry out their remit by regular inspection visits, reporting to the Prime Minister and publishing annual reports on their findings. The Act also establishes an independent Investigatory Powers Tribunal to hear complaints. The Government welcome the role of the Commissioners and the Tribunal, co-operate fully in their inspections and investigations and would assess their work as effective. In his report for 2006, the Interception of Communications Commissioner noted that staff of the agencies he oversees &quot;are always anxious to ensure that they comply both with the legislation and the appropriate safeguards&quot;.

	<p pid="c.99W.5/4">A new course, 'Managing Indeterminate Sentences and Risk' (MISaR) will be available from autumn 2008 to both prison and probation staff managing indeterminate sentenced offenders. This course places an emphasis on identifying, reducing and reporting on the risk these offenders may pose to the public.</p>

	<p pid="c.104W.2/1">Risk of harm screening and risk management plans were introduced as part of the Offender Assessment System (OASys). The roll-out of OASys began in 2003 and is being delivered to offenders serving custodial sentences of more than 12 months. Data on the number of prisoners released on licence without a risk of harm screening and/or a risk management plan is not collated centrally. To provide this information would require manual cross checking of separate databases, which could be carried out only at disproportionate cost.</p>

	<p pid="c.112W.0/1">HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) has too much office space and is engaged in a review programme to decide which offices should be retained as best suiting its future business needs. The review is being carried out on a regional basis but in the light of HMRC's operational needs across the UK, as its work is organised on national business lines rather than regionally.</p>
	<p pid="c.112W.0/2">Decisions have now been made and announced for all HMRC offices in the major urban centres, including those in south-east England.</p>
	<p pid="c.112W.0/3">Proposals were published in March for the remaining HMRC offices in south-east England, as well as in the west midlands, east midlands and north-east. They included proposals to retain the office building in Trinity House, Oxford, but vacate those in Andover, Aylesbury, Banbury, Newbury and Sterling House, Oxford. Final decisions have not yet been made on the future of any of these offices.</p>
	<p pid="c.112W.0/4">There will be short-term costs associated with closing any office as well as specific ongoing estate savings from that closure. However, it would be misleading to look at these in isolation as they are just a small part of the overall picture. HMRC is restructuring its entire business operations in order to achieve the value for money savings and customer service improvements required by the end of the comprehensive spending review (CSR) period in March 2011. MRC is monitored on its performance against its departmental strategic objectives and this includes a cost/benefit analysis of its departmental transformation programme. The restructuring and relocation programme contributes to that programme.</p>
