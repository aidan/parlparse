It is difficult to be precise about the opening dates of further spaces&mdash;each has different requirements for instruments and these have to be sourced and costed before we can make a grant offer for the local authority concerned to consider. However, we are hopeful of making such offers in respect of five further spaces in the next few months&mdash;in St. Austell, Nottingham, Washington (near Sunderland), Hastings, and rural Norfolk. Discussions are also under way about setting up spaces in Manchester, Coventry and Birmingham.</p>

	<p pid="a.2099W.9/3">Applications to the second round of the Free Swimming Capital Modernisation Programme will be assessed against the criteria laid out in the programme prospectus, which was agreed by the Free Swimming Capital Project Board (comprising DCMS, Department for Children, Schools and Families, Sport England, the Amateur Swimming Association and Local Government Association representatives) for both rounds of funding (2009-10 and 2010-11). I have arranged for copies of the prospectus to be placed in the House Library.</p>

	<p pid="a.2102W.3/2">There is evidence from other countries that petrol with 10 per cent. ethanol content can have a deleterious effect upon some older fibreglass fuel tanks, depending upon the type of resin that was used in their construction. This issue has primarily affected fuel tanks on leisure marine vessels, although some older road vehicles may also have been affected. However, ethanol content of UK petrol is not expected to exceed 5 per cent. in the next few years. We do not at present have robust evidence of whether or not these issues could occur at the 5 per cent. ethanol content level.</p>
	<p pid="a.2102W.3/3">We are currently discussing these issues with stakeholders, in the context of plans to implement the EU fuel quality directive 2009/30/EC. The Federation of British Historic Vehicle Clubs in particular has raised concerns about the potential impacts of petrol containing ethanol on fibreglass fuel tanks and products used to reseal fuel tanks on older vehicles. We plan to let research to assess this issue over the next few months.</p>
	<p pid="a.2102W.3/4">The only detailed information we hold on specific materials incompatible with ethanol is fuel industry guidance on materials used in storing petrol containing up to 10 per cent. ethanol content at filling stations and fuel terminals etc. This indicates that fibreglass using polyester and epoxy resins are not compatible with this fuel.</p>

	<p pid="a.2103W.9/1">DEFRA, or MAFF as it was previously, has not undertaken any research specifically into the effects on human health of odours from agricultural muck spreading.</p>
	<p pid="a.2103W.9/2">MAFF carried out a programme of research in the late 1980s/early 1990s to assess what factors affected the emissions of odours from the application (spreading) of agricultural manures to land to identify means of minimising emissions. As a result of this research, guidance on good practice was produced for the agricultural industry in the MAFF/DEFRA Code of Good Agricultural Practice. A copy of the code is available at:</p>
	<p pid="a.2103W.9/3" class="indent"><a href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/farm/environment/cogap/">www.defra.gov.uk/farm/environment/cogap/</a></p>
	<p pid="a.2103W.9/4">The code has provided the agricultural industry with guidance on the best equipment and techniques to use to minimise emissions while applying manures. It has also provided advice about the timing of manure applications, with respect to weather, days of the week and holidays etc., to minimise the impact on surrounding residents.</p>
	<p pid="a.2103W.9/5">Local authority environmental health departments are responsible for investigating and abating statutory nuisances under the provisions of the Environmental Protection Act 1990. One of the statutory nuisances in the Act is. [...] smell [...] arising from industrial, trade or business premises and being prejudicial to health or a nuisance'. Agricultural manure spreading activities have the potential to give rise to odours which may cause a statutory nuisance if not properly managed. There is no UK research at present which would conclusively demonstrate any adverse effects from agricultural odours on health. Therefore, in statutory nuisance investigations, proceeding under the nuisance limb of statutory nuisance is the more likely path.</p>
	<p pid="a.2103W.9/6">There is also no evidence, as far as DEFRA is aware, of workers in the agricultural industry suffering adverse health effects from manure odours, despite the fact that they are inevitably exposed to higher concentrations of odours during the loading, transporting and spreading of agricultural manures than off-site receptors or residents.</p>
	<p pid="a.2103W.9/7">Some odour emissions are inevitable from the application of agricultural manures, but with good management the impact and duration of these odours can be minimised. The use of agricultural manures is an important means of recycling plant nutrients into food production in a sustainable manner, and thereby reducing fossil fuel inputs and greenhouse gas emissions. These benefits have to be balanced against the potential for some short-term localised impact during seasonal peaks of manure application activities.</p>

	<p pid="a.2105W.9/1">One of DEFRA's departmental strategic objectives is to ensure a sustainable, secure and healthy food supply. We want to see a British farming sector that is competitive, and producing food that consumers want in a way that is sustainable, so as not to jeopardise the ability of future generations to exploit and enjoy our natural resources and landscapes.</p>
	<p pid="a.2105W.9/2">The UK is currently 60 per cent. self-sufficient in all food, a higher proportion than in the 1950s. However, this figure tells us very little about UK food security. We need to maintain a range of supply sources for our food to spread the risk that might entail from over-reliance on one or a few supply sources, and to lower the impacts of any unforeseen disruptions involving any particular trading partner or from within our domestic food sector.</p>
	<p pid="a.2105W.9/3">The Department does not have targets for self-sufficiency in food. Government's role is to support the industry to improve its performance through better self-assessment of the relative economic performance of individual businesses, more effective take-up of new technology and better management skills. We are also working with stakeholders to identify measures by which the agricultural sector can sustainably increase its resilience and productivity, strengthening food security within the UK.</p>

	<p pid="a.2106W.2/2">Please note that this percentage should not be confused with the measure of UK self-sufficiency in all food, which in 2008 was 60 per cent. (provisional figure), since self-sufficiency shows the percentage of all UK food production, including UK exports, as a percentage of consumption. Both measures are based on the value of unprocessed food.</p>

	<p pid="a.2109W.3/1">There are few data on returns to pomegranate farmers in Afghanistan. Estimates suggest that gross income could range from US $3,380 per hectare per year (Altai Consulting/UNDP, 2004) to $14,525 per hectare per year (Roots for Peace, 2009) after five to seven years maturation. The variation in gross income estimates depends on product quality, access to markets (including storage), price, yield and the proportion exported. However, set up costs can exceed $1,000 per hectare with the possibility of no return for the first four years following planting.</p>

It is estimated, however, that around &pound;500,000 of British-funded goods were included in the seizures of assets from non government organisations (NGOs). The UK condemned the expulsion and closures of the 13 international NGOs and three local NGOs in unequivocal terms. We have consistently said that the best way to repair the damage was to revoke that action.</p>
	<p pid="a.2110W.0/2">In partnership with the European Commission for Humanitarian Aid (ECHO), USAID, and the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA), we have made it clear to the Sudan Government that the seizure of assets in this way was completely unacceptable.

	<p pid="a.2110W.4/1">The Government have taken decisive action to ensure this country's housing needs are met. We have committed to investing &pound;7.5 billion over two years to deliver up to 112,000 affordable homes and around 15,000 private homes, including &pound;340 million to support local authorities in delivering new council housing. We have taken early action to provide people facing the threat of repossession with help at every stage of the process. I am also introducing a range of major reforms to the social and private rented sector. This includes the consultations I have recently published on a devolved system of responsibility and funding for council housing, a major review of the private rented sector and changes to social housing allocations to give councils more leeway on decisions to allocate housing in their area, and the initiative I have launched to clamp-down on fraud in the social sector. In addition, I will be setting out further details of the Government's plans to support housing recovery and ensure people have access to decent homes later this year. I therefore currently have no plans to pursue an additional housing reform green paper.</p>

	<p pid="a.2112W.3/1">London borough of Barnet currently has 14 Sure Start Children's Centres up and running, of these three are in Hendon offering access to services to around 3,100 children under five and their families. There are no additional children's centres planned for Hendon.</p>
	<p pid="a.2112W.3/2">The Department allocates funding to local authorities for the capital start up and revenue costs of Sure Start Children's Centres through the Sure Start, Early Years and Childcare Grant. It is for local authorities to determine how to allocate the funding between individual centres. The Department does not collect information on how much is allocated and spent at centre level. Information on the services provided by individual centres is available from the local Family Information Service. London borough of Barnet's capital and revenue allocations for the delivery of Sure Start Children's Centres for 2008-11 can be found in the following table. We are committed to delivering 3,500 Sure Start Children's Centres by 2010, a children's centre for every community so every family has easy access to high quality integrated services in their community and the benefits of Sure Start can be felt nationwide. Funding allocations beyond 2010-11 will be subject to future spending decisions.</p>

	<p pid="a.2115W.0/32">The revenue per pupil figures shown in table 4 is taken from the Dedicated Schools Grant (DSG). They are not comparable with those for the years 1997-98 to 2005-06 (in table 3 above) because the introduction of the DSG in 2006-07 fundamentally changed how local authorities are funded.</p>
	<p pid="a.2115W.0/33">The 1997-98 to 2005-06 figures are based on Education Formula Spending (EFS) which formed the education part of the Local Government Finance Settlement, plus various grants. This was an assessment of what local authorities needed to fund education rather than what they spent. The DSG is based largely on an authority's previous spending.</p>
	<p pid="a.2115W.0/34">In addition, the DSG has a different coverage to EFS. EFS comprised a schools block and an LEA block (to cover LEA central functions) whereas DSG only covers the school block. LEA block items are still funded through DCLG's Local Government Finance Settlement but education items cannot be separately identified. Consequently, there is a break in the Department's time series as the two sets of data are not comparable.</p>
	<p pid="a.2115W.0/35">To provide a comparison for 2008-09 DSG, the Department have isolated the schools block equivalent funding in 2005-06 (the baseline); as described above this does not represent the totality of 'education' funding in that year.</p>

	<p pid="a.2117W.0/1">The Department allocates much of its capital resources on a local authority area basis. It then relies on the local authority to prioritise resources between schools, including any further resource available locally. Accordingly, records on the schools in Hendon which have received funding since 1997, and their purposes, are not held centrally and would be held locally by Barnet local authority. Allocations to Barnet between 1996-97 and 2009-10 are set out in the following table.</p>

	<p pid="a.2120W.6/2">The Gas Act 1986 (as amended), which among other things set up the gas regulatory bodies, exempted liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) from its provisions. The Gas Act principally addressed the issues of setting up a regulatory regime to ensure that the national transmission system for gas users was not exploited. In contrast, there is no natural monopoly in the transport of LPG by road. The LPG market operates with a number of distributors competing for supply using alternative supply sources. In that sense, it is broadly similar to other products such as diesel and petrol.</p>
	<p pid="a.2120W.6/3">The Department has not therefore made an assessment of the merits of extending the remit of Ofgem to include responsibility for regulation of the market for LPG. My officials however have had meetings with Consumer Focus to contribute to its assessment of the market in Great Britain for the supply of LPG and heating oil for domestic use.</p>

	<p pid="a.2121W.6/1">Opportunities to embed with Task Force Helmand are in high demand from across the media&mdash;national, regional, print, broadcast, specialist and new media. It is not possible to meet all requests and slots must be time-limited to ensure that the opportunities are shared as widely as possible. A normal embed for a national news organisation will last on average around two to three weeks, including time for travel.</p>
	<p pid="a.2121W.6/2">Michael Yon had been embedded with British forces on a number of occasions before his recent visit&mdash;twice in Iraq in 2007, and once in Afghanistan in 2008. His latest embed had been scheduled to last for two weeks but it was extended to take account of delays to his arrival.</p>
	<p pid="a.2121W.6/3">In all, his stay was extended twice and he was embedded for five weeks&mdash;much longer than is normally the case, and longer than had been agreed with him before he went. He was facilitated by British forces in a number of locations and given a high level of access both to the operations and to our personnel. At the end of this five-week period Task Force Helmand ended his embed as they were no longer able to support it given their other commitments, including other media visits.</p>

	<p pid="a.2123W.5/3">In Scotland, as in the rest of the UK, the majority of secondary health care is provided in NHS hospitals. The single service medical services are responsible for delivering primary health care to their respective service commanders-in-chief. This includes local medical centres (including GP surgeries), Regional Rehabilitation Units (including one in Edinburgh) and military Departments of Community Mental Health (including three in Edinburgh, Glasgow and Inverness). Owing to the number of different internal budgets to which costs would be attributable, any detailed analysis of the budget spent in Scotland would incur disproportionate cost.</p>

	<p pid="a.2124W.9/1">MOD takes very seriously its responsibility to provide high-quality mental healthcare to its personnel, and Defence Medical Services' mental health practitioners remain in touch with the latest advances and developments in treatment in order to ensure that patients receive the most effective and efficient management, subject to proper scientific evaluation and comparison with current effective treatments. We sponsor research and epidemiological studies that address aspects of the mental health of both the in-service and veteran populations. We also maintain a close dialogue with the military medical services of our principal allies, to share understanding and best practice. Additionally, our Academic Centre for Defence Mental Health, based at King's College London, is constantly reviewing the development of new treatments across the national and international spectrum and producing advice accordingly.</p>
	<p pid="a.2124W.9/2">Diagnosis and treatment of mental health disorders in members of the armed forces are performed by trained and accredited mental health personnel. In Afghanistan, we deploy uniformed mental health nurses to provide in-theatre care and treatment for our personnel. If personnel need to leave the operational environment, then their care continues either on an out- or in-patient basis in the UK or their permanent base overseas.</p>
	<p pid="a.2124W.9/3">In the UK, our mental health services for military personnel are configured to provide community-based mental health care, primarily through our 15 military Departments of Community Mental Health (DCMH) across the UK (plus centres overseas), which provide out-patient mental healthcare. The DCMH mental health teams, comprising psychiatrists, mental health nurses, clinical psychologists and mental health social workers, have particular expertise in treatments for psychological injury.</p>
	<p pid="a.2124W.9/4">For the relatively small number of military patients who need it, in-patient care is currently provided by a group of seven NHS trusts located throughout England and Scotland, led by South Staffordshire and Shropshire NHS Foundation Trust (SSSFT) through a central MOD contract.</p>
	<p pid="a.2124W.9/5">When personnel leave military service their healthcare becomes the responsibility of the NHS. Ex-Service personnel receive good treatment from their GPs but we recognise that many health professionals have limited experience of dealing with veterans who have mental health symptoms arising from their Service experience. The MOD, the four health departments and the Combat Stress charity have been working together with clinical experts and the Health and Social Care Advisory Service (HASCAS) to develop a new model of community based mental healthcare that will address assessment and treatment of veterans' mental health problems in the long term.</p>
	<p pid="a.2124W.9/6">The community mental health model is NHS-led and reflects NHS best practice. Two-year pilots, tailored to local circumstances, are operating at Staffordshire and Shropshire Foundation Healthcare Trust, Camden and Islington Mental Health and Social Care Trust, Cardiff and Vale NHS Trust, Tees Esk and Wear NHS Trust, Cornwall NHS Partnership, and NHS Lothian (led by the Scottish Executive). Evaluation of the pilot areas is now underway; early results from all six are encouraging, with evidence that veterans feel able to access and use the service with confidence. Informed by the results of the evaluation the service will be rolled out across the UK. In the interim, for areas not yet involved in the pilots, veterans with operational service after 1982 who are concerned about their mental health can attend our Medical Assessment Programme based at St. Thomas' hospital, for specialist mental health assessment by a consultant psychiatrist with extensive military experience.</p>

	<p pid="a.2129W.5/2">All Royal Navy fuel depots are subject to stringent safety regulations and are inspected and licensed on an annual basis. MOD is working closely with the Scottish Environment Protection Agency to investigate the oil spillage that occurred at Her Majesty's Naval Base Clyde on <phrase class="date" code="2009-07-29">29 July 2009</phrase> and the findings are due to be published in the next few months. As part of this work, an independent marine biologist is assessing the environmental impact of the incident and qualified departmental staff are also carrying out daily inspections of the affected area. The initial findings are that appropriate control measures were in place to contain the spillage resulting in minimal pollution to the local environment.</p>
	<p pid="a.2129W.5/3">The initial assessments have similarly found that the oil spillage resulted in minimal impact to safety, including to the personnel employed at the naval base. Results to date also indicate that the incident was dealt with in accordance with the naval base's Oil Spill Contingency Plan by qualified departmental personnel who had access to industry standard personal protective equipment.</p>
	<p pid="a.2129W.5/4">The Department operates stringent safety operating procedures to ensure that the risk of oil spills is kept as low as reasonably practicable. The circumstances of the spillage are unique to the fuels infrastructure at Faslane and are not replicated across the wider naval fuel depot estate in Scotland. Any lessons learned, however, regarding both the cause of the spillage and our response will be incorporated into working practices and plans as appropriate. Associated risk assessments will also be reviewed to take into account any necessary changes.</p>

	<p pid="a.2144W.2/1">The legal requirements relating to imprints on election material are set out in Section 143 of the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000 for printed election material issued centrally by political parties, and Section 110 of the Representation of the People Act 1983 for printed election material which is intended to promote or procure the election of a candidate.</p>
	<p pid="a.2144W.2/2">These requirements do not apply in the case of non-printed election material, although Electoral Commission guidance for parties and candidates is clear that it is considered good practice to include an imprint that complies with the legal requirements on any website that contains information about an election or candidate(s).</p>
	<p pid="a.2144W.2/3">The Government recognise the importance of ensuring proper transparency as to the source of election material, in any form. Where practical, the Government agree that it is a matter of good practice for an imprint to be placed on non-printed material. However, the Government believe that any regulations introducing legal imprint requirements for non-printed material would need to be workable and long-lasting, in particular taking account of the fast-evolving nature of online campaigning. The Government do not propose to introduce regulations requiring imprints for non-printed material at this time but will keep the issue under review. If evidence suggests that further statutory provision is required we will consider that carefully.</p>

	<p pid="a.2148W.2/1">Information on 'suicide watches' is not collated or held by the National Offender Management Service (NOMS). NOMS has a broad, integrated and evidence-based prisoner suicide prevention and self harm management strategy that seeks to reduce the distress of all those in prison. This encompasses proactively identifying prisoners at risk of suicide and self-harm. At-risk prisoners are cared for using Assessment, Care in Custody and Teamwork (ACCT) procedures. Detailed data is not readily available however some 31,000 ACCT plans are opened each year. These can be opened repeatedly for the same prisoner. There are no easy answers to managing self harming behaviour but NOMS remains committed to finding ways to manage it.</p>
	<p pid="a.2148W.2/2">Without exploring the intent behind a self-harm incident, it is difficult to establish such an incident as an attempted suicide. NOMS does not record intent, and does not hold information on attempted suicides. Table 1 shows annual totals of self-harm incidents by type of custody. Although intent is not recorded and the majority of incidents are not life threatening, analyses show that approximately 1.7 per cent. of all self-harm in prison involves hanging as a method or require resuscitation or hospitalisation on life support.</p>

	<p pid="a.2148W.2/19">Every death in prison is a tragedy, and affects families, staff and other prisoners deeply. Ministers, the Ministry of Justice and NOMS are completely committed to learning from each death and to reducing the number of such incidents. Good care and support from staff save many lives, but such instances go largely unreported. Prisons successfully keep safe in any given month approximately 1,500 prisoners assessed to be at particular risk of suicide or self harm. Deaths in prisons are among the most scrutinised of all incidents and each case is subject to a police investigation and independent investigation by the Prisons Probation Ombudsman. Robust systems are in place for monitoring deaths and learning from them.</p>

	<p pid="a.2157W.2/1">The additional &pound;150 million provided for funding breaks for carers was given to primary care trusts (PCTs) as part of their overall baseline allocations. The Department does not break down PCT revenue allocations by policies at either a national or local level and there is no weighted capitation formula specific to carers that would allow needs to be accurately identified at the local level. So it is therefore for PCTs to decide their priorities for investment locally, taking into account their local circumstances and local priorities.</p>
	<p pid="a.2157W.2/2">The allocations made to each local authority from the &pound;240 million provided for the carers grant are detailed in the local authority social services letter LASSL(DH)(2007)2 which has already been placed in the Library.</p>

	<p pid="a.2169W.5/1">As of <phrase class="date" code="2009-09-09">9 September 2009</phrase> just over 100,000 packs of Tamiflu capsules, around 800 bottles of solution/suspension for use by children under one and nearly 3,500 courses of Relenza have been issued to Cambridgeshire Primary Care Trust (PCT). The PCTs future requirements will depend on the take up of the antiviral stocks as the pandemic progresses.</p>
	<p pid="a.2169W.5/2">Once the swine flu vaccine has been licensed, the intention is that initial supplies will be sent out to all PCTs. They will then be able to place regular orders for the amount of vaccine they need to vaccinate their clinical at risk groups, taking account of local storage capacity and implementation arrangements.</p>

The UK provides the Operation Commander and the Operational Headquarters of the EU Operation Atalanta; the Deputy Commander of Combined Maritime Forces and the at sea commander of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation Operation Ocean Shield. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office currently advises against all travel to Somalia and provides specific advice on sea travel in the region.</p>
	<p pid="a.2174W.2/2">The Government endorse the advice, prepared by the Contact Group on Piracy off the Coast of Somalia (CGPCS) and the International Maritime Organization, on how to prevent, deter and delay acts of piracy off the Horn of Africa. The Maritime Security Centre Horn of Africa (MSCHOA) website contains general advice to shipping companies and ships are encouraged to register with MSCHOA and transit through the Internationally Recommended Transit Corridor (IRTC). In addition, British registered ships receive advice from the Department for Transport, drawing attention to the latest Maritime Advisories in force throughout the piracy threat region. The UK's Maritime Trade Operation based in Dubai advises mariners on planning their passage through the Gulf of Aden.</p>

	<p pid="a.2174W.6/1">The information is as follows:</p>
	<p pid="a.2174W.6/2" class="indent">(a) The agency reviewed its Corporate Plan in the first quarter of the 2009-10 financial year, to take account of the changing priorities resulting from the recession (in particular, the need to prioritise support for business) and the reduction in its budget. As part of this exercise the agency reviewed its investment plans and project portfolio. The aim was to ensure that investments were targeted on those activities that would deliver the greatest benefits for the region. From the outset, Advantage West Midlands undertook to continue to fund all legally committed projects that were being delivered in accordance with contractual conditions. This meant that 600 projects, to which it was legally-committed, were unaffected by the review process. The 306 project proposals to which the agency was not yet legally committed were systematically reviewed against the following criteria:</p>
	<p pid="a.2174W.6/3" class="indent">Impact</p>
	<p pid="a.2174W.6/4" class="indent">Spatial focus</p>
	<p pid="a.2174W.6/5" class="indent">Response to recession</p>
	<p pid="a.2174W.6/6" class="indent">Deliverability.</p>
	<p pid="a.2174W.6/7" class="indent">All agency-funded projects, once contracted and being delivered, are subject to continuing review through regular monitoring visits by agency project and contract managers. This is standard procedure&mdash;the aim being to ensure that projects meet contractually-agreed objectives and fulfil the agreed terms and conditions. Where this has not been the case, the agency has reduced or clawed-back funding on a pro-rata basis.</p>
	<p pid="a.2174W.6/8" class="indent">(b) No legally-committed projects have been cancelled in the past 12 months. As a result of its project review, the agency announced at the end of June 2009 that, of the 306 non-legally committed project proposals reviewed, 184 had been allocated agency funding. The total investment in these projects and the 600 existing projects over their lifetimes will be c&pound;1.1 billion. Since June the agency has continued to work with applicants to explore alternative funding and delivery arrangements for those projects that were not supported.</p>

	<p pid="a.2180W.2/2">When a failed incorporated business enters into an insolvency procedure it is counted in the official insolvency statistics. However, corporate insolvency figures are not currently available at a sub-national level.</p>

	<p pid="a.2182W.5/2">The Department provides a broad package of support to individuals with high levels of personal debt. As set out in the Government's White Paper &quot;A Better Deal for Consumers: Delivering Real Help Now and Change for the Future&quot; published on <phrase class="date" code="2009-07-02">2 July</phrase>, the Government are focusing efforts to ensure that:</p>
	<p pid="a.2182W.5/3" class="indent">creditors across the board offer some relief to customers who find themselves in financial difficulty;</p>
	<p pid="a.2182W.5/4" class="indent">free, independent debt advice and support is available for those who need it;</p>
	<p pid="a.2182W.5/5" class="indent">industry and the advice community both follow best practice guidance in handling clients with problem debt;</p>
	<p pid="a.2182W.5/6" class="indent">the most appropriate debt remedies are in place to support the over-indebted; and</p>
	<p pid="a.2182W.5/7" class="indent">there is better legal protection for debtors' property.</p>
	<p pid="a.2182W.5/8">In particular, the Department is funding a new self-help debt advice toolkit being developed by the Money Advice Trust, which will enable debtors to negotiate debt repayments with creditors themselves with more targeted advice agency support. This assisted self-help approach should allow over-indebted consumers to reach agreement more speedily and start making regular payments to reduce their debt. Use of the toolkit will also reduce pressure on the debt advice agencies and allow many more debtors in need of advice to be assisted.</p>
	<p pid="a.2182W.5/9">Debt advisers are regulated by the Consumer Credit Act, last revised in 2006, and are required to have a consumer credit licence. There are no plans to amend the legislation in this latter area.</p>
	<p pid="a.2182W.5/10">From 2006-07 to 2008-09 the Department provided:</p>

	<p pid="a.2182W.5/12" class="indent">approximately &pound;15 million in the first year, and &pound;28 million in the next two, to the Face-to-Face Debt Advice Project.</p>

	<p pid="a.2182W.5/14" class="indent">&pound;3.5 million each year to National Debtline; and</p>
	<p pid="a.2182W.5/15" class="indent">approximately &pound;28 million in the first year, and &pound;29 million in the second, to the Face-to-Face Debt Advice Project.</p>

	<p pid="a.2184W.5/1">The global recession has hit the west midlands hard and young people are feeling the impact of this. Government are clear that Britain cannot afford a wasted generation of young people, lost to unemployment and although, under this Government opportunities for young people have improved (at the end of 2008 we had the highest ever rate of 16 to 18-year-olds in education and training in England), a number of measures are already in place that will provide further help to school leavers, graduates and young unemployed people, including those in Coventry.</p>
	<p pid="a.2184W.5/2">For example this year across England we expect there to be 250,000 young people starting an apprenticeship and we have recently announced an extra 47,000 youth jobs supported by the Future Jobs Fund for young people who are unable to find work or training within a year. Through this fund Coventry city council will provide 50 job starts during October 2009 and a further 100 job starts in January 2010.</p>
	<p pid="a.2184W.5/3">We recently launched a national campaign Backing Young Britain to ensure we do everything possible to give every young person help to find a job or training or work skills and experience. This will provide &pound;40 million to fund over 20,000 additional internships so that graduates and non graduates can get higher quality work experience; a new mentoring network to help young people find their feet in a tough jobs market; more help for young people from day one of unemployment through job clubs and one to one support in jobcentres for those leaving education this summer.</p>
	<p pid="a.2184W.5/4">In the west midlands regional partners have responded with their own initiatives to help unemployed young people. For example, the West Midlands Graduate Internship Programme will create 250 graduate internships and, uniquely, graduates who are unemployed may be eligible for job seekers allowance through Job Centre Plus. Also there is a new &pound;2.5 million programme funded by Advantage West Midlands called Grad Central online service,</p>
	<p pid="a.2184W.5/5" class="indent"><a href="http://www.grad-central.co.uk">www.grad-central.co.uk</a>,</p>
	<p pid="a.2184W.5/6">which will place at least 2,000 more people into jobs over the next four years. In addition, Graduate Advantage, led by Aston University, has funding from Advantage West Midlands to provide a further 400 placements by 2011. Partners are also providing specific help for redundant apprentices.</p>
	<p pid="a.2184W.5/7">Jobcentre Plus in Coventry has a range of measures to help young people in the city secure employment. It is supporting Backing Young Britain by encouraging key local employers, partners and stakeholders to give their personal commitment to offering jobs, apprenticeships, work trials, work experience, internships and mentoring advice. This has been met with a positive response from both the public and private sector, including BUPA Home Care, TUI UK and west midlands police&mdash;Coventry division. In addition, Jobcentre Plus advisers have referred 114 18 to 24-year-olds to the extensive job search and confidence building support that is available on the first day of unemployment. Further job search support for groups of 18 to 24-year-old customers is due to start in the near future in partnership with Coventry Connexions.</p>
	<p pid="a.2184W.5/8">Coventry city council and its Local Strategic Partnership has prioritised support to assist young people into employment via its Local Area Agreement. The Local Public Service Board has recently approved the use of &pound;550,000 Area Based Grant funding to support a six-month employment placement scheme, which will provide 100 placements for new unemployed graduates, redundant managers and those in the NEET category that fall outside the Future Jobs Fund and other provision provided by ESF and Connexions programmes.</p>

	<p pid="a.2187W.3/2">An important principle set out in legislation (sections 65(1) and 68(2b) of the Further and Higher Education Act 1992) is that Ministers cannot intervene in the funding decisions of the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE). As is the case with other universities, London Metropolitan University receives grant from HEFCE under a Financial Memorandum which sets out how it should properly account for its public funding. It is for the Funding Council to keep the financial health of the institutions it funds under review to protect the public interest, including ensuring that public funds are properly spent. This month I have met with the UCU representative and a number of staff from the institution.</p>
	<p pid="a.2187W.3/3">I know that the process of restructuring can be very difficult and unsettling for both staff and students, but am pleased that the Council's chief executive has met with the new interim vice-chancellor to further discuss the way forward. The final decision must though rest with the university and I remain confident that higher education provision in general across London will be sufficient to meet the diversity of demand. No Government though can give a commitment to protect every course or department at any particular institution.</p>
