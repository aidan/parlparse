In our view, registration under section 15(8) would be a disposal of land for the purposes of section 123 or 127 (as the case may be) of the Local Government Act 1972, and the authority must comply with the requirements of those provisions. We expect that most local authority proposals for voluntary registration are likely to fall within the terms of the General Disposal Consent 2003, set out in ODPM circular 6/03. However, an authority will also need to comply with the special requirements of section 123(2A) or 127(3), as regards the disposal of open space.</p>
	<p pid="b.375W.3/2">We will publish in due course updated guidance on voluntary applications for registration of land under section 15(8) of the Commons Act 2006, which takes account of these requirements.</p>

	<p pid="b.376W.4/1">Many of the provisions of Directive 210/63/EU are similar to current United Kingdom requirements; some are new and go further; and a few are potentially less stringent. For example, unlike the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986, the directive does not provide special protection for cats, dogs and equids. In addition, some of the mandatory standards of care and accommodation set out in Annex III to the directive are lower such as cage height for rats, hamsters and gerbils; minimum floor areas for sheep, goats, dogs, rabbits, guinea pigs, pigs, mini-pigs and equids. The directive also excludes from protection foetal forms of birds and reptiles and protects foetal forms of mammals from the last third of gestation rather than the halfway point. The required membership and functions of the proposed animal welfare bodies in establishments are also less extensive in the directive than the current requirement for local ethical processes in the United Kingdom. This is not a full and final list of differences and further details will be included in the impact assessment currently in preparation which will be published in due course.</p>

	<p pid="b.377W.2/2">The Government support the work of the National Centre for the Replacement, Refinement and Reduction of Animals in Research (NC3Rs) which promotes the replacement, reduction and refinement of animals (the 3Rs) in research and testing. Over the last six years, the NC3Rs has developed a model that enables pharmaceutical and chemical companies and contract research organisations that engage in animal testing to share data and expertise. An example of the success of this approach is the removal from the international regulatory guidelines of single dose acute toxicity testing for pharmaceuticals. In 2010, the NC3Rs has continued to facilitate this cooperation by co-ordinating data sharing between 23 companies in a wide range of areas related to the development of new medicines. Further information on these activities is published on the NC3Rs website.</p>

	<p pid="b.391W.2/1">Responsibility for addressing current and future housing needs rests with individual local authorities; the Department made no assessment of the possible effects of the return of overseas military personnel on local housing authorities.</p>
	<p pid="b.391W.2/2">The Government are committed to increasing housing supply and seeing more of the homes that people want, in the places that people want them. The New Homes Bonus Scheme, announced by my right hon. Friend the Minister for Housing and Local Government on <phrase class="date" code="2010-11-12">12 November 2010</phrase>, will create a simple, transparent and permanent incentive to increase the supply of new homes.</p>
	<p pid="b.391W.2/3">The Department and MOD continue to discuss matters of shared interest. We are not aware of representations from local housing authorities on the likely effects of returning personnel from overseas military bases, as a result of changes announced in the strategic defence and security review. We would not expect to receive such representations before MOD's plans on returning personnel have been developed and finalised. In considering relocation of military personnel from overseas military bases as a result of the review, accommodation would be taken into account.</p>

	<p pid="b.411W.8/1">We believe that future franchises should generally be for around 15 years but that shorter contracts may be necessary in some circumstances, for example, where major works like Thameslink, will involve significant changes in the configuration of services. Where significant private sector investment is proposed, we are prepared to consider franchises of up to 22.5 years.</p>
	<p pid="b.411W.8/2">The significant variation in the nature of services provided on different parts of the network means that a one size-fits-all approach to franchising is not appropriate. Franchise terms will therefore be tailored to the specific circumstances of the services in question.</p>

	<p pid="b.416W.2/1">At up to &#163;6,500 per person the future jobs fund (FJF) is expensive; creates temporary, short term posts; and the grants do not include any incentives to move people into permanent jobs. As part of the evaluation of the FJF we will be conducting an impact assessment to estimate the difference that the policy has made to participants' employment and benefit receipt outcomes. To enable participants' outcomes to be tracked for a sufficient period analysis will be undertaken from autumn 2011 This will inform a cost-benefit assessment based on benefit, fiscal and economic savings. However it is not possible to reliably identify the potential impact on economic growth.</p>

A pensioner unit is defined to be either a single pensioner over state pension age (i.e. a man aged 65+ or a woman aged 60+ in 2008-09) or a pensioner couple, either married or cohabiting, where one or more are over state pension age. The analysis does not reflect income from others in a household. So, for example, if a pensioner lives with their adult children, the children's income is not reflected in this analysis.  5. Gross income is income from all sources received by the pensioner unit including income from social security benefits (including housing benefit), earnings from employment, or self-employment, any private pension and tax credits.  6. State pension income consists of basic state pension, additional state pension, widow's pension and widowed parent's allowance.  7. Non state pension benefit income consists of pension credit, housing benefit, council tax benefit, social fund grants, carer's allowance, disability living allowance and attendance allowance.  8. Average incomes have been rounded to the nearest pound.</td> </tr>

It is likely that most contracts will include some form of confidentiality clause as employees will have access to sensitive patient and commercial information which should not be released.

	<p pid="b.427W.5/1">The Government have committed to work with NHS Employers and trade unions to explore appropriate arrangements for setting pay following the end of the two-year public sector pay freeze.

	<p pid="b.427W.5/2">We are unable to estimate the number of national health service staff that will be covered by future national pay and bargaining structures. The Government have made it clear that pay decisions should be led by health care employers rather than imposed by the Government.</p>
	<p pid="b.427W.5/3">To achieve this, all individual employers will have the right, as foundation trusts have now, to determine pay for their own staff. However, it is likely that many providers will want to continue to use national contracts as a basis for their local terms and conditions.</p>

	<p pid="b.428W.2/2">Use of these tools is delivering the following productivity and quality benefits:</p>
	<p pid="b.428W.2/3" class="indent">Re-designing services around patients. Harmonising terms and conditions of service helps break down barriers between occupational groups and enhance team and gives employers the freedom to create new roles to support patient care.</p>

	<p pid="b.428W.2/6" class="indent">Boosting recruitment and retention. The new pay scales offer higher starting pay and maxima, helping to improve participation rates and keep nurses working for the NHS.</p>

The aim is to address the planning, market, regulatory and technical challenges presented by such offshore grid development and create the right framework for industry to invest in future projects. This initiative will not only pave the way for delivery of the North Seas Offshore Grid, but could also help remove the barriers to the other large-scale cross-border infrastructure projects across the EU which together will form the EU supergrid of the future. The Government are also discussing with fellow members of the British Irish Council the possibility of an 'All Islands Approach' to maximising the renewable energy potential around the British Isles, which could involve working together to assess the opportunity for joint renewables projects, better co-ordinating network development and tackling any barriers to greater co-operation.</p>

	<p pid="b.441W.2/1">The comprehensive review of Feed-in Tariffs (FITs) announced on <phrase class="date" code="2011-02-07">7 February 2011</phrase> will consider all aspects of the FITs scheme, including photovoltaics for all bands and applications, including social housing. It will report before the end of this year for implementation in April 2012. The review will also include specific fast-track consideration of large-scale solar photovoltaic installations of more than 50 kW and fast-track consideration of farm based Anaerobic Digestion.</p>
	<p pid="b.441W.2/2">The starting point for determining whether an installation would fall above or below 50 kW threshold is the existing FITs legislation. On this basis, the review of tariffs for installations below 50 kW would not be fast-tracked. This is regardless of whether they are installed on private housing or social housing.</p>
	<p pid="b.441W.2/3">The Government fully supports &quot;rent roof&quot; models (third party ownership financial packages), especially in the context of opening up the benefits of FITs to those living in social housing. However, the effectiveness and costs of all elements of the FITs scheme will be considered as part of the comprehensive review which will be tasked with improving the scheme to deliver both greater long term certainty to industry and investors and also deliver value for money to consumers.</p>
