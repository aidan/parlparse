	<p pid="a.2035W.10/1">In November 2005, the Government announced that a Renewable Transport Fuels Obligation will be introduced. This will require 5 per cent. of all UK fuel to come from a renewable source by 2010. Target levels for 2008&ndash;09 and 2009&ndash;10 will be announced in Budget 2006.</p>
	<p pid="a.2035W.10/2">Information on fuel sales is not collected on a regional basis so it is not possible to give estimates for Shropshire. Provisional figures for 2005 for the whole of the UK give annual biodiesel and bioethanol sales of nearly 26 million gallons. To meet a 5 per cent. target at current usage would require around 540 million gallons.</p>

	<p pid="a.2035W.13/1">DEFRA's energy crops scheme provides grants to establish short rotation coppice and miscanthus for use in heat and electricity generation, and to set up short rotation coppice producer groups. Part of the funding for this scheme comes from the European agricultural guidance and guarantee fund. Under the Common Agricultural Policy, farmers can also receive the single payment when these energy crops are grown on set-aside land. They can be grown on single payment land if the EU's &euro;45 per hectare energy aid payment is also claimed. Oilseed rape and wheat can be grown on set-aside land under contract for processing into transport biofuels. These crops can also be grown on single payment land and are then eligible for the energy aid payment.</p>

	<p pid="a.2036W.5/1">A study by the Building Research Establishment commissioned by Defra for the purposes of the current review of the UK Climate Change Programme has concluded that, while a switch to Double British Summertime would reduce energy use for domestic lighting and non-domestic cooling, these savings would be more than offset by increased demand for non-domestic heating and lighting. The study therefore concluded that a switch to Double British Summertime was unlikely to lead to a reduction in the UK's carbon dioxide emissions.</p>

The data take account of emissions incurred by providing electricity and other forms of delivered energy for use in the buildings. Emissions for England have been estimated by scaling on the basis of the ratio of total carbon emissions from England for 2003 to that of the UK. The DUKES allocation between commercial and public sector may mean that this data underestimates emissions from the commercial sector.

	<p pid="a.2039W.2/1">The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs does not pay an allowance to staff working in London.</p>
	<p pid="a.2039W.2/2">Instead it operates and maintains two separate sets of pay ranges for staff working in the London and national pay areas. The effect of this, is that for staff employed in the London pay area, they receive a pay lead over those staff employed in the national pay area.</p>
	<p pid="a.2039W.2/3">There are no immediate plans to consider changes to the existing differential pay arrangements that exist between the London and national pay areas. However, the Department will continue to monitor and evaluate the relative pay position of staff employed in the London pay area, with a particular focus on recruitment and retention issues.</p>

	<p pid="a.2039W.8/1">English Nature plays an important role in the planning process, as a statutory consultee, and in providing proactive guidance to regional and local authority planners on their regional spatial strategies (RSS). The agency contributes by responding to formal consultations, having strong involvement with RSS working groups, and advising on sustainability appraisal and strategic environmental assessment. The advice given by English Nature makes sure that biodiversity and geological conservation interests are taken fully into account during the decision making process.</p>
	<p pid="a.2039W.8/2">In particular, the Government's Planning Policy Statement 9 (published in August 2005) sets out policies on protection of biodiversity and geological conservation through the planning system. These policies need to be taken into account by regional planning bodies in the preparation of regional spatial strategies, and regional planning bodies should liaise closely with regional biodiversity fora or equivalent bodies, English Nature or its successors.</p>

	<p pid="a.2041W.5/1">Defra has policy responsibility for management of flood risk in England, funds most of the Environment Agency's flood risk activities and provides grant aid on a project by project basis to the other flood risk management operating authorities to support their investment in improvement works. The Agency has powers to undertake works on designated &quot;main rivers&quot; while the London borough of Redbridge (LBR) has similar powers for &quot;ordinary watercourses&quot;. Defra has funded three studies carried out by LBR since 2000 on the non-main river aspects of flood risk.</p>
	<p pid="a.2041W.5/2">The Agency believes the flooding was primarily caused by the surface water drainage system backing up and being unable to discharge into the river. This affected properties and roads in the Chigwell Road area of Woodford Green.</p>
	<p pid="a.2041W.5/3">Since 2000, the Agency has carried out repairs to a low spot in the flood defences behind the Broadmead Baptist Church and selective de-silting and reed removal upstream and downstream of Chigwell Road to maintain channel flow capacity. Thames Water and LBR have repaired missing or broken flap valves to the outfalls in the river. This will prevent river water backing up into the drainage system at times of high flow but a risk of flooding remains because surface water drainage will not be able to discharge into the river during periods of high flows.</p>
	<p pid="a.2041W.5/4">The Agency is to complete a flood risk management strategy for the Roding Catchment early this summer. A flood storage area in the upper catchment of the Roding is considered to be the most sustainable solution, economically and environmentally.

	<p pid="a.2045W.8/1">Odour from the great majority of sewage treatment works can be dealt with under the statutory nuisance provisions of the Environmental Protection Act 1990.</p>
	<p pid="a.2045W.8/2">Local authorities have a statutory duty to check their areas periodically for existing and potential statutory nuisances, and to take reasonably practicable steps to investigate complaints made within their areas.</p>
	<p pid="a.2045W.8/3">It is for the appropriate local authority to determine whether a smell amounts to a statutory nuisance. Factors to be taken into account include the character of the locality, the duration of the smell and the frequency of its occurrence.</p>
	<p pid="a.2045W.8/4">Once satisfied that a statutory nuisance does or may occur, the local authority must serve an abatement notice requiring that the nuisance be ceased or abated within a specified time scale.</p>
	<p pid="a.2045W.8/5">It is an offence to breach or fail to comply with an abatement notice, with a maximum fine on conviction of &pound;20,000 for industrial, trade or business premises.</p>
	<p pid="a.2045W.8/6">Defra is about to issue a Code of Practice on Odour Nuisance from Sewage Treatment Works to provide high level guidance on the handling and resolution of complaints.</p>
	<p pid="a.2045W.8/7">A few sewage treatment works are controlled under the Integrated Pollution and Control regime monitored by the Environment Agency. Local authorities cannot take action against these plants to abate odour under the statutory nuisance regime unless my right hon.

	<p pid="a.2047W.2/1">I am not aware of any legislation related to the import and export of timber that specifically prohibits social considerations from being considered in such commercial activity. This question is closely related to a request made by WWF UK to see the legal advice on which the Government's timber procurement policy was based and I shall explain why that request was declined.</p>
	<p pid="a.2047W.2/2">The European Treaty and European public procurement directives set principles and rules that govern the manner in which public contracting authorities specify their requirement, select potential bidders and award contracts. The UK Government's interpretation of these principles and rules has led it to conclude that it is not permissible for public sector contracting authorities to specify requirements that are not directly related to the subject matter of the contract in question and that criteria aimed at protecting or improving the economic and social well being of forest dependent people are generally not directly related to the subject matter of public sector contracts for works, goods and services.</p>
	<p pid="a.2047W.2/3">The advice that the Department received on this matter was a combination of guidance published by the European Commission, guidance published by the Office of Government Commerce and communications between Government officials. The published guidance documents were: the Commission's Interpretative Communication on the possibilities of integrating social issues into public procurement under Community law-see <a href="http://simap.eu.int/EN/pub/src/welcome.htm">http://simap.eu.int/EN/pub/src/welcome.htm</a> and Chapter 9 of the &quot;Joint Note on Environmental Issues in Purchasing&quot;-published by The Office of Government Commerce and Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs in October 2003. The Office of Government Commerce have very recently published a Note on Social Issues in Purchasing to further clarify the position-see <a href="http://www.ogc.gov.uk/index.asp?docid=1004561">http://www.ogc.gov.uk/index.asp?docid=1004561</a></p>
	<p pid="a.2047W.2/4">The Government will not provide the information requested because we consider the public interest is best served by not disclosing the internal legal advice held by DEFRA. Decisions by Government must be taken in a fully informed legal context, which includes assessing the perceived weakness of its position. It follows that the disclosure of internal communications between Government officials could prejudice the government's ability to defend its legal interests-both directly by unfairly exposing its legal position to challenge and indirectly by diminishing the reliance it can place on the advice having been fully considered and presented without fear or favour.</p>

	<p pid="a.2048W.0/1">The UK is the world's fourth largest importer of wood products. However, it is not possible for action to be taken specifically to stop illegal timber imports into the UK in the last 12 months, as timber is not currently identified as legal or illegal at ports of entry. UK Customs have made seizures of wood and wood products under separate CITES legislation but legality of their sourcing is not material.</p>
	<p pid="a.2048W.0/2">Once the recently adopted EU Forest Law Enforcement Governance and Trade (FLEGT) Regulation comes into force it will enable member states to prohibit the entry into the EU of illegal timber products from countries that enter into Partnership Agreements with the European Union.</p>

	<p pid="a.2048W.3/2">CPET is a free service that is available to all public sector bodies and their suppliers should they have need of it.

A number of public bodies outside of central Government have sought advice from CPET and we expect the numbers of enquiries to increase as word spreads.</p>

Centro are currently implementing a package of measures in Birmingham, Solihull, Wolverhampton and Sandwell as part of a major scheme bid that was given full approval in 2004 by the Department at a cost of 328 million.

	<p pid="a.2055W.3/1">Academies are established in some of the most deprived and disadvantaged communities in our country, and admit a high proportion of children from the most disadvantaged socio-economic background. The majority of academies have a significantly higher proportion of children with eligibility for free school meals (FSM) relative to both local authority and national averages. Indeed the average FSM eligibility at academies is 34 per cent., compared to a national average of 14 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="a.2055W.3/2">PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) are undertaking a full independent evaluation of the academies programme over five years and a comprehensive assessment of the impact of academies upon academic performance will form a vital part of this evaluation.</p>
	<p pid="a.2055W.3/3">Improvements in GCSE results are already in evidence, despite many pupils only having attended their academy for a few terms. Of the 14 academies open at the time of the last round of GCSE examinations, all but two showed an increase in the proportion of students achieving five grades A* to C relative to their predecessor schools, and the average increase between 2004 and 2005 in the number of students gaining five grades A* to C across all academies was 7.8 percentage points; some three times the national average.</p>
	<p pid="a.2055W.3/4">Several academies have shown remarkable improvements in their GCSE results since opening. The City Academy in Bristol, for example, has shown an increase of 25 percentage points in the number of pupils achieving five grades A* to C in just two years. Four other academies have shown increases of greater than 20 percentage points since opening.</p>

	<p pid="a.2055W.6/1">We have set out a core offer of extended services and activities that we want all children to be able to access through schools by 2010. This includes a varied menu of study support activities, including sport&mdash;at least two hours a week beyond the school day for those who want it. It is for individual local authorities (LAs) and schools to determine what provision best meets the needs of the young people in their area.</p>
	<p pid="a.2055W.6/2">Funding for study support is available to all schools and LAs through their base budgets, and also via the School Development Grant which, for Swindon, amounts to &pound;1,366,981 in 2005&ndash;06. Funding (approximately &pound;100,000 pa) is also provided for the well established &quot;Playing for Success&quot; Centre at Swindon Town FC, which benefits more than 350 pupils each year.</p>
	<p pid="a.2055W.6/3">We have also committed considerable additional funding to support schools in setting up and embedding extended services and activities. A total of &pound;2,050,321 has been allocated to Swindon over three years from 2005&ndash;06.</p>

	<p pid="a.2058W.5/2">The Government believe that suitable work opportunities, based on individual choice, can be beneficial for young people. Nevertheless, children's entitlement to education is paramount. The existing limits on children's working hours are framed to ensure that neither their readiness to learn when they arrive at school, nor their capacity to do school homework, nor their opportunity for necessary rest and leisure, is compromised by the demands of employment. There are no plans to change this, and no discussions with DTI on the issue have been held.</p>
	<p pid="a.2058W.5/3">Guidance has been given to local authorities that Directors of Children's Services should have functions relating to child employment as part of their remit, as recommended by the Task Force. No final decisions have been taken on whether and how the Task Force's other specific proposals will be implemented. They will only be implemented to the extent that they can demonstrate a clear contribution to the key outcomes which we want to see for all children, described in our Green Paper &quot;Every Child Matters&quot;.</p>

	<p pid="a.2060W.11/1">Curriculum Online is a successful way of helping teachers to find appropriate resources to meet the educational needs of individual learners. In 2002, the DfES commissioned the National Centre for Social Research (NatCen) and Bristol university to conduct a four year evaluation of Curriculum Online to examine educational impacts, operational effectiveness and impact on the suppliers of educational digital materials.</p>
	<p pid="a.2060W.11/2">The evaluation of educational impacts is being conducted by NatCen and comprises a series of three surveys of teachers (winter 2002, autumn 2004 and the final report in March 2006) and two qualitative studies (the first was published in autumn 2004 and the second in winter 2005). The findings of the qualitative studies are that almost three fifths (58 per cent.) of school respondents in primary schools and 78 per cent. in secondary schools said that they used the Curriculum Online website as a source of information when selecting software.</p>
	<p pid="a.2060W.11/3">The latest statistics (September 2005) show that the website attracts around 100 thousand users per month, these figures represent a 300 per cent. increase over September 2004.</p>

	<p pid="a.2061W.3/1">No quantitative assessment has been made, partly because this would itself place significant burdens on schools. Informal feedback suggests that new data collection arrangements are working effectively, with schools and authorities reporting that processes are more efficient and less resource-intensive, while the data that is made available to them is of greater help for their own management. Six pre-existing surveys have been incorporated into the Schools Census, lowering the overall burdens of collecting from schools.</p>
	<p pid="a.2061W.3/2">The Implementation Review Unit (IRU) is an independent panel of serving senior school practitioners which reviews the implementation of existing and new policy initiatives. The IRU has encouraged the Department to introduce a system of impact assessment for all initiatives that have workload implications in schools, including data collection and reporting and monitoring requirements. The 2004&ndash;05 IRU annual report welcomed the reduction in the number of new initiatives in 2005, down by 56 per cent. on 2004.</p>

	<p pid="a.2061W.6/1">One of the main changes arising from the White Paper will be a greater emphasis on Personalised Learning, with its stronger focus on English and mathematics, and on those children who have a particular gift or talent. We see this greater focus as being key to driving up standards and to tackling the persistent achievement gaps between social and ethnic groups.</p>
	<p pid="a.2061W.6/2">As I stated in the Schools Funding announcement on <phrase class="date" code="2005-12-07">7 December 2005</phrase>, funds within the new Dedicated Schools Grant (DSG) have been specifically earmarked for Personalised Learning. Primary schools will receive an additional &pound;230 million by 2007&ndash;08, while &pound;335 million will be available for secondary schools to deliver personalised learning for 11 to 14-year-olds.</p>
	<p pid="a.2061W.6/3">Those schools with the highest number of children who have fallen behind in English and maths will receive a further targeted &pound;60 million grant in each of 2006&ndash;07 and 2007&ndash;08, shared equally across the primary and secondary sectors, to provide more effective one-to-one and small group tuition.</p>
	<p pid="a.2061W.6/4">In making arrangements for the DSG and its distribution, we have allowed for the White Paper policies of more independent schools entering the maintained sector, and for more schools becoming academies. We do not otherwise expect that the White Paper will affect the Schools Budgets of authorities.</p>
	<p pid="a.2061W.6/5">In so far as White Paper policies cause increased costs to affect the LEA Budgets of authorities, we will provide extra funding under the New Burdens rules. We do not therefore expect there to be an impact on council tax.</p>

Where schools are playing a wider role in support of the education system we make funding available to support that commitment. We have offered the opportunity for specialist schools that meet performance criteria at specialist re-designation, to take on a leading role. In 2005, high performing schools had the opportunity to take on a second specialism, a vocational second specialism, training school status, or participate in a raising achievement programme.

Each PSCL receives &pound;8,000 to cover the time spent out of their school. We have also funded Primary National Strategy Learning Networks which enable groups of primary schools to work together to raise standards in English and mathematics. Lead schools in the networks, which are usually successful or high performing schools, receive &pound;17,000 in total to support the network activity.</p>

	<p pid="a.2063W.2/1">The formula used to calculate Schools Formula Spending Share for 2005&ndash;06 and previous years took account of the extra spending needed by sparsely populated rural authorities, mainly to keep larger numbers of small primary schools open; the additional costs for secondary schools are mainly from home to school transport, funding for which was delivered through the LEA FSS for 2005&ndash;06, and which continues to be part of the local government finance settlement. Since the formula for Dedicated Schools Grant starts from local authorities' spending on schools for 2005&ndash;06, which in two thirds of cases was above Schools FSS, so that will also take account of the extra spending needed by rural authorities. In distributing their Schools Budget, most local authority formulae take account of the need to provide extra funding for smaller schools, to allow them to meet the extra costs they face, that a purely pupil led formula would not deliver.</p>

	<p pid="a.2063W.5/1">The funding colleges receive for students taking larger programmes of study is reduced on the principle that colleges derive economies of scale as pupils take more intensive programmes, as costs do not rise in proportion to the size of the programme. It will continue to be the case that no funding is paid for parts of programmes larger than the equivalent of 6 AS/A2 levels. The current arrangements allow for the equivalent of 5AS/A2 levels to be fully funded with the sixth being funded at half the standard rate.</p>
	<p pid="a.2063W.5/2">On <phrase class="date" code="">21 October</phrase> as part of the announcements of our funding strategy for post 16 education and skills in 2006/07 and 2007/08 we set out our plans to revise the maximum qualification funding for both school sixth forms and FE colleges. The revised arrangement for colleges will allow full funding for the equivalent of 4.25 AS/A2 levels with the next 1.75 AS/A2 levels being funded at two thirds the standard rate. The revised maximum level of funding has been set to reflect the aim to encourage breadth at AS with more specialisation at A2.</p>
	<p pid="a.2063W.5/3">The maximum qualification funding does not include the additional per pupil funding available for key skills, tuition support and enrichment activities. It is possible to make use of this funding to fund courses of enrichment activities rather than seek funding for such courses as separate qualifications. We need to ensure an equitable share of resources between schools and across a range of pupils with different needs. The LSC's funding system recognises both the additional costs of larger programmes while maintaining a proper level of funding for those pupils unable to study a larger number of AS/A2 levels.</p>

	<p pid="a.2064W.5/1">My Department has developed a wide range of initiatives to enable frontline professionals to use their time more productively. These focus on greater use of ICT; reducing bureaucracy; and workforce reorganisation and training.</p>
	<p pid="a.2064W.5/2">We are promoting the use of ICT in schools to enable easier and quicker assessment of students' progress and simpler, more timely, and more personalised remedial action to be taken. It will also enable easier and quicker access to online resources, make lesson planning easier and save time for teachers; and lead to better quality lessons and an enriched classroom environment which improve standards for our children.</p>
	<p pid="a.2064W.5/3">We have better embedded ICT in the further education sector through the development of a self assessment tool for institutions, better provision of on-line e-learning materials and through development of e-learning training provision for leaders.</p>
	<p pid="a.2064W.5/4">To minimise any unnecessary bureaucracy burdens on frontline staff and thereby help them to function more productively we have established gateway groups in each sector to look at the level of bureaucracy being imposed on the frontline and to challenge existing ways of working with the frontline and between agencies. In, for example, the Higher Education sector we have established the Higher Education Regulation Review Group as an independent group of practitioners working in the HE sector and asked them to help identify new and additional ways to reduce existing burdens, as well as reviewing all new Government policies to try and ensure they do not create unnecessary bureaucracy.</p>
	<p pid="a.2064W.5/5">The workforce reforms we have introduced have also helped professionals to make better use of their time. In January 2003, the Government, employers and majority of the school workforce unions signed a National Agreement on Raising Standards and Tackling Workload that led to a series of changes to teachers' contracts. Teachers have been freed to teach and a wide range of support staff have been deployed to work with teachers in improving standards of teaching and learning.</p>
	<p pid="a.2064W.5/6">Each of these initiatives contributes to our Gershon target of realising &pound;4.3 billion efficiency gains by 2007&ndash;08. Productive time savings are expected to be the biggest slice of those gains.</p>
	<p pid="a.2064W.5/7">My Department reported progress towards our Gershon Review target in the Department's Autumn Performance Report. It will report further progress in the Departmental Annual Report which we expect to publish in April.</p>

	<p pid="a.2065W.2/1">Because of the relatively recent inception of policies to assist schools in their financial management, it is too early to evaluate of their success, especially when success is measured in terms of improved pupil attainment. Policies that have been launched include: the Financial Benchmarking Website (November 2003), the Financial Management Standard and Toolkit (May 2004) and focussed financial management training for finance officers, head teachers and bursars/school business managers in schools and local authorities.</p>
	<p pid="a.2065W.2/2">Our measurement techniques have been designed to ensure that we can monitor and report efficiency gains throughout the Gershon review period, which starts in the current financial year, 2005&ndash;06. Because of the timing of our data collections from schools we shall be able to report the first of these measures towards the end of the current calendar year.</p>
	<p pid="a.2065W.2/3">We do, however, collect very detailed financial benchmarking website user statistics, so we are able to track accurately how many schools and local authorities are using the tools, which provides an indication of the gains we may expect to see in subsequent years. Case study information is also gathered, providing information about the kind of gains schools make through using the website. An example of such a gain was a school which reported gains of &pound;6,000 a year on water rates as a result of action taken after using the benchmarking website.</p>

	<p pid="a.2067W.5/1">The British Educational Communications and Technology Agency (Becta) is making significant progress in delivering improved value for money for schools. The approach of national frameworks linked to regional aggregation of demands, coupled with local choice, provides a range of benefits for schools which otherwise would not be realised.

	<p pid="a.2068W.2/1">We are committed to ensuring further education (FE) serves the needs of the whole community and those learners, and their dependants, receiving a means tested benefit, and unemployed people on Jobseekers Allowance will continue to benefit from free tuition on publicly funded courses. Older learners receiving the Pension (Guarantee) Credit are already eligible for free learning on publicly funded FE courses. The Learning and Skills Council policies on funding free learning (fee remission) are based on the principle that those on low incomes should not have to contribute to the tuition costs of their learning. Learners of any age will continue to have access to literacy, numeracy and English language courses free of charge, as well as free tuition to undertake a first full level 2 qualification.</p>

	<p pid="a.2071W.2/1">By 2010 we expect all schools to be providing access to a core offer of extended services, including child care from 8 am to 6 pm; a varied menu of study support activities; parenting support; swift and easy referral to specialist services and wider community use of facilities. Head teachers, along with others, will want to ensure that these services are planned to support the overall vision of the school and contribute towards the School Improvement Plan. However, we do not expect teachers to provide or head teachers to directly manage all these new services.</p>
	<p pid="a.2071W.2/2">Schools working with their local authority may wish to nominate an extended schools co-ordinator to develop services, and may work in clusters with other schools and children's centres in their area. We are also encouraging schools to work in partnership with existing local private and voluntary sector providers.</p>
	<p pid="a.2071W.2/3">The National Remodelling Team will take a lead role in supporting schools through the development of extended services to ensure that it is consistent with the tenets of work force reform. Extended services can help remove barriers to learning and give support to pupils with their non-educational problems, helping school heads and teachers focus on their core job of teaching.</p>
	<p pid="a.2071W.2/4">We do recognise that the context of school leadership continues to evolve quickly, and so we have welcomed the School Teachers Review Body's timely recommendation for an independent study to report by December 2006 on the roles, responsibilities, structures and reward systems of the leadership group, looking at both current practice and likely future developments. We will announce shortly further details on the independent study.</p>

	<p pid="a.2071W.8/1">With the introduction of new funding arrangements from April 2006, all local authorities will be required to use a single pupil count, based on pupil numbers in the January before the start of each financial year, to determine their schools' budget shares. The use of a single pupil count will make a significant contribution to improved certainty of funding for our schools.</p>
	<p pid="a.2071W.8/2">At the same time, fluctuations in pupil numbers may cause difficulty for some schools and so our school funding regulations allow authorities to vary school budget shares in the face of exceptional pupil turbulence. The new funding arrangements also recognise that primary and infant schools may operate an admission point for their reception pupils in the summer term that the use of a single pupil count would not recognise. Our school funding regulations therefore allow authorities to make an adjustment in the January pupil numbers used to determine a school's budget share, by taking account of the number of pupils admitted at the beginning of the previous summer term.</p>

	<p pid="a.2072W.5/1">The requested information is not available. The Department does however; collect data on pupils' achievements in the end of Key Stage 2 National Curriculum tests. At the end of Key Stage 2 pupils are expected to reach Level 4 in English. Pupils are assessed in both reading and writing to arrive at their overall level in the English test.</p>
	<p pid="a.2072W.5/2">The National Curriculum tests measure the literacy skills that children are able to demonstrate at different levels of attainment. Children who reach Level 3 of the National Curriculum are assessed as having effective English skills and can demonstrate a good standard of reading. They are able to read a range of texts accurately and independently, tackle unfamiliar words and self correct when their reading doesn't make sense. Children achieving Level 4 have access to more complex forms of language and can access more complex ideas. They can use inference and deduction and can locate and use ideas and information.</p>
	<p pid="a.2072W.5/3">Achievement of the target Level 4 provides children with a solid foundation in learning from which to access the full secondary curriculum. Pupils who achieve level 4 or above at the end of primary school are six times more likely to achieve 5 A*- C grades at GCSE. This is why the Government has set a target for 85 per cent. of 11-year-olds to achieve Level 4 or above in English.</p>

	<p pid="a.2073W.8/1">The Skills for Life Strategy, launched by the Prime Minister in 2001, is the first comprehensive strategy to tackle adult literacy, language and numeracy skills across England. Since 2001, 3.7 millions adults have taken up 7.8 million learning opportunities and 1,130,000 of these learners went on to achieve at least one Skills for Life qualification.

	<p pid="a.2073W.8/2">Since the launch of the strategy, the Government have put in place the first national literacy, language and numeracy infrastructure, consisting of national standards, curriculum and qualifications. The next phase of the Skills for Life strategy will focus on raising the quality of teaching and learning, professionalizing the workforce, engaging adults who can benefit most from improving their skills, embedding literacy and numeracy learning in wider learning programmes (particularly vocational learning), and fostering progression to wider and higher levels of learning.</p>

	<p pid="a.2074W.2/1">The Primary National Strategy has been asked to renew and update its framework for the teaching of literacy. It has been conducting a period of informal consultation, including discussions with consultancy groups drawn from national samples of head teachers, teachers, local authority representatives, subject and professional organisations and higher education institutions. A consultation forum has been set up on the DfES website.</p>
	<p pid="a.2074W.2/2">The Primary National Strategy has started work on writing a draft revised framework for more formal consultation, taking into account points arising from the informal consultation and the interim report of the Rose review of the teaching of early reading. This work will be completed by drawing on the findings that Jim Rose will set out in his forthcoming final report. The draft document will set out key learning objectives for the Foundation Stage and each year of Key Stages 1 and 2, giving a clear sense of the progression expected. It will also provide examples based on a particular year of the range of supporting material that the revised framework will marshal to ensure that teachers and practitioners have easy access to guidance and resources to help them plan and execute high-quality teaching. The draft revised framework will be published for consultation at Easter 2006.</p>

We now have a clear framework for rewarding our best and most experienced teachers and the first Excellent Teacher Scheme appointments will be made in September.</p>

	<p pid="a.2082W.2/1">The independent study into teacher workload conducted by PricewaterhouseCoopers in 2001 identified that two-thirds of a teacher's time was spent on activities other than teaching. Following proposals made by the School Teachers' Review Body and extensive consultation, the National Agreement on Raising Standards and Tackling Workload was signed in January 2003 by Government, employers and the majority of school workforce unions. The agreement contained a series of phased changes to teachers' contracts including, from September 2003, that teachers would no longer be routinely required to perform administrative or clerical tasks.</p>
	<p pid="a.2082W.2/2">In order to assess the amount of time spent on such tasks by teachers, the Department uses the Office for Manpower Economics (OME) Teachers' Workload Diary Survey. This survey provides independently collected data on the hours and working patterns of some 2,000 randomly selected teachers in schools in the maintained sector. The survey asks teachers to record the type and duration of activities undertaken in one week in March. Surveys have been carried out in 1994, 1996, 2000, 2003, 2004 and 2005. Estimates from the survey data of the average amount of time spent by teachers in schools each week on various categories of activity, including administrative and clerical tasks, are shown below for each year the survey has been run:</p>

	<p pid="a.2093W.2/2">We subsequently announced, on <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-24">24 January</phrase>, that we will be co-operating with France to produce a common baseline design that both countries can further use to develop their own carriers. France will make a financial contribution in recognition of the investment UK has already made in the design (comprising &pound;30 million now and &pound;25 million in July with a further &pound;45 million at the end of the demonstration phase if France decides to commit to manufacture) and will contribute one third of the demonstration phase costs of the common baseline design.</p>

There have been no recorded incidents of harm being caused to marine life by Sonar 2087. We continue to support a sustained programme of research into the effects of active sonar.</p>
	<p pid="a.2095W.11/2">Copies of the environmental analysis reports relating to the Sonar 2087 sea trials conducted in 2002 and 2004 have been released to interested parties and are available in the Library of the House.</p>

	<p pid="a.2098W.8/2">I understand that items held within the RAF museum's reserve collection, at RAF Stafford, are available to members of the public by appointment, as the site is not suitable for general public access. The RAF museum regularly reviews the items kept on display at its two public sites, and suitable items from the reserve collection may be included in the revised displays.</p>

	<p pid="a.2107W.8/1">In the last 12 months, Invest NI staff have represented the agency at 383 meetings of committees/partnerships that have either been council led or have included council involvement. In most cases these meetings involved more than one council. A breakdown for each individual council area is given in the following table.</p>
	<p pid="a.2107W.8/2">In addition, staff throughout the agency, and in particular its local office network, are regularly involved in discussions with local councils in relation to a broad range of Invest NI's functions and activities.</p>
	<p pid="a.2107W.8/3">In the same period, Invest NI's chief executive also met with ten local councils to update them on Invest NI's current activity in their areas and to discuss any issues of concern (these meetings are also captured in the following table). During this period each council was also invited to meet with Invest NI's chairman and chief executive to comment on Invest NI's 2005&ndash;08 draft corporate plan.</p>
	<p pid="a.2107W.8/4">Invest NI has invested considerable time and effort to build a positive working relationship with Larne Enterprise Development company (LEDCOM) and staff from the agency have attended a total of 43 formal meetings or events associated with LEDCOM during the last 12 months. In addition there have been many other informal discussions between Invest NI and LEDCOM.</p>

	<p pid="a.2109W.0/2">My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland has also announced recently an independent review of education in Northern Ireland which will look at the strategic planning of the whole estate, taking account of provision for 14 to 19-year-olds. Conclusions from the review would therefore inform implementation of decisions following consultation on the draft Order.</p>
