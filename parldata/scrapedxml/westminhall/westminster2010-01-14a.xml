<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2010-01-14a.311.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1548" speakername="Jim Knight" speakeroffice="The Minister for Employment and Welfare Reform"  colnum="311"  time="014:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm100114/halltext/100114h0001.htm#10011454000161">
	<p pid="a.311.2/1">I am pleased to have another opportunity to discuss young people and the recession in the House. After my decision to call this debate, we in the Government were gazumped by the Opposition, who called a similar debate yesterday. Perhaps that explains why this debate is so sparsely attended. From my conversations with right hon. and hon. Members of all parties, I do not think that is due to lack of interest in the subject; rather, I think that it is because a lot was said yesterday and is going on elsewhere in the House and in Members' constituencies.</p>
	<p pid="a.311.2/2">During yesterday's debate, we heard about the importance of education and skills to young people in this context, so I will not say much about that aspect. However, as a former Schools Minister for three years, I am delighted that the Opposition want to debate education. I hope that it means that they will now back the September guarantee of a place in education for every school leaver this year.</p>
	<p pid="a.311.2/3">This Government have done much to improve young people's options in the recession, not just in education but in training, volunteering, work experience and jobs. Before I outline what measures we have taken and their positive effects, I would like to impress on the House the value of young people to business, society and the UK's economic recovery.</p>
	<p pid="a.311.2/4">Businesses need to plan for the future and to develop today the people and skills that they will need tomorrow. They need to find now the talented young people who will be the leaders and innovators of the future. If they sit back and wait for the recovery, they will run the risk of missing out on the best new talent and being left behind by competitors who have planned properly for recovery.</p>
	<p pid="a.311.2/5">Young people can bring new skills, new thinking and fresh ideas to a business, as well as bags of enthusiasm. My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1455" name="Kerry McCarthy">the Member for Bristol, East (Kerry McCarthy)</phrase>, who moved the motion at the beginning of this debate, entered the House at the last election, bringing new thinking, fresh ideas and bags of enthusiasm. Incidentally, she is considerably younger than I am. The vast majority of young people are eager to work, want to get involved and can reinvigorate a workplace. For society, having young people in work is obviously preferable to the alternative, but as well as the economic benefits to individuals and the public purse, there are also wider social benefits, such as the encouragement of responsible behaviour, better public health and a richer, more fulfilled society.</p>
	<p pid="a.311.2/6">It is vital for recovery to get young people into jobs. We need to foster their innovation, develop their skills and ensure that as we move out of the recession, we can take full advantage of emerging markets and continue to be a leading economic power. Yesterday I met the Indian Minister of Human Resource Development. As is well known and documented, the future growth of India, as well as that of China, is a great opportunity for the people of that country but also a challenge for us in the globalised economy. Without the talents of young people, we will struggle.</p>
	<p pid="a.311.2/7">We must nurture the talent of our youth. Businesses throughout the country are recognising that and signing up to the &quot;Backing Young Britain&quot; campaign. Firms such as BT and Marks &amp; Spencer are saying publicly that they recognise the potential of that untapped talent, and they are offering jobs, apprenticeships and work experience to thousands of under-24s.</p>
	<p pid="a.311.2/8">Our message is simple: now is the time to back young Britain. The Government cannot do it on our own. We are doing plenty, as I will discuss shortly, but the problem of long-term unemployment faced by young people is a challenge that we must all pull together to tackle. Business leaders across the spectrum are getting behind the campaign: Terence Conran, Peter Jones and Richard Rogers feature in our advertising inviting businesses to recognise young people's potential.</p>
	<p pid="a.311.2/9">Working with business, we need to develop a range of options, including education, training, work experience and, of course, jobs. The training and experience developed by Government and the private and voluntary sectors are crucial, ensuring that young people get the right skills for business and helping us to avoid a situation in which job vacancies arise and we do not have enough trained people to fill them. As a group, 16 to 24-year-olds can be particularly vulnerable to the effects of a recession. Starting out in the world of work during the worst global recession in 70 years can knock them sideways.</p>
	<p pid="a.311.2/10">Beyond those reasons for doing more are the negative consequences if we do not. Young people can be among the first to lose their jobs when companies make redundancies, because their lack of the experience that businesses value makes them vulnerable during cutbacks. They may have started work only recently, and they can lose out from the &quot;last in, first out&quot; policy. Once unemployed, they can find it more difficult to get a new job. Higher unemployment means more competition for jobs, and young people are too often pushed out of the job market by people with more experience who, given the difficult labour market conditions, are willing to accept lower-level jobs for less money than before.</p>

	<p pid="a.312.1/1">The headline figures for NEETs in this country, compared with the rest of Europe, have been particularly high for some time. There is a more complex picture beneath the headlines, and it is important for all of us who care about the issue-I do not deny the hon. Gentleman's concern-to seek to understand it properly.</p>
	<p pid="a.312.1/2">The NEET figures for 16 and 17-year-olds have improved significantly-they were starting to improve before the recession hit-because more are participating in education. Participation among 16-year-olds is now at 95 per cent. As a former Schools Minister for three years until six or seven months ago, I take satisfaction in that improvement. Indeed, I guided through Parliament the legislation to raise the participation age, which has not yet come into effect but is starting to galvanise improvement in the system. I was also responsible for negotiating with my friends in the Treasury, including the Secretary of State for the Department in which I now work, to secure funding for the September guarantee.</p>

	<p pid="a.317.0/1">It is customary at this point in the proceedings to say that it has been an interesting and lively debate-I will have to cross that line out in my notes. None the less, notwithstanding the low attendance, this is a vital subject. As the Minister said, a related motion was moved yesterday, so some points have already been covered in the House in the past 24 hours. It is good to have a Department for Work and Pensions Minister introducing the topic, because we can raise some specific areas that come under his departmental responsibility. That is what I shall do this afternoon.</p>
	<p pid="a.317.0/2">The starting point must be that young people's potential and talents are going to waste on a massive scale, which, in a sense, is what the Minister said at the start of his remarks. As I tried to point out through my interventions, it is not simply a case of saying, &quot;It's just about the recession.&quot; Even before the global downturn and before Britain entered into recession, as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1634" name="James Clappison">the hon. Member for Hertsmere (Mr. Clappison)</phrase> helpfully pointed out, the scale of young people not in education, employment or training was vast and rising.</p>
	<p pid="a.317.0/3">That is a crippling problem, and it is not amenable to simple or simplistic solutions. There are a variety of categories and circumstances of young people in the NEET group. I was surprised to read that a significant number or young people not in education, employment or training are either pregnant or involved with child care. I suppose one could argue that looking after a young child is a pretty active thing to be doing and the phrase NEET implies that people are doing nothing all day, which is not necessarily the case.</p>
	<p pid="a.317.0/4">Even so, there are clearly large numbers of young people who have had prolonged periods out of contact with formal education. They have not been receiving training or being paid for work, and we are concerned that once a young person has a prolonged period out of contact with the labour market, it has a damaging effect on them-not just this year or next year, but in the decades to come. Professor Paul Gregg who advises the Government on these issues has said that, when someone is in their 40s, one can still see the impact of a 12-month or longer spell of unemployment when they were a young person in terms of depressed wage potential and so forth. It is a waste both economically and socially to allow young people to spend long periods out of work.</p>
	<p pid="a.317.0/5">What can we do specifically about such young people? We knew that the Minister would list a whole set of initiatives-the January guarantee, the September guarantee, this fund, that scheme and all the rest of it. Governments have such initiatives; some of them work and some do not. However, a fundamental element is missing from all this: with the best will in the world, such schemes tend to cut in after a prolonged period of unemployment. I am aware, for example, that to qualify for some schemes one must have been unemployed for two years, for some schemes for one year, for others six months and so on.</p>
	<p pid="a.317.0/6">When I quiz Ministers about that, they say, &quot;You don't need to worry because from day one, we're giving people support.&quot; I am sure they are giving people support from day one, but it is not on the scale needed for some young people. Indeed, if they were given the scale of support that I am talking about from day one, we would not have a three-month, six-month, 12-month or 10-month guarantee because there would be nothing to add-it would all be being done.</p>
	<p pid="a.317.0/7">At present, support clearly steps up as someone goes through unemployment. Obviously, if we gave everybody everything on day one, that would be a big dead weight. As the Minister said, there would be a whole set of people who would have found a job anyway without help. Giving extensive, intensive support on day one to everybody is not a particularly good use of public money, when many people might well stand on their own two feet, find a job and not need such help. However, it is also not a good use of public money to wait for what in some cases, sadly, is the inevitable, and then to step in when the problem has got much worse.</p>
	<p pid="a.317.0/8">That brings us to the key Liberal Democrat difference from the Government on the issue. The Government tend to say they will ratchet up support as the problem gets worse-the longer someone has been out of touch with the labour market, the more help they will give-but they never seem to say from day one that they know the risk factors likely to lead to the young person still being in the system 12 or 18 months down the track. I appreciate that the matter is not without controversy, because we all know what the risk factors will be. Giving enhanced support to groups with particular risk factors would be contentious, but it might be the best thing to do.</p>
	<p pid="a.317.0/9">For example, a young person who has left school notionally at 16, but who has in fact probably dropped out when they were about 13 and a half, might come into a jobcentre. They might have been put on schemes and now be aged 18. They might have already been out of contact with the system for some time, have few or no formal qualifications and have poor literacy and numeracy. If the jobcentre they walk into is in a jobs blackspot or if they live in a remote rural area, one can start to think about the risk factors, such as poor public transport, a lack of an independent means of getting to and from work and so on. Why do we have to wait 12 months for what someone once called &quot;the bloomin' obvious&quot;-I think that was the phrase-when we know that we can intervene early?</p>
	<p pid="a.317.0/10">We could intervene early for those at the highest risk of being long-term unemployed and have much better value for money as a result, because merely being unemployed for a further 12 months makes intervention harder. People get out of the habit of getting up, making themselves presentable and having routines and discipline. That is not true universally, but when it has been a while since someone has had a job, been on a course or done something for which they have had to be in a particular place at a particular time, it is almost inevitable that things will slip. We know that people's mental health tends to suffer during prolonged periods of unemployment.</p>
	<p pid="a.317.0/11">All that is true in general, but it is particularly true for the young unemployed, who are the focus of the debate, because although a year of unemployment is bad enough for anyone, it is catastrophic for those whose adult life has only been a year long, because it becomes all they have known as adults. That heightens the reason for early intervention for those with the highest risk factors. I do not think that the Government are totally hostile to the idea, and there may be elements of what I am describing in the current arrangements, but they clearly do not go far enough.</p>
	<p pid="a.317.0/12">There is a question about whether we can spot people on day one. One cannot identify with 100 per cent. certainty which one of 10 people who come in will still be unemployed in 12 months' time, but statistically significant risk factors are involved. We need an objective basis; we cannot have a jobcentre adviser just looking at someone and saying, &quot;Well, we know he'll be back in a year's time.&quot; We would have to be scientific about it. I believe that there are statistically significant risk factors-they relate to the local labour market and the demand side, and the qualifications and skills of the young person-that would enable one to identify high-risk groups, for whom early intervention would yield a higher return and represent money well spent.</p>
	<p pid="a.317.0/13">My second consideration relates to early intervention in schools. When someone leaves school with limited qualifications and poor job prospects, we say that the rot has already set in, but we need, in the spirit of early intervention, to intervene to prevent people reaching that point. The Minister mentioned higher staying-on rates at age 16, which is obviously welcome, but clearly we must also talk about intervention much earlier in the educational process.</p>
	<p pid="a.317.0/14">The Department for Children, Schools and Families, the Minister's former Department, has commissioned research on more than 15,000 people on the drivers and barriers to educational success, and it has found strong links between poverty and poor outcomes, which we need to break. For example, it found that for the poorest fifth of the young people we are talking about, only one in five gain five or more A* to C grades at GCSE, including English and maths, compared with three quarters for the richest fifth. Are poor children stupid? No. Are poor children disadvantaged by the system? Absolutely.</p>
	<p pid="a.317.0/15">What should matter in educational outcome is not parental income, which probably provides the best guess for outcomes-if one wants to know how a child will do at school, knowing how much their parents earn is probably the simplest way of judging that. It should not be like that. We need to do far more to reduce educational inequalities by doing more to support children from deprived backgrounds and in deprived areas.</p>
	<p pid="a.317.0/16">Another example is that 15 per cent. of the poorest fifth of children are not in education, employment or training at 17, compared with just 2 per cent. of the richest fifth, so a child from a poor family is seven times as likely at 17 not to be in any of those activities as one from a rich family. I do not want to read out a whole stream of statistics, but I will give one further example that relates to aspirations: 76 per cent. of the parents in the poorest fifth would like their child to stay in full-time education beyond 16, which sounds quite high, but the figure is 91 per cent. for the richest fifth. There are differences across the income scale even in terms of what parents want for their children.</p>
	<p pid="a.317.0/17">How do we redress that situation? It is tempting to say that it has always been thus and that is how society works, and there is an element of truth in that. However, we can gear funding for education not just to deprived areas, which school formula funding already does to an extent, but far more to deprived children. Therefore, the Liberal Democrats have proposed the concept of what we call a pupil premium, an enhanced level of funding. We would withdraw tax credits from those on above-average earnings to pay for it, so we are being entirely clear about where the money will come from. By finding that money and spending it on children from disadvantaged backgrounds, we can raise the funding for those children close to private school levels-that is the scale of funding we are talking about. We believe that would have a transformative effect on the outcomes for children from deprived backgrounds.</p>
	<p pid="a.317.0/18">For example, schools in a particular area might hitherto have exercised what one might call covert selection, by discouraging children from the wrong side of the tracks from coming to their school because they will drag down the league tables. Suddenly those children would look much more attractive because they would bring with them a funding level that enabled the school to do more overall. The money would not have to be spent on an individual child, but the child would bring the funding. In deprived areas, that would certainly boost the level of funding and enable us to do much more.</p>
	<p pid="a.317.0/19">We cannot go on with the current level of inequality and the fact that parental income shapes a child's outcome. What should matter is a child's talent and effort and the input of the school, not simply whether one is from a prosperous background. My first point about early intervention is about identifying the high-risk groups on day one when they hit the unemployment system, and the second is about the need to ensure that school funding favours disadvantaged children in a much more geared way than at present.</p>

	<p pid="a.326.1/1">We have set out our plans and our intentions for doing that, and we stick by them. We would tell people in this country that young people here have great potential. The question is how we help them, through the education and training that they receive, to meet the demands in the economy.</p>
	<p pid="a.326.1/2">At this point I must diverge from the Minister's views, because I was a little perplexed about the philosophical approach behind his response to the issue-and it is a big issue for young people. It is not clear to me whether the Minister was saying that there is a great problem for young people, who have been hit very hard by the recession, or that things are not that bad, and they have not been too badly hit: that if we look at statistics in a certain way the problem is not that great. I am not sure whether he is saying that there is a great problem, to which the Government have answers, or that there is not a problem at all. We need to be a bit clearer about that, and to recognise that young people have been hit hard by the recession.</p>
	<p pid="a.326.1/3">That fact has been evidenced by the steep rise in the number of young people aged 16 to 24-that is our definition of young people for the relevant purposes-who are unemployed, whether we use the International Labour Organisation's definition or the claimant count. Whatever measure is used, there has been a very steep rise. The issue is not just that there are young people who are unable to find work: behind that there are other young people who are struggling in the recession and who may have found work but have had to compromise their ambitions. They may be in employment but waiting to fulfil their chosen career path.</p>
	<p pid="a.326.1/4">It is widely known that many firms froze recruitment last summer. Even those who have had the good fortune to obtain a job in their chosen field have sometimes found their entry to that work deferred. There are many reports of companies and professional bodies deferring graduate level entry of young people to whom jobs have been offered. We must recognise that there are young people who are unemployed and in need of help, and others who have been hit by the recession. We need to help all of them, but of course our particular focus is on those who have been unable to find any employment at all. The Minister needs to recognise the scale of the challenge.</p>
	<p pid="a.326.1/5">I heard what the Minister said about the ILO measures of unemployment. He knows that its figure for 16 to 24-year-old unemployment in this country is about 1 million, and even if one takes out young people in education the number is still substantial. He can contradict me on this if he wishes, but, for the sake of his argument, even if one subtracts from the figure young people who are in education looking for work, a significant number are still unemployed, and certainly a much higher number of 16 and 17-year-olds and 18 to 24-year-olds than in 1997. That was the situation in 2008, and I believe that it is still the case. If the Minister has different figures, I would be grateful if he produced them, but we must stop looking at statistics as a way of getting around the problem. Instead of trying to find some explanation for them or trying to put a gloss on them, we should just face up to the scale of the problem.</p>
	<p pid="a.326.1/6">Another thing that is evident, even in some of the material produced by the Government on youth unemployment-the hon. Member for Northavon touched on this point-is that there was a problem with youth unemployment in this country before the recession took hold. We need to face up to that fact. It is serious and needs to be reflected on when we come to choose policies and the means by which we try to get young people back to work.</p>
	<p pid="a.326.1/7">It is worrying that youth unemployment seems to have been creeping up, certainly on the ILO's statistics, since about 2003, which was obviously long before the recession took hold. I am looking at the figures that the Government chose to put in their White Paper, &quot;Building Britain's Recovery: Achieving Full Employment&quot;. Their statistic on youth claimant unemployment, as opposed to the ILO's measurement, would appear to tell the same story of declining effectiveness on the part of Government interventions to try to get young people back into work, and of youth claimant unemployment starting to creep up after about 2003. There will be interesting issues for economic historians in explaining how that came about, but it is important that we learn lessons from it, and from the policies that were put in place to help young people but which manifestly failed to do so. That includes learning lessons from what has happened with the new deal, because with unemployment affecting about one in five young people, we cannot afford to continue with approaches that have failed in the past.</p>
	<p pid="a.326.1/8">I heard what the Minister said about his chosen historical perspective. He mentioned the last two recessions. The White Paper selected the worst periods of the last two recessions, in 1985 and 1993. I heard at one point in his address the suggestion that the problems we face today are somehow the responsibility of the previous Conservative Government. I shall pass over that, but I think that we have to be careful about how far we go back on such matters.</p>
	<p pid="a.326.1/9">I remember-you may as well, Mr. Betts-that we used to have a programme on independent television called &quot;All Our Yesterdays&quot;, which selected things that had happened 25 years earlier. In the 1960s, my age group watched things about the second world war. I am afraid that the Government's policies and thinking seem to be about all our yesterdays. It would be better if they looked at what has happened in the immediate past, and the failures that there have been, and learned lessons from that.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2010-01-14a.330.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1548" speakername="Jim Knight" speakeroffice="The Minister for Employment and Welfare Reform"  colnum="330"  time="015:42:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm100114/halltext/100114h0004.htm#10011454000188">
	<p pid="a.330.0/1">With the leave of the House, I shall respond to the debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.330.0/2">We have had an interesting, if intimate, debate between three of us about an important subject. I enjoyed the other contributions, which were characteristic of both the hon. Members who made them. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1743" name="Steve Webb">The hon. Member for Northavon (Steve Webb)</phrase> gave an interesting speech containing many points with which I agree and I shall go into them in a little detail as there appears to be a bit of time to do so. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1634" name="James Clappison">The hon. Member for Hertsmere (Mr. Clappison)</phrase> gave a coherent criticism of what was going on, without really offering any policies at all.</p>
	<p pid="a.330.0/3">It is important that we intervene early. That is why in April we changed policy so that if there is evidence that young people who start claiming at 18 have been NEET for six months previously, they are fast-tracked to what would normally be the six-month point in the claim. There is a clear reason why we should take action much sooner when someone is at high risk of moving into long-term claimant unemployment. Six months is the point at which people go into the gateway for the new deal, which is even more relevant now that we have moved, as both hon. Members said, from 10 months to six months for the young persons' guarantee.</p>
	<p pid="a.330.0/4">The hon. Member for Northavon mentioned what in jargon terms people call segmentation: being able to do some analysis of individuals as they come through the door to work out the likelihood of them becoming longer-term unemployed, so that provision can be accelerated or so that the rewards to providers of getting them into sustained employment outcomes can be priced differently. There is a logic to that.</p>
	<p pid="a.330.0/5">I will talk through some of the measures in the White Paper, because I held a few things back from my opening remarks on the new measures for young people that we have included in it. We talk in the White Paper about the importance of considering how we develop segmentation tools. I do not advocate going as far as Australia has: from day one it uses a segmentation analytical tool to send people straight into the private sector, externalising the provision and support so that there is no state-run equivalent to Jobcentre Plus. That is too early in a claim, when there is a lot of vulnerability, because that tool has some problems in dealing deal with individuals and their different needs. In the White Paper we discussed combining the use of that sort of tool with the learned experience of working with an individual through our personal advisers in Jobcentre Plus-seeing whether we can combine objective and subjective measures to come up with something more accurate. That would happen in the context of introducing more flexibility in Jobcentre Plus.</p>
	<p pid="a.330.0/6">When I came into this job last summer, I was surprised by the disproportionate amount of debate about the use of providers. In terms of the work it does, and considering that it deals with 90 per cent. of jobseekers, Jobcentre Plus does not get anything like 90 per cent. of the attention compared with the provider sector, which deals with 10 per cent., although admittedly that 10 per cent. is harder to help.</p>
	<p pid="a.330.0/7">I wanted to be able to introduce more flexibility in Jobcentre Plus and to learn not only from experience internationally, but from our private providers, and I want to give some of that to people. The hon. Member for Northavon knows that the Jobcentre Plus district that he represents in Gloucestershire will be one of the pilot areas for flexibility for Jobcentre Plus. Our managerial staff will be able to use much more flexibility to do what works on the ground to get people back in, as long as they do not veer away from the fortnightly sign-on. If that means bringing forward provision in the ways he has mentioned, that is what they will do if they are confident enough that they can get the outcomes in exchange.</p>
	<p pid="a.330.0/8">In the family intervention projects that the Government are pursuing, we identify those who have the most chaotic lives in our communities-where family members might be responsible for much of the crime in a community, and unemployment and truancy might be significant problems. We focus on those families to provide much more intensive, holistic support to help them get back to doing some of the right things, thereby reducing the problems they cause our communities, but, importantly, giving them a much better opportunity to get on.</p>
	<p pid="a.330.0/9">In the White Paper, &quot;Building Britain's Recovery: Achieving Full Employment&quot;, which we published last month, not only did we set out in the final chapter the vision for Jobcentre Plus and some of the changes that we want to make in the delivery, but we set out new provisions for young people. We shall bring forward the young person's guarantee for 18 to 24-year-olds to six months. There will be 100,000 Government-funded additional training, internships, work experience and job opportunities on top of the 300,000 we have already pledged for the next 18 months, to help us deliver that guarantee. There will be access to a dedicated, named personal adviser from day one of the jobseeker's allowance claim for young people, with the ability for them to fast-track to the support available from six months if they think that is appropriate, which is along the lines the hon. Member for Northavon set out.</p>
	<p pid="a.330.0/10">There will be Jobcentre Plus support for 16 to 17-year-olds to help them access apprenticeships or jobs with training in addition to the normal support from Connexions, thereby giving a much closer relationship with the Connexions service, which some criticise for signposting people into education more readily than into employment-there will be more of an employment focus in its work. There will be a graduate guarantee so that all those who graduated last year and are still unemployed after six months will have access to one of the internship, training or self-employment places. There will also be a new subsidy of &#163;2,500 for up to 5,000 employers to offer new apprenticeship places for 16 to 17-year-olds, which shows that we are listening to what the CBI has asked us to do in respect of encouraging apprenticeships for younger people.</p>
	<p pid="a.330.0/11">I have much sympathy with what the hon. Member for Northavon says about early intervention, and we are coming forward with the appropriate policies. Self-employment will be a way out of the recession for people. Bringing the self-employment credit to three months will work for all people, not just young people, and will be another part of that help. The individual skills accounts and the skills pot will also help to further the integration of employment and skills, as set out in the White Paper.</p>
	<p pid="a.330.0/12">The hon. Gentleman mentioned education. The link between poverty and education outcomes could be the subject of a three-hour debate. Clearly there is a link, and as all Members would expect, I looked at it in some detail as Schools Minister. I also looked at the effect of the funding arrangements that we introduced. Since 1997, we have substantially increased the revenue funding for schools-by well over 50 per cent. When comparing local authorities that have higher levels of deprivation and disadvantage with those that have lower levels, it is interesting to see that the gap in educational outcomes has narrowed significantly. Funding went disproportionately to local authorities with higher levels of deprivation, and that measure has worked well.</p>
	<p pid="a.330.0/13">At school level, the gap has also narrowed significantly, according to the various quartiles. At pupil level, however, the gap has not shifted so much-although it has shifted a little-so it might be tempting to rush to the &quot;pupil premium&quot; or a funding formula that focuses simply on the individual pupil. As the House knows, we have gone through a process. The consultation period is closed, and consideration is now being given to the new funding formula that will kick in for a three-year period starting in April 2011. That formula is being considered, and the intention is to find ways of measuring deprivation at a more fine-grained level. If the gap has narrowed at school level but not at pupil level, we must ask whether the measures that the hon. Gentleman mentioned regarding school level would be the whole answer.</p>
	<p pid="a.330.0/14">During my period as Schools Minister, I concluded that the biggest single determinant of a child's success in school is the involvement of their parents in their education. That is why there is such a strong link between poverty and educational outcomes. How do we raise the aspirations of parents and make them confident to help their children with their homework? If parents had a poor experience in school, how do we break that cycle of low educational achievement? That is one of the reasons why I introduced measures to improve parental engagement in schools through better reporting to parents, extended school activities that include more engagement with parents, and opportunities for parents to improve their learning through schools. There were also area-level aspiration-raising measures such as the Black Country challenge and the Manchester challenge, which built on the success of the London challenge. From the woeful state they were in some time ago, London schools-and London pupils-now outperform the national average.</p>
	<p pid="a.330.0/15">Last year, or the year before, more than 70 Education Ministers were in London. It was the equivalent of this week, when Education Ministers are in London for the BETT fair in education technology, in which this country takes a global lead. A couple of years ago we took those Ministers on study visits to schools in Tower Hamlets. In 1997, no Government would have taken visiting Ministers anywhere near schools in Tower Hamlets. It is a demonstration of the success of the London challenge that schools are doing so well in Tower Hamlets, the most deprived education authority anywhere in the country.</p>
	<p pid="a.330.0/16">We agree that one-to-one tuition is one of the ways we can get at individual pupils and their aspirations, and try to help them achieve their full potential. When the GCSE figures were announced yesterday, I was pleased to see that the number of young people getting five A* to C grades at GCSE, had moved from around a third, to just shy of half-49.5 per cent. That is considerable progress, but clearly there is more to be done.</p>
	<p pid="a.330.0/17">The hon. Gentleman talked about the power of the Government as an employer through their procurement policies. I strongly agree. One of the reasons why we brought forward the fiscal stimulus in response to the recession was so that we could use Government investment to help save jobs and, where possible, to create them. Building Schools for the Future, for example, as managed by Partnership for Schools, insists that contractors agree to new apprenticeships as part of the deal. We are extending that approach across Government, because one of our three priorities in procurement policies is to protect skills and jobs, as well as creating new jobs.</p>
	<p pid="a.330.0/18">As the hon. Gentleman knows, schemes such as Warm Front, managed by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, helped insulate the homes of vulnerable people on lower incomes. There is the new boiler scrappage scheme, Building Schools for the Future, and new hospitals and roads. All those things benefit from the investment that we are putting in, which would be cut under Conservative plans, and have all been important in creating jobs. The building of the wonderful new Weymouth relief road has created 300 jobs, and I am pleased that at least 100 of them are local jobs. In my constituency of South Dorset, we have five new schools and four new children's centres. Recently, there have been three major lottery bids, two new roads and, of course, the Olympics will be coming to Portland. All those things have brought significant new jobs for my constituents.</p>
	<p pid="a.330.0/19">The hon. Gentleman mentioned the structure of the programmes, and in an intervention I pointed out the importance of the personalised employment programme as our way of testing the accelerator funding model. We are also piloting invest to save, so that we can proceed on the basis of an understanding of risk that is shared between us and our contractors, and gets the best possible price and outcomes. There are reasons for piloting the accelerator funding model. If we are to use segmentation, for example, we must understand how well segmentation tools will work. If we price according to the distance that someone is from the labour market-to use the jargon-we must understand how accurately we will be able to predict that distance.</p>
