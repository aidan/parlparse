	<p pid="a.431.3/1">I am grateful for this opportunity to debate one of the most important subjects for the people of Northern Ireland: the state of Northern Ireland agriculture. Agriculture is three times more important to the Northern Ireland economy than it is to the UK economy as a whole.</p>
	<p pid="a.431.3/2">The industry in Northern Ireland is predominately grass-based, with grazing livestock accounting for almost two thirds of gross industry output. The poultry, pig, cereal and potato sectors also have a significant part to play in the Northern Ireland agri-food industry.</p>
	<p pid="a.431.3/3">In Northern Ireland there are more than 28,000 farms, half of which are large enough to have at least one full-time employee. As in other regions of the UK, there have been great changes to the agricultural sector, resulting in many farms merging and becoming larger. The 3,800 largest farms account for 57 per cent. of all on-farm economic activity, for 82 per cent. of the dairy population, for 80 per cent. of the pig population and for 61 per cent. of the poultry population. That restructuring has resulted in the total number of farms falling by approximately 1 to 2 per cent. per annum, reflecting the fact that fewer younger people are entering the industry and that more elderly people are leaving their lifelong profession, handed down from generation to generation. In my contribution, I shall identify problems and express my concern about the fact that fewer young people are entering the industry.</p>
	<p pid="a.431.3/4">Although the age profile of farmers has not significantly changed over the past decade&mdash;the average age of farmers is 55&mdash;it is noteworthy that farmers on larger holdings have a younger age profile than those on smaller holdings. It is vital that those on larger farms are given the help and assistance that they require to survive well into the future. If those large holdings do not have a secure and viable long-term future, I am genuinely afraid that the agri-food sector, Northern Ireland's largest employer, will become unsustainable.</p>
	<p pid="a.431.3/5">Northern Ireland farmers supply the many food processing companies in the Province. Also, a large volume of milk is exported from Northern Ireland to the Republic of Ireland for further processing. The food industry has a gross turnover of over &pound;2 billion per annum, and it accounts for approximately 21 per cent. of the total for the Northern Ireland manufacturing sector. The largest two sub-sectors&mdash;milk and milk products, and beef and sheep meat&mdash;account for almost 50 per cent. of the industry's turnover, reflecting the importance of those commodities in Northern Ireland's primary production.</p>
	<p pid="a.431.3/6">The processing sector is heavily dependent on external markets, with sales outside Northern Ireland accounting for well over half the industry's turnover. It is not fully recognised that the food industry exceeds the performance of many other sectors of the economy. The agri-food industry is vital to the Northern Ireland economy as a whole.</p>
	<p pid="a.431.3/7">I turn to the key problems facing the Northern Ireland farming community. A number of key policy decisions are currently being debated at local, national, European and global level; they will have a massive impact on how the agri-food industry survives in future, and on farmers in Northern Ireland.</p>
	<p pid="a.431.3/8">The first issue is the Government's attack on the common agricultural policy, and the EU budget and World Trade Organisation discussions. During the past few months we have listened to the UK Government link any possible deal on the EU budget with a further reform of the CAP. I have to say that, at a time when the Government are chairing the EU presidency, the policy is flawed and will ultimately damage the agri-food sector, not just in Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK, but throughout Europe.</p>
	<p pid="a.431.3/9">I urge the Government not to surrender the UK rebate won by a previous Government and not to accept a deal that will be bad not only for UK agriculture but for the UK economy. When the CAP was reformed in 2003, it was sold to UK farmers in the guise of something that would prepare Europe for a world trade deal. In Northern Ireland, we are already starting to see how the reformed CAP is impacting on the Northern Ireland farming industry.</p>
	<p pid="a.431.3/10">Due to a reduction in export refunds for milk products, milk prices received by United Dairy Farmers, the largest milk processor in Northern Ireland, are 10 per cent. lower than this time last year. Over the coming months, many dairy farmers will struggle to survive as the price they get paid for their produce continues to decline. They will face losses rather than break even if that decline continues. Given the many hours that farmers spend on the farm, working for nothing is not practical and will drive many to the wall. A further reform of the CAP would undoubtedly mean support for agriculture being further removed, and I fear that that would result in many farmers turning their back on the land. That will have a negative impact not just on the economy but on the management and sustainability of our rural areas.</p>
	<p pid="a.431.3/11">This week finds us in the midst of the world trade summit in Hong Kong. The current proposals being tabled by the EU Commissioner, Mr. Mandelson, and supported by the UK Government, will jeopardise the whole rural infrastructure throughout Northern Ireland. They will lead to a reduction in import tariffs for products coming into the EU, and will result in further cuts of export refunds for products leaving it. That will have major consequences for both the beef and dairy sectors in Northern Ireland. I am also concerned that before a final deal is reached, further ground will yet be conceded and farmers will suffer even greater hardship.</p>
	<p pid="a.431.3/12">This summer, beef prices collapsed in Northern Ireland as a direct result of the importation of high-value beef cuts from regions such as south America. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1892" name="David Simpson">My hon. Friend the Member for Upper Bann (David Simpson)</phrase> will no doubt touch on the point if he is able to catch your eye, Mr. Cook.</p>
	<p pid="a.431.3/13">The Mandelson proposal envisages current import tariffs being reduced by a further 50 per cent. The impact of that would decimate the market, and with a reduction in export refunds for exports going outside the EU, the impact on livestock prices would be dramatic, resulting in a loss of producer confidence. Given that consequence, there could be a mass exodus from both dairy and suckler production, and the slaughtering off of the dairy and suckler herds which have taken decades to build up.</p>
	<p pid="a.431.3/14">I challenge the Minister today: is she content with the depopulation of livestock numbers throughout the United Kingdom? Are the Government satisfied with leaving the job of supplying the food for the UK to another nation? What will happen when there is a global pandemic of a disease such as bird flu or foot and mouth? What will happen when there is a major natural disaster in one of the countries on which we rely to provide us with our food? What will happen if bioterrorism affects the food imported into this country?</p>
	<p pid="a.431.3/15">Returning to the reform of the CAP, I say to the Minister that farmers have had to meet strict environmental and animal welfare standards. Are those same conditions and standards being requested from other countries that supply us with our food? My hon. Friends and I have grave doubts about that; we believe that other countries that sell their food in Northern Ireland and under-cut prices are not meeting the standards, and that strict animal welfare and environmental conditions are not being met. Those are serious matters, to which the Government ought to give serious consideration.</p>
	<p pid="a.431.3/16">In Northern Ireland, the implementation of stringent environmental legislation is causing considerable concern. Currently, both the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development and the Department of the Environment are discussing with the European Commission how best to implement the nitrates directive in Northern Ireland. My view is similar to that of many farmers: the environment should be protected from pollution. However, I harbour concerns that the implementation of the nitrates and water framework directives will result in a massive cost to the industry without any proper environmental gain.</p>
	<p pid="a.431.3/17">The implementation of the nitrates directive will cause massive problems for the dairy sector and the intensive pig and poultry sector in Northern Ireland. Those problems cannot be overstated; neither should they be underestimated. In early July 2005, I gave a guarded welcome to the announcement made by the agriculture Minister, Lord Rooker, of a reduction in the closed period required for organic manures and to account being taken of producers who out-winter livestock, rent winter accommodation and use straw bedding. I was disappointed to learn that the Commission was not willing to accept the points given to DARD at that time.</p>
	<p pid="a.431.3/18">Several areas need to be addressed before the action programme is formally submitted to Brussels. It is vital that the closed period for organic manures should be kept to a bare minimum. I would have preferred to see a system that allowed the spreading of slurry according to the prevalent climate conditions and those forecast by the Met Office. That seems more logical than using dates on the calendar to decide when and when not to spread slurry.</p>
	<p pid="a.431.3/19">The current proposal, which will prevent slurry from being spread on land whose gradient is greater than 20 per cent., is also open to challenge. Its very nature shows how detached policy makers, even those in DARD and the DOE, can become from the reality on the ground. I would welcome a commitment from the Minister that the Government will reconsider the proposal to ensure that farmers can spread organic manure on land, even if the gradient of that land is greater than 20 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="a.431.3/20">Another measure included in the proposed action programme which will severely limit the area of land available for spreading organic manures is the ban on the spreading of manure within 10 m of any other waterway. Do the Government realise that the majority of fields in Northern Ireland are small and have open drains? To have a policy that means that manure cannot be spread with 10 m of a waterway is totally illogical and, in many ways, impractical. Will the Minister give a commitment to look afresh at the matter and ensure that when the regulation is implemented, there will still be some available land left for the spreading of organic manure?</p>
	<p pid="a.431.3/21">Another concern is phosphates. I recognise that traditionally there has been a surplus of phosphates in fertilisers and animal feeds used in Northern Ireland. However, the farming industry has already taken major steps to reduce the levels of phosphates included in fertilisers and animal feeds. That alone should help to address the phosphate imbalance that has traditionally existed. I oppose the introduction of individual farm phosphate balances from 2007. In the longer term, it is vital that the Government find alternative uses for animal manures, particularly from the intensive pig and poultry sector.</p>
	<p pid="a.431.3/22">I welcome the group that has been set up in Northern Ireland and tasked with addressing that issue. However, much of the European legislation that the group is addressing has been on the statute book for years, so it is rather late in the day to set up the group, although it is welcome. That should have been done within the Department years ago. It is equally important that there is appropriate financial backing to deliver projects that will provide an alternative use for organic manure produced by the intensive sector. Without that, the measures will be impractical.</p>
	<p pid="a.431.3/23">I welcome the announcement earlier this year of the &pound;45 million earmarked to help farmers to make necessary adjustments to their holdings to cater for the implementation of the nitrates directive. However, there are a number of changes that could result in the farm nutrient management scheme providing better value for money. My party has called on the Government to introduce a roofing scheme to reduce the dirty water collected on farms instead of constructing additional storage capacity. The Government should not delay the scheme but seek to introduce it at the earliest opportunity.</p>
	<p pid="a.431.3/24">I have received numerous complaints regarding the specification of tanks funded under the farm nutrient management scheme. I often wonder whether the current specification required from farmers is above that required under the slurry and fuel oil regulations. It is vital that, when DARD is providing 60 per cent. grant aid for the construction of tanks, it does not gold-plate the building specifications. I always find that when regulations are introduced to deal with issues that have emanated from Europe, the UK Government gold-plate the legislation, rather than trying to bring the Community along with them.</p>
	<p pid="a.431.3/25">I remember one of the issues that we faced in the crisis in the pig industry. Another noble Lord was the Minister at that time, and I remember begging him to save the industry from total collapse. He told me that European legislation would not permit that; no help could be given. However, France gave help to its farmers. I pointed out to the Minister that a great European country, France, the leader of Europe, was giving help and asked why the United Kingdom&mdash;we are looked on as poor Europeans who do not know whether we are in or out of Europe&mdash;could not help its farmers.</p>

	<p pid="a.435.0/1">The issue of gold-plating is of concern to all industries in the United Kingdom. Does the hon. Gentleman agree that we should put tremendous pressure on those responsible for the interpretation of European directives to ensure that they do not interpret them to the maximum extent but reflect the spirit of what they are intended to achieve?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-12-14a.435.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1376" speakername="William McCrea" colnum="435"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051214/halltext/51214h01.htm#51214h01_spnew2">
	<p pid="a.435.1/1">I absolutely agree with that sensible comment. A balance has to be struck, but there is a desire to prove something to Europe by gold-plating legislation coming from Europe instead of dealing with the spirit of its intention, so the UK tries to maximise the legislation, instead of having a balanced reaction to it. That causes grave concern to industry in general and to agriculture in Northern Ireland in particular, bearing it in mind that some of the legislation could destroy the industry completely.</p>
	<p pid="a.435.1/2">To return to the case of the pig farmers, at that time we were begging our Government to save an industry that was going down. Many farmers had been encouraged to spend money by the Department. They did so and found that the Department left them high and dry when they were up to their eyes in debt. Many of them went under. In fact, farmers committed suicide because of the tremendous debt they faced because of the Department's encouragement and because, when they were faced with a crisis, they were deserted. There is now another crisis.</p>
	<p pid="a.435.1/3">I come to the end of my earlier story. When I spoke to the then Minister about the crisis in the pig industry, I said to him that the difference between the French Government and ours was that they would save the pig industry but ours would have it destroyed. In many ways, that was true because of the number of farmers who were totally destroyed at that time. It was not their fault. If one could say that they had contributed to their situation, it would have been their fault, but it was totally out of their control. There was a fire in one of the major factories; it seemed that one thing after another happened, and the pig industry was in a terrible situation.</p>
	<p pid="a.435.1/4">I referred earlier to finding alternative uses for slurry, particularly in the intensive pig and poultry sector. Instead of forcing farmers to invest large sums in putting up storage, it would be more economical to consider investing the money in a system that would process the slurry into a valuable by-product. That is more rational and acceptable, and would be more acceptable to the environmental lobbies in Europe and elsewhere.</p>
	<p pid="a.435.1/5">There are also small producers who cannot afford the adjustment to meet the new environmental legislation. Surely, urgent consideration should be given to the introduction of an out-goers scheme. Let us take the example of a small pig farmer who is asked to put up thousands upon thousands of pounds, to which the Government will add &pound;30,000 or &pound;40,000, to put in tanks in which to keep slurry. If he were given a certain amount of money to go out of the industry, because he would not be viable in the long run, it would be a more rational way of spending the money, and more helpful to the industry than giving him that first sum. Will the Minister ask the Department to consider the introduction of an out-goers scheme for the smaller producer who cannot afford the adjustment? Otherwise, they will have to apply for and take grants to keep going at least for a short period.</p>
	<p pid="a.435.1/6">Before leaving the issue of implementing of the nitrates directive, I ask the Minister to provide me with two assurances. First, will the Government give farmers more time to adjust to the new regulations? It is unacceptable that farmers have only until next August to complete all the works and submit the receipts to DARD. In reality, it is not practical and it cannot happen within that short time. Given that the Government still have to finalise the action programme and decide whether to introduce a roofing scheme for farmers, surely the additional time could be given.</p>
	<p pid="a.435.1/7">Secondly, I should welcome a commitment from the Government that Lord Rooker, the Minister in charge of DARD and DOE, will take a more proactive role in the negotiations. It is essential that the Minister lobbies on the issue to get the best possible deal for the industry.</p>
	<p pid="a.435.1/8">I spoke in the House the other day about the other side of the agriculture industry, fishing. Major debates are upcoming in Europe about quotas and how to deal with the fishing industry, yet I am led to believe that our Minister will not be present. It is vital that he takes an active role, batting in Europe for the farmers, taking on the battle himself and not leaving it to the officials. The Minister has good batting power, and I trust that he will lobby on those issues on behalf of the farming industry in Northern Ireland. Other pieces of environmental legislation likely to impact on Northern Ireland's agri-food industry are the water framework directive, integrated pollution prevention and control&mdash;the IPPC&mdash;and the climate change levy.</p>
	<p pid="a.435.1/9">I welcome the issuing of single payments to many producers in Northern Ireland. However, with time running out, I encourage DARD to ensure that the maximum number of payments can be made to farmers before the end of 2005. There is some disappointment that, according to DARD's timetable, approximately one third of producers will not receive any other farm payment this year. I was also disappointed that only 75 per cent. of the single farm payment was issued to farmers in Northern Ireland, whereas 80 per cent. of it was issued to producers in Wales. If it can be done in Wales, it can be done in Northern Ireland. I wish my Welsh colleagues well, and I am happy for them, but I am looking for the same happiness for the Northern Ireland farmer.</p>
	<p pid="a.435.1/10">Although many farmers have already received their single farm payment for 2005, many are still apprehensive about the inspection procedures under cross-compliance. It is vital that the inspection process is not over-zealous, and that the farmers are not severely penalised for minor non-compliance.</p>
	<p pid="a.435.1/11">I turn to the potato sector. Despite the area of ground that is planted in potatoes decreasing annually, the sector still has a key role in the Northern Ireland agri-food industry. Although I do not agree entirely with everything in the recent Quinn report, &quot;Review of Support Arrangements to the Northern Ireland Potato Sector&quot;, I believe that it could act as a basis for driving the potato sector forward. Northern Ireland traditionally had a lucrative seed potato sector. It is therefore vital that DARD puts increased resources into supporting this sector, to ensure that the critical mass remains in place to keep the sector viable.</p>
	<p pid="a.435.1/12">Until there is an agreement over the EU budget, we still do not know how much money will be available for rural development in Northern Ireland for the period 2007&ndash;13. We do, however, know that the budget will be significantly less than that in the current round of funding. The rural development fund includes measures to boost farmland biodiversity, to restructure the rural economy and to improve the quality of life in rural areas. These constitute tangible public benefits that will support the EU's social and environmental objectives. However, this budget has been cut by 25 per cent., compared with the Commission's original proposal.</p>
	<p pid="a.435.1/13">In the future it is likely that that share of the rural development spend will be funded through compulsory and voluntary modulation of the single farm payment. It is therefore vital that the larger farmer who is likely to have contributed a greater amount of modulated funds in the first place is able to receive some funds through rural development. There is an opportunity here for intensive farmers to get some assistance to meet standards through rural development.</p>
	<p pid="a.435.1/14">There is a significant lobby for rural development money to be spent on wider rural society. I support more funds going to rural schools, roads and health care. I also believe that the Government should be spending core budget funds on these areas, rather than targeting rural development money.</p>
	<p pid="a.435.1/15">The future of the agri-food industry in Northern Ireland depends on young people coming into the industry. I welcome the new entrants scheme for Northern Ireland and hope that it encourages many young people into the industry. Despite all the negativity I believe that there will be a bright future for those who are willing to adapt to new circumstances.</p>
	<p pid="a.435.1/16">A number of changes could be made to the new entrants scheme which would help to encourage more people to avail themselves of it. I would like to see a mixture of a lump sum payment and a low-interest loan available under the scheme. I would also like other young people who commenced agricultural activity over the last five years to be able to avail themselves of the scheme.</p>
	<p pid="a.435.1/17">If it is right that we have a scheme that encourages new entrants, it is also right to have a scheme that encourages and enables older people to move out and allow the younger people to get in. We are talking about an industry here&mdash;although the Government refer to it as an industry only when it suits&mdash;and in the past a farm enterprise was able to finance not only the older generation, but the incoming farmer and the new generation too. Quite often, two or even three families could be sustained on a farm holding. That is no more. Even the larger holdings could sustain only one family. Therefore, it is vital to encourage young people to come in and to encourage older people out. That can be done only if we have a scheme that allows it to happen.</p>
	<p pid="a.435.1/18">I should like to say something about the high calibre of young people in the industry. For over 80 years, Queen's university, Belfast, has been training graduates in a degree in agriculture and they have gone on to lead the industry throughout Northern Ireland and further afield. It is vital that one of our main universities in Northern Ireland provides a high-quality agriculture degree to train young people for the largest industry in the Province. Others offer quality training for young people coming into the industry, but if one of our main universities does not offer an agriculture degree, we will not attract our brightest students and they will go elsewhere to qualify.</p>
	<p pid="a.435.1/19">Will the Minister make it a priority to ensure that one of our universities offers a pure agriculture-based degree? I am concerned that in years to come the best export from the industry will be our young people, who are committed and interested in it but will go elsewhere to be trained. We cannot afford a brain drain from the agri-food sector in the Province.</p>
	<p pid="a.435.1/20">In conclusion, I shall deal with renewable energy policy. DARD is currently consulting on a renewable energy policy for Northern Ireland. That strategy, together with the recent announcement of a &pound;50 million budget to be spent on renewable energy in Northern Ireland over the next two years, will help renew interest in considering alternative land uses in Northern Ireland. I welcome this innovative move by the Government. With the current trend towards the globalisation of food products and massive increases in the price of oil and gas, many farmers look forward to the day when alternative land uses, such as planting oil seed rape for biodiesel or planting biomass for bio-remediation, will be economically viable. The Government's recent announcement regarding their renewable transport fuel obligations will hopefully allow some farmers in Northern Ireland to diversify into these new niche markets.</p>
	<p pid="a.435.1/21">I am grateful to have had the opportunity to draw hon. Members' attention to the importance of this industry. Many are the challenges that the industry is facing. I believe that Northern Ireland farmers are willing to face, and meet, those challenges. There is a future; I am simply asking the Government to ensure that they do all within their power to give the farmers that future.</p>

	<p pid="a.439.3/1">It would be a shame to lose it.</p>
	<p pid="a.439.3/2">The beef industry has gone through hard times, and I would like to comment on that. I will do so briefly, as I know that the Minister is eager to start answering all the questions that have been put to her. I welcome the Government's announcement last week that &pound;1.3 million will be put aside to assist Northern Ireland's beef industry. It is to be hoped that that, along with the money available under the fit for market initiative, will help to find new markets for the sector. However, I was disappointed that the Government did not provide more money to compensate for the beef special premium scale-back for 2004.</p>
	<p pid="a.439.3/3">The beef industry's finding new markets is solely dependent on the UK getting rid of the beef export ban. My party is actively engaged in seeking that. Only yesterday, our colleague, Mr. Jim Allister MEP, met the European Commissioner for Health and Consumer Protection, Markos Kyprianou, to discuss this issue. It is clear that the UK has now taken all necessary steps to satisfy both the Foods Standards Agency and EU officials that beef from these regions is safe to eat. However, I must also say that I am disappointed that the UK Government have not taken a more proactive stance on the issue during their presidency of the EU.</p>
	<p pid="a.439.3/4">With the removal of the over-30-months scheme and the introduction of the older cattle disposal scheme in the latter half of January, there will be a significant increase in the number of cattle coming on to the UK domestic market. My party has already lobbied both the European Commission and the Government on keeping the OTM scheme in place until the market opens up for beef exports. That would prevent a glut of beef from coming on to the UK market and continuing to depress beef prices, as has been the case over the past months. Can the Minister confirm that the Government are pushing for the lifting of the beef export ban at the earliest opportunity? Are they also lobbying for the OTM scheme to remain in place until the export ban is lifted? Those are two vital components that must go together.</p>
	<p pid="a.439.3/5">On the subject of beef exports, and on the assumption that the export ban will be lifted at the earliest opportunity, I wish to mention live animal exports. I understand that that is an emotive subject in the UK and that we cannot ignore animal welfare issues. However, it is essential for the live animal export market to be opened up for Northern Ireland, alongside the beef export ban being removed.</p>
	<p pid="a.439.3/6">Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that has a land border with another member state, and it is traditional for animals to be traded between the two countries. I was encouraged by the recent announcement by the noble Lord Rooker supporting the case for live animal exports from Northern Ireland. In 1995, the last year that Northern Ireland was allowed to export bovine animals, the value of that trade to the economy was placed at some &pound;34.6 million. Currently, in Northern Ireland, dairy-bred male animals are being humanely slaughtered at birth, which is disgraceful. There is no viable market for these animals in the United Kingdom.</p>
	<p pid="a.439.3/7">Over the 12-month period ending <phrase class="date" code="2005-09-30">30 September 2005</phrase>, there were 64,953 animals of dairy sires registered on the database. Only recently did DARD adjust its rural portal to facilitate the humane slaughter of those young calves. If there were live animal exports, and these animals were exported to the Republic of Ireland rather than being humanely done away with at birth, they would be worth approximately &pound;50 per head, which would make an awful difference to the farming community. It is therefore vital to the Northern Ireland economy that the export market re-opens for live cattle.</p>
	<p pid="a.439.3/8">In an era where farmers are compensated for environmental and animal welfare management, instead of given direct production-linked subsidies, it is difficult to see how the primary producer and processor can survive with current market prices. It is vital that there is an open and communicative supply chain that will help achieve closer relationships between the primary producer, the processor and the consumer. In my lifetime in the industry, I have always preached that that should be the case. For many years, it was a &quot;them and us&quot; situation between the farmers and processors. That has to change, but I believe that it will because the pressure coming on to the industry will inevitably make it happen, and that is vital. To survive in future, the primary production sector must be competitive and profitable. For that to happen, the major multiple retailers need to pass more money down the food chain to processors and, ultimately, to the primary producer.</p>
	<p pid="a.439.3/9">The current retailer code of practice has clearly failed the agricultural community, not just in Northern Ireland, but throughout the whole United Kingdom. Strengthening that code is vital so that a greater percentage of revenue coming from the food chain is passed down the line. The Office of Fair Trading should not only scrutinise the major multiples but investigate those companies' suppliers. I am concerned that monopolies can be created&mdash;if they have not been already&mdash;in the supplier sector of major retailers, due to their adoption of single sourcing policies in the United Kingdom.</p>

	<p pid="a.440.0/1">Does my hon. Friend agree that in Northern Ireland there has been a major bone of contention, in that while the housewife continued to pay high prices for the products on the shelves of these large retailers, in reality many producing farmers were receiving a price at the farm gate that did not even cover their costs? That bone of contention remains; therefore, there should be a major inquiry into that whole position. There is sufficient cake for everyone, but the issue is the division of it. Does my hon. Friend agree that an inquiry would be helpful?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-12-14a.441.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1892" speakername="David Simpson" colnum="441"  time="010:08:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051214/halltext/51214h01.htm#51214h01_spnew9">
	<p pid="a.441.0/1">I agree 100 per cent. with my hon. Friend's comments. Recent television programmes have shown the situation; he mentioned the pig sector, about which a programme was made. It showed how much it took to produce a pig up to a certain stage and how much people were losing by doing so. They took that same pig and transferred it into the retail side at the supermarkets; the price for the same weight was 10 times more. There is no doubt that we need an inquiry and we need fair play. That returns to my earlier point that it is imperative that there is a closer working relationship between the processor, the producer and the consumer. That must be done for the industry to survive. I hope that the Minister will take my points on board.</p>
	<p pid="a.441.0/2">My hon. Friend mentioned waste material and the renewable energy methods that need to be examined in the industry. A system called anaerobic digesters is currently being researched and operated in Northern Ireland. A company is experimenting, trying to develop an anaerobic digester that will take much of the waste material that my hon. Friend spoke of, along with the blood and other animal waste from the meat plants, not only from the beef sector but from the pork and poultry sectors. It will make a viable fertiliser for the ground, which will deal with the nitrates problem and all the difficulties in the industry.</p>
	<p pid="a.441.0/3">However, the company has come up against some difficulties, which derive from the lack of investment. It is a family with a private farm who have moved into this area and are forward thinking. Some problems have been caused for local residents, involving the odours coming from the plant. It is important that, although we are trying to help the company develop an anaerobic digester, we take on board the concerns of residents.</p>
	<p pid="a.441.0/4">My hon. Friend mentioned the money that has been put aside by the Government to examine different sources and alternative uses for waste material. I would encourage them to consider helping the company to do further research in this area. We have in Northern Ireland one or two rendering plants for disposing of dead animals and other waste, but that is not the future; the future is anaerobic digestion, which we need to examine closely. I ask the Government to examine it and perhaps to contact the company to see whether there is any way that it can be helped. I know that Lord Rooker wrote a letter to the company and that it was not too promising. Will the Minister use her influence to see whether something can be done? It is obviously the future for the industry.</p>

	<p pid="a.441.1/1">I wonder whether the hon. Gentleman is aware that funding for anaerobic digestion and for development of the use of slurry is available to other parts of the United Kingdom under the national industrial symbiosis programme, but that no funding has been allocated to Northern Ireland. I have written to the Minister to ask why. I will discuss her answer to my question at more length in my speech; otherwise I run the risk of making too long an intervention. I just mention that to find out whether the hon. Gentleman is aware of it.</p>

	<p pid="a.442.0/1">I thank the hon. Lady for that information. I had heard that the money was not going to Northern Ireland, but I thank her for confirming it. The Government need to consider the issue in order to help the situation, and they need to think of the future.</p>

	<p pid="a.442.1/1">Returning to the situation that my hon. Friend talked about, it is a lot easier for the Department to close places down&mdash;that is an easy way out&mdash;than to help them to overcome their problems. There are problems in the community that need to be taken seriously and overcome, but we need to deal with the underlying problems, rather than simply close down a company to get rid of a problem, and that certainly requires Government help.</p>

	<p pid="a.442.2/1">I agree. I encourage the Minister to use her influence. Perhaps she will even agree to a meeting with the company of which I spoke, or to receive representations from it and from me, to find out whether there is a way forward. I honestly believe that anaerobic digestion is the way forward for waste material in Northern Ireland, and indeed the United Kingdom.</p>
	<p pid="a.442.2/2">I thank you for allowing me to speak, Mr. Cook. I am sorry that I took a little more time than I said I would. I look forward to hearing what the Minister has to say.</p>

	<p pid="a.442.3/1">I begin by echoing the concerns of the two hon. Gentleman who have spoken so far. I am sure that the Minister will confirm that it is her full intention that the whole Government should fight for our agriculture industry, particularly with respect to farms in Northern Ireland, where agriculture is obviously more important than in other areas of the United Kingdom.</p>
	<p pid="a.442.3/2">I should like to speak about green issues. Not a lot of people know this, but my party has nominated me green Minister for Northern Ireland, which is a great honour. <i>[Interruption.] </i>Shadow Minister, that is, I hasten to reassure the Minister.</p>
	<p pid="a.442.3/3">I want to speak about the national industrial symbiosis programme. The hon. Gentlemen who have spoken mentioned alternative uses for slurry and referred to the lack of investment in anaerobic digestion&mdash;both issues are crying out for investment in Northern Ireland. The Government's refusal to allocate funds under NISP, as it is colloquially known, has greatly hampered the farming industry in adapting to change as it needs to do.</p>
	<p pid="a.442.3/4">I wrote to the Minister about the lack of NISP funding for Northern Ireland. The programme tries to marry different types of industry in a symbiotic way, so that, for example, slurry can be used for different purposes. It allows different parts of industry to work together in new and innovative ways, particularly those that help the environment. When I wrote to the Minister, she responded:</p>
	<p pid="a.442.3/5" class="indent">&quot;As part of the Priorities and Budget process, decisions on the allocation of resources have to be taken in the context of local needs and priorities. Therefore, in this instance, it was decided to allocate these resources elsewhere within the Northern Ireland Block where the need is greatest.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.442.3/6">Will the Minister say just where that need is greatest, given that we are talking about an industry that is suffering as a result of gold-plated European directives, and that faces all sorts of challenges? How is Northern Ireland agriculture to reshape and reform itself to meet challenges, which are not only industrial but environmental and global, if it is not to receive the support that is being enjoyed by other parts of the United Kingdom?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-12-14a.443.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1381" speakername="David Lidington" colnum="443"  time="010:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051214/halltext/51214h01.htm#51214h01_spnew15">
	<p pid="a.443.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1376" name="William McCrea">the hon. Member for South Antrim (Dr. McCrea)</phrase> on securing the debate. The subject is of even greater importance to the economy and people of Northern Ireland than it is to the rest of the United Kingdom. I appreciated the wide-ranging nature of his speech. It certainly alerted the House to the complexity of the issues that we are debating and the way Government policies and European legislation impact on many different types of farm and food businesses in the Province.</p>
	<p pid="a.443.0/2">There is no doubt that farming, whether in Northern Ireland or elsewhere in this country, is going through a period of rapid and sometimes traumatic change. There is the major reform of the common agricultural policy&mdash;a reform that is largely a response to the development of not just a European, but increasingly, a global marketplace for food and food products, with the additional competitive pressures that that brings to bear on our producers. We have, both from the public and the Government, pressure for stricter environmental controls and higher standards of animal welfare. However, at the same time as imposing those higher standards, we as politicians are asking our farmers to compete with producers in parts of the world where such standards of environmental protection and animal welfare do not apply. That is often the case not simply in countries that we might label as developing economies, but in some quite advanced agricultural competitor countries.</p>
	<p pid="a.443.0/3">It is therefore important for the Government&mdash;whoever it is that is in office&mdash;to approach regulation in the right way. I recall that about four years ago one of the Select Committees of the House of Lords produced a valuable report on the regulation of agriculture. It suggested a number of ways to change the culture of regulation which would not compromise the need for high standards and the need to root out the rogue elements that exist in farming, as in any industry. At the same time it recognised that, at the end of the day, farmers have to run profitable businesses and we would not get the attractive countryside that we all appreciate&mdash;whether we live in villages or cities&mdash;were it not for the existence of a thriving agricultural sector. It is important for us all to appreciate that, even in an increasingly urban and suburban society, we do not want our countryside to become simply a museum or an illustration on a chocolate box. We want it to be a vibrant part of the economy and a place where people can make a home and earn a living, as well as an attractive place for city dwellers to visit.</p>
	<p pid="a.443.0/4">The House of Lords Select Committee concluded that, among other things, there needed to be much earlier consultation with the agricultural sector about regulation, and in particular European regulation, that affected it. In the report, the Committee drew attention to how a number of key European directives&mdash;for example, those on the disposal of waste&mdash;had got to quite an advanced stage before anyone in Whitehall woke up to the realisation that farmers, as well as more traditional industries, were going to be affected, in some cases quite severely, by that new legislation. Consultation should happen earlier and the Government should firmly resist the gold-plating of European legislation; I agree with everything said by other Members on that subject. However, we also have to recognise and be prepared to say to the electorate that if we are going to rule out gold-plating, that will sometimes mean also saying no to pressures for even higher environmental welfare standards than those provided for in the relevant European legislation. Sometimes, although the gold-plating may be well intended, we in the United Kingdom end up imposing stricter rules on our own businesses than apply elsewhere in the European Union.</p>
	<p pid="a.443.0/5">My third conclusion from the House of Lords Select Committee report is that a change in the culture of inspection and enforcement in this country is needed. We certainly need fewer different inspectors and inspections, and fewer forms, which too often appear to seek exactly the same information as has been provided on a previous set of forms. We need fewer people coming up the farm track and knocking on the door.</p>
	<p pid="a.443.0/6">We also need something less tangible, but none the less important. I have lost track of the number of occasions on which farmers&mdash;whether in Northern Ireland, my constituency or elsewhere in the country&mdash;have contrasted the attitude of inspectors in the United Kingdom with that of inspectors and enforcement officers elsewhere in Europe. The farming organisations' view is that on the continent there tends to be a realisation by those charged with enforcing new rules that they have a duty not only to enforce the law, but to discuss with the operator of the relevant farm business how that can be done so as not to compromise the profitability and sustainability of that enterprise.</p>
	<p pid="a.443.0/7">However, the farming industry here certainly feels that too often the inspector comes in, bangs a wodge of papers on the farmer's desk and says, in effect, &quot;It is up to you to read those and comply with them. If you step out of line, I'll come down on you like a ton of bricks.&quot; We need to think our way into some form of co-operation between inspectors and those who are trying to run businesses and serve their customers. That comes through when we consider specific directives.</p>
	<p pid="a.443.0/8">I shall not repeat everything said by the hon. Member for South Antrim about the nitrates directive; his detailed points about time scales and the 10 m rule on the spreading of manure were valid and well made. I hope that the Minister will say a word about the water framework directive, which will clearly have a massive impact on agriculture throughout Northern Ireland. The fact that in future river quality is to be measured in biological rather than chemical terms marks a very significant change.</p>
	<p pid="a.443.0/9">It seemed to me from the Select Committee report and other material on that directive that we are still very much in the dark about exactly what standards are to be applied. Yet, from memory, the directive&mdash;at least, its initial stages&mdash;is supposed to be implemented by 2010. The changes required to apply the directive will probably mean considerable planning to ensure that businesses can make the adjustments in time. I hope that we will get greater clarity from the Government on that point.</p>
	<p pid="a.443.0/10">I should also like to express my concern about two aspects of the reform of the CAP. First, I am concerned about the delay in the introduction of the entry-level scheme for Northern Ireland. I had always understood, when the CAP was being negotiated, that the Government regarded the introduction of the entry-level schemes throughout the United Kingdom as integral to their vision of the future of agriculture, and that it was a way to turn farm support payments away from subsidising production and towards providing support for the environmental stewardship carried out by farmers and land managers. Yet I am told by the Ulster Farmers Union that the introduction of the entry-level scheme in the Province is to be delayed for several years. I should like to know why. Is that due to budgetary constraints, or are the Government considering a pilot scheme that might operate with farms in some parts of the Province?</p>
	<p pid="a.443.0/11">Secondly, I am concerned about cross-compliance, which was touched on in earlier contributions. The industry fears that minor, probably unintentional, lapses could lead to a disproportionate cut in farm payments in a particular year, yet I can recall the repeated assurances from Ministers, while the CAP reforms were being negotiated, that cross-compliance would only amount to what good, well-run farms in the United Kingdom were doing already in terms of environmental standards. I hope that we are not seeing what might be described as agricultural mission creep, where environmental standards that one might have expected to fall within the ambit of an entry-level scheme will instead be imposed through the use of cross-compliance. I hope that the Minister can provide some reassurance on that point.</p>
	<p pid="a.443.0/12">I should like to make two points that particularly affect the cattle industry. First, on the beef export ban and the over-30-months scheme, will the Minister say where we are now on the Commission's expected proposal to lift the export ban on cattle born on or after <phrase class="date" code="1996-08-01">1 August 1996</phrase>? We have been waiting a long time for that. Farmers in Northern Ireland feel especially aggrieved by the delay, because they have not had the curse of BSE that we have had on the mainland of Great Britain and they have seen producers in the Republic of Ireland being able to continue to export their beef and beef products while Northern Ireland's farmers have been constrained.</p>
	<p pid="a.443.0/13">It is well over a year since the Commission's food and veterinary office published a satisfactory report on the United Kingdom's BSE controls. I should like to know why we are still waiting. Is the delay with the Commission, or is there foot-dragging on the part of other beef producers in the EU? If that is so, will the Minister name and shame those countries?</p>
	<p pid="a.443.0/14">Secondly, there is a consultation going on about how the new rules on specified material might operate following the hoped-for permission being given for exports. I read with concern in DARD's impact assessment about the possible impact on small rural producers in Northern Ireland and on small abattoirs if the Government did not make use of the derogation to allow the spinal column to be removed at butcher's shops, but instead ruled that it could take place only at certain licensed cutting plants. I very much hope that the Government will listen carefully to the views of the industry&mdash;retailers as well as farmers&mdash;and of customers who like to eat a piece of mature, grass-reared, well-hung beef, and are willing to pay a premium for it in the shops.</p>
	<p pid="a.443.0/15">Finally, can I press the Minister to say something about bovine tuberculosis? I am sure that, like me, the Minister tuned into &quot;Farming Today&quot; this morning and heard that her colleague, the Under-Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1580" name="Ben Bradshaw">the hon. Member for Exeter (Mr. Bradshaw)</phrase>, is due to make a major announcement on the Government's bovine TB policy tomorrow. I know that the number of reactors in Northern Ireland fell a bit last year compared with the previous year, but I return time and again to the fact that the evidence from the Irish Republic is overwhelming: although the culling of wildlife, and in particular of badgers, is not a panacea, it is effective as part of an overall TB eradication strategy. Northern Ireland's cattle farmers face a crisis. This is a drain year after year on revenues that the Government could well spend on other priorities, and I hope that the Minister will give us some news on that, too.</p>

	<p pid="a.446.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1376" name="William McCrea">the hon. Member for South Antrim (Dr. McCrea)</phrase> on securing the debate, and on the reasoned, knowledgeable and passionate way in which he put forward his views. He clearly feels strongly about the subject, and I assure him that my ministerial colleagues and I feel equally strongly about it.</p>
	<p pid="a.446.0/2">We must ensure that we have a sustainable and efficient agriculture industry in Northern Ireland that is capable of addressing the challenges posed by the rapidly changing society of the 21st century. Contributions to the debate have highlighted many of the current difficulties facing agriculture. If the Northern Ireland industry is to move forward in what is an increasingly competitive environment, it must be fit for purpose and in a position to embrace change and exploit the opportunities that change inevitably brings. Both hon. Members from Northern Ireland made that point.</p>
	<p pid="a.446.0/3">In the time available to me, I will do my best to address the various points that have been raised. With regard to the broad charge that the industry is in decline, the 2005 reduction in the numbers of farmers and farm businesses does not represent evidence of a major exodus from the industry; it is no more than a continuation of existing trends. The rate of decline in the last 12 months is in line with the trend over the past five years&mdash;a decrease of about 2 per cent. per annum, as the hon. Member for South Antrim said. Similar patterns of structural adjustment are occurring across Europe. In many cases, the decision to exit the industry coincides with farmer retirement. It is also important to remember that the overall reduction in numbers improves the structure of the sector, and that it will contribute to its future competitiveness and sustainability.</p>
	<p pid="a.446.0/4">On the age structure of the farm work force, the evidence that we have suggests that the age profile of farmers in Northern Ireland is relatively stable and that it is in line with the average for the EU 15 member states. The Department of Agriculture and Rural Development operates a new entrants scheme, which was launched in June this year. Its aim is to encourage and give support to young entrants who want to build a future in the industry. I can give further information on that.</p>
	<p pid="a.446.0/5">On the request for a mixture of a lump sum and interest rate subsidy, I have received legal advice and, unfortunately, that is not possible. However, research shows that the interest rate subsidy offers better value for money in respect of encouraging new entrants into the industry and sustaining them. Applicants to the new entrants scheme must have been in business in their own right for no more than one year. We are bound by the legislation on that.</p>
	<p pid="a.446.0/6">Some Members also referred to the announcement in the draft budget that DARD was proposing to delay the start of the entry-level countryside management scheme in 2008. That has been a cause of concern for a number of stakeholders, including the main farming organisations, which have made representations to my noble Friend Lord Rooker, who has ministerial responsibility for agriculture. I understand that the Department is looking into that again, to see if there is anything we can do to bring that forward. An earlier starting date would be of assistance.</p>
	<p pid="a.446.0/7">The issue of the WTO meeting in Hong Kong was raised. Progress with ongoing WTO negotiations in the development round has been slow, but significant benefits could be delivered to developed and developing countries as a result of an agreement.</p>
	<p pid="a.446.0/8">The CAP reforms being implemented will help the industry focus on meeting market demands and improving competitiveness. The Department has in place numerous measures to help the industry make the adjustment. They will ultimately put the industry in a position to face the market pressures that are causing difficulties.</p>
	<p pid="a.446.0/9"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1892" name="David Simpson">The hon. Member for Upper Bann (David Simpson)</phrase> described himself as a walking advert for the Northern Ireland beef industry. I congratulate him on his commitment. The hon. Gentleman, along with the hon. Members for South Antrim and for Aylesbury (Mr. Lidington), raised a number of issues about beef imports. Hon. Members will be pleased to hear that imports to the UK for the first nine months of 2005 were 18 per cent. below those for the equivalent period in 2004. More than half of the 2005 imports came from the Republic of Ireland, and less than a quarter came from south America, Brazil, Uruguay and Argentina.</p>
	<p pid="a.446.0/10">The issue of standards was also raised. Beef can be imported to the EU only from countries and establishments that meet strict EU food, veterinary health and hygiene requirements. Full compliance is ensured by inspections carried out at border posts. There is also full traceability under EU-wide beef labelling rules. Looking to the longer term, we must recognise that there is greater competition, and we must address it and help prepare the industry. Rather than trying to stifle trade, we must support the industry to allow it to compete.</p>
	<p pid="a.446.0/11">All the hon. Members referred to the beef export ban. The recent lifting of the over-30-months rule is a significant step forward. It is a welcome boost for the food industry and for Northern Ireland's beef farmers, who can now enter their older cattle into the food chain. There are three plants that have been approved to slaughter OTM cattle for human consumption. The UK has met all conditions that the Commission set for lifting the ban. Effective BSE controls and traceability systems are in place. BSE has been reduced to achieve moderate risk status and the OTM rule has now ended.</p>
	<p pid="a.446.0/12">I recognise the concerns that were raised about the matter, and the UK is pressing the Commission for a proposal to be made and adopted to lift the export ban as early as possible in 2006. I understand the concern that any gap between the OTM scheme ending and exports resuming may cause market difficulties. The Commission has made it clear that it is opposed to any extension of the OTM scheme, and there are mechanisms available to consider what action is needed to deal with market difficulties. We are pressing for the lifting of the export ban as soon as possible. It will provide new opportunities for agriculture.</p>
	<p pid="a.446.0/13">Several hon. Members raised the issue of the nitrates directive and what compliance will mean for the industry locally. The Government are keenly aware of the significance of the issue, and DARD and DOE officials recently met the Commission yet again to discuss outstanding issues about the draft action programme and secure a viable way forward. There have been continual meetings. I remember, in my previous incarnation as a DOE Minister, meeting the industry myself to discuss the matter. The Government have been working with the industry for some time to find ways forward. The process has been protracted and difficult, and there are still differences between us and the Commission over the matter.</p>
	<p pid="a.446.0/14">The position on a closed period for spreading organic manure has not yet been finalised. However, I can assure hon. Members that phosphorus balance measures at individual farm level will not be required at this stage. That may give some reassurance to the hon. Member for South Antrim, who raised the issue.</p>
	<p pid="a.446.0/15">The draft action programme will be issued to stakeholders and discussed at their next meeting in January. We are seeking a balance on the issue. We recognise the pressures on farmers, and we shall do all that we can to ensure that we strike a balance between letting the industry get on with the business of farming and recognising the support that we must give to the environment.</p>
	<p pid="a.446.0/16">If we consider the money that has been made available, we see that significant resources have been allocated to the industry. As part of the revised budget in December 2004, &pound;45 million was announced; that money is still available under those proposals. Moreover, &pound;16.6 million has been allocated for 2006&ndash;07 and &pound;28.4 million for 2007&ndash;08, so the Government are going a long way to assist farmers in that regard.</p>
	<p pid="a.446.0/17">The farm nutrient management scheme was also mentioned. Initial uptake has been slower than expected and the closing date has been extended to <phrase class="date" code="">31 March 2006</phrase>. However, commitments totalling &pound;10 million have now been made out of a total Government provision of &pound;45 million, which represents additional support for the industry.</p>
	<p pid="a.446.0/18">The hon. Member for South Antrim raised concerns about pig farming. I would refute the accusation that we have abandoned that sector or any other. It is always the role of the Department to give support and advice whenever possible within the constraints of EU legislation and within budgetary constraints. Hon. Members will be aware of the pressures on the draft budget. The hon. Members for South Antrim and for Upper Bann have made numerous representations to me about other areas of the budget. Within those constraints, the Department does everything it can to support farmers.</p>
	<p pid="a.446.0/19">The hon. Member for South Antrim raised the issue of single farm payments being made in Wales and asked if our payments could be as good as those in Wales. I think that ours are even better. We are meeting the targets: of all applicants, 71 per cent. will receive payments totalling &pound;103 million by Christmas and by the end of December that will have risen to 73 per cent. receiving &pound;110 million. The hon. Gentleman mentioned the figure of 80 per cent. in Wales. There is a slight difference is the way that the money is counted; it is not the case that less money is being paid out in Northern Ireland. From a slow start, that represents very good progress, given that the applications were made in May and so much money is being paid by the end of the year.</p>
	<p pid="a.446.0/20">Renewables and the environment were mentioned. It is worth flagging up that in the draft budget announced today there will be &pound;50 million for an environment and energy fund, which will allow us to look for new opportunities to bring Northern Ireland to the fore in the field of renewables. As an energy Minister, I have a particular interest in that.</p>
	<p pid="a.446.0/21">The hon. Member for Upper Bann mentioned anaerobic digestion. DARD has carried out extensive research and development in this area. It has offered financial assistance of about &pound;3 million to a centralised anaerobic digestion plant; that particular project faced local opposition. However, part of the new strategy is the work of an expert group on animal waste, and research and development in the Department will help us learn what else can be done. We shall consider the opportunities that can be made available.</p>
	<p pid="a.446.0/22">On university provision, I assure the hon. Member for South Antrim that we are working to ensure that there is in Northern Ireland a degree-level qualification in agricultural technology. There is extensive provision already in the sector, of which we should be proud.</p>
	<p pid="a.446.0/23">The power of supermarkets was mentioned. I assure the hon. Gentleman that the Government are working closely with supermarkets on local sourcing; I know that he has asked a parliamentary question about that recently and has further information. I understand the concerns raised about the increasing concentration and buying power of supermarkets. I am concerned about allegations that multiple retailers are making excess profits at the expense of producers. If there is specific evidence of that, I ask hon. Members to give it to the Office of Fair Trading, and action should be taken.</p>
	<p pid="a.446.0/24">The hon. Member for Aylesbury raised the issue of badgers and TB. He will be aware that the badger stakeholder group is considering the matter at the moment, and the results of the work will be presented to the badger group at a further meeting. It is expected to report to Lord Rooker in early 2006. I recognise the strongly held views on both sides of that argument. We felt that research and investigation was the appropriate way forward.</p>
	<p pid="a.446.0/25">I hope that I have addressed as many of the points raised during the debate as possible. The breadth of issues raised shows the scale of interest in this subject in Northern Ireland and the challenges faced by the industry. There are numerous difficulties; I assure hon. Members that the Department will work closely with farmers and those in the industry to do all that we can to support them because that is important to the future well-being of the industry and the economy of Northern Ireland.</p>

	Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency
</major-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-12-14a.451.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1635" speakername="Peter Atkinson" colnum="451"  time="011:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051214/halltext/51214h02.htm#51214h02_spnew0">
	<p pid="a.451.1/1">I am grateful for the opportunity to have a short debate on what has become an important matter. After I applied for this Adjournment debate, <i>The Mail on Sunday</i> exposed the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency for selling the names and addresses of many tens of thousands of motorists, and since then the issue has moved up the political agenda considerably.</p>
	<p pid="a.451.1/2">From my point of view, the issue arose in a small way when Tesco opened a new store on the edge of Hexham, the main town in my constituency, which was recently voted the best market town in the UK. Leaving that aside, Tesco has a large car park in the centre of the town, adjacent to the council car park where charges are made, and in order to protect its car park it introduced a parking control system. Much to our surprise, little yellow signs went up around the car park with an illustration of a camera on them, saying that if people overstayed their welcome in the car park, which was three hours, their registration numbers would be photographed and the company would apply to the DVLA for their names and addresses and they would then be asked to pay a charge of &pound;70, which would be given to charity.</p>
	<p pid="a.451.1/3">That caused a certain amount of outrage in the community as most of us felt that this was an abuse of the powers of the DVLA. We were amazed that a company such as Tesco&mdash;or probably its parking contractor&mdash;was able to obtain names and addresses in this way. As a consequence of that and a certain amount of local publicity, I wrote to the Minister, who replied courteously and quickly, in rather unconcerned terms. He wrote to me on <phrase class="date" code="">10 November</phrase> explaining that under regulation 27 of the Road Vehicles (Registration and Licensing) Regulations 2002, the DVLA was free to give the names and addresses of car owners to anyone who could demonstrate a reasonable cause for their request. He pointed out that:</p>
	<p pid="a.451.1/4" class="indent">&quot;'Reasonable cause' is not defined in law but release is normally associated with road safety, the direct involvement of a vehicle in road traffic incidents, the enforcement of road traffic legislation and the collection of taxes.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.451.1/5">He added&mdash;this is important&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.451.1/6" class="indent">&quot;Requests from private car park enforcement companies meet the 'reasonable cause' criteria. Landlords would have great difficulty in enforcing their rights to their property if this was not the case.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.451.1/7">That would seem to most people to be a reasonable definition of circumstances in which the DVLA should give out names and addresses, but from that it never crossed our minds that this provision would be used in wholesale fashion by large supermarket companies and others.</p>
	<p pid="a.451.1/8">Finally, in his letter, the Minister directed us to the website of the Information Commissioner, <a href="http://www.informationcommissioner.gov.uk">www. informationcommissioner.gov.uk</a>, saying that the Information Commissioner was aware of the arrangements for private car park enforcement and had issued advice on the website.</p>
	<p pid="a.451.1/9">That was fine until <phrase class="date" code="">27 November</phrase> when <i>The Mail on Sunday</i> published details of a large-scale investigation, which revealed the enormous scale of the releasing of information by the DVLA. The paper identified 157 different organisations that had computer access to the DVLA records and were able to obtain names and addresses of drivers for a whole variety of reasons. Among them was a company called Euro Parking Collection, which collects parking tickets incurred by British motorists abroad. They get in touch with the DVLA here and then the fines are issued in order to be repatriated to the country of origin.</p>
	<p pid="a.451.1/10">Among those other organisations that were revealed as having rights of access to the information were not just car park owners, but car park clampers as well. Many of us will know the circumstances under which many of these car park clampers operate, and it is fair to say that they work very close to the edge of the law. Indeed, some of those identified as having the right of access to the DVLA records have criminal convictions for illegal clamping and what is effectively blackmail. Others with the right of access are bailiffs, credit control companies, debt collection agencies, property management firms, leisure centres, solicitors and even MBNA&mdash;which is, as <i>The Mail of Sunday</i> put it, one of the world's largest loan and financial services companies. When MBNA was asked, it said that it wanted it to protect the private car park at its Chester offices.</p>
	<p pid="a.451.1/11">We must ask ourselves what use these companies can make of that information. I am making no allegations against MBNA, or Tesco, or anyone, but it is a fact that people's details are extremely valuable in marketing terms. Lists of people and their interests change hands for money, because companies want to build up a database. We would all be quite surprised at the amount of information that the large supermarkets have about us. They know what we buy; they can probably tell us how many bedrooms there are in our houses and how many people live there by the number of toilet rolls that we consume. They know all about us, and it might be of interest to them and others to know who actually owns a car&mdash;whether it is ours or a company's&mdash;or what the value of that car is. That such information is getting out is a serious matter.</p>
	<p pid="a.451.1/12">There are other people who would be interested in knowing who owns which particular vehicle&mdash;car thieves for one, and motorbike thieves for another. There are some expensive Italian motorbikes on the roads that are worth large sums of money and so are a target for thieves. If somebody is seen riding a Ducati, for example, their registration number could be taken and all that would then be needed would be a contact with direct access to the DVLA database, such as a mate at one of these car clamping companies, who could tell them who owned it and where they lived and it could then be easily stolen.</p>
	<p pid="a.451.1/13">Other people are also intrigued by car registration numbers. There are those on the fringes of the newspaper world who keep an eye on what celebrities and others are up to. There are strange creatures who occasionally rummage through the dustbins of celebrities to find out what is there and who has written to them. Others wish to know who is visiting, and it is rather useful, when a particular celebrity is visited regularly by someone in a particular car, to be able to find out to whom that car belongs. Quite a lot of money could be made from a newspaper by revealing such a relationship. So there are people with ill intent who would wish to get hold of such information.</p>
	<p pid="a.451.1/14">In another life, before I came to this place, I seem to recall that, over the years, a number of police officers were prosecuted for making improper use of DVLA records. To be precise, police officers would be asked by their various contacts&mdash;who may have been journalists, bailiffs, debt collectors or others&mdash;whether they could find out who owned a particular car and where it might be found. They may have wanted to repossess it. For a certain small sum the officers would be prepared to do that. A number were discovered doing that, dismissed from the force and punished in court.</p>
	<p pid="a.451.1/15">The sanctity, we may say, of the DVLA list changed in 2002 when, under the negative resolution procedure, a statutory instrument was put through the House allowing all this to happen. It is fair to say that it is a failing of the House that so much legislation goes through in that way. How on earth can Members of Parliament spot something like this? I obtained a copy of the statutory instrument, which, on the face of it, seems perfectly reasonable. As I said, it refers to reasonable cause. There was no suggestion that this would be used wholesale, to give out millions and millions of drivers' details in that way.</p>
	<p pid="a.451.1/16">The ease with which one can access the system is also alarming. To set up a direct computer link to the DVLA one has to pay about &pound;3,000, and then it is simply a question of banging in the number and getting back the information, for which one is billed &pound;2.50. The DVLA has made several million pounds from the system since it started in 2002. Curiously, it is the only department that allows such information to be sold. No other departments do; they hold it close to their chests. Interestingly, when the story broke, the Information Commissioner and others appear to have taken the view that this was quite wrong.</p>
	<p pid="a.451.1/17">The Department for Constitutional Affairs, which is responsible for the Information Commissioner and the Data Protection Act 1998, said that the practice was unacceptable. That is one Department talking to another Department, saying that the practice of an agency related to the Department for Transport is unacceptable. When tackled about this, the assistant Information Commissioner, Mr. Bamford, was also critical. He was quoted as saying:</p>
	<p pid="a.451.1/18" class="indent">&quot;We will be taking this up with the DVLA to find out why they think this is covered by the 'reasonable cause' provision.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.451.1/19">He, too, believes that the reasonable cause provision is being grossly exaggerated and extended by the present system.</p>
	<p pid="a.451.1/20">My constituents were scandalised when they saw what was going on at Tesco. They became even more incensed when they read in <i>The Mail on Sunday</i> and in other papers about the scale of what was happening. Most reasonable people would think that it was unacceptable. I am pleased that following the publication of the article in <i>The Mail on Sunday</i> the Minister began to take a more robust approach. I believe that he said that he was going to take a more robust view and examine the matter with a view to having a consultation about what could be done. No doubt he will have time to explain that.</p>
	<p pid="a.451.1/21">This is not a question of consultation. It is a serious matter that requires urgent action. The original statutory instrument must clearly have been based on some piece of enacted legislation in the House, therefore I presume it is relatively simple to introduce another statutory instrument to put a stop to this. The Minister must put a stop to it. It is a gross intrusion into people's privacy. It is Big Brother coming to the DVLA. We are giving out private names and addresses, which could put people at risk, in order for the DVLA to make &pound;2.50 a time and a few million pounds over the years. It is a scandal and it should stop.</p>

	<p pid="a.454.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1635" name="Peter Atkinson">the hon. Member for Hexham (Mr. Atkinson)</phrase> on taking an interest in this matter and on obtaining this Adjournment debate. I will start with his final comment&mdash;the implication that the DVLA does this in order to make millions of pounds. In actual fact, it makes not one penny on these dealings. It is allowed to charge a small fee to cover its administrative costs only; it is not allowed to make a profit. If it is reasonable that information is given out in some circumstances&mdash;I will deal with that in a moment&mdash;surely it is right that the cost of meeting that reasonable demand does not fall on the taxpayer. Therefore, those people who will benefit from it should pay a sufficient sum to cover the costs. That is exactly what they do. No profit is involved for the DVLA: &pound;2.50 is a small fee, which is chosen to be just sufficient to cover the administrative costs of providing the information.</p>
	<p pid="a.454.0/2">After all, as the hon. Gentleman said, many of the people who are requesting the information are doing so for the purpose of running a business that makes a profit. Possibly, they are in the business of enforcing private parking arrangements. They make a profit out of doing that and it is right therefore that they should pay something for the information that they need in order to do so. It is right that the costs should not fall on the taxpayer, and therefore, a small fee is paid. Let us deal with that issue first and foremost. The DVLA makes no profit out of this. There is no money-making exercise on behalf of the DVLA or on behalf of Government. Sufficient money is raised to cover only the legitimate costs involved in this transaction.</p>
	<p pid="a.454.0/3">Before I deal with the next issue, I will put it on the record, loudly and clearly, that I have undertaken to carry out a review of the policy. I believe that certain of the allegations that were made in <i>The Mail on Sunday</i> have raised legitimate concerns that need to be addressed. As yet, I am not taking a position on them one way or the other, but issues have been raised and the public are entitled to understand that they have been thoroughly examined and that we have arrived at a proper position. We will carry out a thorough review covering all aspects of the arrangement, and we will begin with the consultation. We need a consultation to deal with the core issue, which is about what is reasonable. When is it reasonable for the DVLA to provide such information?</p>
	<p pid="a.454.0/4">The hon. Gentleman started by mentioning the case of his local Tesco, which has a piece of private land. I am surprised to hear the hon. Gentleman, who is a Conservative after all, seeming to imply that anybody should be allowed to park on that piece of land for as long as they want, irrespective of whether they are engaged in commerce with Tesco. The hon. Gentleman shakes his head, but either Tesco is allowed to enforce parking restrictions on its private land or it is not.</p>

	<p pid="a.455.1/1">Let me make this point, then I shall certainly allow the hon. Gentleman to intervene. If we decide that Tesco should be allowed to enforce parking restrictions on that land, the question is how it is to do that. First, the company not unreasonably put up a sign explaining how it would enforce its parking restrictions, so that people knew how long they were welcome to park for free. Secondly, it indicated what it would do if a person decided to exceed the time limit, so that people knew. Thirdly, it explained how it would go about enforcing the restrictions and at what cost.</p>
	<p pid="a.455.1/2">It sounded to me as though anyone parking there would know exactly the circumstances of the transaction. What would be the alternatives for Tesco? One, which I should like the hon. Gentleman to address when he intervenes, is that it would be forced to clamp vehicles. That is one of my big concerns. If in our consultation we come to the conclusion that private car parking companies should not have access to the DVLA database to enforce private parking, many businesses will have no alternative but to use clamping companies to enforce their parking rules. Tesco would have to clamp the hon. Gentleman's constituents' cars after three hours and charge a fee before it released them. If the hon. Gentleman thinks that his constituents would be happier about that than the arrangement that Tesco currently uses, I suspect that he does not know his constituents very well. I think that they would be horrified.</p>

	<p pid="a.455.2/1">I am sorry, but the Minister has not grasped the tenet of this issue; this is a question of principle versus practicality. However, I leave that aside. Of course I understand that Tesco is perfectly entitled to police its car park in whatever way it decides, but there are many ways of doing that other than clamping. If the Minister goes supermarket shopping in many parts of the country, he will find different systems. One system uses a barrier: the person goes in, takes a ticket and has it endorsed at the till, which allows them out free of charge. If the person overstays their time, they are made to pay by an attendant at the barrier. Many other systems can be used without giving a private parking contractor access to DVLA records. That is a matter of principle, not practicality.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-12-14a.455.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1874" speakername="Stephen Ladyman" colnum="455"  time="011:12:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051214/halltext/51214h02.htm#51214h02_spnew4">
	<p pid="a.455.3/1">I understand the hon. Gentleman when he describes the matter as one of principle rather than practicality, but he describes exactly what I would regard as a case of practicality. In this particular case, Tesco seems to have concluded, rightly or wrongly, that it would rather have a relatively cheap method of enforcement that does not require barriers or people sitting at the gates collecting money after three hours. It would rather have a system that is, or ought to be, more or less self-enforcing&mdash;and therefore free&mdash;so as not to have to pass the costs on to its customers. The hon. Gentleman's constituents presumably pay less in that Tesco store than they would in other supermarkets that use manned barriers and other methods for collecting money. That is the commercial decision that Tesco has made.</p>
	<p pid="a.455.3/2">Let us deal with the principle of whether the information should be available. Let us go through one or two scenarios in which we might make it available. If I were to drive into the hon. Gentleman's motor vehicle in the House of Commons car park, leave a dent in it and drive off without telling anybody about it and somebody was quick enough to spot me doing it and take my number, would he not think it reasonable for him to be able to approach the DVLA, get my details and make me pay the bill?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-12-14a.456.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1874" speakername="Stephen Ladyman" colnum="456"  time="011:12:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051214/halltext/51214h02.htm#51214h02_spnew6">
	<p pid="a.456.1/1">I think that that would be reasonable. If the hon. Gentleman thinks it reasonable&mdash;I suspect that most of our constituents would do&mdash;the principle is established: there are circumstances in which it is reasonable for the DVLA to provide that information. If he does not think that it is reasonable for a private individual to be able to do that, it is up to him to say how private individuals will enforce their rights when somebody parks on their private property, or dents their motor vehicle and drives away after their number has been taken.</p>
	<p pid="a.456.1/2">Having said that, I also entirely accept that there are circumstances in which it would not be reasonable for that to happen. The hon. Gentleman described many circumstances in which I would unequivocally say that it would not be reasonable. It is not reasonable for the paparazzi to attempt to trace celebrities by getting information from their number plates from the DVLA. If we find in our review that they are able to do that, I promise the hon. Gentleman that it will be stopped. As he said, it is also not reasonable for information to be provided to people who might be car or motorcycle thieves, and if I find that there are loopholes in the arrangements through which such information can be obtained by such people, we will try to find a way to stop that.</p>
	<p pid="a.456.1/3">In order to achieve what we want, more is needed than just for me to make an edict. We need to have a consultation about what is reasonable and what is not reasonable. If we decide that there are circumstances in which access is reasonable, we will need to have a discussion about how thoroughly we would expect the DVLA to check that reasonable cause has been established. Current road traffic legislation makes it clear that the DVLA has a duty to provide such information to people who have reasonable cause. That is the basis on which the DVLA is providing that information. However, as I stated in my letter to the hon. Gentleman, reasonable cause is not established in law. Perhaps one of the things that will emerge out of this consultation is that we need to have greater clarity about what is, and what is not, reasonable cause. I will keep an open mind during the review, but my opinion at present is that there are circumstances in which it is perfectly right and justified that the DVLA should be required to make that information available.</p>
	<p pid="a.456.1/4">I do not want there to be a proliferation of clamping companies throughout the country. My constituents would not welcome having even more clampers out on the streets, but that will be the consequence if we take away the right of people legitimately to police private car parking by this method. People will have no alternative but to enforce parking in private car parks and on private land through clamping. We do not want to encourage that.</p>
	<p pid="a.456.1/5">I believe that most people think that there are circumstances in which insurance companies and others should have access to the information. However, it would certainly not be right if the information could be obtained and used for marketing purposes. I am not a lawyer, but my understanding of the Data Protection Act is that if one obtains personal information about somebody, it can be used only for the purpose for which it was obtained, it can be stored and processed only in accordance with the purpose for which it was obtained, and the data protection registrar would expect the computer database that holds that information to be managed in accordance with that purpose.</p>
	<p pid="a.456.1/6">Therefore, if Tesco were to put up a sign in the hon. Gentleman's constituency that said, &quot;If you park for more than three hours, we will take a picture of your car number plate and use the information we get from that to enforce a charge against you,&quot; that is the only purpose for which that information could be used. However, if Tesco were to put up a camera in its car park in order to record its customers entering in their cars to obtain personal information about them, I doubt very much that that would be legal, and it would certainly not be legal with the type of notification that the hon. Gentleman has described as being displayed in that car park. In any case, I doubt very much that Tesco would contemplate doing that sort of thing.</p>

	<p pid="a.457.1/1">The hon. Gentleman shakes his head; he does not think that Tesco are using it in order to get that sort of information.</p>
	<p pid="a.457.1/2">A debate needs to be had on this matter. We have to decide what is and what is not a reasonable cause. I do not know whether the hon. Gentleman is going to be absolutist about this matter and say that there is no reasonable cause. If he said that the only two groups of people who should have access to the information on the DVLA database are the DVLA for the purpose of collecting vehicle excise duty and the police for the purpose of criminal investigations, and if that was the general view, we would need to change the law to reflect that.</p>
	<p pid="a.457.1/3">However, we must consider what the consequences would be. It would be difficult to enforce private parking, there would be cost increases for people engaged in certain transactions because the cost of the transactions would increase, and there would be no recourse for individuals who cannot get the help of an insurance company or the police to track someone who is responsible for damage to their vehicle. We have to accept that those would be the consequences of taking the absolutist view.</p>
	<p pid="a.457.1/4">If we decide that the absolutist view is not the correct one, and that in some circumstances reasonable cause can be established, we must ensure that reasonable cause is being established. The hon. Gentleman painted a picture of completely unauthorised individuals getting automatic access to the DVLA database, not providing details of the incident about which they are requesting information and not establishing reasonable cause. That is not my understanding of how the system works.</p>
	<p pid="a.457.1/5">At present, individuals who want information about somebody must provide information about themselves and about the incident. They must fill in a comprehensive form to establish why they need the information. Organisations that wish to engage in a high volume of such transactions must first establish their bona fides. They must provide details of their business, including when it was established, on headed letter paper. There is a sift to ensure that there is reasonable cause, and they must give the time and date of the incident in respect of which they are requesting information each time they apply for information.</p>
	<p pid="a.457.1/6">We may decide in the course of the review that things need to be tightened up. Perhaps a more thorough investigation of these matters must be carried out before we allow such access to the database. Perhaps we need to sift more information before we provide information on individual cases, in which case the cost would increase. Why should the taxpayer pay for this? I am not suggesting that the DVLA will want to make a profit in the future any more than it has in the past, but we would have to increase the cost if we took that approach.</p>
	<p pid="a.457.1/7">Another possibility that should be considered in the review is one that I confess I found out about by accident, while reading a thriller on the train the other day. In some states in America, if an individual requests information about the owner of a vehicle on the basis of a registration number, the information is provided if reasonable cause is established, but the owner of the vehicle is contacted and told that that information has been provided, why it was provided and to whom it was provided. Both the owner of the vehicle and the person requesting the information know that a request has been made for information. I would like the review to consider whether that should be built into the system as an additional protection.</p>
	<p pid="a.457.1/8">I promise the hon. Gentleman that the views that he has expressed today and any other views that he wishes to present will be included in the consultation, which will be thorough. We will start on it as soon as possible by producing a consultation document. We need to focus on what is reasonable cause and whether it can be established. If we decide that it can sometimes be established, we need to focus on whether we are checking thoroughly enough to ensure that the sort of abuses that he identified do not happen. Then we must consider the consequences of any change, including the cost to the taxpayer and customers, and any unintended consequences. As I have said on several occasions, we certainly do not want to encourage the growth of clamping. I doubt that our constituents would thank us for that.</p>
	<p pid="a.457.1/9">The review will be thorough. The views of the hon. Gentleman, his constituents and <i>The Mail on Sunday</i> will be taken into account. I encourage anybody who has evidence that the system is being abused to provide me with it so that we can get to the bottom of matter.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-12-14a.459.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1871" speakername="David Wright" colnum="459"  time="014:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051214/halltext/51214h03.htm#51214h03_spnew0">
	<p pid="a.459.1/1">Thank you for calling me to speak, Mr. Olner. It is a pleasure to be in your company this afternoon, as it always is. It is appropriate that we are having a debate on UK world heritage sites, because we are sitting&mdash;and I am standing&mdash;in a world heritage site now. About a week and a half ago, I was lucky enough to be re-elected as chairman of the all-party world heritage sites group&mdash;[Hon. Members: &quot;Hear, hear!&quot;] I knew that I would get an accolade in this House for something. It is a great pleasure to serve in that position.</p>
	<p pid="a.459.1/2">A number of Members in the Chamber have been active in the all-party group for some years. I see the hon. Members for East Devon (Mr. Swire), for Salisbury (Robert Key), for Shipley (Philip Davies) and for Bath (Mr. Foster) and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1979" name="Mark Lazarowicz">my hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, North and Leith (Mark Lazarowicz)</phrase>. I am sure that other colleagues will be keen to join in the work of the all-party group in time, particularly <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1714" name="Ashok Kumar">my hon. Friend the Member for Middlesbrough, South and East Cleveland (Dr. Kumar)</phrase>, who I know hopes to catch your eye a little later, Mr. Olner.</p>
	<p pid="a.459.1/3">The all-party world heritage sites group has been functioning for several years. The group is cross-party, as is the nature of this debate. We want to get our teeth into world heritage issues, put the politics to one side and talk about how we can ensure that world heritage sites deliver the very best for us as a nation and for the communities in which they sit. I hope that the tone of this debate will be one of constructive thought and the desire to make sure that new partnerships develop so that our world heritage sites are protected for the future.</p>
	<p pid="a.459.1/4">I should like to thank English Heritage, which has taken on the role of the all-party group's secretariat support. I particularly wanted to thank Peter Just, who is not a million miles away at this very moment, for the work that he is already doing for the group. The group welcomes English Heritage's support.</p>
	<p pid="a.459.1/5">Today almost seems like world heritage day: this morning, the Minister and I had the pleasure of attending the annual general meeting of the Local Authority World Heritage Forum, which brings together all local authority areas with world heritage sites to ensure a co-ordinated view of the needs, desires and aspirations of world heritage sites across local government. The forum works in partnership with a range of organisations that I shall probably mention this afternoon.</p>
	<p pid="a.459.1/6">I want to split my speech into two sections. I want to talk about some of the broader issues affecting world heritage sites in the UK, but obviously, Mr. Olner, you would not blame me for wanting to speak briefly about the world heritage site in my own constituency&mdash;the Ironbridge gorge&mdash;and I shall do that in my closing remarks.</p>
	<p pid="a.459.1/7">The 1972 UNESCO world heritage convention was perhaps the most successful of all; it covered 180 member states and more than 800 world heritage sites. By joining the convention, member states undertake to protect their heritage, both natural and cultural, in general terms. They also have the opportunity to identify places of outstanding value to all humanity, and they can nominate them to be included on the UNESCO world heritage list. Once sites are on that, member states accept that the international community will take an interest in the management of those places through the work of the world heritage committee.</p>
	<p pid="a.459.1/8">Within the UK, world heritage is probably the best known aspect of UNESCO's work, and the one that captures the popular imagination, because it is linked to specific places. World heritage involves many players. At national level, the Department for Culture, Media and Sport has the lead responsibility for the convention, and other Departments, such as the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister and the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, are also involved.</p>
	<p pid="a.459.1/9">The devolved Administrations are involved too, as are the newly re-established UK National Commission for UNESCO and non-governmental organisations such as the UK committee of the International Council on Monuments and Sites, ICOMOS-UK. Of course, the Local Authority World Heritage Forum is also involved, as are individual local authorities and organisations that are present within world heritage sites.</p>
	<p pid="a.459.1/10">There is a wide range of partners within world heritage sites. For example, one of the key players in my area is the Ironbridge Gorge museums trust. Such organisations take an important leading role within the world heritage site in their locality.</p>
	<p pid="a.459.1/11">The UK joined the world heritage convention in 1984 and now has 26 world heritage sites: 16 in England, four in Scotland, two in Wales, one in Northern Ireland and three in overseas territories&mdash;I am sure that the Minister will be particularly keen to visit those.</p>

	<p pid="a.460.1/1">I would like to go there as well, if the Minister will take me with him.</p>
	<p pid="a.460.1/2">Twenty-one UK world heritage sites are cultural sites, four are natural sites and one, St. Kilda, is both a cultural and a natural site. During its 21 years in the convention, the UK has gone through three distinct phases of site development. During the first phase, from 1984 to about 1989, we nominated obvious monumental iconic sites in the UK&mdash;for example, Stonehenge, Avebury and the Tower of London&mdash;without much thought to the consequences for managing such places in the future.</p>
	<p pid="a.460.1/3">During the second phase, from 1989 to 1997, we realised after a series of planning appeals that world heritage status was a significant factor in the management and sustainable use of places such as Avebury, Ironbridge and Hadrian's wall. We started to consider other places, as well as the obvious monumental iconic sites, and that led in 1994 to planning policy guidance note 15, which stated that world heritage sites were a key material consideration in planning cases. It asked local authorities to develop policies to protect them and recommended that they draw up management plans as well.</p>
	<p pid="a.460.1/4">Management plans are now a key feature of the UK's approach to world heritage sites. Their implementation is overseen by steering groups of stakeholders, including national agencies, local authorities, site owners and local communities. Since 1997, the number of UK world heritage sites has increased from 16 to 26. I understand that all but four have current management plans, and work should be completed on the remaining few sites&mdash;the last four&mdash;during 2006.</p>
	<p pid="a.460.1/5">Management plans are incredibly important, as most world heritage sites are living communities. People live in them, and local people need to understand how the organisations involved in managing the site will interact with them. They need to know how they can make plans to change their housing, to start up a new business or to do something else within the site. They need to think about how their plans will correspond with the management plan for the site. The management plans are important documents, and credit is due to all the organisations that have moved so quickly to ensure that they are in place.</p>
	<p pid="a.460.1/6">The third phase of development involved a review of tentative sites for world heritage status, which must be considered collectively on their merits. Between 1997 and 1999, the review of the tentative list marked a new approach to defining world heritage sites in the UK. In large part, the tentative list moves the balance from monuments, which can be managed, to urban and rural landscapes, which are far more difficult to manage. Management plans would be crucial if further sites were to be designated. We must consider the sustainability of such sites for the benefit of local and national communities.</p>
	<p pid="a.460.1/7">That has been a quick canter through some of the broad themes in world heritage. The Minister may like to reflect on some of the key issues when he speaks, and I am sure that other colleagues will do the same. I shall now raise five points.</p>
	<p pid="a.460.1/8">The first issue is the statutory recognition of world heritage. Historically, there has been no statutory protection in the UK for world heritage sites, unlike listed buildings, conservation areas, ancient monuments, national parks and so on. The current review of heritage designations and protection is an opportunity to address that. World heritage sites sit at the top of the heritage hierarchy. The designation is one of the few of international significance that we recognise in the UK, and the statutory recognition and protections afforded to such sites should reflect the importance of world heritage sites in that heritage hierarchy.</p>
	<p pid="a.460.1/9">I understand that the DCMS has announced that the new heritage register will include world heritage sites. I should like the Minister to say a few words about that, because if that is the case, it is a major step forward. It would be interesting to hear his views on how the interaction with local authorities and their planning powers is working, and its impact on how we treat our world heritage sites in the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.460.1/10">The second theme is about the resourcing and management of world heritage sites. The primary responsibility for world heritage sites in the UK rests with the Government, because of their deal with UNESCO, but much of the day-to-day management falls on the local authorities where the sites are located. They have individual and day-to-day responsibility for protecting, promoting and presenting sites that fall within their boundaries.</p>
	<p pid="a.460.1/11">Local funding for those activities varies between sites, but in practice there is pressure on local authority budgets. Authorities and communities benefit from the generation of tourism that the sites engender, but because of the national and international status of the sites and the scale of visitor numbers, they put unique pressures and burdens on local areas. Will the Minister open up a continuing dialogue with colleagues at the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister to consider the impact that world heritage sites have on local authorities, and whether we can do any more to assist them?</p>
	<p pid="a.460.1/12">Thirdly, I want to reflect on the promotion of world heritage. The brand and the concept are probably not that well known beyond anoraks like us. Most people probably realise that there are one or two world heritage sites locally, regionally or nationally, but we do not promote the brand well in the UK, never mind internationally. We must do more to ensure that world heritage and the world heritage sites are considered key destinations for people who want to visit the UK, and for internal tourism. That is important.</p>
	<p pid="a.460.1/13">I was lucky enough last year to visit the grand canyon. It is a world heritage site in the United States, but there was no indication of that status. It is clearly of world significance, but it would have been nice to have walked into the entrance lobby of the main hotel on the rim of the grand canyon to find a brochure on worldwide world heritage sites, showing Bath, Stonehenge, Ironbridge gorge and other sites in the UK and throughout the world, where people could pick up and follow the world heritage trail.</p>
	<p pid="a.460.1/14">We must consider that idea. It is particularly important because the Olympic games will take place in this country in 2012. Would it not be a shame if millions of visitors come to London and other sites throughout the country, including world heritage sites that will host parts of the Olympics, but never get any further? Would it not be nice to get some of those millions of visitors out of the Olympic venues, London and the other locations where events are being held, and into world heritage sites?</p>
	<p pid="a.460.1/15">What better way is there of promoting Britain and its contribution to the world through the Olympics than by promoting Britain's own world heritage sites? There is an opportunity, and I hope that the Minister will ensure that we seize it.</p>
	<p pid="a.460.1/16">We in Telford had the pleasure of receiving the Under-Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1836" name="James Purnell">my hon. Friend the Member for Stalybridge and Hyde (James Purnell)</phrase> recently. He was keen to work with our hon. Friend the Minister who is here today to promote world heritage sites as tourist destinations in association with the Olympic games.</p>
	<p pid="a.460.1/17">Fourthly, several world heritage sites throughout the UK are at specific risk from development and from natural problems such as flooding, land instability or coastal erosion. The status and the physical fabric of several sites are under threat. We need help and support from across the Government to ensure that those sites are protected. Many local authorities cannot carry the burden of ensuring that their site is protected. We need support from central Government.</p>

	<p pid="a.463.0/1">My hon. Friend is making an interesting contribution. As he will know, the world heritage site in my constituency is a living, urban heritage site, with several thousand people living in it. One of the issues that we face is how to maintain a vibrant urban centre when there are pressures from many directions, such as the pressures on small shops and smaller shopping centres, and the effects of that pressure. Does my hon. Friend agree that it is important to consider how urban heritage sites are affected by wider trends in the retail and shopping markets and in planning policy? To put it bluntly, the viability of the heritage site in my constituency would be affected if the local community were to run down because of pressures on the local shopping and retail centres; that would undermine the entire living nature of that heritage site.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-12-14a.463.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1871" speakername="David Wright" colnum="463"  time="014:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051214/halltext/51214h03.htm#51214h03_spnew3">
	<p pid="a.463.1/1">My hon. Friend makes his point very well. It is important to bear in mind what we might term global factors, such as changing retail markets, in thinking about management plans for world heritage sites.</p>
	<p pid="a.463.1/2">In world heritage site management, it is important that we do not stop the development, change and evolution of sites in urban environments, such as my hon. Friend's and mine. We do not want to preserve them totally; we want to ensure that their key elements are preserved, and their key spirit, but we should not turn down all development or stop all retail growth or change. We should respond in a way that is in keeping with the spirit of the management plan and the spirit of world heritage. Many urban world heritage sites are not static communities; they are living communities where people want to go shopping and earn a living&mdash;where people live. It is important that we understand that in our management of world heritage sites.</p>
	<p pid="a.463.1/3">I am conscious that several Members want to speak, but I wish to make a fifth and final point; it is about specific development threats, and it fits in particularly well with my hon. Friend's comment. In planning world heritage site environments in both rural and urban areas, it is important that we consider the scale, scope, quality and design of new buildings. I understand that Cologne in Germany was put on the world heritage at risk register in 2004 because of approvals given for high buildings outside the buffer zone, more than 1 km from the cathedral, which is inscribed. I would hate similar situations to arise, where buildings are developed around world heritage sites that detract from those sites. We must manage planning processes extremely carefully.</p>

	<p pid="a.463.2/1">On that point, may I offer an example? One of the issues in the world heritage site of Edinburgh new town in my constituency is the need for affordable housing. Affordable housing that meets the high standards&mdash;it is correct that they should be so&mdash;in that site tends to cost a lot more than affordable housing in other parts of the community. Does my hon. Friend agree that it is therefore important that local, devolved and central Government should be prepared to pay extra to ensure that where there are vibrant communities, we can have affordable housing for a range of people? If that costs more because the housing has to meet the higher standards required for world heritage sites, so be it, because that cost has to be met.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-12-14a.464.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1871" speakername="David Wright" colnum="464"  time="014:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051214/halltext/51214h03.htm#51214h03_spnew5">
	<p pid="a.464.0/1">As Parliamentary Private Secretary to a Minister in the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister, I must be careful about what I say; I notice that my hon. Friend the Minister is looking at me with that thought in mind. However, I agree that it is important to promote high-quality design in development. I worked in the housing sector for 13 years, and I think that it is possible to secure very high-quality buildings that are fit for purpose through existing regimes, by acting creatively and addressing quality&mdash;and, occasionally perhaps, by pushing at the cost boundaries.</p>
	<p pid="a.464.0/2">Perhaps we should not mention the Scottish Parliament building in this context, but to ensure that we get quality, we should look very closely at planning applications within world heritage site areas. We need to ensure that partners who wish to work in those areas are aware of their responsibilities within the management plan.</p>
	<p pid="a.464.0/3">Time is pressing on, Mr. Olner, but I want to make two brief concluding remarks about Ironbridge. The first is on a positive note, while the second is about a local problem with which I hope the Minister might be able to help us.</p>
	<p pid="a.464.0/4">First, Ironbridge gorge, within my constituency, has a major and regular flooding problem, which goes beyond Ironbridge, down through Coalbrookdale to Coalport. Recently, in February 2004 and November 2005, we instituted a successful scheme that defended the Wharfage by placing pallet barriers along it. We were grateful to ministers at DEFRA for working with ourselves and the local community to ensure that we had flood protection on the Wharfage at Ironbridge. But there are still properties where we have problems, so it would help if the Minister could meet council officials and myself to discuss continuing problems with flooding in the world heritage site area.</p>
	<p pid="a.464.0/5">Secondly, as local people will be aware, there is a major problem with land instability within the gorge. A combination of geology, erosion, mineral exploitation and ongoing development within the gorge has caused a series of land instability problems. The bill for remedying that is significant. The initial scheme, which we have at the moment, to stabilise one of the areas at greatest risk, will cost &pound;5.2 million. That will be funded by the European regional development fund and specific awards through the local transport plan. But we need to look at a much larger scheme&mdash;for which we would need Government support&mdash;if we are to ensure that we deal with that land instability problem, and avoid ongoing problems with our world heritage site resulting from the natural environment.</p>
	<p pid="a.464.0/6">I will conclude there, having tried to canter round the broad issues relating to world heritage&mdash;some of the challenges and problems that we face, but also some opportunities. We have a massive asset here which, if we are careful, will ensure that we bring in a large number of tourists to the UK and promote tourism across it. World heritage sites can be an engine for their local economy. We have certainly found that with Ironbridge, and I know that other hon. Members find the same with the world heritage sites in their areas. I am proud to chair the all-party group, and I look forward to a continuing dialogue with the DCMS and other departments on the issues that I have raised.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-12-14a.465.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1803" speakername="Robert Key" colnum="465"  time="014:53:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051214/halltext/51214h03.htm#51214h03_spnew7">
	<p pid="a.465.1/1">It gives me great pleasure to congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1871" name="David Wright">the hon. Member for Telford (David Wright)</phrase>, first on securing the debate and secondly on his renewed chairmanship of the all-party group. He is doing a service to us all, and to world heritage sites. I wonder, Mr. Olner, whether you remember the film that accompanied the British bid for the Olympic games in Singapore, and the dramatic effect of seeing Stonehenge with the Olympic flags behind it. That was part of the reason why Britain gained the Olympic games for London. Of course, I have the honour to represent the stones and the Stonehenge world heritage site, which includes Avebury, which is not actually in my constituency.</p>
	<p pid="a.465.1/2">The story of Stonehenge is a great one, but also a sad one. Back in 1985 the United Kingdom withdrew from UNESCO. I was, at the time, the last national commissioner to have been appointed for UNESCO from the United Kingdom. I was obviously sad at the decision of my Government to pull out at that time. However, that has been remedied. We are back in, and I am delighted that the Secretary of State for International Development took that decision.</p>
	<p pid="a.465.1/3">During the period that we were out, much had happened in terms of designating British sites. There is now a long and distinguished list, as we know. UNESCO now has a full British complement and is responsible for the world heritage sites. Sue Davies is chairman of the culture committee of the UK National Commission for UNESCO and the chief executive of Wessex Archaeology. I should, therefore, start by declaring a non-pecuniary interest as a director and trustee of Wessex Archaeology.</p>
	<p pid="a.465.1/4">I remember well the launch of English Heritage in the chapter-house of Westminster Abbey, just across the road. In those days the chapter-house belonged to the Government and was administered by the Department of the Environment, and then by English Heritage. At the first meeting of English Heritage, Lord Montagu of Beaulieu pledged that the No. 1 priority would be Stonehenge, including the refurbishment of the visitor centre, improvement of the site and taking the roads out of the landscape.</p>
	<p pid="a.465.1/5">Lord Montagu made huge strides and efforts over many years, but he did not quite get there. He was not the only one who was defeated. Margaret Thatcher was defeated, too. I recall visiting her as Prime Minister in her rooms in the House of Commons. She got on her hands and knees with me, poring over the maps, looking at the Stonehenge issue and arguing the case, because that was the sort of person she was. However, even she did not manage to crack the problem of Stonehenge.</p>
	<p pid="a.465.1/6">Then Sir Jocelyn Stevens came on the scene and he, as chairman of English Heritage, brought to bear all his charm and charisma and all the other traits for which he was famous and made valiant, dramatic attempts to solve the problems of Stonehenge. We recall the cartoons of people at English Heritage jumping out of windows and all those happy days. However, even Sir Jocelyn did not solve the problem of Stonehenge. I hope that Sir Neil Cossons will solve the problem; he is the person most likely to succeed.</p>
	<p pid="a.465.1/7">It was not just Margaret Thatcher who failed to succeed; our present Prime Minister also failed. I raised the matter of Stonehenge with him at Prime Minister's questions in July 1997, when he said that the Government were aware of the problem and would do their best to try to solve it. We are still waiting. I suspect that the Prime Minister will have retired before the stones are put in their proper context.</p>
	<p pid="a.465.1/8">This is an extraordinary story about a world heritage site, because everyone has wanted to succeed. I know, because I was the first Minister for National Heritage at the Department of National Heritage. Quite rightly, Sir Humphrey said, &quot;No, Minister. You can't get involved in your own constituency.&quot; So that was fine. But then I became the Minister for Roads and Traffic and I saw the problem from another angle and, once again, Sir Humphrey rightly said, &quot;No, Minister. You can't get involved in your own constituency.&quot; So I could not solve the problem either.</p>
	<p pid="a.465.1/9">The local authorities were hugely enthusiastic about cracking the problem. Local government officers in Wiltshire county council and Salisbury district council were sweating away, trying hard to find the right way through. That was a great drain on their expertise and on the local authority budgets, but nobody succeeded.</p>
	<p pid="a.465.1/10">The current Minister has a huge challenge before him. I know that he understands what this is all about, because he is helpful and courteous, and has been infinitely patient as he has observed the sand slipping through his fingers when it comes to Stonehenge. His door has always been open; I am grateful for that. I know that, thanks to his background, he has a good feeling for the importance of things like world heritage sites in our national history.</p>
	<p pid="a.465.1/11">Stonehenge is about more than that, however; it is a matter of national and international significance. I was going through one of the huge piles of Government brochures, plans and so on, and I came across a brilliant initial plan that was produced to celebrate the English Heritage bids, which spoke of</p>
	<p pid="a.465.1/12" class="indent">&quot;Working together to meet the challenge.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.465.1/13">And on the front of that Stonehenge master plan was a quote from Siegfried Sassoon's poem, &quot;The Heart's Journey&quot;:</p>
	<p pid="a.465.1/14" class="indent">&quot;The stones remain; their stillness can outlast</p>
	<p pid="a.465.1/15" class="indent">The skies of history hurrying overhead.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.465.1/16">Then we turn the page, and we see Sir Jocelyn Stevens saying something that I bet he has regretted ever since. It is the sort of thing you say; it is the sort of thing you mean:</p>
	<p pid="a.465.1/17" class="indent">&quot;I can think of no better example to the world of how this country cares for its great heritage.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.465.1/18">Yes. Quite. And that is the problem, because everyone has wanted to solve this problem at Stonehenge. We all know that we want to restore it to the grandeur of the time when there was little interference by man. We want to take the roads out of the landscape; do we do it with a tunnel or not?</p>
	<p pid="a.465.1/19">We were all pretty surprised when the then Minister, Lady Blackstone, announced that they were going to build a long haul tunnel beside the stones, and we said, &quot;Hooray, but where is the money coming from?&quot; But of course, earlier this year the Department for Transport said that it had no money, so that was all over and we had to go back to the drawing board.</p>
	<p pid="a.465.1/20">We have had endless problems about the visitor centre and how it depends upon the tunnel or the road improvement, and if the Winterbourne Stoke bypass and the Countess road flyover are built without the tunnel there has to be a new public inquiry. It gets more and more convoluted. That is the problem. I honestly believe that our system of national government is not good at delivering this sort of project; it is just not designed to do it. Even when two Prime Ministers have been personally committed to trying to find a solution, they have not found it.</p>
	<p pid="a.465.1/21">So we have to keep trying and we will keep trying. Meanwhile, the stones will not get damaged. They will be as mysterious and wonderful as ever. They deserve their designation as a world heritage site. But we should be increasingly ashamed of the visitor facilities there, and of the encroachment of the 20th and now the 21st century upon the landscape of the stones, and we must try harder.</p>
	<p pid="a.465.1/22">I am still passionate about this and I believe that there are ways through. I am delighted that the Minister for roads has also had an open door and I know how much he wants to solve this. I know how much the Minister who will reply to today's debate does too, but we must go on until we do solve it; otherwise, we shall not be living up to our responsibilities as the keepers of a world heritage site like Stonehenge and Amesbury. We simply must do it. My plea to the Minister is that he uses his best endeavours and, much more than that, his charm, his guile and whatever else he can offer to help us do this, because everyone will be grateful to him: the local authorities, the local people, and the people travelling up and down from the west country.</p>
	<p pid="a.465.1/23">My final point is that a world heritage site in this case is not just a heap of old stones. Stonehenge represents an important symbol of the history of our country and culture, but much more than that, it is the gateway to the west of England. The west of England is one of the most innovative, exciting, vibrant parts of the United Kingdom. We trade on our heritage, our environment, our beaches and our holidays. At the same time, we have&mdash;in my constituency at least&mdash;the lowest unemployment rate in the United Kingdom and the highest rates of economic activity. We have high technology, we have nanotechnology and we have science in bucketfuls, and yet the whole economy of south-west England comes to a halt at Stonehenge. Stonehenge ought to have a large road sign saying, &quot;Gateway to the South-West&quot;; instead, you get to Stonehenge and there is a big sign saying, &quot;Road Closed&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.465.1/24">That is the problem, because in the south-west of England the infrastructure investment has been poor over many years. We have not had road improvements. We have had to fight even to get the M5 designated a strategic route. The A303, which was always the second route to the south-west, has been downgraded. The Blackdown hills controversy cost us years. It cost the economy of the whole south-west years; it cost the tourist economy of the south-west huge amounts. It continues to cost everyone a great deal, not only in terms of money, but in terms of everything that world heritage sites stand for. There is every reason why the Government, as a whole, should get together to solve this problem: it is about the economy, the quality of life and the standard of living.</p>
	<p pid="a.465.1/25">Only last night, some of us had a meeting with the South West of England Development Agency. It too recognises that the bottleneck of Stonehenge is having an adverse impact on the place of the south-west of England in the world, in terms of economy and quality of life. So the problem represented by Stonehenge is a massive problem, and I have not over-egged that in any sense. But at heart it is the stones that matter, and the landscape in which they lie. They matter to us and to our children and grandchildren, and we must crack this problem for their sake too. I put in a plea not just for all the world heritage sites to be in our hearts and minds as we think of everything that makes Britain so British, but for us to think in practical terms about the need to provide world-class visitor facilities. Britain is capable of the very best&mdash;we know that&mdash;but we are failing miserably at Stonehenge in 2005.</p>
	<p pid="a.465.1/26">I hope that, by the middle of 2006, we will see the Government's working party produce a sensible plan that can be costed, afforded and implemented without delay. At that point, UNESCO can realise its dreams for the world heritage sites in this country, all of which are magnificent; indeed, I hope to see more. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1538" name="Hugo Swire">My hon. Friend the Member for East Devon (Mr. Swire)</phrase> has in his constituency not only part of the Jurassic coast international site, but the Cornwall and west Devon mining landscape, which is the subject of a new application.</p>
	<p pid="a.465.1/27">There is a huge task ahead. Everyone wants this to happen. Minister, please make it happen.</p>

	<p pid="a.468.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1871" name="David Wright">my hon. Friend the Member for Telford (David Wright)</phrase> on securing this debate. Before he was elected, I, as a student in Birmingham, regularly visited his constituency to see the Ironbridge site, which I have admired since the first time I saw it in 1975. I have been there many times since. I have not visited Ironbridge since he was elected, so I will inform him when I next decide to visit.</p>
	<p pid="a.468.0/2">I wish to focus on two matters; I am aware that time is limited. First, I shall make a few observations about the world heritage site list and, secondly, develop another theme. Unlike other hon. Members who have spoken, I do not have a world heritage site in my constituency. However, in the northern region, we have two: Hadrian's wall and Durham cathedral and castle. I am happy that they are world heritage sites, but, if one goes further down the road, one finds York cathedral and city walls, which are not included in the list. That is surprising, given that the great Roman emperor Constantine was crowned in that city. That site should have been a candidate for the list. Somehow, it has been overlooked and does not appear on the list that I have seen on the internet.</p>

	<p pid="a.469.0/1">I add <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1871" name="David Wright">my congratulations to the hon. Member for Telford (David Wright)</phrase> on securing the debate. I was interested to hear <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1714" name="Ashok Kumar">the comments of the hon. Member for Middlesbrough, South and East Cleveland (Dr. Kumar)</phrase> about the Roman empire. I wonder whether he is aware that the proposed list includes the first multi-country bid for world heritage status for the frontiers of the Roman empire, including the Antonine wall in Bearsden, in my constituency. I would be interested to hear whether he believes that that should be included on the list.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-12-14a.469.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1714" speakername="Ashok Kumar" colnum="469"  time="015:06:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051214/halltext/51214h03.htm#51214h03_spnew10">
	<p pid="a.469.1/1">I heartily agree. The tentative list includes sites in the north-east, including Lindisfarne and Jarrow. It is amazing that they have not been considered, given the part they have played in history. In the dark ages, the torch of learning was kept alive at those sites, where men such as Bede kept our spirit alive. Further south, one finds Whitby, which has a great religious history, and was the site of the synod that effectively settled what we now know as the Christian doctrine. There is no recognition of that.</p>
	<p pid="a.469.1/2">I believe that the list is subjective and selective. I know that the Minister is looking for ideas, so I suggest that he takes up some of my suggestions when advancing his programme. There is also a little bias, which has been hinted at earlier in the debate. A lot of the sites are all about stone and mortar. I recognise that it is about buildings: churches, cathedrals, castles, abbeys or palaces. That is fine, as they are part and parcel of our history, but that is a limited reflection of our heritage and world heritage. I want to explore that theme further.</p>
	<p pid="a.469.1/3">We must consider things laterally. I am most interested in science and engineering, which the Minister knows I am passionate about. I care greatly for it. I studied it as a student and I worked for a living in that sector before I entered the House.</p>
	<p pid="a.469.1/4">Nowhere in the list of UK world heritages sites is there any connection with the physical and natural sciences. The nearest that we get is the Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew, the Royal Greenwich observatory and the maritime museum.</p>
</speech>

	<p pid="a.469.2/1">Does my hon. Friend agree, given his enthusiasm for engineering, that the Telford aqueduct should be on the list of heritage sites in Britain? Its bicentenary was held just a couple of weeks ago. It is a 200-year-old aqueduct that is still in use and it is an amazing engineering feat.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-12-14a.469.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1714" speakername="Ashok Kumar" colnum="469"  time="015:06:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051214/halltext/51214h03.htm#51214h03_spnew12">
	<p pid="a.469.3/1">I am happy to endorse that, because it fits into the theme that I am trying to explore. The contribution of science and technology needs to be incorporated into our heritage. Nowhere do I see any evidence that such an approach has been explored.</p>
	<p pid="a.469.3/2">Great learned men and women have honoured this country in developing ideas. I am thinking of the Cavendish laboratory at Cambridge, a great institution where James Clerk Maxwell, Ernest Rutherford, James Chadwick and Nils Bohr made great contributions. They were great learned scholars in science. That is one institution that we should consider in terms of great world heritage sites. Matter was explored and the structure of the atom was investigated, as were all the forces of the universe, over a long period.</p>
	<p pid="a.469.3/3">Many other institutions could be included, such as Manchester university, where great pioneering work was done in physics, discovering the nature and depth of the universe. They are great world heritage sites, which we ought to promote in our discussions from now on. I could suggest many other institutions, such as Woolsthorpe manor, which was the Lincolnshire home of Sir Isaac Newton. It is not on the list. He was a great pioneer, who broke frontiers of science. Newtonian physics lives with us to this day. There is an opportunity for us to explore that and to put it in the relevant category somewhere along the line.</p>
	<p pid="a.469.3/4">It would be a great credit to UK heritage and world heritage if we could explore that theme. After all, the theme of this Government has been to promote science and technology and our great achievements. We have a great heritage. That is a further suggestion that the Minister can take away and perhaps explore. I am not saying that he must give me the answers today, but I am outlining an approach.</p>
	<p pid="a.469.3/5">The Minister could also involve the scientific and engineering institutions&mdash;the Royal Society, the civil engineering organisations, the Institution of Chemical Engineers, of which I am a member, and other institutions&mdash;in considering whether such sites could be recognised in this respect in the future. I am not looking out for my constituency on the issue, because it has no world heritage sites, but the theme needs to be explored.</p>
	<p pid="a.469.3/6">I know that time is limited. Perhaps the Minister can take some of those ideas away and, some years down the road, there might be some success.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-12-14a.470.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1816" speakername="Philip Davies" colnum="470"  time="015:15:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051214/halltext/51214h03.htm#51214h03_spnew13">
	<p pid="a.470.0/1">I shall be as brief as possible because other hon. Members wish to speak. I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1871" name="David Wright">the hon. Member for Telford (David Wright)</phrase> on securing t<phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1803" name="Robert Key">his important debate. As my hon. Friend the Member for Salisbury (Robert Key)</phrase> said, we all appreciate greatly his work on the all-party parliamentary group.</p>
	<p pid="a.470.0/2">World heritage sites are places of international importance for the conservation of our cultural and natural heritage. Examples include the great wall of China, the pyramids, the great barrier reef, Venice, the Tower of London, the Palace of Westminster. In Shipley, we are proud of the fact that Saltaire, including Salts mill, which hosts the Hockney collection, is on the list. I recommend all hon. Members to visit it. It is a fantastic place.</p>
	<p pid="a.470.0/3">World heritage sites face several problems, which I hope the Minister will deal with in his response. I shall be parochial, stick to my patch, as my hon. Friend the Member for Salisbury stuck to his, and discuss Saltaire. It was designated a world heritage site in 2001. No central agency has overall responsibility for the site. In effect, the management relies on everyone with an interest in the village working together. That includes all owners and occupiers of properties in Saltaire. A number of people do a great job. The Saltaire project team is a forum for key stakeholders at the world heritage site and involves local councillors. There is also the Saltaire village society, which is made up of representatives from the village. They have an important role in enhancing the look and attraction of Saltaire. I pay tribute to their work.</p>
	<p pid="a.470.0/4">I shall touch on some issues rightly raised by the hon. Member for Telford. As for the financial burden of local authorities, I am sure that all Members are aware that the world heritage convention places several duties on the Government in respect of the management of world heritage sites to ensure that they are identified, protected, conserved and presented to the public. The responsibility for individual sites falls often at local government level. Each site must now have a management plan. It is recognised by most people that a co-ordinator post is fundamental to driving the implementation of the plans.</p>
	<p pid="a.470.0/5">The post at Bradford was funded partially for three years by English Heritage, but that funding ends in April next year. Fortunately, Bradford metropolitan district council has stepped in, taken on the responsibility for the post and made it permanent. Other sites throughout the country are not as lucky and often find it difficult to retain long-term funding for such posts, which obviously creates concern about the continuity of the work. Although funding can be obtained for certain projects within a world heritage site, the local council often has to contribute to it.</p>
	<p pid="a.470.0/6">I hope that the Minister will accept that there is a danger that those responsible for nominating sites for inspection to be included on the world heritage list may decide not to because of resource implications. It would be sad if that were decided on the grounds of which authority had the resources, not the importance of the site. Surely that should be the most important factor when deciding whether something is a world heritage site or not.</p>
	<p pid="a.470.0/7">The hon. Member for Telford made a good point when he said that being designated as a world heritage site probably brings no additional legislative protection for that site. All the buildings in Saltaire are listed, which means that they have a high level of protection. However, that probably is not the case with all sites. Some additional protection for those important assets would be beneficial for those of us who represent constituencies with world heritage sites.</p>
	<p pid="a.470.0/8">I refer now to joined-up government, a matter that I want the Minister to address. The Government have a responsibility to raise awareness of world heritage, but I am not aware of anything in the school curriculum raising awareness of world heritage matters. Saltaire has focused on links with the Highways Agency, which is responsible for the roads in the area. One of the pavements needed resurfacing. As anyone who has been to Saltaire will know, its significance rests in its housing, and its street surfacing is vital to the character of the place. To ensure that stone paving was used, rather than a concrete alternative, the council had to supplement the work financially, as the Highways Agency had no special provision in its budget for world heritage sites. I hope that the Government will address that point.</p>
	<p pid="a.470.0/9">Saltaire is one of the most congested places in the whole Bradford district. That is recognised by the Highways Agency, which apparently has no money to sort it out. The last thing that we want is for those visiting Saltaire to be stuck in queues of traffic. What incentive would there be for them ever to return? I hope that the Government will work with the Department for Transport to ensure that the Highways Agency makes special provision for places with world heritage sites, in order to attract people there.</p>
	<p pid="a.470.0/10">My final point, which I would like the Minister to address, is that some regulations seem to work against some world heritage sites. For example, signs cannot be put up on the motorway to promote Saltaire as a world heritage site, because the site is more than three miles from the motorway. Such regulation prevents world heritage sites from being promoted. It would be welcomed by people travelling on the M62 if there were something on that motorway saying, &quot;Come to Saltaire, there is a world heritage site there.&quot;</p>

	<p pid="a.472.0/1">I encourage my hon. Friend to challenge that ruling. It is a very important point. A long time ago, when I was Minister for Roads and Traffic, I received complaints from the dean and chapter of Ripon cathedral, because it was not allowed a sign on the motorway. Going to Dover on the motorway at that time, I discovered a brown sign for Rochester cathedral, which was further from the motorway than Ripon cathedral. So I tell my hon. Friend to challenge that ruling and really go for it.</p>

	<p pid="a.472.1/1">I am grateful to my hon. Friend for that helpful advice. I am sure that my colleagues on Bradford metropolitan district council will challenge that ruling, but they were told that they were not allowed to put a sign on the motorway, because the site was more than three miles from it.</p>
	<p pid="a.472.1/2">I again congratulate the hon. Member for Telford on all his hard work in the field, and on securing the debate. World heritage sites are an important part of our culture and heritage, and they deserve special protection. There are measures&mdash;often simple measures&mdash;that the Government could take that would do an awful lot to help those sites. I hope that the Minister can address some of those issues.</p>

	<p pid="a.472.2/1">We have had a useful and valuable debate, with tremendous contributions. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1803" name="Robert Key">The hon. Member for Salisbury (Robert Key)</phrase> told us the great and sad story of Stonehenge. As I listened to him, I reflected that it was a huge pity that when the hon. Gentleman held his two ministerial posts, Sir Humphrey laid such a heavy hand on his shoulder, because with his passion and commitment to finding a solution to the problems of Stonehenge, I am convinced that if he had been given the necessary freedom in those posts, he would have got on and done something about it.</p>
	<p pid="a.472.2/2">I shall return to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1714" name="Ashok Kumar">the contribution of the hon. Member for Middlesbrough, South and East Cleveland (Dr. Kumar)</phrase> in a minute, but first I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1816" name="Philip Davies">the hon. Member for Shipley (Philip Davies)</phrase>, who talked passionately about his patch and the world heritage site of Saltaire in it, but who also rightly raised a number of concerns that are shared by others in the House, and I want to touch on those. I join the hon. Member for Salisbury in urging the hon. Member for Shipley to go back and have words about signage; I, too, am convinced that that problem can be solved. I notice that the Minister's Parliamentary Private Secretary is making detailed notes, so I am sure that if the hon. Gentleman talks to him afterwards, he will get some advice about that.</p>
	<p pid="a.472.2/3">My greatest praise must be for <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1871" name="David Wright">the hon. Member for Telford (David Wright)</phrase>, who made an extremely good and comprehensive introductory speech. I also congratulate him on his re-election as chairman of the all-party group on world heritage sites. I am delighted to be one of the two vice-chairmen of that group, and am particularly delighted that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1538" name="Hugo Swire">the hon. Member for East Devon (Mr. Swire)</phrase>, the other vice-chairman, is here. I wish to take this first public opportunity to congratulate him on his recent elevation in the ranks of his party. I also put on record my thanks to English Heritage for the support that it now gives the all-party group, and add particular thanks to Sir Neil Cussons from that body for his inspiring contribution to our first meeting in this parliamentary Session.</p>
	<p pid="a.472.2/4">I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak, because not only I am the vice-chairman, but I am proud to be the only Member of Parliament in the United Kingdom who can boast of having an entire city as a world heritage site in their constituency.</p>
	<p pid="a.472.2/5">I want to begin my remarks, oddly, by making a few suggestions to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1714" name="Ashok Kumar">the hon. Member for Middlesbrough, South and East Cleveland (Dr. Kumar)</phrase>. I agreed with everything he said about reflecting the importance of science and engineering in the tentative list&mdash;and in the long term, I hope, in the actual list.</p>
	<p pid="a.472.2/6">I hope that the Minister is listening to this next suggestion. Next year, 2006, will be the 200th anniversary of the birth of Isambard Kingdom Brunel. If we ask the question, &quot;Who put the great in Great Britain?&quot;, we know from the recent poll that Churchill came first and I. K. Brunel came second. One of the best ways of reflecting that and meeting the hon. Gentleman's requirements would be to ensure that the Great Western railway gets the prominence that it deserves.</p>
	<p pid="a.472.2/7">After all, it was Brunel's work on that railway that not only put Britain on the map, but showed the world how to set up mass transport. It is not Brunel's fault that on that railway there are some of the highest fares in Europe. Although many of the early railways have long since disappeared, the Great Western railway is not only still in operation, but able to carry the modern high-speed trains that, as the hon. Member for Salisbury said, enable us to travel to the south-west.</p>

	<p pid="a.473.1/1">The hon. Gentleman may doubt the speed, but he knows that with the new franchise, we have a commitment from First Group to provide better rolling stock on the line.</p>
	<p pid="a.473.1/2">Perhaps the hon. Member for Middlesbrough, South and East Cleveland and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1971" name="Jo Swinson">my hon. Friend the Member for East Dunbartonshire (Jo Swinson)</phrase>, who is no longer present, were guilty of trying to put too many sites on the tentative list. Now that we have the opportunity for only one key proposal, it will be even more difficult for GWR to be the one that we take forward.</p>
	<p pid="a.473.1/3">Wherever world heritage sites are&mdash;Saltaire, Telford or anywhere else&mdash;we are proud of them, we know about their importance, we recognise their economic potential and we know that they are attractive to businesses and investment. After all, they have been singled out as the best examples in the world of places that people inhabit, visit and so on. I recognise the enormous benefit of that status, but it does not alter the fact that there are a number of problems, which other hon. Members have already described.</p>
	<p pid="a.473.1/4">Bath, for example, has a large number of listed buildings. The people in listed buildings automatically have to apply for listed building consent to make any changes, but they do not have to pay for that, which puts financial pressure on the local authority. Because Bath is a world heritage city, if there is a major development and the developers come in, our local council planning department must do a huge amount of additional work. However, there is a cap on the amount of money that it can charge developers, which creates a huge strain.</p>
	<p pid="a.473.1/5">Throughout the country, there is inconsistency in the funding, back-up and support for our 26 world heritages sites. Sadly, there are gaps in the conservation legislation and the listed building and scheduled monument legislation, down which we can fall.</p>
	<p pid="a.473.1/6">There are huge pressures. The South West regional assembly, in developing its regional spatial plan, wants to create a huge amount of growth in Bath. There are huge consequences for the way in which we manage that growth while retaining the uniqueness that entitles us to call ourselves a world heritage city. We must find a way of resolving that conflict.</p>
	<p pid="a.473.1/7">Only in the past couple of days, I received a letter from Bath's conservation officer with responsibility for world heritage. She writes:</p>
	<p pid="a.473.1/8" class="indent">&quot;It is very hard to get environmental issues such as World Heritage status appropriately considered in the face of 'economic necessity', especially when we are talking about emotive (as well as essential) issues such as affordable housing and employment. But, and it's a big but, certainly with Bath and with most if not all other World Heritage Sites, we will be killing the golden goose if we allow inappropriate levels and types of development.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.473.1/9">She is absolutely right. We must find solutions to that problem.</p>
	<p pid="a.473.1/10">As the hon. Member for Telford said, management plans are part of the solution. This country led the way in putting them in place. Now, nearly all our world heritage sites have one, and soon all of them will. They are part of the way forward. However, unless we find resources for implementing them, we will be in difficulty, as the hon. Member for Shipley rightly said.</p>
	<p pid="a.473.1/11">We must also take forward some of the other ideas that have been suggested. The Government are currently conducting a heritage protection review. Many of us would urge the Minister to provide statutory protection in one form or another for world heritage sites, and to ensure that it is the right sort of statutory protection. This cannot be done on some sort of consensual basis. A mandatory system must be put in place to get real protection. Perhaps the Minister will respond to those points.</p>
	<p pid="a.473.1/12">As has been mentioned, there have been opportunities in respect of the register of historic sites and buildings and so on, but there are models&mdash;for example, areas of outstanding natural beauty and the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000&mdash;that we could pick up and run with quickly.</p>
	<p pid="a.473.1/13">I am conscious that time is tight, so I must finish soon. In his extremely valuable contribution, the hon. Member for Telford discussed the need to start promoting the brand in this country, and he is absolutely right. My suggestions build on what he said. There are five key steps that we could easily take.</p>
	<p pid="a.473.1/14">First, we should work hard to get all the United Kingdom's sites to use and prominently display the official world heritage symbol. Secondly, Ordnance Survey maps should show world heritage sites with the appropriate symbol on all its maps. Thirdly, VisitBritain should promote our world heritage sites much more effectively, particularly when it advertises overseas. Fourthly, let us persuade every site to distribute a leaflet that describes what is offered at the other sites in the rest of the country and overseas. Finally, let us find better ways of providing links between the sites&mdash;perhaps route maps and so on.</p>
	<p pid="a.473.1/15">I entirely agree with the hon. Member for Telford that the 2012 Olympics will provide a target date for putting all those ideas in place. World heritage sites are fantastic. They are wonderful. We should be enormously proud of the 26 in this country, but they need more help, and I hope that in few minutes' time the Minister will describe how he will provide it.</p>

	<p pid="a.475.2/1">Thank you, Mr. Olner. I am sure that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1696" name="Philip Dunne">my hon. Friend the Member for Ludlow (Mr. Dunne)</phrase> will find me very forgiving if he seeks to intervene during my few remarks. In the spirit of consensus, I should like to join the universal gratitude of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1871" name="David Wright">the House to the hon. Member for Telford (David Wright)</phrase>, who manfully continues the job that he started. I take this opportunity to congratulate him and the vice-chairman, while simultaneously apologising for not being able to make our meeting yesterday.</p>
	<p pid="a.475.2/2">I would also like to take the opportunity&mdash;with your indulgence, Mr. Olner, lest this become a sort of end-of-term party&mdash;to thank <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1391" name="Don Foster">the hon. Member for Bath (Mr. Foster)</phrase> for congratulating me on my elevation to the shadow Cabinet. My only message to him, given the current questions over the leadership of his own party, is that the sky is the limit. I also extend my thanks to the Local Authority World Heritage Forum, as I suspect that much of the work falls on its shoulders. It does an excellent job.</p>
	<p pid="a.475.2/3">It is appropriate that we are meeting here this afternoon. The hon. Member for Telford was right to point out that we are debating this topic in what is&mdash;although we often forget it&mdash;a world heritage site. As the chairman of the Speaker's Advisory Committee on Works of Art, I know that that sometimes causes problems. Who has the right to decide what statues stand in the square outside? It turns out that the answer to that is not Parliament, or even Parliament as a world heritage site; it is the Mayor of London. The fact that the Mayor has the right to decide what statues should stand opposite Parliament fills some of us with as much confidence as the Trojans had on discovering too late that the horse was hollow and had people inside it. I ask the Minister to look into the whole question of the Westminster world heritage site at some stage in the future, and find out whether we can bring within the competence of that site&mdash;and, perhaps, within the powers of Parliament&mdash;the right to control the place that we inhabit.</p>
	<p pid="a.475.2/4">There is much talk about sites in the United Kingdom&mdash;that is what the debate is about&mdash;but our responsibilities extend beyond our national borders. We have responsibilities around the world. In my party's manifesto at the last election, I specifically included a token sum of &pound;5 million from the lottery funds to protect British heritage overseas; there are many remnants of British history overseas, such as Shackleton's Antarctic huts. That sum might have been tokenistic, but it was indicative of our thinking and our aspiration. Funds would also have been made available for heritage sites in Iraq, such as Babylon, which suffered during coalition activity and attacks in the recent war in that country. Therefore, although our responsibilities are domestic, they extend beyond our national borders.</p>
	<p pid="a.475.2/5"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1803" name="Robert Key">My hon. Friend the Member for Salisbury (Robert Key)</phrase> is my almost near neighbour; he would be my near neighbour if the trains were faster and the roads better between Salisbury and East Devon. He referred&mdash;rather poetically, I thought&mdash;to the world heritage site that is partially in my constituency as &quot;Jurassic Park&quot;. No doubt many of us in our part of the world would do well as extras in the film of that name, but the correct term for it is the Jurassic coast&mdash;in fact, the technical term for it is the Jurassic, Triassic and cretaceous coast; were I allowed to refer to those sitting at the back of the Chamber, I would no doubt be able to state that several of them were nodding in assent to that.</p>
	<p pid="a.475.2/6">As we are all being a little partisan about our own sites, I shall take this opportunity to congratulate everyone in Devon and Dorset who worked so tirelessly to get us world heritage site status. The day we got it was a tremendous day. I should like to point out that we got it in the same year as Saltaire did, and somewhat after the city of Bath, which was awarded that status in 1987. My hon. Friend's very own Stonehenge was awarded it in 1986, which pips us all at the post.</p>
	<p pid="a.475.2/7">I am interested in what the hon. Member for Telford said, and I look forward to hearing the Minister's comments. That there is no statutory provision for protecting world heritage sites is extraordinary. I would welcome receiving any information that the Minister might have on that. I question whether the DCMS register goes far enough, and what it is intended to do. I would also like to know how we could go further.</p>
	<p pid="a.475.2/8">The thorny issue of resources is dear to my heart. We should not do world heritage sites on the cheap. We are in a competitive environment; we are competing with the very best around the world. Places should not be given world heritage site status and then, bang, they are on their own&mdash;but that is what tends to happen. In Jurassic park&mdash;or rather, on the Jurassic coast&mdash;we are trying to set up a themed walk with visitor centres, some of which might be in my constituency. There might be one at the start of the walk in Exmouth, another in Seaton and others in Dorset as well. There would be interpretive centres linked together all the way down the coast. But we are finding it extremely difficult to access funding and to get any body&mdash;such as the ODPM or the DCMS&mdash;interested in developing these ideas.</p>
	<p pid="a.475.2/9">To give credit to all who are working on the project, I must add that the Jurassic coast is already recognised nationally and internationally as leading on sustainable tourism and public transport initiatives. It won the winter 2005 Tourism for Tomorrow destination award, and the Jurassic coast X53 service got an excellence passenger transport award and a national transport award. People are doing things, but often without much support from central Government.</p>
	<p pid="a.475.2/10">There is also the wider issue of entertaining and looking after all those tourists who come to see our world heritage site. Amazingly, we have a shortage of hotel beds in my part of the world. No great thought seems to be given to what should happen next. Yes, the award was won on merit, but what happens next? What about the necessary infrastructure, both for the people who live there, so that their everyday lives are not impinged on unnecessarily, and for the tourists whom we want to come here to make the sites economically viable and sustainable in the longer term?</p>

The Olympics provide us with a wonderful opportunity to do so. There is some nervousness that the Olympic games will be London-centric. That would be inappropriate, particularly given this debate, which is about sites all around our country. I urge the Minister, when discussing the subject with officials and colleagues, to bear in mind that there is life outside London.</p>
	<p pid="a.478.0/3">World heritage sites at risk, and future sites that may be threatened, have been briefly mentioned. That problem needs to be examined. We also need to spend a little more time, energy and&mdash;dare I say it?&mdash;resources, on the conservation of existing sites. That may be required as a result of wear and tear from the increase in visitor numbers, or there may be a need for sensitive development to enhance rather than detract from the sites.</p>
	<p pid="a.478.0/4">My hon. Friend the Member for Salisbury spoke about Stonehenge. I know a little bit about that. He has been kind enough to brief me in the past. I have had visits from people involved in the visitor centre in my constituency. Stonehenge is a token in my everyday life in a way, because I travel up and down the A303. I have my own reservations about some of the plans. The Countess roundabout is quite far away for a visitor centre, and there are issues about how one gets people from there to the site.</p>
	<p pid="a.478.0/5">I have a residual sadness at the thought that one day I will travel up and down the A303 and not even see Stonehenge&mdash;but I am prepared to sacrifice my desires for the benefit of all. I understand that something needs to be done. The Minister could make his name here, because this argument has been around almost as long as the stones themselves. If he comes up with a workable solution on which we can all co-operate&mdash;it may not be the ideal solution, but it must be one that can be undertaken and enforced&mdash;he will have my support and that of my hon. Friend the Member for Salisbury.</p>
	<p pid="a.478.0/6"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1714" name="Ashok Kumar">The hon. Member for Middlesbrough, South and East Cleveland (Dr. Kumar)</phrase> made some very good points about what he wanted, given his background in science and engineering. I urge him to consider that not everything can be a world heritage site. If anything is to come out of this debate, for goodness' sake, let it be that we spend a little more time on making what we have better, rather than just coming up with new ideas. Otherwise, the entire country could turn into a world heritage site. None the less, I take the hon. Gentleman's point.</p>
	<p pid="a.478.0/7"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1816" name="Philip Davies">My hon. Friend the Member for Shipley (Philip Davies)</phrase> talked about Saltaire, which received the same award in the same year as us&mdash;and a very good thing, too. He talked about Saltaire's connection with David Hockney, who is perhaps not so popular in Government circles these days, as he is, as it were, rubbing salt from Saltaire into the Government's wounds over their plans to ban smoking. Saltaire is an important site.</p>
	<p pid="a.478.0/8">My hon. Friend made an important point about the school curriculum; the debate always returns to the school curriculum. The first people to whom we should speak about world heritage sites in the United Kingdom are our students, pupils and children, who are the citizens of tomorrow. If they do not take an interest, not only shall we not get many more world heritage sites but there will be no great hunger for them and no one to look after them. Therefore the school curriculum is incredibly important to preserving our heritage. I know that in his reply to the debate, the Minister will want to deal with each and every point that has been made.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-12-14a.479.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1882" speakername="David Lammy" speakeroffice="The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport"  colnum="479"  time="015:46:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051214/halltext/51214h03.htm#51214h03_spmin1">
	<p pid="a.479.0/1">In the time available, I want to respond to all the points that were raised by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1871" name="David Wright">my hon. Friend the Member for Telford (David Wright)</phrase>. I congratulate him on introducing an excellent debate on world heritage. It is important that we have the opportunity to discuss the issue, and it is appropriate that we are having the debate in Westminster Hall. I accept <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1538" name="Hugo Swire">the points that the hon. Member for East Devon (Mr. Swire)</phrase> raised about the Mayor of London, and those points will arise again during next year's heritage protection review.</p>
	<p pid="a.479.0/2"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1714" name="Ashok Kumar">My hon. Friend the Member for Middlesbrough, South and East Cleveland (Dr. Kumar)</phrase> made important points too. I take those on board, even if I may not have time to respond to them. The same goes for what was said by the hon. Members for Salisbury (Robert Key) and for Shipley (Philip Davies).</p>
	<p pid="a.479.0/3">The hon. Member for Salisbury will know that I sympathise greatly with the case for Stonehenge. Stonehenge was the first heritage site that I visited, in my first few days in this post. The case to renew Stonehenge is well made, and we must work through the problems; I hope that I will have time to speak about them today. I sympathised with the hon. Gentleman when he spoke about the position that he found himself in with Sir Humphrey. He will see today that I have with me not just one but five Sir Humphreys. That is why it has been difficult to get White Hart Lane on to the tentative list.</p>
	<p pid="a.479.0/4">I can tell the hon. Member for Shipley that I have been to Saltaire. I was there in May to help the former Member for Shipley, and I hope to visit Saltaire again in the years ahead.</p>
	<p pid="a.479.0/5">We have had a good debate. The world heritage convention, which the UK signed in 1984, has proved to be an enormously effective and positive force in bringing together nations from all over the world to act collectively to safeguard sites of outstanding universal value. An inscription as a world heritage site, of which there are now more than 800 worldwide, is the highest accolade that a place can receive. An inscription brings with it real international prestige.</p>
	<p pid="a.479.0/6">One of the first steps that this Government took was to rejoin UNESCO. We played a full part in supporting UNESCO and the world heritage committee's implementation of the world heritage convention. From 2001 to 2005 the UK was, for the first time, a full member of the world heritage committee. We left this year only because our term of office came to an end.</p>
	<p pid="a.479.0/7">The work that we did has gained us huge international standing. During our time on the committee, we have supported developing countries as they put together their own nominations for world heritage inscription. We have participated in a full revision of the operational guidelines&mdash;the rule book that governs how the world heritage convention is implemented. We have supported the process for periodic reporting on world heritage sites across Europe and contributed funds for bilateral programmes to support world heritage in other parts of the world, including support for Anguilla and St. Lucia. We are now discussing a further programme based on sub-Saharan Africa with UNESCO.</p>
	<p pid="a.479.0/8">We are delighted that through our membership, we have encouraged the world heritage committee to develop a strategy to manage the impact of climate change on world heritage sites. Next year, the UK is to host a meeting of experts to consider specifically the effect of climate change on our world heritage sites. Our aim is to pool expertise and develop management strategies across all regions of the world so that that important issue, which is bearing down on our sites, can be resolved.</p>
	<p pid="a.479.0/9">I now turn back to our track record at home. The year 1997 saw the start of the review of the tentative list of sites recognised as having potential for future nomination as world heritage sites, and that redefined how we look at candidates for world heritage nomination, which now include not only iconic monuments&mdash;world-class though they are&mdash;but sites that epitomise Britain's achievements in leading the industrialisation of the world, and our global influence, as well as sites that reflect everyday life and industry. That goes to the heart of the contribution made by my hon. Friend the Member for Middlesbrough, South and East Cleveland, notwithstanding the fact that some of the sites that he wants to be included are not on the list.</p>
	<p pid="a.479.0/10">The UK currently has 26 world heritage sites. As we have heard, there are 16 in England, four in Scotland, two in Wales, one in Northern Ireland and three in our overseas territories. They represent a tremendous spread, both geographically and in terms of type. They range from the town of St. George in Bermuda to the frontiers of the Roman empire, represented by Hadrian's wall, and from St. Kilda to the Blaenavon industrial landscape in Wales. They include, of course, the Ironbridge gorge. Eight sites from the tentative list have been inscribed since 1999.</p>
	<p pid="a.479.0/11">The Government take seriously their responsibility for world heritage. Protection for world heritage sites is enshrined in the planning system; in England that is set out in PPG15 and the associated guidance, specifically for the home counties. Management plans for world heritage sites are an essential part of how we manage them; that approach has been adopted throughout the world, and is encouraged by UNESCO.</p>
	<p pid="a.479.0/12">The management plan should govern how we bring about consensus among all the stakeholders involved in a world heritage site. Essentially, it is the partnership contract that enables all participants to work together. In 1997, one management plan had been completed; now, 22 have been, and work is in hand on the remaining four sites.</p>
	<p pid="a.479.0/13">As a country, we have achieved a great deal, but the route to world heritage status is not easy. Such status brings advantages: prestige, recognition, public awareness and local pride. More weight is given to conservation and protection, and the status can bring economic advantage through increased tourism as part of an economic regeneration plan.</p>
	<p pid="a.479.0/14">However, the status also brings questions about how the sites are to be managed. Increased visitor numbers can jeopardise the sustainable development of a site. A few months ago at Stonehenge, I saw how the flow of people was being managed. Particularly during the summer solstice, work with the police ensured that the volume of people coming to the site did not disrupt it for future generations. The Government are not complacent about those responsibilities, and today's debate has highlighted some of the issues that we face and how they relate to aspects of what the Government are attempting to do. We believe that there is more we can do to develop partnership by working even further at the national level through my own and other Departments and with agencies and non-governmental organisations such as English Heritage, the UK National Commission for UNESCO, the Local Authority World Heritage Forum and the all-party parliamentary group.</p>
	<p pid="a.479.0/15">I shall now turn to some of the specific issues raised in the debate. I have said that I will announce the start of a review of the tentative list next spring. That will be a major lengthy undertaking on which we shall work closely with the devolved Administrations and the Crown dependencies. The points raised by my hon. Friend for Middlesbrough, South and East Cleveland are on the record, and he will no doubt want to play a role in that.</p>
	<p pid="a.479.0/16">What has been said about statutory protection for our world heritage sites is important, and I totally understand the need for that as we move forward with the heritage review. A balance needs to be struck. Any new system must take account of the nature of world heritage sites, and enable them to extend across a wide area. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1391" name="Don Foster">The hon. Member for Bath (Mr. Foster)</phrase> raised that issue in the context of almost his entire constituency, and we will have to ensure that there is flexibility. I suspect that the hon. Gentleman would want to ensure that the entirety of Bath town centre was not included under some new system. We want to work through such issues, and we want hon. Members and the all-party group to help us as we begin to work out how inclusion of world heritage sites might look in a new unified register.</p>
	<p pid="a.479.0/17">I fully recognise the important points that my hon. Friend the Member for Telford made about promotion and marketing of our heritage sites. I recognise the importance of world heritage sites in attracting visitors to the UK. That is the key reason for the heavy involvement of VisitBritain in promoting heritage sites, and I am pleased that it is launching its Enjoy England 2006 campaign tomorrow. That will play a role in promoting world heritage more widely, particularly after the problems that we had in London this summer, which affected tourism in this country to some extent.</p>
	<p pid="a.479.0/18">As for the pressure that is rightly placed on local authorities and the funding issues that arise from that, there is a quid pro quo. Designation as a world heritage site means that in a fairly competitive field&mdash;we have heard about some of the other places that could be world heritage sites&mdash;people are attracted to a particular place. They want to come to it, and that in itself benefits the local economy. During the next few months, my officials are discussing further with English Heritage the central support that might be needed for world heritage sites in the light of information coming out of the recent periodic reporting exercise.</p>
	<p pid="a.479.0/19">It is important to emphasise&mdash;this has not been mentioned so far&mdash;the huge role that the Heritage Lottery Fund plays in supporting our world heritage sites. It has given more than &pound;85 million towards them since 1994, and as I examine the list of the money that it has provided, there is not a site mentioned in the debate that has not received some money from the fund. It stands ready to receive applications if there are particular needs&mdash;</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-12-14a.483.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1380" speakername="David Heyes" colnum="483"  time="016:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051214/halltext/51214h04.htm#51214h04_spnew0">
	<p pid="a.483.1/1">I am grateful to have been granted this Adjournment debate on a matter that has had an impact on many hundreds of my constituents and, I suspect, many thousands of others throughout the country&mdash;people who live near newly constructed highways, and who should be entitled to financial compensation under the law.</p>
	<p pid="a.483.1/2">In October 2000, the long-awaited and much-needed final section of the M60 motorway opened to complete the missing link in the Manchester outer ring road. The motorway runs right through the heart of my constituency, between junctions 22 and 23. The road has transformed communications on the eastern side of the Greater Manchester conurbation, and we are seeing some real economic regeneration benefits in such areas as Hollinwood junction and Ashton Moss.</p>
	<p pid="a.483.1/3">The opening of the motorway came as a great relief to many of my constituents, some of whom had waited more than 40 years since plans were first published. During that time, the area suffered greatly from the effects of blight, and during the five-year construction period, people suffered even more from the consequent noise, dust, dirt and traffic disruption.</p>
	<p pid="a.483.1/4">Most significantly, once the motorway was opened, people faced the further consequence of the loss of property values as a result of their proximity to the new road. It came as good news to thousands of local residents to discover that under part 1 of the Land Compensation Act 1973 they were at last to qualify for some financial compensation.</p>
	<p pid="a.483.1/5">I should declare an interest as I live close to the new motorway. Potentially, like so many of my constituents, I shall be entitled to compensation under the 1973 Act. We became aware of our entitlement because of a widely circulated Highways Agency leaflet telling us about the scheme and what we needed to do to pursue a claim. The leaflet includes these words:</p>
	<p pid="a.483.1/6" class="indent">&quot;If you have employed an agent and your claim is successful then the Highways Agency will also pay their reasonable costs, as agreed by the valuer&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.483.1/7">For many people, the prospect of making a claim seemed daunting. However, in the run up to the motorway opening and immediately after, people in the affected area started to receive letters from firms of chartered surveyors offering to process their claims. All stated that because the Highways Agency would pay a fee to the agent, there would be no charge for the service. Understandably, most residents signed up with the agents, and I am aware of many who have received their compensation and are satisfied with the surveyors who acted on their behalf.</p>
	<p pid="a.483.1/8">I first became aware in August of the problems that I want to outline, when a constituent complained to me about the chartered surveyor who was acting on his behalf. The surveyor wrote to him in April 2003, assuring him that</p>
	<p pid="a.483.1/9" class="indent">&quot;there will be no cost to you for our services whatever the outcome.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.483.1/10">The phrase was in bold type, and it was the only part of the letter emphasised in that way. A subsequent letter in May 2003 said that the agent was</p>
	<p pid="a.483.1/11" class="indent">&quot;pleased to confirm that our costs will be paid by the compensating authority&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.483.1/12">Both letters were written in reassuring and accessible language, and, understandably, my constituent felt comfortable engaging the professional services of a firm of chartered surveyors to pursue his claim free of charge.</p>
	<p pid="a.483.1/13">I shall fast forward almost two years to January this year when my constituent received another letter from his agent advising that he was pleased to report that the compensating authority had made an offer of &pound;1,000 to settle his claim. However, further in the letter came the bad news, and I shall read some key extracts. The surveyor's third letter says:</p>
	<p pid="a.483.1/14" class="indent">&quot;You will recall that in previous correspondence we stated that the compensating authority are obliged to pay our reasonable costs.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.483.1/15">In fact, in the first two letters, there was no mention of &quot;reasonable costs&quot;, although it is used in the Highways Agency literature. The surveyor's letter continues:</p>
	<p pid="a.483.1/16" class="indent">&quot;Unfortunately, we have not been able to agree our fee with the compensating authority for the work that we have carried out on your behalf. The reason for this is that the Highways Agency has withdrawn from a provisional agreement made with them and their valuation advisers last September.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.483.1/17">The letter continues to allege that the Highways Agency had refused to meet the agents to discuss the issue, and offers the client three options. The first option is:</p>
	<p pid="a.483.1/18" class="indent">&quot;To refer the matter to the Land Tribunal for determination. Although it is possible to make the application yourself we would recommend that you take appropriate legal advice as this can be a costly legal process and as with all such references the costs involved are not necessarily recoverable even if the reference is successful.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.483.1/19">That is a change from the reassuring and simple language of the initial letters to a much more technical style. Strangely, that so-called option refers to determination; yet the beginning of the letter suggests that the Highways Agency has already made the offer of a settlement figure. Even stranger, elsewhere in the same letter the agent refers to</p>
	<p pid="a.483.1/20" class="indent">&quot;significant risks involved in making such a reference&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.483.1/21">to the Land Tribunal, and cautions against that course of action.</p>
	<p pid="a.483.1/22">The second option is for the client to wait until the fee negotiations are concluded. However, the agent warns that:</p>
	<p pid="a.483.1/23" class="indent">&quot;Unfortunately not only is there little prospect of reaching agreement with the Highways Agency within the next few months, it may not be possible to reach agreement through negotiation and therefore the dispute may remain unresolved until it is determined through legal action.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.483.1/24">The third and final option offered to my constituent was:</p>
	<p pid="a.483.1/25" class="indent">&quot;To make a contribution towards the difference between the amount which the Highways Agency are prepared to pay and the costs we have incurred. As a valued client we are not asking you to pay the full amount.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.483.1/26">In this case, the amount requested was &pound;50, although I am now aware of other cases where the amount was much greater.</p>
	<p pid="a.483.1/27">My constituent found none of the options in that letter to be reasonable. However, he felt that he had no choice but to pay the additional fee, being left with the clear impression that he might never get the compensation if the Highways Agency and the agent did not reach an agreement. Faced with Hobson's choice&mdash;that is, no real choice at all&mdash;my constituent reluctantly paid up.</p>
	<p pid="a.483.1/28">In March 2005 the Highways Agency wrote to my constituent, confirming the amount of compensation and asking him to complete and sign an acceptance form. They also advised that his agent would be paid &pound;326.65 for representing him. This infuriated my constituent, who wrote to the agent on his own behalf, and on behalf of three neighbours, saying:</p>
	<p pid="a.483.1/29" class="indent">&quot;After studying item three of your January letter . . . we wrongly assumed that we would have to pay this &pound;50 fee before you would take further action on our behalf.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.483.1/30">He also pointed out that neighbours who had refused to pay that extra fee were told that it would be waived, and that they received their settlement at the same time as people who did pay. He correctly states that he was never told that the Highways Agency would pay the agent the fee of &pound;326.65, and therefore requested a refund of his own &pound;50 fee, and those of his three neighbours&mdash;who are, incidentally, all elderly widows.</p>
	<p pid="a.483.1/31">Let me emphasise the point. That means a charge of &pound;376.65 for negotiating a claim valued at only &pound;1,000. Even at that stage, my constituent did not feel the need to turn to his MP. By August, he had written a further two letters, but had had no response other than a holding letter in July, advising that the person he had written to was on leave and would respond on his return two weeks later. As of today, my constituent has still not had the courtesy of a response, and has certainly not had his &pound;50 refunded.</p>
	<p pid="a.483.1/32">I agree wholeheartedly with my constituent that the three choices offered to him were not really choices at all. As I said earlier, it just so happens that my own home is close to the M60 and I am likely to be eligible for compensation under the scheme. Like my constituent, I received the first two standard letters from the same firm of chartered surveyors, reassuring me that it would act on my behalf at no cost. As it is a member of the respected Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, I, like so many of my constituents, put my trust in it.</p>
	<p pid="a.483.1/33">I, too, have since received the third letter offering me the same three options. I replied making it clear that I had no intention of paying the extra fee and that I would hold the firm to our original agreement. I also challenged that practice on behalf of my constituents. Unlike them, I did receive a response&mdash;in fact, a rather swift and lengthy one&mdash;from the senior partner in the firm. He told me that</p>
	<p pid="a.483.1/34" class="indent">&quot;it is true that in some instances we have waived our request for a contribution&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.483.1/35">He also said:</p>
	<p pid="a.483.1/36" class="indent">&quot;If none of our clients paid a contribution we would not be in business today, however if the majority pay then we can occasionally afford to waive the contribution.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.483.1/37">He offered to waive it in my own case. Needless to say, I would not contemplate accepting that offer while many of my constituents have felt obliged to pay. Indeed, I now have no intention of progressing my own claim until a satisfactory conclusion is reached on the matter.</p>
	<p pid="a.483.1/38">Although there are several firms acting as agents in the M60 compensation process, I am aware of only two that have requested additional fees from clients. They are Thomson Broadbent of Wellingborough, which is acting on my behalf and that of my constituent, and, to a lesser extent, the Davies Partnership of Ledbury. That calls into question the claim that Thomson Broadbent would go out of business if it was not paid the additional fee by most of its clients. Other chartered surveyors are dispensing their duty to clients in good faith, consistent with their original offer of representation free of any charge to the client.</p>
	<p pid="a.483.1/39">Since August, I have pursued a number of avenues in relation to this matter. I suspected that the few cases of which I had been made aware might be just the tip of the iceberg. I promoted the matter through some articles in the local press, which prompted dozens of calls from people who had had similar experiences. I now have a file containing details of about 100 people, many from my own constituency and others from neighbouring constituencies. I am grateful to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1531" name="Andrew Gwynne">my hon. Friend the Member for Denton and Reddish (Andrew Gwynne)</phrase> for allowing me to include his constituents in the evidence that I have presented to the various agencies.</p>
	<p pid="a.483.1/40">The same pattern emerges from most of those cases. Most are clients of Thomson Broadbent. All were originally promised that the agent would act free of charge. All were subsequently asked for an extra contribution, being offered that as one of three options. All had inferred that to pay up was the only way to receive compensation within a reasonable time scale. Some paid up and, like my constituent, later discovered that their surveyor was also paid a substantial fee by the Highways Agency. Others simply refused to pay. Many had realised that there was no correlation between whether they paid the fee and the timing of their claim being settled. All felt aggrieved to have been treated in that way by firms in which they had placed their trust.</p>
	<p pid="a.483.1/41">I have written to the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors asking it to investigate whether the actions of its members contravene its code of conduct and, if so, what it intends to do. I have given details of the 100 or so cases of which I am aware and I await its response. I hope that it will see that the dubious practice of some of its members reflects badly on the profession, and that its many reputable members risk being tarred with the same brush. However, I am not confident that any sanction that the institution might be minded to impose would be sufficient to prevent that practice from continuing in my constituency and elsewhere.</p>
	<p pid="a.483.1/42">I have also written to the Office of Fair Trading. I received a reply last week and I was astounded to be told that there is no legislation that it can use to prevent the practice of requesting an extra fee after initially agreeing to act on a free-of-charge basis. After I received the letter, I contacted the OFT again and was assured by the deputy director of UK enforcement that that was the case. I question the validity of current fair trading legislation if the practice that I have described is not considered illegal, and the watchdog that should be able to challenge it seems to be so toothless.</p>
	<p pid="a.483.1/43">I shall turn now to the role of the Highways Agency in the matter. I am not sure to what extent the actions of the agency may have brought about the difficulty in the first place. Moreover, I am not convinced that it has acted with sufficient determination to bring about a solution. I have written to, and met, senior managers from the Highways Agency. They dispute the allegation that they have withdrawn from an agreement.</p>
	<p pid="a.483.1/44">From that meeting, and from correspondence with Thomson Broadbent, I now have a clearer understanding of the dispute between the Highways Agency and the agents. It appears that the fees for surveyors acting in compensation cases used to be paid in accordance with something called Ryde's scale, which was last reviewed in 1996, and before that was typically reviewed every six or seven years. However, in 2002, the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister announced that there would be no further review of the scale, which suggests that no fee increases have been agreed since 2002. If that is the case, I have some sympathy with surveyors, other than those who have chosen to offload the burden on to their clients. I am told that the scale was discontinued to encourage appropriate parties to seek to agree fees among themselves, and that the principal cause of the change was that Ryde's scale was generally too low. I am also told that the scale covered compulsory purchases, as well as part 1 compensation, but that the discontinuation of the scale has proved to be much more problematic in the case of part 1 compensation.</p>
	<p pid="a.483.1/45">I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister will be able to tell me whether he believes that the Highways Agency has acted properly to resolve the dispute with the agents, or whether it is to some extent responsible for the delay in resolving it. I was encouraged to learn that consultants have recently been engaged by the Highways Agency in an attempt to navigate a way out of the current impasse. I would be interested to know how the negotiations are progressing and whether my hon. Friend the Minister will press the Highways Agency to find a resolution. If he agrees that the request for an extra fee is unacceptable, will he act to stop it? Will he press for the inclusion in any deal of a requirement that firms of surveyors should pay back any top-up fees that had needlessly been paid by my constituents?</p>
	<p pid="a.483.1/46">I urge my hon. Friend to do everything in his power to encourage the parties to the dispute to find a solution that is fair to all, and particularly that my constituents get the compensation to which they are legally entitled&mdash;at no cost to them.</p>

	<p pid="a.487.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1380" name="David Heyes">my hon. Friend the Member for Ashton-under-Lyne (David Heyes)</phrase> on securing this important debate on what I know is a significant issue for many of his constituents. I congratulate him also on his diligent work in bringing the matter to the attention of Ministers, and on the work that he has done&mdash;I know that he has engaged in a large amount of correspondence.</p>
	<p pid="a.487.0/2">Through his correspondence with my hon. Friend the Minister of State, Department for Transport, my hon. Friend is aware that the Highways Agency is currently negotiating reasonable fees with agents representing claimants under part 1 of the Land Compensation Act 1973. That Act compensates those whose properties have been reduced in value by physical factors such as the noise, lighting or fumes that arise from the use of a new or improved road.</p>
	<p pid="a.487.0/3">The agency fully recognises its statutory obligations to reimburse successful claimants for the reasonable fees of their agents. It remains committed to working with the agents to find a fair solution to the fee issue. I shall refer shortly to the positive steps that have been taken to reach an agreement, about which my hon. Friend has asked a number of questions.</p>
	<p pid="a.487.0/4">Historically, Ryde's scale was the basis for the settlement of agents' fees. The scale was agreed jointly by the profession and the Government. As my hon. Friend said, it was abandoned in 2002 by the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister, in consultation with the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, because it was viewed as being uncompetitive and out of step with the remuneration of other professions.</p>
	<p pid="a.487.0/5">As my hon. Friend is aware, the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister has advised that there are no plans to reinstate Ryde's scale or to replace it. The ODPM stated in July 2002 that fees should normally be assessed on a reasonable basis, agreed between parties. Fixed scale fees were abandoned on <phrase class="date" code="2002-07-18">18 July 2002</phrase>. However, in the absence of an agreed formula, the Highways Agency continued until March 2004 to settle claims on the basis of Ryde's scale without dispute.</p>
	<p pid="a.487.0/6">A group of chartered surveyors then requested that the Highways Agency increase fees by 20 per cent. above those allowed for in Ryde's scale. The agents argued that Ryde's had not been reviewed for many years and their costs had risen considerably. The agency asked independent valuation contractors whether a 20 per cent. increase was justified, but they were of the view that the scale was sufficiently generous for the market and that fees had increased with the level of compensation and property values. They also advised that a reasonable settlement should reflect the economies of scale obtained by the agents in handling compensation claims.</p>
	<p pid="a.487.0/7">The agency carried out further investigations to corroborate the findings of its valuers. It sought the views of others, including Transport for London, which was also of the opinion that Ryde's scale was generous.</p>
	<p pid="a.487.0/8">My hon. Friend is aware, I am sure, that this is not a simple dispute to resolve. The agency and the claimants' agents are not contractually linked, and the solution goes well beyond the determination of individual claims. It has implications for all compensating authorities, and it will have an impact on thousands of part 1 claims&mdash;and on the public purse. As one of the larger compensating authorities, others look to the agency to set a benchmark on fees; accordingly, it has acted prudently and correctly throughout.</p>
	<p pid="a.487.0/9">The agency has held numerous discussions with representatives of the major agents and has also talked to other compensating authorities and the RICS. As a result, in March 2005, the agency made a two-stage offer which, if it had been accepted, would have led to a settlement based on measured evidence of the time taken to negotiate a part 1 claim.</p>
	<p pid="a.487.0/10">In response to this, the agents stated in April 2005 that it was impossible for them to keep accurate timesheets. The agency then proposed on <phrase class="date" code="2005-05-19">19 May 2005</phrase> that agents recommend an independent consultant to investigate the fee issue. The agents accepted this approach. However, on <phrase class="date" code="2005-08-17">17 August 2005</phrase> they reported that they had met with no success in finding a suitable person or organisation.</p>
	<p pid="a.487.0/11">As my hon. Friend is aware, the agency is currently working to find a suitable consultant. I am pleased to say that it has selected a firm of consultants that has considerable and far-reaching experience in determining the fee levels through negotiation and dispute resolution. The appointment will be announced shortly. Throughout the process, the agency maintained a dialogue with the major agents and kept them fully informed.</p>
	<p pid="a.487.0/12">During the study, the consultants all worked closely with the agency and the claimants' agents under the compensating authorities. The agency, for its part, will do its best to find a solution.</p>

	<p pid="a.489.0/1">On that point, will my hon. Friend urge the parties to this process&mdash;which I am happy is now in train and I obviously welcome it&mdash;to look at the issue of people who have made these top-up payments to firms of surveyors and who, should a better scale of fees be agreed retrospectively, stand to lose out financially. Can some way be found of recompensing them for the money that they have paid out in good faith?</p>

	<p pid="a.489.1/1">If agreement is reached on a higher fee, the agency will give sympathetic consideration to the reimbursement of those who have already paid an additional sum to their agents. The RICS was also asked to act as an arbiter but it has declined to be involved.</p>
	<p pid="a.489.1/2">As I said, during the study the consultants will work closely with the agency and the claimants' agents and other compensating authorities. The agency, for its part, will do its best to find the solution. The consultant's report should be available in the new year and it is hoped that it will give all parties the clarity that they require.</p>
	<p pid="a.489.1/3">I share my hon. Friend's concerns about the actions of individual agents who are requesting additional sums from the clients pending a general settlement of fees, following the abolition of Ryde's scale. It is for individual claimants and their agents to agree or waive this payment and it remains a private contractual matter in which the agency cannot intervene. The agency does not have the authority to prevent agents from acting in this unprofessional way towards its customers.</p>
	<p pid="a.489.1/4">The agency has referred the matter to the RICS, which has declined to be involved in the general settlement of fees. I was advised that it does not consider that it is wrong for members to renegotiate the terms of a contract.</p>
	<p pid="a.489.1/5">If claimants seek the agency's guidance, they are told that they are free to choose whoever they wish to represent them. Alternatively, clients are within their rights to deal directly with the Highways Agency and it will offer them every assistance. The agency already has a leaflet given to all claimants that explains the compensation process. A detailed booklet is currently being drafted, which will be made available to the public before new road schemes are opened to enable a more informed choice of an agent to be made.</p>
	<p pid="a.489.1/6">I should like to reassure my hon. Friend that the Highways Agency is firmly committed to the resolution of this issue. Putting the specific question of fees to one side, the working relationship the agency enjoys with the agents has developed in the spirit of partnership. The agency will do all that it can to reach a solution that is acceptable to all parties.</p>

	Artificial Sweeteners
</major-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-12-14a.491.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1444" speakername="Roger Williams" colnum="491"  time="016:25:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051214/halltext/51214h05.htm#51214h05_spnew0">
	<p pid="a.491.1/1">I am grateful for the opportunity to have this debate. For almost a year, I have been looking into the safety of the artificial sweetener, aspartame, and I was truly horrified by what I discovered. When I began my research, I was unconvinced by the off-the-wall internet conspiracy theories. I am a man of science, not of the internet. However, a number of eminent academics from the UK and further afield have persuaded me beyond doubt that aspartame represents a serious health problem.</p>
	<p pid="a.491.1/2">There is strong scientific evidence that the components of aspartame and their metabolites can cause very serious toxic effects in humans. There is also a wealth of subjective evidence that suggests a range of adverse neurological reactions to aspartame. Most importantly, undoubted scientific evidence was published in a top peer-reviewed journal last month that showed that long-term aspartame use causes cancer in rodents. The World Health Organisation recognises such findings in rats as highly predictive of carcinogenic risk for humans.</p>
	<p pid="a.491.1/3">The history of aspartame's approval is mired in controversy, not least because of the likes of Donald Rumsfeld &quot;calling in his markers&quot; to get it approved. The science that supported its approval was biased, inconclusive and incompetent. Aspartame is in a higher category of risk than Sudan 1, the UK's fastest recalled food substance. However, bad science, bad regulation and bad politics have left the bigger of those two threats in everyday products on our supermarket shelves.</p>
	<p pid="a.491.1/4">Aspartame is consumed every day by an average of one in 15 people worldwide, most of whom are children. How many children in Britain do not consume Walker's prawn cocktail crisps, Orbit or Airwaves chewing gum, Robinson's fruit squash, Lucozade or Diet Coke? Aspartame is even found in Centrum Kidz multivitamins, Lemsip cold and flu sachets for children, and Nurofen Meltlets for children. Those are the very products that are designed to cure our children when they are sick.</p>
	<p pid="a.491.1/5">The economic reality of a sweetening agent that costs one third of the price of sugar means that it is present in no fewer than 6,000 foods, drinks and pharmaceutical products in our supermarkets. The history of the approval of this ubiquitous product puts public health regulators and politicians to shame. Health regulators are set up to ensure that substances that reach our food shops are safe for human consumption. The average citizen does not&mdash;and should not have to&mdash;question the safety of every product on sale in a supermarket. Nor should the average citizen have to question the processes that lead to the licensing of a product. The public should be able to meet&mdash;and have trust in&mdash;the regulatory experts. However, in licensing aspartame for public consumption, UK and international health regulators did not perform the one task that they were set up for, namely to protect the public.</p>
	<p pid="a.491.1/6">Crucial questions that have been largely repressed since the early '80s hang over aspartame's safety. When journalists attempted to tackle those questions, their newspapers were threatened with intimidating letters from the industry's lawyers. I am duty-bound by the immunity afforded to me under parliamentary privilege&mdash;and as a servant of the public&mdash;to initiate a debate that has been silenced for over two decades.</p>
	<p pid="a.491.1/7">I believe that aspartame should never have been licensed for use as a low-calorie sweetener in foods and drinks, and that there is compelling and reliable evidence for this carcinogenic substance to be banned from the UK food and drinks market. I call on the Government to ban the use and sale of aspartame.</p>
	<p pid="a.491.1/8">What is in aspartame that merits a ban? The chemical breakdown of aspartame reveals three basic components: a methyl ester and two amino acids; phenylalanine and aspartic acid. The sweetener industry will say that those three components occur naturally in fruit, eggs and alcohol. Those compounds are, they argue, harmless or even beneficial to humans. However, those simple truths hide the complex science that makes every one of those components, when found in aspartame, harmful to humans. Molecules that can be good or harmless to the human body are not always so. Factors such as the compounds that the molecules form, the substances with which they are ingested and the concentrations in which they are absorbed can make the difference between an innocuous substance and a toxic substance.</p>
	<p pid="a.491.1/9">In their natural form, the first two components, phenylalanine and aspartic acid, help keep humans healthy. In foods like meat, fish, dairy products, vegetables and eggs, phenylalanine and aspartic acid are bound to other amino acids in long, complex chains of proteins. When proteins are broken down into their constituent parts during digestion, the protein's amino acids compete with each other for absorption into the human body. That dilutes the risk of a dramatic rise in one single substance in the blood stream, which is when damage is most liable to occur. However, when present in aspartame neither phenylalanine nor aspartic acid are bound to complex chains of amino acids. Enzymes in the gut can easily split them apart. When phenylalanine is released in its free form, it is metabolised into diketopiperazine or DKP, which is a suspected carcinogen.</p>
	<p pid="a.491.1/10">A similar process occurs when aspartic acid enters the bloodstream. In its free form, aspartic acid becomes an excitotoxin, a toxic molecule that stimulates nerve cells to the point of damage or death. That can have an adverse effect from the twitching of a hand to a grand mal seizure. Studies by Meldrum attest to the damaging effect of free aspartic acid in the human body. If both of the amino acids in aspartame are potentially very harmful to humans, the third component&mdash;methyl ester&mdash;is the most harmful and potentially lethal component. As soon as it is ingested, the methyl ester is metabolised by the body into methanol. Methanol is a well-known poison.</p>
	<p pid="a.491.1/11">In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency defines safe consumption of methanol as no more than 7.8 mg per day. That means that anyone drinking three cans of a drink sweetened with aspartame is consuming about 56 mg of methanol, eight times the EPA limit. Like phenylalanine and aspartic acid, methanol is naturally present in a regular diet of fruit, vegetables and even alcohol. However, as with phenylalanine and aspartic acid, those everyday occurrences of methanol do not make it safe in aspartame. In those natural occurrences, the body is shielded from methanol's adverse effects by two protective substances, pectin and ethanol.</p>
	<p pid="a.491.1/12">The human body lacks the enzyme required to cleave methanol from pectin in fruit and vegetables, so the methanol is never released into our bodies. Moreover, when consuming alcoholic drinks, which almost always contain methanol impurities, the body is protected by the preferential metabolism of ethanol. There is so much more ethanol than methanol in alcohol that the body does not have time to metabolise the methanol before it is excreted naturally through breath and urine. A human being would need to drink 58 bottles of Jack Daniels in one go to reach potentially toxic levels of methanol through alcohol.</p>
	<p pid="a.491.1/13">When we ingest aspartame, things are different. Humans do possess the enzyme required to separate methanol from the amino acids. The methanol is then released in its free form and absorbed into the body, according to Davoli's paper in 1986. During the digestion of aspartame, methanol is not coupled with the natural protection of ethanol or pectin, and that leaves us exposed to its toxic properties. However, then comes the alarming part: methanol is unstable in the human body and so gets converted into formaldehyde. Reference to that can be found in the papers of Kavet in 1990 and Trocho in 1998. Let us be clear that formaldehyde is a class A poison, which was used to prevent dead bodies from decaying.</p>
	<p pid="a.491.1/14">Do we really want our children exposed to an embalming fluid? Some of the formaldehyde accumulated in the body will be converted into formic acid, a potent toxin, which can cause central nervous system depression and, in sufficient quantity, coma and death. Many human studies show the adverse effects from chronic, low-level formaldehyde exposure. Crucially, in 1998 Trocho demonstrated that, even when consuming small doses, severe problems occur from the gradual accumulation of formaldehyde in the body, which cannot be excreted.</p>
	<p pid="a.491.1/15">Adverse effects include irreversible genetic damage from long-term, low-level exposure shown by Shaham in 1996, low birth weight shown by Maroziene's research in 2002 and cytogenic effects of blood lymphocytes, under Suruda's paper in 1993. The Suruda research that shows the degeneration of white blood cells is particularly relevant in light of the evidence from the World Health Organisation's International Agency for Research on Cancer. A working group looking into the toxicity of chemicals in humans found that exposure to formaldehyde induced leukaemia&mdash;a cancer of the white blood cells&mdash;and cancer of the nose and throat. Surely, if aspartame metabolites have been shown to cause cancer in humans, we should be more concerned about the safety of the entire product. How can the Government, faced with those facts, still hope to reassure regular consumers of diet cola and other products containing aspartame that they do not run a significantly higher risk of developing cancer as a result of drinking them?</p>
	<p pid="a.491.1/16">Before considering the studies revealing the dangers of aspartame itself, it is worth reflecting on the magnitude of the risks of the product and its metabolites. Hon. Members will no doubt remember the scandal in February this year, when Sudan 1 dye found in food in the UK led to possibly the biggest and fastest ever food recall that this country has ever known. A human being would have had to consume 3 tonnes of Worcestershire sauce every day for two years for potentially harmful effects to occur from tiny doses of Sudan 1 in foods. Despite that minimal risk, however, it was removed immediately.</p>
	<p pid="a.491.1/17">Sudan 1 was found to be carcinogenic in 1975, but despite that it was placed in the least dangerous of the three WHO categories of carcinogenic substances. Aspartame, which is found in 10 times more products is, on the basis of the ground-breaking Ramazzini study, in WHO category 2, which is potentially far more dangerous to humans.</p>
	<p pid="a.491.1/18">The Ramazzini study, to which I will return in depth later, revealed a repeated incidence of malignant tumours in rats after moderate regular consumption. Will the Minister explain why the treatment of aspartame, which is still in 6,000 supermarket products today, has been so different from that of Sudan 1?</p>
	<p pid="a.491.1/19">The toxicity of aspartame's individual components is surely sufficient for us to be alarmed about its widespread use in the products that we and our children consume every day. But consumers and scientists alike have shown there is cause for concern from the regular consumption of products containing aspartame. The US Food and Drug Administration website lists more than 9,000 aspartame-related health complaints, but this could be just the tip of the iceberg.</p>
	<p pid="a.491.1/20">Health professionals are often unable to diagnose a case of aspartame toxicity when they see one&mdash;after all, doctors are not currently trained to recognise it&mdash;and a number of cases have been misdiagnosed. A number of independent studies have shown that aspartame toxicity mimics conditions such as multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, arthritis, chronic fatigue syndrome, panic disorder, lupus, diabetes, lymphoma, depression and other psychological disorders. It is perhaps not so surprising therefore that, frustrated by repeated flawed diagnosis, some people have turned to support groups as a method of sharing case history and exchanging information, some of which even leans towards the hysterical.</p>
	<p pid="a.491.1/21">The final nail in the coffin for aspartame must surely be the monumental Ramazzini study. The research by the independent European Ramazzini Foundation in Bologna was published online in the highly acclaimed and peer-reviewed <i>Environment Health Perspectives</i> journal last month. It should have set alarm bells ringing in health departments around the world.</p>
	<p pid="a.491.1/22">The conclusions of the Ramazzini study deserve painstaking dissection. It was, without a doubt, the most large-scale, comprehensive study ever performed on aspartame. The study looked at the effects of aspartame on 1,800 male and female rats, using six different control doses. Most studies use only around 400 rats and three usage doses, so it is easy to see why the Ramazzini study is so much more statistically significant than anything done before.</p>
	<p pid="a.491.1/23">The Italian study allowed the animals to live out their full life of about three years, rather than culling them after two years as sometimes happens. That is particularly crucial, as tumours both in animals and humans are much more prevalent in later life. This vast study demonstrated that aspartame administered at varying levels in feed causes a statistically significant increase of lymphomas and leukaemias, malignant tumours of the kidneys in female rats and malignant tumours of peripheral and cranial nerves in male rats. Such tumours occurred even in two of the doses that were well below the acceptable daily intake recommended by regulatory authorities in the EU and the US.</p>
	<p pid="a.491.1/24">There has been a wealth of compelling and rigorous research showing aspartame to be harmful, which culminated in last month's comprehensive Ramazzini study. How has the industry responded to such an overwhelming volume of sound science? I met industry representatives in October and if they were not scientifically illiterate, they were certainly very misinformed as to the credentials of the Ramazzini study, which they presented as worthless, unpublished and un-peer-reviewed. Holland Sweetener, Ajinomoto and NutraSweet must think that they are very convincing when they claim that aspartame is the safest product on the market by virtue of the 500 studies attesting to its safety. One can test a product 4,000 times, but if the tests are badly conducted and planned in such a way as to yield the desired results, its safety will always be questionable. In reality, the contrast between the quality of the science in the Ramazzini study and the industry studies could not be more clear or more damaging to the industry.</p>
	<p pid="a.491.1/25">Serious doubts have been raised that suggest links between the results of scientific research and the body responsible for funding it. Professor Ralph Walton, who is present today, demonstrated in 1996 that of the 166 studies conducted on aspartame's safety deemed relevant to humans, 74 were sponsored by the aspartame industry and 92 were independently funded. Of the 92 non-industry sponsored studies, 92 per cent. identified one or more problems with aspartame's safety. The industry-sponsored studies, on the other hand, found unanimously in favour of aspartame's safety.</p>
	<p pid="a.491.1/26">The industry has also suggested that aspartame is essential for helping diabetics. Although the American Diabetes Association, which incidentally receives considerable funding from the aspartame industry, claims that aspartame is useful in managing diabetes, there is plenty of evidence to the contrary. Diabetic management is much more complex than simply avoiding sugar. Total calorific intake is far more significant than whether or not a diabetic patient takes a small amount of sugar. Aspartame is known to interfere with the synthesis of serotonin, a neurotransmitter important in appetite regulation. Emerging evidence suggests that aspartame can lead to carbohydrate craving, a devastating situation for a diabetic. The stimulation of insulin release by a non-nutritive substance such as aspartame could potentially lead to hypoglycaemia. Animal studies by Sardesai and Dunbar conclude that aspartame may adversely affect the capacity to control glucose in a diabetic. Diabetic specialists, such as Roberts and Barua, have published extensively on problems of diabetic management caused by aspartame. So, even on diabetes, the industry's arguments have been shown to be highly contestable, at the very least.</p>
	<p pid="a.491.1/27">On the question of who to trust on the competing scientific tests&mdash;be they on diabetes or aspartame safety&mdash;the track record of the industry should leave us in no doubt. The history of aspartame's approval is one in which sound science and proper regulatory and political independence seem to be notable by their absence. Aspartame was first licensed in the United States in 1981. Searle, the chemical company that discovered it, submitted a host of tests to the FDA in the hope of getting it approved. It was granted a provisional licence in 1974. However, when flaws were revealed in the science behind another Searle product&mdash;Flagyl&mdash;later that year, aspartame's impending licence was brought into question.</p>
	<p pid="a.491.1/28">The FDA set up a taskforce to investigate 15 of the key aspartame studies submitted by Searle. Dr. Bressler was commissioned to investigate three of those studies. Due to insufficient funds, the FDA submitted the other 12 studies to be analysed by a body called universities associated for research and evaluation in pathology, which was under contract with Searle and which unsurprisingly declared all 12 studies to be authentic. Aspartame was recommended for approval.</p>
	<p pid="a.491.1/29">Meanwhile, Dr. Bressler reported to the FDA in early 1976. He found no less than 52 major discrepancies in Searle's clinical conduct of its toxicological studies. They included no clear record being kept of the doses fed to rats; antibiotics being given to animals showing symptoms but not being reported; tumours contracted by rats during the experiment being surgically removed before dissection and not reported; and, above all, no clear record of death. One record shows an animal was alive, then dead, then alive, then dead. Yet despite the 52 major discrepancies, FDA scientists were overruled by the FDA's administration, which seems to have been more concerned with safeguarding the institution's reputation after having been initially misled by unreliable data.</p>

	<p pid="a.496.3/1">Thank you, Mr. Olner.</p>
	<p pid="a.496.3/2">Although no formal good laboratory practice protocols existed in the early '70s, it is quite clear that Searle's scientists breached even the most basic understanding of sound laboratory science. However, the real tragedy is that it was on those 15 deeply flawed studies that the final decision to approve aspartame in the US was made, and many other countries soon followed suit. Today, those same highly questionable studies still underpin the science attesting to aspartame's safety.</p>
	<p pid="a.496.3/3">Aspartame's approval incorporates not just bad science but bad politics. On the political scene, Donald Rumsfeld was instrumental in securing its approval. As chief executive officer of Searle from 1977, he publicly pledged to call in his markers to get it approved. Despite a public board of inquiry reopening the case in 1979 and ruling unanimously against its approval, Rumsfeld appears to have honoured his pledge.</p>
	<p pid="a.496.3/4">When Ronald Reagan was inaugurated as President in 1981, Donald Rumsfeld was on his transition team. President Reagan sealed the lid on the aspartame controversy. On the very day of his inauguration, Reagan personally wrote the executive order suspending the FDA commissioner's powers on aspartame. Reagan replaced the commissioner one month later with Arthur Hayes Jr., who granted the official licence for aspartame. The history of its approval is littered with examples showing that if key decision-makers found against its safety, they were discredited, ignored or replaced by industry sympathisers, who were in turn recompensed with lucrative jobs.</p>

	<p pid="a.497.1/1">Thank you, Mr. Olner.</p>
	<p pid="a.497.1/2">I have raised some of the most important questions about aspartame's safety ever discussed in this place. There is solid evidence to suggest that its regular long-term use can cause cancer and a range of other health problems. Emergency action is now needed to remove the toxin from our own and our children's diets. Aspartame has caused concern among the public and the scientific community for more than 30 years. Better information or better product labelling simply is not enough at this point. Today, I am giving the Government a chance to set right what previous British, European and international health authorities have so dismally failed to do. A total ban is the only way to protect the British public.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-12-14a.497.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1543" speakername="Caroline Flint" speakeroffice="The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Health"  colnum="497"  time="016:46:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051214/halltext/51214h05.htm#51214h05_spmin0">
	<p pid="a.497.2/1">I welcome <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1444" name="Roger Williams">the debate secured by the hon. Member for Brecon and Radnorshire (Mr. Williams)</phrase>. He obviously feels passionately about this issue. He cited a number of scientists and experts who have a particular view about aspartame. I will go through the procedures that we have in the European Union, which are outside whatever the United States does, for confirming and granting the status and use of additives in our foods, and I will discuss safety in the food chain in relation to the issue. This is not a status quo issue; as any new evidence comes forward, it is important that all these issues are examined afresh. I link to that the latest study to which the hon. Gentleman refers.</p>
	<p pid="a.497.2/2">I will give an overview. We take the safe use of artificial sweeteners and all additives in food seriously. We are all aware that food additives may be added to food, usually at very low concentrations, for a variety of reasons. Those include restoring colours lost during processing, providing sweetness in low sugar products and preventing deterioration during storage. As the Minister with responsibility for public health, I am always advocating that people have a healthy diet, which I hope would include more of the fresh foodstuffs that are available in our stores. That is why we support the five-a-day programme.</p>
	<p pid="a.497.2/3">The use of artificial sweeteners can be beneficial, particularly for those who seek a low calorie alternative to a certain food. That is especially true given our current debate on how we tackle the increasing problem of obesity in this country. Despite that, the important issue is consumer safety, regardless of whether the additive comes from a natural source or is man made. The question of safety is central to the decision as to whether or not an additive should be permitted in our food.</p>
	<p pid="a.497.2/4">The use of food additives is strictly controlled by laws that are negotiated at European level, which list those additives that are approved for food use, the types of food in which the additives may be used and the maximum amounts that may be used. Before an additive is approved it must go through an extensive safety evaluation undertaken by independent experts. In the EU, that is now carried out by the independent scientific committees that advise the European Food Safety Authority. The manufacturer of the additive must submit a detailed dossier of research into the safety of that substance in order for it to be evaluated. That research must include toxicological tests to determine whether the substance is harmful. Such tests are designed to give information on any possible effects of exposure to the additive, including whether it may have any potential to cause cancer.</p>
	<p pid="a.497.2/5">As far as I am advised, aspartame is not known to cause cancer in humans and the evidence does not indicate the potential for it to do so. Most studies in animals showed that it did not cause cancer. It is important for experts to examine the data to see why the Ramazzini study is different. I will come to that matter later and go into more detail.</p>
	<p pid="a.497.2/6">I shall say something about the difference between aspartame and Sudan 1. Sudan 1 is an industrial dye that has never been approved for use in food and its presence in food is therefore illegal. When it became clear that the substance was being used in foodstuffs&mdash;Worcester sauce is one example&mdash;we had to act quickly to take those substances off the market. The data from the scientific literature suggests that Sudan 1 is genotoxic in that it damages DNA, but there is no suggestion that aspartame is genotoxic. I make that clear because Sudan 1 should never have been in food products.</p>
	<p pid="a.497.2/7">The applicant has to justify the technological need for the additive; the process of evaluation can often take years before safety can be assured and even after approval it will be subject to continued monitoring. I am sure the Committee agrees that that is absolutely right.</p>
	<p pid="a.497.2/8">We need to ensure that consumers can make choices about the foods they eat and European Community labelling regulations require the additive to appear clearly in the ingredient list on food labels. It must be identified by one of a number of category names specified in the regulations, such as sweetener or colour, followed either by the specific name of the additive or by its E number.</p>
	<p pid="a.497.2/9">Aspartame has been used in soft drinks and other low-calorie or sugar-free foods throughout the world for more than 25 years. Questions have been asked about the safety of the product and I shall outline the conclusions that have been drawn from the large body of research investigating its safety.</p>
	<p pid="a.497.2/10">In 2001, the Food Standards Agency pressed the European Commission to revisit its previous safety assessment of aspartame published in 1988. As a result of that request, the European Commission's independent Scientific Committee on Food reviewed more than 500 research papers published in the scientific literature between 1988 and 2001 on the safety of the product. The papers included studies that considered the toxicity of the substance, and the research was conducted by independent researchers. The SCF also took into account the outcome of a review published in 2002 of the safety of aspartame, which was carried out by the French Agency for Food, Health and Safety. The review by that agency concluded that there was no evidence of a link between the consumption of aspartame and the development of brain tumours. Following that extensive exercise in December 2002, the SCF concluded that there was no evidence to suggest the need to revise the conclusion previously drawn by the committee that aspartame was safe for use in food.</p>
	<p pid="a.497.2/11">More recently, in July this year, Worcester at the Ramazzini Foundation in Italy published the findings of new research on the safety of aspartame, suggesting that rats may develop tumours when given doses of aspartame equivalent to the acceptable daily intake amount for humans. However, I understand from the study that the full data has yet to be published and the UK's independent committee on the carcinogenicity of chemicals in foods has reviewed initial data from the study published in July. At this stage they are not convinced by the Worcester interpretation of the data.</p>
	<p pid="a.497.2/12">However, the Committee agreed that the full data set should be reviewed, and that will be carried out by the European Food Safety Authority. Of course, the findings from the study will need to be considered in the light of the extensive body of existing data on the safety of aspartame. I hope that reassures the hon. Gentleman that we are also open to any new evidence that comes to light but it is important that the full evidence is explored and examined.</p>
	<p pid="a.497.2/13">The researchers from the Italian institute have been asked to make available all the data from the study in order for the assessment to be carried out. When we have advice from the European Food Safety Authority, the Food Standards Agency and its independent scientific advisory committees will study EFSA's opinion carefully and consider whether it needs to revise its advice on consuming aspartame. The current advice from the Food Standards Agency remains in place, namely that aspartame is safe for use in food.</p>
	<p pid="a.497.2/14">The hon. Gentleman mentioned methanol and formaldehyde. Those substances are naturally present in the body and, as far as I understand, studies have shown that they are not increased by aspartame. Those substances are toxic at high doses, but not at the levels released from aspartame.</p>
	<p pid="a.497.2/15">I understand that the hon. Gentleman has asked the Food Standards Agency for information to assist him in his investigations. I hope that he agrees that the FSA and its officials have tried to respond in good faith and in a transparent way with the information that he has asked for. That includes information on how scientists and others developed the acceptable daily intake, or ADI, for aspartame.</p>
	<p pid="a.497.2/16">As I understand it, the intakes are defined for both adults and children, and are set at a very conservative, low level to cover the maximum levels that people might consume. As part of that work, issues were explored, particularly to do with children, the sort of food and drink products that they might use, and the maximum amount of foods containing aspartame that they might consume in a day. That was cross-referenced with the levels of aspartame that children might acquire if they really went all out to consume as many products containing aspartame as possible. When that was done, the study showed that that was still below the accepted daily maximum level.</p>
	<p pid="a.497.2/17">I recognise the concerns raised in this debate, and I hope that I have assured the hon. Gentleman that we take the issue seriously. Our procedure in the European Union is to continue to keep an open mind about any new evidence that comes forward. However, we should not lose sight of the fact that additives are approved only if they are of benefit to consumers and are shown to be safe at the levels used in foods.</p>
	<p pid="a.497.2/18" class="italic">Question put and agreed to.</p>
	<p pid="a.497.2/19" class="indent">Adjourned accordingly at three minutes to Five o'clock.</p>
