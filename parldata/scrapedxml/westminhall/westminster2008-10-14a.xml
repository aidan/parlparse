<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-10-14a.187.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1965" speakername="Michael Moore" colnum="187"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm081014/halltext/81014h0001.htm#08101444000469">
	<p pid="a.187.2/1">It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Mrs. Humble. I hope that we do not cause you too much stress and discomfort over the next hour and a half. I am very grateful to have the opportunity to introduce this debate on digital switchover and particularly grateful to Mr. Speaker for allowing me to do so. I also welcome the Minister to her new role within the Department for Culture, Media and Sport. I appreciate that broadcasting is the responsibility of her soon-to-be noble Friend Lord Carter, but we all look forward to hearing her comments and answers at the end of the debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.187.2/2">I sought this debate because switchover is very important to my constituency, where, in three weeks, we will see the first stage of switchover when analogue BBC 2 is switched off and moved across to the digital platform exclusively. That will be followed a fortnight later, on <phrase class="date" code="2008-11-20">20 November</phrase>, by all the remaining stations. Over the past three years, since the timetable was published, we in the borders have been getting ready for this, particularly in the Selkirk transmitter area, which serves my constituency. Over that time I have chaired eight different meetings of the borders digital forum, which has brought together community activists and representatives, voluntary groups, broadcasting professionals and many others with an interest, direct or indirect, to ensure that we are on top of the issues and communicating our concerns to those with responsibility for ensuring that switchover is a success. In a couple of weeks I also look forward to welcoming the Secretary of State to the borders, when he comes to see for himself the preparations that are nearly complete.</p>
	<p pid="a.187.2/3">Just over 70 years ago, the first flickering television pictures came on air courtesy of the BBC. We have since come a very long way from that technological marvel&mdash;whether it was moving from black and white to colour televisions, seeing the proliferation of new channels, or learning the different ways in which we can now record programmes or pause them and continue watching afterwards. It is unrecognisable from the service that started all those years ago. Switchover will be another giant step forward and a very welcome development. It will bring together a great many technological advances, provide much more choice&mdash;I shall return to that theme&mdash;and be compulsory, which makes it different from many previous developments. It is compulsory because of the intention to free up the analogue spectrum to allow it to be used for other purposes&mdash;another theme to which I shall return.</p>
	<p pid="a.187.2/4">Switchover is an exciting prospect for everybody across the country, but as we face up to the imminent change in the south of Scotland, significant issues remain to be addressed. We are not the first part of the United Kingdom to transfer: constituents of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1511" name="Jamie Reed">the hon. Member for Copeland (Mr. Reed)</phrase> in Whitehaven were the first to do so, last November. However, the digital switchover taking place in the Selkirk transmitter area in a few weeks represents a significant step change, covering a very large rural area involving more than 100,000 people and a number of transmitters. Whitehaven has just one transmitter, which was converted in a matter of minutes, but we have one main transmitter and 11 relay transmitters, so it will take the best part of a day on each occasion to manage the switchover. That represents a change in scale, and it matters that we get it right.</p>
	<p pid="a.187.2/5">None of my constituents have complained about the fact that we are right at the front of the queue. Occasionally they have asked why they in particular have been chosen, but we recognise that before certain geographical issues associated with the sorting out of frequencies across Europe are addressed, it is easiest to deal with the borders, because that will interfere least with neighbouring countries. Equally, it is fair to say that most people recognise that there are fewer people in the borders than in many other places, so it is perhaps easier to do a little testing and experimentation. That has led to the guiding philosophy of the digital forums and other local activities: we are happy to be first, but we want to be the pioneers who get it right, not the guinea pigs from whose poor experiences other people learn.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-10-14a.192.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1965" speakername="Michael Moore" colnum="192"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm081014/halltext/81014h0001.htm#08101444000477">
	<p pid="a.192.1/1">I might not share the hon. Gentleman's confidence about that fourth Labour term, but I share his concerns about the impact that the new form of transmission will have on smaller communities such as mine. He has given the <i>Hansard</i> reporters a nice little challenge with the different communities he mentioned.</p>
	<p pid="a.192.1/2">Although the technology exists to get around all those problems, my worry is that the Government have thus far let the broadcasting industry off the hook. We have a two-tier service. I was rebuked by Digital UK when I started referring to a two-tier service some years ago&mdash;I was told that it prefers the term &quot;Freeview Lite&quot;. I said that I was happy to call it &quot;Freeview Lite&quot; too, but they are now irritated by that and claim that such a name suggests that it is not the full service. However, it is not. There has never been a good reason for that, other than the fact that the commercial broadcasters have been let off the hook and are not obliged to put their multiplexes in all of the relay transmitters. I have not yet been given a costing for doing that, so perhaps the Minister could share with us today how much it would cost the broadcasters to put their bits of kit in all of the relay transmitters. What sum are we talking about? With that information, we could start to debate the public policy questions about who should fund it. For now, it looks like we will end up in a position where only part of Britain will get everything and large parts in rural areas will receive a much reduced service.</p>
	<p pid="a.192.1/3">Currently, the case could be made that some of those extra services are not exactly wonderful television, but top-up television&mdash;Setanta Sports, which has been controversial for other reasons recently&mdash;and many of the other channels that are held at the moment for ITV or Channel 4 for their more peripheral services, although I am sure that they will not like me using that term, are in that extra segment of transmission. I simply do not understand why people in rural Britain should be excluded and why that should have been allowed to happen.</p>
	<p pid="a.192.1/4">I recently attended an event in Scotland at which the Ofcom advisory committee and various Ofcom officials were present. Without talking out of turn, it was clear to me that the attitude within Ofcom was that people in rural Britain accepted that they will receive some sort of second-class service. It is not only broadcasting, but lots of other things that are important. I was absolutely appalled by that attitude and hope that the Minister will distance herself from it. I hope that, regardless of our political positions and parties, her Government remain a Government for the whole UK and not only urban Britain. This will be an important test of that.</p>
	<p pid="a.192.1/5">Choice is one of the key themes of the digital switchover, as I have already mentioned, but choice also has to be about diversity. We have been told how much more we will have to enjoy, but at the same time ITV is predicting meltdown and suggesting that the public service broadcasting licence requirements are perhaps too onerous and that it might just give up the licences in due course. I have not seen ITV offering to give up position three on any of the different channel guides or anything that goes with that, so perhaps there is an element of bluff to be called in that regard.</p>
	<p pid="a.192.1/6">However, we can see ITV's intent, and without diminishing or underplaying the serious economic challenges facing it, we have seen in the past few weeks the latest announcement about what it plans for regional news and programming. In the Border Television region, those plans amount to broadcasting vandalism, and what Jim Graham and Paddy Merrall put in place over decades on behalf of Border Television is to be swept aside. Michael Grade met with MPs from across the Border Television region a year ago and has agreed to come back to discuss the detailed proposals with us, so I hope that there is still a chance that those in charge at ITV will change their minds.</p>
	<p pid="a.192.1/7">Border Television has had a really important role in the past and I am concerned that it is about to lose its relevance to people in my constituency. Such was its commitment to ensuring that parts of my constituency and parts of the constituency of the hon. Member for Dumfries and Galloway were on the television, that cameramen would report stories in far-flung parts of the borders, relative to Carlisle, and rush across to put the tapes on the X95 bus to Galashiels, waiting and hoping that someone would be there to pick it up at the other end and put it on. It was a bit of a threadbare system, but it worked, and it meant that the communities that I represent were regularly featured on television and that local news was relevant to them. Since that cameraman retired, coverage of my constituency and those neighbouring it has declined. There are no two ways about it. There has been no replacement reporter.</p>
	<p pid="a.192.1/8">Under the new plans, we have been promised that there will be a dedicated opt-out for the south of Scotland in the bigger mish-mash of the Border and Tyne Tees arrangements, which will cover from St. Abbs to Stranraer and to Sunderland. What sort of region is that, and what relevance will news from Sunderland have for many of my constituents?</p>

	<p pid="a.202.1/1">I am grateful for that clarification, but it makes the point even more effectively. A number of bodies is involved, and there may be some confusion and overlap. We want clarity, not least to ensure the effective use of public money.</p>
	<p pid="a.202.1/2">The issue that is emerging from digital switchover is not significant concern that it will not run smoothly, that technical issues will not be addressed or that people will be unaware. We know that some 26 million analogue televisions remain out there, that about 10 per cent. of the population is unaware of switchover, and that some people feel unprepared for it. There are concerns that perhaps with hindsight the switchover scheme has been drawn too narrowly and that, given the surplus, people who fall outside the narrow remit of the scheme should be able to access some help.</p>

	<p pid="a.205.1/2">As heralded by the hon. Members for Bath and for Wantage, the Secretary of State has today put out a written ministerial statement formally announcing that the help scheme will be extended to include everyone normally resident in care homes. Letters seeking information on residents have been sent to all care homes in the Selkirk transmission area, so that those people know that the help scheme can offer them assistance. As the hon. Member for Bath said, someone is normally be considered to be a resident if they have been in a care home for six months or more, or if the care home manager expects them to have been resident for more than six months by the end of the eligibility period.</p>

	<p pid="a.212.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1456" name="Doug Naysmith">the hon. Member for Bristol, North-West (Dr. Naysmith)</phrase>, my constituency neighbour, on securing this important debate and on the thoughtful, measured and well informed way in which he opened it. I agree with the thrust of what he said, and I am grateful for the opportunity to participate. I have recently been made aware of the work of the Rarer Cancers Forum by meeting a constituent who is affected by some of the problems that the hon. Gentleman spoke about. Briefly, I should like to describe my constituent's experiences and draw some conclusions about how the system is working or, more to the point, not working.</p>
	<p pid="a.212.0/2">My constituent, Robert Derrick, is in his mid-60s; he is a father and grandfather who lives in Charfield in my constituency with his wife, and who runs a small business. He could be any of us. Last year, he saw a surgeon in Gloucester because it was clear that something was not quite right. The surgeon suspected bone cancer, but in June 2007, he was diagnosed with kidney cancer and had a kidney removed. In October 2007, he had a knee and part of a femur removed. He went through the wars but, interestingly, made a good recovery. He still runs his business, which I believe involves transfers for vintage motorbikes, and he is keen to go on doing so. We have a correspondence, and I met him and his wife on Friday. He has had kidney cancer, but one would not necessarily recognise that he was ill.</p>
	<p pid="a.212.0/3">In June 2008, he was admitted to Gloucester hospital bleeding from the lungs, and was diagnosed with inoperable metastases on both lungs, at which point the system started to go wrong. The family spoke to the consultant, who told them that they can have two drugs, one on the NHS and one not. The drug that is available on the NHS is called Interferon. In Mr. Derrick's circumstances, it offers a poor quality of life and works for only one in six people; it might, with luck, give him another six months. The consultant said that Sutent, the other drug, should work well. The family wrote to me to tell me that their impression was that the consultant had told them that Mr. Derrick could expect to lead a normal life on Sutent, so there is a huge contrast between the drugs.</p>
	<p pid="a.212.0/4">Sutent and associated treatments cost &pound;4,000 a month&mdash;no-one pretends that that is not a lot of money&mdash;and the family were told that the NHS would not pay for it. The consultant said, &quot;Every time I get a patient who would be appropriately treated with Sutent, I fax a request to Gloucestershire PCT, but it has told me to stop doing that because it has an exceptional funding process.&quot; If the consultant referred everybody who he thought would benefit from the treatment, by definition, they would not be exceptional, so the PCT told him to stop making requests. He replied, &quot;All my patients are exceptional, so why should I look at 10 people who come through my door and privately make a decision to pick this person or that because they are somehow more exceptional than the other nine? That is not why I came into medicine.&quot; When Mr. Derrick and his wife went to see him he said, &quot;There's no point me even applying for this drug, because the PCT will just say no.&quot; Understandably, the family were unhappy.</p>
	<p pid="a.212.0/5">When approached, Gloucestershire PCT said, &quot;You haven't asked for or applied for the drug, in this case, for this patient, so we haven't yet refused.&quot; Having been told to apply, we did so. The family wrote in, the consultant said why Mr. Derrick would benefit and I wrote letters of support. The PCT had a meeting and decided not to fund the treatment, which is probably not surprising. However, the meeting was held behind closed doors, and had I not told the family what date the decision would be made, they would not have known. They were not allowed to send anyone along, did not know who was making the decision, and there is no accountability for what happens behind those closed doors. Making what is literally a life-or-death decision behind closed doors, unaccountably, is a problem.</p>
	<p pid="a.212.0/6">When the decision was made and the family came to see me on Friday, they said that they had not yet had an explanation from the PCT. I phoned the PCT on Thursday night, and was kindly sent a copy of the letter that explained things, which they were about to post. In the letter, the chief executive of Gloucestershire PCT wrote:</p>
	<p pid="a.212.0/7" class="indent">&quot;Whilst sympathetic to the patient's condition&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.212.0/8">Mr. Derrick smiled at that pathetically weak phrase and said that it was the first time that he had had any sympathy from the PCT. We know that funding cannot be provided for everything and everyone, but we should all be treated with humanity and sympathy. The letter continues:</p>
	<p pid="a.212.0/9" class="indent">&quot;the symptoms described are, unfortunately, not uncommon in patients requesting this treatment and are therefore not considered exceptional in that they will be experienced by other patients in the county. We therefore regret that we feel unable to grant funding&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.212.0/10">In other words, Mr. Derrick was not different enough to warrant funding.</p>
	<p pid="a.212.0/11">NICE preliminary guidance concludes that Sutent is not cost-effective. However, there was uncertainty whether NICE had taken account of the fact that Pfizer provides the first course&mdash;four weeks of tablets and two weeks off&mdash;free of charge. NICE did not factor that into the costing of the drug, because the Department said that it was not sure that it was national, robust or rigorous. However, I believe that Pfizer confirmed that the first month is free to the NHS, so NICE could take account of it when it revises its guidance. Will the Minister assure us that it will? The first month being free to the NHS should be taken into account in the costing. Pfizer has also provided further clinical data. I hope that NICE has a more favourable cost assessment when it revises its judgment and that it recommends the treatment. I asked NICE whether it can speed up the process, because until the guidance is revised, PCTs throughout the country will use the preliminary guidance and probably say no in most cases. I also contacted Pfizer to see whether my constituent can go on a clinical trial or something.</p>
	<p pid="a.212.0/12">Mr. Derrick told me that it is not the illness that gets him down, but the battling&mdash;the constant lobbying and letter writing, uncertainty and waiting. It would be unfair to say that the people making the decisions are faceless, but they are in the sense that they sit behind closed doors. The problem is that people do not know who is deciding their fate.</p>
	<p pid="a.212.0/13">Not only is the drug available in most other European countries but it is also more expensive. This is not a case in which a drugs company is making vast profits by charging huge amounts in this country. The drug is cheaper here than elsewhere. Most other European countries pay for it, and some PCTs have approved its being prescribed, but not my constituent's. That is the root of the problem.</p>
	<p pid="a.212.0/14">Let me share with the House a few words from Mr. Derrick's daughter. She wrote to me and has given me permission to quote from her letter. As an Opposition MP, I do not have the right to place something in the Library, but I would love to place this letter there because it is so powerful. Her letter is headed:</p>
	<p pid="a.212.0/15" class="indent">&quot;Robert Derrick, Not Cost Effective.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.212.0/16">It includes a photograph of him with his grandchild. His daughter says that</p>
	<p pid="a.212.0/17" class="indent">&quot;it all depends on where you live. If you live in one place in Britain it definitely is OK to let you go. If you live in another it certainly is not, and in some, you just need an assertive family and a really good lawyer, and if you don't have them, then oops yes, it's OK to let you go too.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.212.0/18">She goes on to say:</p>
	<p pid="a.212.0/19" class="indent">&quot;The differences don't stop there. If you can prove you are exceptional, then you might be in with a chance of staying alive. But surely we are all exceptional. It's a funny thing. You have to show you are different to everyone else who is the same as you, i.e have this horrible disease. So you can't win.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.212.0/20">She talks about the difficulty of battling the disease, and says that a patient cannot enjoy what is left of their life.</p>
	<p pid="a.212.0/21" class="indent">&quot;No, you have to find the energy and the will to fight, do research, hassle doctors, MPs, journalists and anyone else who will listen to you to try and get them to understand that you do count, that it really is immoral and barbaric to let you die like this.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.212.0/22">She says that the drugs are costly, but that does not amount to much in the great scheme of things.</p>
	<p pid="a.212.0/23" class="indent">&quot;Is it really too much for Dad to expect the best available treatment, one that his neighbours are getting?&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.212.0/24">I know that it is easy for me to say that Mr. Derrick should just get his drug. The Minister has a fixed budget and has to allocate it. My argument is that if the public's priorities were really getting through in the NHS, they would want Mr. Derrick to have his drugs at the expense of other things the NHS spends its money on. If the public was actively involved&mdash;even locally in Gloucestershire&mdash;and were asked to list their priorities, I believe that this case would be one. This case is not about localism. I believe in localism and that the health service should respond to local needs. However, this is not about that. Mr. Derrick's needs are not different because he lives in Gloucestershire; he would have the same needs wherever he lived. Localism is not relevant in the provision of a treatment because, morally, it should not matter where a person lives. What should we do? I believe that the system is cruel and inhumane because it has the random element of where a person happens to live. The system is not working and it is not what the public wants.</p>
	<p pid="a.212.0/25">The hon. Member for Bristol, North-West raised the crucial issue of the cost threshold NICE uses to evaluate drugs. It is about &pound;30,000 for a quality-adjusted life year. I know it is not quite as simple as that, but that is the figure that appears in the Sutent judgment. As the hon. Gentleman said, that figure has not kept pace with the costs of the NHS and its medicines since NICE was introduced. If that one change was made&mdash;if NICE was asked to adjust that threshold to reflect what has happened since it was created&mdash;and the Sutent appraisal was redone in the light of the fact that the first treatment is free and of the latest clinical evidence, that could just make the difference. It would not make a difference for some drugs, but it would for this one.</p>
	<p pid="a.212.0/26">I understand that the Minister cannot say, &quot;Yes, of course, this gentlemen can have this drug.&quot; However, this is not a choice between two drugs, one of which is quite good, and one of which is very good, one of which is fairly expensive and one of which is very expensive. It is a choice between treatment that will prolong Mr. Derrick's life, perhaps for a good long period, and his death. It is not that there is a treatment that works and a treatment that does not. There is only one effective treatment, and the NHS does not pay for it. That is wrong. The NHS does not pay for the treatment because of where Mr. Derrick lives. If he lived somewhere else, it would pay for it. I ask the Minister to look again at the threshold that NICE is using and objectively assess whether it should be increased because of NHS inflation and drug price inflation, and to let us know how quickly it can be done, to benefit not just my constituent but many others.</p>

	<p pid="a.216.0/1">It is a pleasure to see you in the Chair, Mrs. Humble. I should like to congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1456" name="Doug Naysmith">the Member for Bristol, North-West (Dr. Naysmith)</phrase> on setting us down the track on this important issue and covering lots of ground, which will save us getting into it, because we absolutely agree with him. He has the facts at his fingertips. I can sense a whiff of socialism in the air around this place. It is apparent, if one is in the right wind direction. I am aware, though, that there are hon. Members here who do not like that. On Radio 4 this morning, I heard a Republican denying that what was happening in America had any semblance of socialism. He said that recent events were a little episode that will suddenly disappear and then we will get back to good old strong capitalism again.</p>
	<p pid="a.216.0/2">We are seeing that in the health service too. Last night, I was with the Minister at a party on the 29th floor of a building not far from Millbank. Many people were talking about the information that patients were getting now, not just through websites and internets but from individuals. They said that the balance of power was swinging in the health service. Jonathan Miller described it as a revolution. He said we were moving towards a situation in which doctors, GPs and consultants would have to find time to listen to the patient. Sometimes the patient knows what is happening, can understand it and should be put in a position in which they can say clearly, &quot;This is having a good effect.&quot; They understand that doctors should not be as omnipotent as the system often makes them. That is important. Some of what we are talking about today is part and parcel of that process.</p>
	<p pid="a.216.0/3">The hon. Member for Bristol, North-West has delimited many of the things that are happening. I have reason to congratulate the Government. A consultant at Guys called me to say that the Government had used a special system, on which the Minister will elaborate, for paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria. A special commissioning group had decided to extend the system to a group of patients in this country, and various strategic health authorities had come out and said that Eculizumab must be available on the NHS. What a way forward. At last, amazingly, something is happening that will make a difference to people's lives. I am not talking about millions or even thousands of people, but individuals and groups of people, who, politically, punch well beyond their weight in numbers. They are not 3,000 beekeepers coming down to make a noise about bees. Those patients might be numbered in fives and tens, but they have a huge influence on the process.</p>
	<p pid="a.216.0/4">It is not just MPs and Ministers who play a part, but people across the country. That gives confidence to other groups to take similar action. Therefore, people who punch beyond their weight can have an effect. We must ensure that when we implement this system, there are no delays and no postcode lotteries, whereby one place gets the drug and another does not. Those days are past. That nonsense is surely over. After all, NICE was inaugurated to prevent such behaviour. Ever since, there have been problems relating to finance, the way in which people make their judgments, and who is on the committees that make such judgments. One of the issues that my hon. Friend the Member for Bristol, North-West touched on was that the people on the committees are often hidden away and we cannot find out who they are. Some committees are made up of administrators, some have a few clinicians, and others have a large number of clinicians. It is no surprise that there are huge differences across the country and they must be eliminated.</p>
	<p pid="a.216.0/5">I want to carry on the Sutent argument. For my sins, I have to chair the rarer cancers forum, whose meetings take place in here, in dining rooms and so on, and who are an amazing organisation of people. They are enthusiastic, determined and knowledgeable. They have recently published a well researched, well documented report called &quot;Taking Exception&quot;, which is a must-read for the Health Committee. The way forward is for groups of people to come up with things that are not contained by the rules of this House. Such people come together from different parts of the country and produce new and exciting ideas. We tend to get trammelled by the pathways that operate in this place.</p>
	<p pid="a.216.0/6">This morning I phoned a friend of mine who has just been given Sutent by NHS Norfolk. His name is David Blackett, and I met him at a football competition at Tasburgh; he was not a bad player in his time. He has kidney cancer. He wanted the drug, and he has been paying for it. He has funded it himself, and it is costing an arm and a leg: the house, the insurance and other things have had to pay for it. On top of that, there is the top-up issue&mdash;the Government are holding an inquiry into it&mdash;which means that people who self-fund are not allowed to use other NHS facilities. It creates a huge political dilemma about a two-tier service that must be eliminated quickly.</p>
	<p pid="a.216.0/7">The issue arises only because decisions are made not to give people the prescription drug Sutent. Why was it given in David's case? It was partly because of the inquiry being held into the need for top-up fees, but also because his doctor stood up in front of the committee with two pictures, one taken before Sutent and one after, and said, &quot;Just look at that cancer. There it is then, and here it is now.&quot; There was a huge difference.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-10-14a.219.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1949" speakername="Richard Taylor" colnum="219"  time="011:37:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm081014/halltext/81014h0005.htm#08101444000518">
	<p pid="a.219.0/1">It is very nice to be under your chairmanship, Mrs. Humble, and it is good to see in the hot seats two hon. Members with considerable experience of the NHS from their careers as nurses. I am pleased to see them. I welcome this debate and the introduction given by my friend from the Health Committee, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1456" name="Doug Naysmith">the hon. Member for Bristol, North-West (Dr. Naysmith)</phrase>. It is crucial at this time.</p>
	<p pid="a.219.0/2">So many different definitions of rare diseases are used, but I think that the easiest is that a rare disease is one that a busy GP would not see more than once a year. A lot of work has been done in Europe by the rare disease task force, which has chosen the most ironic day to be rare disease day in Europe: <phrase class="date" code="2008-02-29">29 February</phrase>. As to the availability of treatment, I commend the Government for following up the Carter review and creating the regional specialised commissioning groups and national specialised commissioning groups, which will make a huge difference. A word about the national commissioning group: its website gives a list of the illnesses and groups of illnesses covered, but there are just 38. I do not think that that can be complete.</p>
	<p pid="a.219.0/3">We have heard about paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria, and I commend the Government for allowing treatment for that condition. I looked in my Merck Manual, the bible for those who, like me, are out of touch with medicine. My 2006 edition dismissed treatment for PNH as being only supportive. However, I received a letter from a constituent of mine with that very rare disease. He is 45-years-old with a wife and three children under 16. In 2000 he lost his job when the disease was diagnosed and for a long time was out of work and receiving disability living allowance and incapacity benefits. He also had to have blood transfusions every three months, despite which he was extremely ill. He heard of a team in Leeds working with Alexion&mdash;a drugs company in the United States&mdash;and went up there fortnightly. For four years he has been taking Eculizumab and has not required a single blood transfusion. Furthermore, the treatment has been free, because it is part of a phase 3 clinical trial. He is now off the disabled register and back in part-time work. He would have been devastated if he could not have had the treatment, which is to be introduced on <phrase class="date" code="2008-04-01">1 April</phrase>. Will arrangements be made for those such as my constituent to receive the supply that they need up until that time?</p>
	<p pid="a.219.0/4">That brings me on to NICE and other points raised by other hon. Members. Eculizumab seems to have bypassed NICE. It is absolutely right that it has been approved, and I suppose that it could not be examined by NICE because the condition is so rare that there is not enough evidence and are no comparative trials. That makes it very difficult. However, that means that, if things that are examined by NICE are turned down, they have a desperately unfair status. We have heard already from the hon. Members for Northavon (Steve Webb) and for Norwich, North (Dr. Gibson) about Sunitinib. I have seen three patients whom I thought were exceptional cases&mdash;the first two, in Worcestershire, were described as &quot;not exceptional&quot; just like in Gloucestershire, and it was suggested that there was no point in referring any more similar cases because they would not be exceptional either. Then I saw a patient whom I thought was definitely exceptional: a 36-year-old lady with young children to whom even an extra few months of life would make all the difference, but again she was not counted as an exceptional case.</p>
	<p pid="a.219.0/5">Rare cancers are covered by specialist commissioning groups and will probably get funded, so why could they not take on people with common cancers who appear to have rare social conditions and the need for a rare drug. In those cases, some fairness could be introduced into the system, because Sunitinib, as we have heard, is funded in several parts of the country, but not in others. I would very much like there to be other ways of treating such non-exceptional cases of relatively common cancers, but where the patient is in truly exceptional circumstances.</p>
	<p pid="a.219.0/6">Not very much has been said about research into rare diseases, which of course is desperately important. I shall always remember a John West cartoon of a very worried lady talking to her husband in a hospital bed saying: &quot;The doctor says it's so rare that they cannot be bothered to find a cure&quot;. Sadly, that is rather near the truth. I remember a particular Health Committee report that found that drug companies at the time were investing &pound;3.3 billion a year in drug-related research, which was many times the figure invested by the Department of Health, the Medical Research Council and medical charities combined. We are dependent on the pharmaceutical industry for research into drug treatment, but inevitably, owing to the costs of new drugs, the industry must consider drugs that will produce a return.</p>
	<p pid="a.219.0/7">What made Alexion look at paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria, which is so incredibly rare? I flashed Alexion up on Google a few moments ago, and as far as I could see it only produces that one drug and is desperately researching its use for asthma, and in transplantation and inflammatory disorders. Why did it start and come up with this remarkable drug that it describes on its website as the</p>
	<p pid="a.219.0/8" class="indent">&quot;first and only medication approved specifically to treat PNH&quot;?</p>
	<p pid="a.219.0/9">In the 2005 Health Committee report into the pharmaceutical industry, we made it quite clear that we wanted the Government to direct, and have discussions with, the industry to include in its research rare diseases. With that report, we discovered that the Department of Health does not respond to a conclusion unless the word &quot;recommendation&quot; is in it. One of our conclusions read:</p>
	<p pid="a.219.0/10" class="indent">&quot;Priorities for research into medicines inevitably reflect the interests of the pharmaceutical companies and are not necessarily well aligned with the medical needs of all patients. The industry will continue to undertake the bulk of research in this area, but there are improvements that could be made. We welcome Lord Warner's recognition of this and look forward to his proposals to align more closely the drug companies' research strategies with the public health aims&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.219.0/11">In fairness, there were some comments about that in the introduction to the Government's response, although the Department did not pick out that particular conclusion. One comment read:</p>
	<p pid="a.219.0/12" class="indent">&quot;To build on this progress, the Government is consulting on a new strategy for the NHS contribution to health research in England.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.219.0/13">A document entitled, &quot;Best Research for Best Health: a New National Health Research Strategy&quot;, was published around the same time. I am sure that the Minister is not quite prepared for this line of questioning, but what progress has been made on the NHS contribution to health research?</p>
	<p pid="a.219.0/14">On the pharmaceutical industry, the response stated:</p>
	<p pid="a.219.0/15" class="indent">&quot;One of the areas considered by the Committee was how the Government could inform the industry the disease areas where more research was needed.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.219.0/16">The response went on to say that the Government were forming the Ministerial Industry Strategy Group to continue the dialogue between the Government and the industry. I would love to know if any updates are available on that.</p>
	<p pid="a.219.0/17">How do we find the money to begin to afford all these expensive treatments? To me, the answer is obvious, but no one will accept it because nobody likes the dread word &quot;rationing&quot;. In a briefing for this debate, the Specialist Healthcare Alliance suggested that we use the money saved from medicines coming off patent to re-invest in new treatments, which the Department has started to do. Ages ago, it produced the paper, &quot;Better Care, Better Value Indicators&quot;, which I have mentioned umpteen times before, and which showed that if everyone prescribed generic statins the way that the best 25 per cent. of primary care trusts do, we would save &pound;80 million a year. So the answers are there.</p>
	<p pid="a.219.0/18">In its submission, Myeloma UK said:</p>
	<p pid="a.219.0/19" class="indent">&quot;We need a broad societal debate on what should be paid for by the NHS&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.219.0/20">Finally, the <i>British Journal of Healthcare Management</i>, for which I have a great deal of time, popped across my desk this morning. I shall finish with a quote from Nick Bosanquet in an article about top-up fees, which I hope will be passed across the Minister's desk as well. He said:</p>
	<p pid="a.219.0/21" class="indent">&quot;Top-up payments should be regarded as an interim solution until we are prepared to reform the lop-sided rationing problems of the NHS. NICE is in effect applying an intensive form of rationing to one corner of health spending. NICE claims that it is making these decisions on the grounds of affordability, but there is no connection at all between the denial of these therapies and the financial state of the system. Nor are patients in neglected areas getting more because cancer patients are getting less. NICE is intensively rationing cancer drugs while large areas of inefficiency, waste and duplication have had no attention at all.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.219.0/22">That is an excellent summary of the position.</p>

	<p pid="a.222.0/1">It is a great privilege to work with you again, Mr. Cummings. A long time ago, we worked together in a very different place. I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1456" name="Doug Naysmith">the Member for Bristol, North-West (Dr. Naysmith)</phrase> on securing the debate, and I assure those present, particularly <i>Hansard</i><i></i>staff, that I shall do my best not to use words of more than three syllables.</p>

	<p pid="a.222.0/3">Within a month of coming to this place, I was asked whether I would be prepared to chair the all-party group for muscular dystrophy, and I was pleased to take up that opportunity. I want to put on record my thanks and the thanks of those involved with the parliamentary group, as well as campaigners on muscular dystrophy, for the great response that we have had so far from the Minister. She has shown real good will in trying to take forward the campaign with which we are involved. I thank her in particular for giving us access to the civil servants in the research department whom we met during the recess. They were very positive about their role in helping us to maximise opportunities to develop good-quality research.</p>
	<p pid="a.222.0/4">I shall spoil the party a little bit now, though, by telling the Minister that I am going to write to her about an issue that has arisen as a result of those meetings. It is ludicrous that Government money that had been allocated to the development of drugs to help people with this disease has been classed as underspend because it has not been spent within a certain time scale, and will probably be clawed back. That money has been underspent not because people have not wanted to use it, but because the phasing of what they have been doing did not work as they thought it would. It is not rocket science, but it is research science. Surely, the essence of research is that things develop in a way that is uncertain. Things sometimes go much quicker than expected and sometimes much slower. That money is a relatively small amount in the Department's global sum, and the fact that it has not been spent within the expected time scale should not be a way of getting money back into the Department. It should be kept by the groups doing the research.</p>
	<p pid="a.222.0/5">I have received information from the Muscular Dystrophy Campaign that I want to take hon. Members through to inform them of the current situation. There are more than 60 types of muscular dystrophy and related neuromuscular conditions&mdash;rare conditions for which there is no cure. That shows the importance of the research work being done. It is estimated that such conditions affect more than 1,000 children and adults for every 1 million of the UK's population, and conditions can be genetic or acquired. Some types, such as Duchenne's, are aggressive, causing muscular deterioration and wasting. They are responsible for respiratory and cardiac problems and, sadly, result in premature death, particularly in young boys. Other conditions can cause lifelong disability. My sister was 53 when she died and my brother was 48. They had a lifelong disabilities, but not very long lives.</p>
	<p pid="a.222.0/6">The campaign invests about &pound;3 million of its own money in research, care support services, muscular centres, development networks, and in sharing information and resources. It has pioneered research into treatments and cures for nearly 50 years, but it cannot do everything on its own. The House, the Department, the Government and the Minister all have a responsibility, and I know that the Minister takes her responsibility very seriously.</p>
	<p pid="a.222.0/7">Last December, the campaign produced a report called &quot;Building on the Foundations: Establishing a Specialist Neuromuscular Service across England&quot;, which found classic disparities such as those that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1743" name="Steve Webb">the hon. Member for Northavon (Steve Webb)</phrase> mentioned. In the north of England, where we have a strong lead in muscular research, the average survival rate for patients with Duchenne's muscular dystrophy is 30 years, whereas in the south-west it is, sadly, only 18 years. That is a huge difference in life expectancy. The report also found that two out of three primary care trusts do not support a muscle clinic for either adults or children, which means that many patients do not receive the special care that they need. It also found that the service is dependent on a handful of world-class specialists. What will we do when those people retire or move on to another area and there is no on left to come behind them? We must take control and embed what they are doing into a national structure.</p>
	<p pid="a.222.0/8">Last month, the Muscular Dystrophy Campaign carried out the &quot;State of the Nation&quot; survey as part of its muscle week. The survey focused specifically on access to specialist services, quality of life and the impact of living with a rare disease. There were 1,000 respondents, of whom 50 per cent. said that their experience of the diagnosis process was either poor or very poor. The results showed that half of patients have not seen a physiotherapist and that half do not have access to a specialist neuromuscular consultant. The survey also found that 80 per cent. of patients do not visit a specialist centre or receive specialist care for their condition. The campaign believes that those problems can be put right, and we seek commitments from the Department on its recommendations. It would be great if the Minister said yes today, but I do not suppose that she has the authority to do so.</p>
	<p pid="a.222.0/9">The campaign recommends that we should, as a matter of course, designate specialist muscular services within the Department of Health's specialised services definition set, so that specialised commissioning groups can be set up across England. Each such group, and responsible bodies in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, should follow the lead of the South West SCG and carry out a comprehensive review of the provision of specialist services. Let us know what is going on out there. We should also ensure that every person who is affected by muscular dystrophy has access to a care co-ordinator or key worker who can take a lead on their behalf with the care team and provide them with support, information and a regular review of their care plan. We need more. Far be it from me to fall out with my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1744" name="Ian Gibson">the Member for Norwich, North (Dr. Gibson)</phrase>, but the truth is this: socialism might put this matter right, but whether there is socialism, capitalism, a laissez-faire approach or a middle-of-the-road system, those people are not being looked after properly, and we need a system that does look after them properly.</p>

	<p pid="a.226.0/1">It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Mr. Cummings, and I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1456" name="Doug Naysmith">the hon. Member for Bristol, North-West (Dr. Naysmith)</phrase> on securing the debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.226.0/2">Although <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1949" name="Richard Taylor">the hon. Member for Wyre Forest (Dr. Taylor)</phrase> attempted to give a definition of a rare and complex disease by stating that a GP would see one example per year, there are a number of definitions. There is an official definition, but the prevalence criteria used in national commissioning is one per 50,000. Interestingly, that varies from the EU definition of fewer than five per 10,000. Many diseases with a prevalence of fewer than five per 10,000 do not require special arrangements for health services to be commissioned.</p>
	<p pid="a.226.0/3">None the less, there are many thousands of different diseases, many of which are suffered by only a few hundred people in the UK, and even fewer than that in some instances. Collectively, however, the numbers can be much higher. For example, recent research shows that between 30 and 50 per cent. of all cancer cases could be classified as rare as they fall outside the more common and highly publicised cancers such as colon, breast, lung, prostrate and bowel cancer, which we hear about frequently in the press.</p>
	<p pid="a.226.0/4">One prominent feature that I do not think has been highlighted strongly enough in the debate is that those suffering from rare and complex diseases often feel a tremendous sense of isolation&mdash;more so than if they were suffering from a more common disease. There might be few survivors and no available support networks, the GP might know little about the condition and it is often difficult to get accurate information about the prognosis or effective treatment. Of course, availability to much wider networks on the internet has made a significant impact on that problem, but many of those people do not necessarily have access to the internet and might not be comfortable joining support networks in that way. The isolation, the feeling of fear and the lack of information are significant factors.</p>
	<p pid="a.226.0/5">I understand that there are currently around 8,000 identifiable rare diseases. As we have heard, it is clearly not practical to plan and purchase separately for each of those, and as a result, the UK's approach has been to provide those specialist services around groupings of expertise, and increasingly that is becoming the case. In fact, the provision of specialist services in specialist centres is certainly not an innovation. The hon. Member for Wyre Forest commented on the fact that the Minister and I, who are both in the hot seats today, both trained as nurses. I am sure that she will join me in noting that, even 30 years ago when I was training, the newest surgical services were provided on a regional basis and in specialist centres. None the less, the aim of the arrangements is to purchase specialist services, ensure fair access to clinically effective services where patient numbers are small and a critical mass of patients is needed to achieve the best outcomes, maintain clinical confidence, sustain the training of specialist staff, ensure cost effectiveness in provision and made the best use of scarce resources.</p>
	<p pid="a.226.0/6">The hon. Member for Bristol, North-West rightly commented that local decision making should not prejudice the situation of people with rare or complex conditions and raised the fact that there is considerable variation in the applications to PCTs for exceptional cases. There are wide variations in the review of those and in the clinical input of those review panels and the decisions made.</p>
	<p pid="a.226.0/7">What is causing the increasing concern that we are seeing among the public and in the press are these huge variations and indeed the lack of fairness and transparency associated with them. We must have right of access extended to specialist services. It is very important that people have confidence and trust in a system that is making what could be life or death decisions about them.</p>
	<p pid="a.226.0/8">The hon. Member for Bristol, North-West also said that the Department of Health and NICE should work together better. I find it extraordinarily frustrating, and I think that my frustration will be shared by many people, that NICE and the Department of Health do not work more effectively together. It staggers me that everybody wants this process speeded up, to be more efficient and to be more transparent, but the continuing frustration is that that improvement never seems to happen. I am sure that the Minister will address the issue of why it takes so long to get what feel like quite simple decisions or simple actions taken to make this process work more quickly and more effectively for the patients involved; the delay makes me very impatient.</p>
	<p pid="a.226.0/9"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1743" name="Steve Webb">The hon. Member for Northavon (Steve Webb)</phrase> highlighted the issue affecting one of his constituents and, as ever, personal experiences and personal stories are particularly poignant. He also mentioned another source of frustration, that Pfizer was prepared to share the cost of the drug that his constituent required, but that offer was not taken into account by NICE. I and many other people would like to see a much more common-sense approach taken by NICE. The fact that Pfizer would share the cost of the drug is relevant and should have some impact on NICE's decision making.</p>
	<p pid="a.226.0/10">I would like to congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1744" name="Ian Gibson">the hon. Member for Norwich, North (Dr. Gibson)</phrase> for his excellent work on the Rarer Cancers Forum. However, although he has clearly felt a wave of socialism around the place recently, I would suggest that nationalising the drug companies might see a halt in any progress that has been made in the innovation and research carried out by them, particularly in relation to PNH&mdash;I leave the full pronunciation of that condition to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1949" name="Richard Taylor">the hon. Member for Wyre Forest (Dr. Taylor)</phrase>.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-10-14a.227.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1603" speakername="Anne Milton" colnum="227"  time="012:06:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm081014/halltext/81014h0007.htm#08101444000523">
	<p pid="a.227.1/1">I could try it, but I do not want to take up any more of Members' time, so I will not.</p>
	<p pid="a.227.1/2">The hon. Member for Wyre Forest rightly raised the issue of research, which had not been mentioned until that point. The hon. Member for Norwich, North talked about people with rare and complex conditions punching above their weight; I think that he is absolutely right that they do punch above their weight. Nevertheless, there are concerns about the lack of incentives within the system, not only for research but for diagnosis and treatment innovation.</p>
	<p pid="a.227.1/3">The hon. Member for Norwich, North also talked about some obvious ways of saving money to pay for new and expensive treatments. I could feel a certain tension&mdash;an anticipation&mdash;as we heard from him that the way that he would finally solve the problem was through paying for some of these drugs, which I well appreciate is not easy.</p>
	<p pid="a.227.1/4">I would also like to congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1427" name="David Anderson">the hon. Member for Blaydon (Mr. Anderson)</phrase> on his work on muscular dystrophy. It was very useful to have the example of one particular rare and complex condition. He also highlighted the fact that, even within the group of people who suffer from a rare disease such as muscular dystrophy, that rare disease can itself be further split up, into even rarer subsections of the same disease type. It is very sad that the experiences of people with muscular dystrophy have been poor, in terms of the diagnosis and treatment that they have received. He then widened the debate away from the issue of drugs, which was the focus at the start of the debate this morning, into the wider and important societal and care issues surrounding rare diseases.</p>
	<p pid="a.227.1/5">I would like to finish by asking the Minister to address a few a few points, in particular the view that was expressed that PCTs are out of their depth; the issue about their decision making on exceptional panels, and the significant issues that surround some of the ignorance among those in general practice, even if that ignorance is not surprising given that these conditions so rarely emerge. Nevertheless, the issues of training, education and, just as importantly, continual professional development are important and it would be encouraging to hear from the Minister what she is doing to ensure that those issues are addressed.</p>
	<p pid="a.227.1/6">It is also of note that since 1997 there has been an increase in mortality for those people with rarer cancers. Although that increase can be partially attributed to the lack of knowledge among physicians of the symptoms of rarer cancers and also the late presentation of such symptoms, it would be interesting to know what the Minister is doing about this issue and whether she has any ideas in the pipeline about how to reduce the mortality for those people with rarer cancers.</p>
	<p pid="a.227.1/7">The next point that I would like to make is that there is a European directive to incentivise the investment in research and development in orphan medicines for rare and life-threatening diseases, which I understand has had some success. Since its adoption, 22 products have received a marketing authorisation. Overall, that is still a comparatively low number, but given the disproportionately low survival rates for rarer cancers, does the Minister agree that more needs to be done to incentivise drug research?</p>
	<p pid="a.227.1/8">Rarer cancers often require treatment by drugs that have not yet been approved by NICE or rejected on cost, requiring patients to plead the exceptionality of their case, as we have heard on numerous occasions. I know that we have heard a few figures, but perhaps we have not heard so many this morning. I would like to give one other figure; 5,000 patients have been forced to demonstrate their exceptionality in the last 20 months, in order to receive cancer treatments that are not recommended by NICE. Of those 5,000 patients, 1,300 had their request rejected.</p>
	<p pid="a.227.1/9">I think that it was the hon. Member for Northavon who said that what finally gets to people is this battling away against the system. Not only do they have to live with a rare disease and with the isolation that surrounds the fact that they have a rare illness&mdash;there is fear and lack of information&mdash;but they also have to do battle against a system that they do not entirely understand. In fairness to the Minister, I think that she would agree with me that that system is indeed not understood by herself of the Department of Health. The lack of fairness and transparency makes the situation even worse.</p>
	<p pid="a.227.1/10">In the past, NICE has proposed an ultra-orphan drugs evaluation committee, to undertake an appraisal of medicine for very rare diseases. I understand that Ministers have received NICE's report on appraising ultra-orphan drugs and have concluded that it is not appropriate at this time to establish a separate appraisal system for such drugs. Perhaps the Minister could bring me up to date on that issue.</p>
	<p pid="a.227.1/11">We have had a debate today on exceptional and rare conditions. Special cases require special treatment; exceptional medical conditions need exceptional treatment. I know that the Minister agrees with that view and has much sympathy with it. However, what we want to hear from her now is what action she will be taking.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-10-14a.229.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1448" speakername="Ann Keen" speakeroffice="The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Health"  colnum="229"  time="012:18:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm081014/halltext/81014h0007.htm#08101444000524">
	<p pid="a.229.0/1">Thank you, Mr. Cummings; it is a pleasure to be in attendance with you today.</p>
	<p pid="a.229.0/2">I thank my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1456" name="Doug Naysmith">the Member for Bristol, North-West (Dr. Naysmith)</phrase> for securing this debate. He has particular knowledge and expertise in all House matters, but he has been consistent in holding a strong interest in the treatment and care of the wide range of patients who are unfortunate enough to suffer from a rare or complex medical condition.</p>
	<p pid="a.229.0/3">My hon. Friend last raised this issue in the House in 2005, and he was kind enough to say that we have made strong progress in improving the overarching commissioning arrangements for specialised services, which I will mention in more detail shortly, and that patients are starting to see the benefits of those improvements. In fact, all hon. Members here today have congratulated us on that progress.</p>
	<p pid="a.229.0/4">My hon. Friend made some important points in his speech and I will respond to his concerns as far as I am able to, given the time constraints that I now face. I commend the efforts of the Specialised Healthcare Alliance and its chairman, Baroness Pitkeathley, which has supported my hon. Friend in raising this debate The SHCA has actively engaged many of my predecessors and colleagues to advance the case for improvements in the treatment and care of those people with rare conditions, and it continues to promote these causes vigorously and determinedly, with the help of stakeholders and sponsors. It is right to do so.</p>
	<p pid="a.229.0/5">I thank my hon. Friend for his kind words about the Carter review of arrangements for the commissioning of specialised services, which was introduced in April 2007. The arrangements, which have been in place for 18 months, are making significant progress in improving the quality of specialised commissioning at regional and supra-regional levels and, as a consequence, are improving access to specialised services for local people. Parts of the country, including the area in which my hon. Friend serves, which had hitherto been notably weak in their approach to commissioning specialised services, have improved rapidly as a result of the Carter reforms. From next year, we expect that more services than ever before will be commissioned by specialised commissioning groups through primary care trusts' pooled budgets. Additionally, the new arrangements allow the national health service to take collective and consistent action across the country to pursue areas of agreed priority. A good example is work now commencing in SCGs to plan for improved levels of renal transplantation, in response to the recently published report of the Organ Donation Taskforce.</p>
	<p pid="a.229.0/6">Another example of the strengthened national approach that the national specialised commissioning group has delivered is provided in the agreement of all SCGs to adopt the unified commissioning approach in &quot;Target Therapies for the Treatment of Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension in Adults&quot;. Adoption of a national policy by all SCGs will mean substantial increases in investment by some of them to raise standards to those of the best and to provide a level playing field for patients across England.</p>
	<p pid="a.229.0/7">Our world-class commissioning programme is designed to raise ambitions for a new form of commissioning that has not yet been developed or implemented in a comprehensive way anywhere in the world. World-class commissioning is about delivering better health and well-being for the population, improving health outcomes and, of course, meeting the huge challenge of reducing health inequalities. As part of the programme, a commissioning assurance system has been launched this year. It is a national system to hold commissioners to account, to reward performance, and to ensure that health outcomes improve. As <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1830" name="John Pugh">the hon. Member for Southport (Dr. Pugh)</phrase> said, we are running a pilot with the north-west SCG to design a national scheme for holding commissioners of specialised services to account, and for encouraging better co-operation and co-ordination between PCTs and SCGs.</p>
	<p pid="a.229.0/8">Hon. Members may be aware that the Government have actively supported the provision of high-quality treatment services for many rare conditions and complex procedures through the arrangements. Some 40 highly specialised services are currently commissioned nationally through the national commissioning group. I approved the national commissioning from April this year of a proton-beam therapy service for complex and difficult to treat patients with rare cancers, and of an islet cell transplantation service for diabetic patients who suffer recurrent episodes of hypoglycaemia.</p>
	<p pid="a.229.0/9">The Minister of State, Department of Health, my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1457" name="Dawn Primarolo">the Member for Bristol, South (Dawn Primarolo)</phrase>, who has responsibility for public health matters, released a statement last week that confirmed approval for the national commissioning of a service for paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria&mdash;perhaps I should have said &quot;PNH&quot;, as I obviously did not see those words coming. It will ensure a high-quality service for patients who would benefit most from high-cost drugs, which are estimated to cost some &pound;25 million a year. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1949" name="Richard Taylor">The hon. Member for Wyre Forest (Dr. Taylor)</phrase> raised that matter. I congratulate Dr. Peter Hillman, the professor who is leading the group in Leeds, and can say to the hon. Gentleman that, yes, the drug will be funded before the service commences in April. Dr. Hillman has been important in our making that decision.</p>
	<p pid="a.229.0/10">Lord Darzi's final report, &quot;High Quality Care for All&quot;, sets an important context that is as applicable to patients with rare or complex medical conditions as it is to patients with more common conditions. The report describes a health service that delivers fair, personalised, effective and safe care. Lord Darzi calls his final report an enabling document because it sets out more than 90 commitments from the Department of Health that will help the NHS to deliver high-quality health care that puts the patient at the centre of the organisation and meets the challenges of the 21st century. Its time is overdue. The time is right to bring quality into the NHS.</p>
	<p pid="a.229.0/11">I am aware of colleagues inside and outside this Chamber who have discussed quality over the years. Since entering the House in 1997, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1744" name="Ian Gibson">the Member for Norwich, North (Dr. Gibson)</phrase> has chaired groups, in particular on cancer, and has described the way forward for the Rarer Cancers Forum. I have had the pleasure to be involved with him on that forum.</p>
	<p pid="a.229.0/12">I was probably at the conference at which discussion of nationalising our pharmaceutical companies was doing the rounds, but the style of delivery of a speech at that time&mdash;things were put in a particular way&mdash;did not necessarily demonstrate the need for it. Of course, we are getting the huge co-operation from scientists and researchers that hon. Members have asked for today. I am sure that we all look forward to the return of the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Bill, when the House will be challenged by even more advancement of science. Nevertheless, it is necessary for us to deal with such matters.</p>
	<p pid="a.229.0/13"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1743" name="Steve Webb">The hon. Member for Northavon (Steve Webb)</phrase> spoke about his constituent Mr. Derrick and the moving way in which Mr. Derrick's daughter put the case for a particular drug that the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence is reviewing. I hope the hon. Gentleman will accept that it is not possible for me to comment while the appraisal is taking place; however, I hope that this debate will be read in Northavon and that it will be helpful.</p>

	<p pid="a.233.1/1">Mr. Cummings, I thank you for your chairmanship of this debate, which is important for residents in my constituency and neighbouring constituencies. I thank the Minister for coming along today to respond to the debate. I welcome him to his new position and wish him every success in his role as a Minister.</p>
	<p pid="a.233.1/2">The M3 motorway and network roads are at the heart of the reason why, over a number of decades, Basingstoke has become not just a great place to live, but a great place to run businesses. We have more than 60,000 jobs in the borough of Basingstoke and Deane, making it one of the top 10 centres for employment in the south-east. Many companies are located there because of our communication network, our highly skilled labour force and, importantly, because we have superb residential communities throughout north Hampshire.</p>
	<p pid="a.233.1/3">We are proud to be home to many household name companies, including Macmillan books, Motorola, Sony, the Automobile Association, Game and Barclays: I could go on. The Prime Minister has recognised how important Basingstoke is and has recognised the opportunity it affords to the whole of the south-east of England and the role it could play in helping build the United Kingdom economy into the future. That is perhaps why it has been designated by Ministers as a business growth point, recognising the area's potential for sustainable economic growth. The South East England Development Agency has recognised the area as just one of eight diamonds for growth: it has been identified as such for its potential to drive economic growth both regionally and nationally.</p>
	<p pid="a.233.1/4">On the housing side, the Government have set targets that mean that we are already building 1,000 houses a year in Basingstoke. I understand that they would like even more to be built in future, although I am not sure that market conditions or the residents will favour that demand.</p>
	<p pid="a.233.1/5">The Government are right to identify the strengths of the community that I represent, but this can never be a one-way street. No area can accommodate the considerable scale of house building and business growth that is expected in my constituency without the necessary investment in local infrastructure and services. The motorway is the critical element driving the Government's focus on Basingstoke, both in terms of housing and business targets, yet local residents and local businesses who already use the motorway regularly, or live by it, are experiencing significant congestion and noise pollution. Noise pollution, particularly, has spiralled as a result of growth not just in Basingstoke and Deane, but throughout the south-east region.</p>
	<p pid="a.233.1/6">Despite all those demands on my constituency, there are neither current not future plans, as I understand it, to address a mounting infrastructure gap for the M3. The raw facts, which I have gleaned through parliamentary questions, are as follows. Congestion between junctions 6 and 7 has increased by 5,000 vehicles a day over the past 10 years; there have been some slight changes to the signals at junction 6 to maximise traffic flow, but no increase of capacity over that part of the motorway. Junction 6 already operates in excess of capacity, with 100,000 vehicles using it every day. The most sobering fact of all is that accidents between junctions 5 and 8 have increased by a staggering 42 per cent. over the past 10 years, including a notable increase in fatalities.</p>
	<p pid="a.233.1/7">Residents are also troubled by traffic noise, which has doubled in the past 20 years, leaving many more residents affected by that sort of noise pollution than was ever the case in the past. Yes, there are residents who live close to the motorway, but now such issues are affecting people far further away than previously, including in the villages of Mapledurwell and Up Nately in the east, areas around Hatch Warren and, in the constituency of my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1613" name="George Young">the Member for North-West Hampshire (Sir George Young)</phrase>, Beggarwood and Dummer in the west.</p>
	<p pid="a.233.1/8">I am concerned that things look set to become more of a concern for local residents and businesses. There is talk of yet more house building, but in the present conditions the Government's ambitions in that area may be more limited. There are plans by Southampton airport to double passenger numbers in the next 10 years, which will add further pressure on the motorway that passes through my constituency. All those plans amount to additional vehicles on the M3 and additional noise and congestion.</p>
	<p pid="a.233.1/9">What does that mean for businesses and local residents in my constituency? The Government need to start listening when the chairman of one of the major employers in my constituency&mdash;indeed, in the UK&mdash;says:</p>
	<p pid="a.233.1/10" class="indent">&quot;congestion on the M3 in the vicinity of Basingstoke at peak times has reached a level at which it has a significant negative impact on local industry. Indeed, it is likely now to be an important factor in companies' decisions about locating or expanding operations in Basingstoke.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.233.1/11">The Government need to listen carefully to such comments.</p>
	<p pid="a.233.1/12">Basingstoke will not be the diamond for growth, or the growth point that the Government need it to be in these difficult economic times, if employers see the reason that they chose Basingstoke&mdash;its location and road networks&mdash;becoming a problem rather than an advantage in terms of location. I am sure that the Minister will make himself familiar with the congestion problems suffered by businesses in Reading and will know about some of the actions taken there.</p>
	<p pid="a.233.1/13">For residents, Basingstoke's attractiveness is as a great place to live and work: 80 per cent. of my constituents live and work in the constituency. However, noise from the motorway has become a growing problem for many of them. As the number of vehicles, both commercial and domestic, grows, so the noise from the motorway grows and affects ever more communities. That direct cost of growth cannot be ignored, but I fear that that has been the position to date&mdash;the approach taken to mitigating its effects has been at best patchy. Some remedial work has been done in my constituency. On a nationwide basis, the Government set aside a limited pot to deal with remedial noise measures, primarily through the use of fencing. However, the limited use of such provision in my constituency is causing me a great deal of concern. There has also been a limited use of noise retardant material on the motorway surface, but there is a lack of clarity about how to move that forward to ensure the sort of noise-reduction measures that my residents would like to see.</p>
	<p pid="a.233.1/14">Returning to sound barriers for a moment&mdash;I should like the Minister to pick up on this issue&mdash;they have been used on a limited basis to deflect noise away from residents, but that usage appears somewhat haphazard and is not always co-ordinated, because it is dealt with by the Highways Agency, not the local authority. Some of the worst affected communities in my constituency are those situated near a sound barrier, where sound has been deflected from one residential area into another. In my closing comments, I shall return to matters that the Minister might want to consider in that regard.</p>
	<p pid="a.233.1/15">Villages in the east of my constituency are so badly affected by noise that the Highways Agency has acknowledged that, if their population density were greater, they would be eligible for Government support. However, because of the sparseness of those villages' populations, they receive no help at all. That method of allocating money is not an equitable and fair way of recognising an extreme problem for some of the communities in my constituency. Some might say that that discriminates against rural communities in areas such as Basingstoke.</p>
	<p pid="a.233.1/16">Many already appreciate the great scale of the problem locally in Hampshire. The M3 Action campaign has presented a petition with 2,000 signatures calling for action to be taken to reduce noise and congestion on the M3. Hampshire county council has already identified that &pound;300 million of improvements are needed to our roads in Basingstoke, and that &pound;160 million is needed to improve reliability and safety on the M3.</p>

	<p pid="a.236.1/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1389" name="Maria Miller">the hon. Member for Basingstoke (Mrs. Miller)</phrase> on securing this debate, and providing us with the opportunity to discuss noise pollution and congestion on the M3. I know that it is a matter of concern, and the hon. Members for Winchester (Mr. Oaten) and for North-West Hampshire also contributed to the discussion. I am aware of the keen interest that the hon. Member for Basingstoke has shown with her M3 action campaign and the presentation of a 2,000-signature petition earlier this year. I hope that my response will clarify the route forward by dealing with some of the issues that we understand are of concern to the hon. Lady's constituents.</p>
	<p pid="a.236.1/2">The M3 is part of the core motorway and strategic road network, providing a link from south-west London to Southampton. It is an important key road corridor for long and medium-distance traffic travelling between Southampton and London. I am delighted that the hon. Lady endorsed the Prime Minister's forward thinking and the importance of Basingstoke in the decisions that have been taken. It is an important part of the M3 route.</p>
	<p pid="a.236.1/3">Protecting and enhancing the environment is an increasingly important role for the Highways Agency, and that includes mitigating the impact of traffic noise wherever practicable. The Highways Agency is committed to taking action by March 2011 on those sites listed in <i>Hansard</i> in November 1999&mdash;the <i>Hansard </i>list. Under the national &pound;5 million ring-fenced annual budget, the Highways Agency has installed acoustic barriers at various locations on the M3 in the hon. Lady's constituency since 2001 on the basis of priority according to their noise severity rating at a total cost of approximately &pound;8.5 million. They include Hatch Warren, Black Dam and Hatch caravan site.</p>
	<p pid="a.236.1/4">The 2007 comprehensive spending review confirmed that resurfacing of concrete roads for noise mitigation reasons ahead of maintenance need would not be allocated funding. Traditional surfacing with hot-rolled asphalt uses high quality stone rolled into the top layer, but quieter surfacing requires that higher quality stone throughout the full depth of the wearing course leading to an increased environmental impact at quarry sites. The hon. Lady will appreciate that there is environmental impact from that process.</p>
	<p pid="a.236.1/5">I am sure that the hon. Lady is aware that the Highways Agency is working closely with the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs on the production of noise maps and action plans in line with the Environmental Noise (England) Regulations 2006. The maps for England's roads were first published on <phrase class="date" code="2008-05-16">16 May 2008</phrase> and DEFRA is working with the Highways Agency and local authorities to develop traffic noise action plans. Those plans will be used to review the priorities and measures to provide noise mitigation solutions. Funding levels and responsibility for delivery, when required, have yet to be agreed.</p>
	<p pid="a.236.1/6">The action plan is expected to identify practical and cost-effective solutions for reducing road noise. It will include a cost benefit analysis of measures to ensure they are sustainable and estimates of the reduction in the number of people affected by excessive noise as a result of the proposed measures. The Highways Agency is also developing a forward strategy for noise mitigation that will include implementation of a new system for identifying and prioritising problem sites. As I am sure the hon. Lady appreciates, it would be inappropriate for me to comment further on that until the work is complete and I have fully considered the region's advice.</p>
	<p pid="a.236.1/7">As has been identified by right hon. and hon. Members, congestion generally occurs during morning peak times on the north-bound approach to the M25, south bound on the approach to the M27 at Southampton and at junction 6 at Basingstoke in both directions. We recognise that problem.</p>
	<p pid="a.236.1/8">The Command Paper produced in July 2008 by the then Secretary of State, my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1433" name="Ruth Kelly">the Member for Bolton, West (Ruth Kelly)</phrase>, highlighted locations for potential funding for improvements to the strategic road network. As part of my right hon. Friend's proposals, she highlighted a number of techniques to get more out of the existing network, such as the dynamic use of hard shoulders to provide additional capacity. Following the Command Paper, two studies are now underway to investigate the feasibility of traffic using the hard shoulder during peak periods on two stretches of the M3 between junctions 2 to 4A, and junctions 9 to 14.</p>
	<p pid="a.236.1/9">To allow maximum to access and egress from Basingstoke, the Highways Agency has programmed the traffic signals at junction 6 of the M3 to give priority to clear the queuing traffic exiting the motorway and to reduce the hazard of vehicles queuing on the main carriageway. As the hon. Lady said, that could make a significant difference. Delays into Basingstoke town centre on the A30 and A339 are due to the high volume of traffic on all approaches to the Black Dam roundabout, which links the local network with junction 6 of the M3.</p>
	<p pid="a.236.1/10">I noticed that the hon. Lady talked about the sustainability of jobs, homes and housing. Equally, we need sustainability in terms of traffic and transport options for people going to and from work, home, schools and so on. That is why it is important that we work collectively on sustainable solutions and do not put our eggs all in one basket. Strategically, of course, although that transport corridor&mdash;the M3&mdash;is important to Basingstoke, there are other options, which I will come on to shortly.</p>
	<p pid="a.236.1/11">A scheme to reduce the hazard of traffic queuing on the main carriageway is currently being worked on. The scheme will include extending the off-slip roads at junction 6 by using the hard shoulder. A study programmed for 2009-10 will model the wider road network around junction 6 and assess the impact of the growth point status of Basingstoke that was announced by the Department for Communities and Local Government in October 2006, as the hon. Lady noted. That study will include further options for improvement.</p>
	<p pid="a.236.1/12">As I have said, there need to be sustainable solutions that take all parties and all stakeholders into account, which is why the Highways Agency is working with all the local planning authorities along the M3 to reduce traffic demand in relation to future developments. Measures will concentrate on providing workable alternatives to car-based travel, principally by improving public transport and facilities for walking and cycling. I am well aware of the problems concerning the location of junction 6 and of coming off there and meeting the Black Dam roundabout, which I know has been phased to make the situation easier. Of course, there are substantial business and residential developments off that road, but I am well aware that Basingstoke station is close to that area. Therefore, when we talk about sustainability for housing or jobs, we must consider the multitude of options available. We have been working closely with local authorities to consider how we can take options forward.</p>

	<p pid="a.239.1/1">What the hon. Lady can certainly take from my comments is that we look at all possible and affordable options. That is where we have to be. The programme on the various road surfacing and changes that are ahead, which I shall run through in response to her final points, obviously has to be subject to the funding available. The hon. Lady has said, and rightly so, that we have specifically identified a ring-fenced budget for some of the work. Equally, she will be aware that there are many demands on that budget from the length and breadth of the country.</p>
	<p pid="a.239.1/2">On the three specific areas that the hon. Lady raised and in terms of looking for whisper quiet surfacing and so on, we are committed to a programme of working through priority areas and what finances permit. Further resurfacing work will take place between junctions 5 and 7 between 2008-10 and, funding permitting, further work on quieter surfacing is scheduled for between junctions 5 and 6 by April 2010.</p>
	<p pid="a.239.1/3">On a co-ordinated approach to noise barriers, far more joint working is needed. Some &pound;8.5 million has been put in by the Department for noise barriers along road sections that fall within the Basingstoke constituency. The hon. Lady will also be aware that others have been agreed with developers through the planning process and in co-ordination with themselves. I understand and hear clearly what she is saying about the potential knock-on affects in other areas. That is why there needs to be joint working across local authorities and planning agencies.</p>
	<p pid="a.239.1/4">Finally, on the co-ordinated approach to junction 6, I have already indicated that work will take place on the off-slip roads and on ensuring that the hard shoulder can accommodate and make the access and egress from junction 6 into Basingstoke safer. Overall, in terms of flows, we must take all possible options into account and look at sustainable transport measures to meet the needs of what is obviously a thriving community in Basingstoke, where there are strong jobs and strong possibilities for further development. Together, we need to find a solution to making sure that the traffic of people to jobs and schools in the community continues to flow.</p>

	<p pid="a.243.0/1">I am grateful to my right hon. Friend for giving way. I feel guilty at interrupting her flow. We are listening to her with great admiration and sympathy.</p>
	<p pid="a.243.0/2">On <phrase class="date" code="2008-09-30">30 September</phrase>, my hon. Friend the Member for Dewsbury, then a Minister in the Department for International Development, had a meeting with members of the Tamil forum about the crisis in Kilinochchi. The Government said that they wished to send aid, including the vital snake bite serum, directly to that area. If that cannot be provided through NGOs, it must be provided through local Tamil organisations. Does my right hon. Friend believe that that is the way to proceed?</p>

	<p pid="a.244.0/1">My hon. Friend makes an important point. I hope that the Minister will soon be able to shed some light on the matter.</p>
	<p pid="a.244.0/2">I have no doubt that the previous ceasefire was inconsistent, imperfect and ultimately flawed, but it was a basis for progress. Under that ceasefire, proposals were made for proper devolution and an autonomous Tamil province. Only under a ceasefire can meaningful negotiations proceed and a solution be found. However, although such a prospect is obviously urgent it seems more distant than ever. Meanwhile, suffering in the Vanni region continues unabated. Any approach must therefore be two-fold. On one hand, urgent action must be taken to tackle the immediate humanitarian situation. In my view, that must include the Government allowing access for aid organisations and ensuring that aid reaches those who need it. On the other, the Government of Sri Lanka, being the party that formally withdrew from the agreement, must make a genuine and sustained effort to re-establish a ceasefire, stem the increase in violence, and return to talks about peace.</p>
	<p pid="a.244.0/3">In this, on the 60th anniversary of the independence of Ceylon from the United Kingdom, the case for a just settlement in Sri Lanka seems more urgent than ever, and the peace dividends more appealing than ever&mdash;a peace not for the Tamils, nor for the Sinhalese, but for Sri Lanka.</p>

	<p pid="a.246.1/1">I should like to make a little bit more progress.</p>
	<p pid="a.246.1/2">The UK monitors the situation in Sri Lanka constantly and has increased its humanitarian aid in the light of circumstances on the ground. We provided more than &pound;532,000 for conflict related activities in 2006, an additional &pound;1 million in 2007, and &pound;250,000 in January this year. Only a few weeks ago, we sent a humanitarian expert to assess the situation and to see what further help is needed. On the basis of his findings in Vavuniya and Jaffna, I am pleased to announce that DFID is providing an additional &pound;2.5 million to support the efforts of the ICRC and other UN agencies and NGOs. Part of that funding will go to the north and part to the ICRC and UN High Commissioner for Refugees to support their work in other conflict-affected areas of Sri Lanka, including the Jaffna peninsular and the east of the country.</p>
	<p pid="a.246.1/3">To tackle the urgent risk of starvation, last month we lobbied for an emergency delivery of UN food aid. On <phrase class="date" code="2008-10-02">2 October</phrase>, a UN humanitarian convoy of 51 trucks successfully delivered food rations to northern Sri Lanka. The food will provide emergency rations for an estimated 230,000 people. With the rainy season upon us, as has been said, the demand for humanitarian aid will grow markedly.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-10-14a.252.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1911" speakername="Claire Ward" speakeroffice="Vice-Chamberlain of Her Majesty's Household"  colnum="252"  time="013:45:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm081014/halltext/81014h0011.htm#08101444000576">
	<p pid="a.252.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1549" name="Oliver Letwin">the right hon. Member for West Dorset (Mr. Letwin)</phrase> on securing this debate on an issue whose importance is reflected in our postbags as constituency MPs. We are a country of animal lovers, and we are concerned about unnecessary testing on animals.</p>
	<p pid="a.252.0/2">There is a clear distinction between legislation on cosmetics and legislation on other things such as medical devices or household cleaning products, and the Home Office licence is very clear about what tests may be carried out under which legislative regimes. The right hon. Gentleman raised an interesting issue about how we should take the debate onwards in respect of testing in general on animals.</p>
	<p pid="a.252.0/3">Perhaps it would be helpful if I clarified the situation regarding the testing of cosmetics on animals. Under the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986, the Home Office is responsible for licensing test houses that carry out testing on animals for any purpose. The terms and conditions of licensing indicate that a licence will be issued only if there is no alternative to animal tests, if the generation of new data is justified, if the protocols proposed cannot be further refined and if the protocols will be likely to produce data meeting the specific objective.</p>
	<p pid="a.252.0/4">In 1997, following discussions between the test houses and cosmetic product and ingredient manufacturers, it was agreed that existing licences would be withdrawn and no new licences would be issued for animal testing of finished cosmetic products, ingredients or combinations of ingredients. In effect, no testing of cosmetics on animals has taken place in the UK for the last 11 years.</p>
	<p pid="a.252.0/5">The seventh amendment to the cosmetics directive, the requirements of which are contained in the Cosmetic Products (Safety) Regulations 2008, takes what the UK and some other member states had in place and extends it to the whole of the European Union (EU). The seventh amendment has several elements. First, it imposes a ban on the testing of finished cosmetic products and cosmetic ingredients on animals from <phrase class="date" code="2005-03-11">11 March 2005</phrase>. Secondly, it introduces a provisional ban on the marketing of cosmetic products that have been tested on animals or contain ingredients that have been tested on animals using a method other than an alternative method where such a method has been validated and adopted at Community level. In other words, if an approved alternative method exists, testing on animals is unlawful. Thirdly, the amendment introduces a longstop ban that will prohibit the marketing of cosmetic products tested on animals from 2009 for the vast majority of animal tests and from 2013 for the remaining three tests, toxicity, reproductive toxicity and toxicokinetics, for which development of alternatives, as the right hon. Gentleman highlighted, is much more complex. The longstop ban will come into force irrespective of whether alternative methods have been developed.</p>
	<p pid="a.252.0/6">That means, in effect, that no animal testing of cosmetics can take place in the UK or other EU member states and that, in a phased transition starting next year and culminating in 2013, the marketing of cosmetic products tested on animals will be prohibited. The marketing ban will include not only products from within the EU but cosmetic products manufactured outside of the EU that have been subject to animal testing. That is of particular importance, because there are still countries, such as Japan and the United States, where animal testing of cosmetic products is an important part of product safety assessment.</p>
	<p pid="a.252.0/7">It might be useful to mention briefly the progress being made in the development of alternatives to animal testing. For the deadline in 2009, alternatives already exist for tests for skin corrosion, acute phototoxicity, skin penetration and skin irritation and mutagenicity. Work on the replacement of the genotoxicity and eye irritation tests is progressing well&mdash;I am sure that we all have very clear images of the sort of animal welfare posters produced, at the time, of rabbits, in particular, involved in the latter tests.</p>
	<p pid="a.252.0/8">Hopefully those replacement tests will be completed towards the latter half of 2009, and at present we have no reason to believe that the 2013 end points will not be met. It is worth pointing out that once those tests are validated and legally accepted, they are to be used as alternatives to animal testing in all areas, not just those related to cosmetic products&mdash;I think that that addresses the point that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1549" name="Oliver Letwin">the right hon. Member for West Dorset (Mr. Letwin)</phrase> mentioned.</p>
	<p pid="a.252.0/9">As I indicated at the beginning of my remarks, the Home Office, via its Animal (Scientific Procedures) Inspectorate, is responsible for ensuring that test houses do not carry out testing on animals for cosmetic purposes. Day-to-day enforcement of the Cosmetic Products (Safety) Regulations 2008 is the responsibility of local authority trading standards departments, which have access to the safety assessment dossiers, which companies must retain for all the cosmetic products that they supply. Those dossiers will contain information on any animal testing that has been carried out in the past. If hon. Members are contacted by constituents with concerns about such matters, they can refer them to their local trading standards department.</p>
	<p pid="a.252.0/10">My Department has received a number of letters from members of the public concerned that the regime that I described earlier will change because of pressure from the cosmetics industry. I can reassure Members of the House that the cosmetics industry has made no such approach to my Department and that, even if it did, we would not change the existing legal framework. My officials have also confirmed that no approach has been made by the cosmetics industry to the European Commission seeking changes to the European directive on cosmetics in respect of animal testing.</p>
	<p pid="a.252.0/11">All animal testing must be conducted under the REACH&mdash;Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals&mdash;regime, which was initially an EU regulation, but now incorporated into UK law. Its overall objective is to establish a rapid, efficient system for collecting the necessary information on chemicals and for tackling those of most concern, while minimising animal testing and maintaining the competitiveness of the chemical industry. The UK Government continue to be strongly supportive of the principles and objectives of this new EU chemicals strategy.</p>
	<p pid="a.252.0/12">Although it is important for the industry to demonstrate that its chemicals are safe to the environment and to human health, via the environment, the animal testing required under REACH to achieve these ends must be minimised and undertaken only where it is needed, and not just for the sake of filling data gaps.</p>

	<p pid="a.255.1/1">My hon. Friend raises another important point. I am sure that the Minister who has full-time responsibility for this issue will study the <i>Hansard</i> of this debate with great interest, and that my hon. Friend's points will be taken on board.</p>
	<p pid="a.255.1/2">My hon. Friend is absolutely right to make it clear that this issue is also about the public demanding changes. There has been a huge change in the public's state of mind in the past few years, initially as a result of people such as Anita Roddick and organisations such as the Body Shop making changes to the way in which they marketed and sold their products, and others seeing the value of those changes. In time, we will move on to the changes that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1549" name="Oliver Letwin">the right hon. Member for West Dorset (Mr. Letwin)</phrase> suggests. He sees this as a much bigger issue involving the use of animals for testing not only cosmetics, but household, medical and many other items.</p>
	<p pid="a.255.1/3">I thank the right hon. Gentleman again for raising this important issue, which will no doubt be aired again, perhaps taking on the points that he has made and developing the debate. I trust that he feels that the UK Government and the European Union have made significant progress in changing animal testing regimes and taking this issue forward, so that there might be a time at which we can significantly reduce the amount of animal testing.</p>
	<p pid="a.255.1/4" class="italic">Question put and agreed to.</p>
	<p pid="a.255.1/5" class="italic">Adjourned accordingly at two minutes to Two o'clock.</p>
