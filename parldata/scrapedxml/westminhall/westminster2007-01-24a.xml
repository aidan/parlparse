	<p pid="a.452.3/1">That is absolutely the case. I understand that First Great Western is now also laying off some travelling chefs, and of course the trolley on commuter services is complete fiction because, as passengers are packed in like sardines, it would take a Houdini to get the trolley from one end of the train to the other.</p>
	<p pid="a.452.3/2">First Great Western did carry out a consultation on the proposed new timetable that was to come into force in December 2006. The company heard from 9,500 separate correspondents, but one has to question whether it listened to a single one. One correspondent&mdash;me&mdash;wrote to the Secretary of State for Transport and to First Great Western on <phrase class="date" code="">5 September</phrase> saying that</p>
	<p pid="a.452.3/3" class="indent">&quot;one can see I think quite a big reduction in service during the peak commuting time around 0730. Between 0717 and 0748, there are currently 5 fast trains. In December there will effectively be only one. I can assure you this will lead to serious overcrowding, and would really urge you to try and insert an additional 2 fast services at this time&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.452.3/4">At the time, consulting only the timetable, I was blissfully unaware that shorter trains were also about to be brought into service. I met the head of First Great Western and the then Minister responsible for rail, who is now the Under-Secretary of State for Defence, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1609" name="Derek Twigg">the hon. Member for Halton (Derek Twigg)</phrase>. We saved one train, the 05.46, but nothing else was changed.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-01-24a.454.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1905" speakername="Edward Vaizey" colnum="454"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070124/halltext/70124h0001.htm#07012467000585">
	<p pid="a.454.1/1">My right hon. Friend is absolutely right. She represents her constituents, and the anger that we heard in her voice represents the anger felt by so many of them. Indeed, we need to increase not only the number of services, but the length of the trains. Quite a few commuters are returning to the car, which is not something that those of us who care about the environment want to see. Even worse, some commuters are honestly thinking of giving up their jobs, while others are even being told by their bosses that it might be better to leave.</p>
	<p pid="a.454.1/2">Let me give just a flavour of some of the remarks that have been made to me over the past month. One commuter said:</p>
	<p pid="a.454.1/3" class="indent">&quot;I have been commuting from Didcot for nearly 20 years&mdash;I have never been so angry that I have been forced to complain to my MP&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.454.1/4">Another commented:</p>
	<p pid="a.454.1/5" class="indent">&quot;It feels as though commuters are being punished/taxed for using the railways&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.454.1/6">Another said:</p>
	<p pid="a.454.1/7" class="indent">&quot;It pains me to send an email to you for the first time in my ten year commuting career. The first two weeks of 2007 have been so appalling that I feel compelled to write to you&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.454.1/8">And so the comments go on.</p>
	<p pid="a.454.1/9">Let me describe a typical week in the life of a commuter from Didcot. On Monday, the 7.19 was cancelled, the 7.30&mdash;the new train that First Great Western had trumpeted&mdash;was cancelled, the 7.36 was delayed until 7.54 and so it goes on. I came into the office yesterday to find a dozen e-mails from people who had seen the new 7:30 train, which was supposed to help my constituents, come into Didcot, slow down and then carry on without stopping. That was apparently because of driver diagram error, which is a new one on me. First Great Western has been fatally damaged by this chaos, and commuters now refer to it as Last Great Western or Forever Getting Worse. I suspect that there are plenty of other names, but they may be too rude for a family audience such as the one that we have with us today.</p>
	<p pid="a.454.1/10">As I said at the beginning, I hope that hon. Members will indulge me while I briefly make some points on behalf of hon. Members who cannot be here. My right hon. Friend the Member for Witney wrote to me to say:</p>
	<p pid="a.454.1/11" class="indent">&quot;It is clear that the punctuality of the service has deteriorated, and overcrowding has reached unacceptable levels.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.454.1/12">Perhaps the Minister can confirm in his reply that serious efforts will be made in the short term to achieve a marked improvement in First Great Western's performance along the Cotswold line and that there is a real prospect of redoubling the line in the medium term.</p>
	<p pid="a.454.1/13">The hon. Member for Reading, West, who, as I said earlier, was optimistic about the First Great Western franchise, wrote to the chief executive to say that she had</p>
	<p pid="a.454.1/14" class="indent">&quot;lost the confidence of myself and the travelling public&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.454.1/15">In his letter, he raises many of the complaints that I have raised, but he also refers specifically to his concern that late-night trains no longer stop at Reading. The last train stops there at 10.30, and there has also been a reduction in the number of fast and semi-fast trains serving Tilehurst, Reading and Pangbourne.</p>
	<p pid="a.454.1/16">In her note to me, the hon. Member for Slough highlighted similar issues&mdash;a reduction in service, overcrowding and worsening reliability. She says that local firms are suffering and quotes many of the e-mails from her constituents, who use phrases such as</p>
	<p pid="a.454.1/17" class="indent">&quot;I am nearly at breaking point&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.454.1/18">She concludes by saying that</p>
	<p pid="a.454.1/19" class="indent">&quot;people are paying more to get less&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.454.1/20">Let me return to my specific concerns about Didcot. At a time when Didcot has been designated a growth point in the south-east, when thousands of new houses are planned for Didcot and nearby Grove and when the Government say that they are committed to public transport and to getting people out of their cars, the present situation is completely and totally unacceptable. I repeat: the situation is completely and totally unacceptable, and it must be sorted out.</p>
	<p pid="a.454.1/21">The great difficulty, of course, is that each side blames the other. Not to put too fine a point on it&mdash;I hope that I am not telling tales out of school&mdash;First Great Western blames the Government. It wrote to me, saying:</p>
	<p pid="a.454.1/22" class="indent">&quot;the new timetable was based on the timetable specified in the Greater Western franchise bid...any timetable has to meet both Network Rail and Department for Transport specifications&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.454.1/23">The Government responded on <phrase class="date" code="">2 November</phrase>. They wrote to me, saying:</p>
	<p pid="a.454.1/24" class="indent">&quot;In relation to the timetable due to commence this December...I consider a reasonable balance has been struck in the level and structure of provision of train services from Didcot Parkway&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.454.1/25">If I were in a mischievous mood, I would put those words on a large billboard outside the Didcot Parkway station, but I would probably be responsible for starting a riot, so I will not.</p>
	<p pid="a.454.1/26">In all my negotiations with First Great Western and my attempts to bring colleagues from all parties together to meet the company and sort the situation out, I have tried to avoid partisanship. However, the more I look into the situation, the more concerned I am about the effect of the Railways Act 2005, which gave the Government the power to set the timetable. Some of the current problems are the result of botched nationalisation, rather than botched privatisation, which is often the charge that Ministers make against any Conservative who takes issue with the state of the railways. I should remind hon. Members, however, that the Government have been in charge of the privatised railways five times longer than the previous Conservative Government.</p>
	<p pid="a.454.1/27">In the past few days, the <i>Evening Standard</i> has run an important campaign on the issue. It has focused mainly on overcrowding, but it could have focused on a host of other issues, although there would have been no room in the newspaper for any other news. I was particularly taken by an article in yesterday's edition by Christian Wolmar, the well-known transport journalist. He says, I am afraid, that</p>
	<p pid="a.454.1/28" class="indent">&quot;most of the blame lies squarely with the Department for Transport and its ministers, who have been attempting to micro-manage the contract from 100 miles away...the buck stops with the Transport Secretary&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.454.1/29">Having had my partisan outing, I want to look ahead to see what can be done to solve the problems for my constituents and those of the dozens of hon. Members present. First, the Minister must accept responsibility for the way in which the franchise was tendered. Transport 2000, the well-known transport lobbying group, told me:</p>
	<p pid="a.454.1/30" class="indent">&quot;the Government imposed a timetable and train leasing framework which involved fewer trains&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.454.1/31">I hope that the Minister notes the use of the word &quot;imposed&quot;. It is plainly silly for the Department to try to micro-manage such franchises, because they only end up taking the blame.</p>
	<p pid="a.454.1/32">It is also bizarre that the specification of the timetable is kept confidential for commercial reasons when it is put out to tender. Presumably, all the train companies tendering for the specification see it, so there could be no issue of commercial confidentiality between them. It would be extremely helpful if members of the travelling public, most of whom know a great deal about the railway that they use every day, had a chance to see the tender and comment on how realistic it was.</p>
	<p pid="a.454.1/33">What needs to change? First, obviously, I would like more train services. I would like to go back to the timetable before December 2006; it was not perfect, but people knew and understood it. I do not know whether, in asking for that, I am asking the Minister to wave a magic wand, but my commuters want that timetable. Secondly, the Minister must answer the charge that 32 rail carriages have been withdrawn from service at the Department's behest. We want those carriages put back into service.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-01-24a.459.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1787" speakername="Sandra Gidley" colnum="459"  time="009:57:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070124/halltext/70124h0002.htm#07012467000597">
	<p pid="a.459.2/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1905" name="Edward Vaizey">the hon. Member for Wantage (Mr. Vaizey)</phrase> on securing the debate. I too applied for a debate on the subject and was unlucky, but the number of hon. Members here today demonstrates the strength of feeling. I thought that I had a large postbag, but clearly problems with the First Great Western franchise are much greater elsewhere.</p>
	<p pid="a.459.2/2">The tale is one of unremitting misery. In my constituency First Great Western took over the old Wessex Trains franchise, which broadly covers the journey from Southampton to Bristol and sometimes Cardiff via Bath and Salisbury. The first sign of problems, as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1755" name="Andrew Smith">the right hon. Member for Oxford, East (Mr. Smith)</phrase> hinted, was the draft timetable. At that stage the timetable was drawn up so that if one were a commuter living in a village who worked either in Salisbury or Southampton it would be necessary to get up at 6 o'clock in the morning to catch a very early train from Dean, Dunbridge or Mottisfont. It would also be necessary to stay at work for quite a long time, because, depending on where the person lived and worked, they might not be able to get back until 7 in the evening. Understandably many people were rather unhappy at being forced to stay at their workplace longer than necessary. However, the problem was worse than that because the times of trains from the villages to Salisbury, which were relied on by quite a few schoolchildren, were changed such that they would all arrive at school late.</p>
	<p pid="a.459.2/3">Those concerns were raised with the Minister's predecessor and the timetable was improved slightly, but I had the feeling then that the train franchise company had proposed the worst possible scenario, so that any small improvement could be regarded as evidence of the company listening. I do not like to think that it was that cynical. Clearly we still have a substandard service, although it is better than the one that was originally proposed. The big problem is the number of peak-time trains that were cut. Although the overall reduction in seats is only about 20 per cent., there is a 50 per cent. to 60 per cent. reduction at peak times, which is causing great problems.</p>
	<p pid="a.459.2/4">Also raised with the Minister at that time were concerns that the trains in the reduced service were to be reduced from three carriages to two. That seemed particularly perverse because, only a few years before, Wessex Trains had received permission to put on extra carriages because of the demand on the line. Again, we are not learning from the lessons of the past when designing new franchises. I support entirely the call for the draft timetable to be available for public scrutiny.</p>
	<p pid="a.459.2/5">The public have reacted in droves. I want to give other hon. Members the chance to speak, so I shall simply highlight what is happening by giving some typical quotes from my constituents. A few people have asked why the franchise was given to a company that admitted in writing that it did not have enough carriages to run the service. That is still the case after 12 months. Many people are concerned about fares. A number of people have been caught out by fare increases and the change in the fare structure. One constituent said:</p>
	<p pid="a.459.2/6" class="indent">&quot;On the first day that the service was run by First Great Western, my fare went up as they cancelled the 'super saver' ticket I had always used.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.459.2/7">Constituents also say that overcrowding is a problem. One said:</p>
	<p pid="a.459.2/8" class="indent">&quot;I have a photo of 60 people standing on a one-carriage train all the way to Bristol because the previous train had not turned up.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.459.2/9">Another problem with the franchise is its unreliability. Over the Christmas period in particular, a large number of trains were cancelled, simply did not arrive, or were terminated short of the expected destination.</p>
	<p pid="a.459.2/10">The changes to the timetable are somewhat perverse. Many of my constituents who travel from Romsey or Southampton to Cardiff sometimes have to change trains at Bristol Temple Meads. On some services, they no longer have seven minutes to change trains because the interval between the services has been changed to three minutes. I know that we are trying to encourage the public to be healthy, but one gentleman told me about an occasion when he had to make such a connection, saying:</p>
	<p pid="a.459.2/11" class="indent">&quot;I had to run down the stairs, under the tracks and up the other side to just make it as the doors closed. Anyone not fit would never have made it.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.459.2/12">Clearly, some common sense has to be used when the services are designed.</p>
	<p pid="a.459.2/13">Several hon. Members have mentioned the problems with maintenance and the lack of rolling stock, which is something of a mystery because there seem to be carriages available. There are quite a few sitting in warm storage&mdash;I do not quite understand what that means&mdash;at Eastleigh depot, waiting to be used. I gather that there are other carriages at other depots. It has been suggested that they have been put to one side because First Great Western is struggling to meet the repayment terms of the franchise. A huge amount of money was offered for that franchise, and many people thought that the Government were benefiting at the expense of the commuter. Sadly, that seems to have been the case.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-01-24a.467.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1391" speakername="Don Foster" colnum="467"  time="010:22:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070124/halltext/70124h0003.htm#07012467000609">
	<p pid="a.467.2/1">I do indeed, and I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for making that point.</p>
	<p pid="a.467.2/2">It may interest hon. Members to know what was written on the ticket handed out at the protest on Monday. The rail company was described as &quot;First Late Western&quot;. The class was described as &quot;cattle truck&quot;, the ticket type, &quot;standing only&quot;, the route, &quot;hell and back&quot;, and the price, &quot;up 12 per cent.&quot; In a sense, that sums up the issues of real concern to my constituents and others in the wider area. That protest, organised excellently by More Train, Less Strain, brought real concerns to the fore.</p>
	<p pid="a.467.2/3">People's concerns fall into four categories. They are concerned by the inadequacies of the timetable, which no longer meets the working patterns of many who wish to commute by rail. They are also concerned about the inadequacy of the number of carriages. We are told by First Great Western that it needs 94 carriages per day to operate the commuter services&mdash;what we used to know as the Wessex trains&mdash;and, indeed, until Monday, it did not have that full number running on any one day. We have been assured that we will get that full number, but as has already been pointed out, even if a full complement is run, fewer carriages are operating than used to. There is also the question of where those carriages come from&mdash;it is quite amazing simply to look at the signage on them.</p>
	<p pid="a.467.2/4">There are deep concerns about excessive delays and cancellations and at the height of all those concerns, ludicrous fare increases were imposed. The fare from Bath to London on the high-speed train is one of the highest priced train journeys per mile in the entire world. Many of my constituents have suffered in massively overcrowded carriages and many have not even been able to get on to the trains.</p>
	<p pid="a.467.2/5">We have heard about passengers, but in fairness, I should point out that many of the staff working for First Great Western are equally concerned about what has happened. A letter sent to my local paper by a ticket officer who, unsurprisingly, wanted to remain anonymous, read:</p>
	<p pid="a.467.2/6" class="indent">&quot;The person selling you your ticket is appalled at the price and embarrassed about the service.</p>
	<p pid="a.467.2/7" class="indent">We've voiced our opinions repeatedly, to no avail. We're on your side, so please, please, don't take it out on us.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.467.2/8">He went on to point out that no one gets admonished for arriving late at work at First Great Western because very few of those who now work there travel to work by train. Another anonymous letter was sent by a train driver, who wrote:</p>
	<p pid="a.467.2/9" class="indent">&quot;Like all the others at the moment, I am appalled at what is happening with the 'service' we are supposed to be providing for our customers... reduced services, lack of units, late running or just plain cancellations of services&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.467.2/10">The staff are appalled about the level of service as well.</p>
	<p pid="a.467.2/11">The Government must take some of the blame. Over a year ago, I wrote to them detailing my concerns about the planned new timetable, and I received a letter on <phrase class="date" code="">9 August</phrase> from the then Parliamentary Under-Secretary at the Department for Transport, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1609" name="Derek Twigg">the hon. Member for Halton (Derek Twigg)</phrase>, about Keynsham and Oldfield Park, and another letter on <phrase class="date" code="">13 September</phrase> relating to Freshford. I had written to him expressing concern about a reduction in the frequency of trains to those stations. I got a letter referring me to table 6.112 of the franchise stakeholder consultation. My attention was drawn to the fact that the table clearly states the intention to retain an hourly frequency at both stations, and that there would also be additional hourly calls, giving two trains an hour at the stations concerned during peak periods. Those promises from the Government were not delivered. Those trains do not exist and there are greater gaps at those stations than were promised.</p>
	<p pid="a.467.2/12">As I said earlier, rail services in the south-west are simply not fit for purpose, and the Government must take some of the blame for that. The hon. Member for Wantage is right to say that the buck passing has to stop. I join him and all hon. Members who have spoken in urging the Minister to agree to a meeting that will bring First Great Western, the Government and concerned Members of Parliament into one room, in which we will stay until we have sorted the matter out.</p>

	<p pid="a.471.0/1">Like so many other hon. Members before me, I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1905" name="Edward Vaizey">my hon. Friend the Member for Wantage (Mr. Vaizey)</phrase> not only on securing this debate, but on his eloquent advocacy on behalf of his constituents. That has been a feature of this debate&mdash;I was going to name all hon. Members who had spoken, but I have counted 17 contributions or interventions so far. That shows the strength of feeling about the franchise.</p>
	<p pid="a.471.0/2">We had two debates on the same subject in the Chamber last year, one initiated by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1787" name="Sandra Gidley">the hon. Member for Romsey (Sandra Gidley)</phrase> and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1881" name="Anthony Steen">the other by my hon. Friend the Member for Totnes (Mr. Steen)</phrase>. In March last year I visited <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1760" name="Alison Seabeck">the constituency of the hon. Member for Plymouth, Devonport (Alison Seabeck)</phrase> and other parts of the area to listen to the problems of local commuters and to discuss the issues with First Great Western management.</p>
	<p pid="a.471.0/3">What has happened has not been a surprise. This debate is important on two levels. First, the service that the train users receive from First Great Western, as operated by First Group, is not satisfactory. In fact, it is so far from satisfactory that it is, to use the currently immortal phrase, not fit for purpose. However, on another level the debate is clearly about some of the key problems of the rail industry, including how it is structured. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1743" name="Steve Webb">The hon. Member for Northavon (Steve Webb)</phrase> mentioned the length of franchises; other problems include the level of Government intervention and how the franchising is being tendered.</p>
	<p pid="a.471.0/4">Transport 2000, an independent group, has stated that rail use in the south-west and west has grown by 42 per cent. in the past decade. Yet it goes on to say that despite that categorical evidence of passenger demand, in December 2006 in the finalised timetable</p>
	<p pid="a.471.0/5" class="indent">&quot;the Department for Transport's rail group cut back rail services, taking away 32 rail carriages and with it thousands of rail passenger seats.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.471.0/6">During his excellent contribution, my hon. Friend the Member for Wantage said that people are extremely angry and are paying huge prices for an abominable service. He outlined the litany of performance failures. I can only say that on behalf of my constituents and myself, I am glad that I do not travel on the Didcot service. We talk about journey times decreasing; it seems extraordinary that there has been a 20-minute increase in the time that the service takes. That was cited by &quot;The Thunderer&quot; on Monday, the day of action. For those who do not read <i>The Times</i>, I should explain that &quot;The Thunderer&quot; is a columnist who on Monday pointed out the problems not only of delays, but of overcrowding. He specifically mentioned Oldfield Park station, where commuters had difficulty getting on the train. That underlines the consensus of feeling, which is evident not only from hon. Members here today and from &quot;The Thunderer&quot; in <i>The Times</i>. Gerry Doherty of the Transport Salaried Staffs' Association union said on Monday, the day of the strike:</p>
	<p pid="a.471.0/7" class="indent">&quot;Passengers have had enough of paying sky-high prices for appalling services&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.471.0/8">This debate has shown a clear consensus: First Great Western is not providing the service that it should. Inevitably, as predicted by Members in their letters to the Minister and by Transport 2000 and others, we are seeing overcrowding and transference away from trains across the whole area. The service being provided is in direct contrast to the needs of the commuting public and the long-distance traveller.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-01-24a.473.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1927" speakername="Stephen Hammond" colnum="473"  time="010:38:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070124/halltext/70124h0004.htm#07012467000615">
	<p pid="a.473.0/1">I entirely agree with my hon. Friend. I am sure that the senior civil servant who said that standing was acceptable will be regretting his remarks. Rail commuters from Reading may well want to hold him up as one of the villains of the piece.</p>
	<p pid="a.473.0/2">I want to talk about long-distance as well as commuting issues, as considerable wider west and south-west needs are also involved. The corridor from the south coast to Bristol and Wales links some of the major urban settlements. Particular problems in Greater Bristol, Bath, Wiltshire and south Wales, and the line from London to the south-west peninsula, have been mentioned. The regional spatial strategy and regional economic strategy highlight those as areas of housing and economic growth. The timetabling for those areas has resulted in cuts in service, shorter and less frequent trains starting later in the morning, and longer dwell times&mdash;in complete contrast and opposition to the regional economic strategy.</p>
	<p pid="a.473.0/3">This debate has shown that the plight of all travellers using Great Western since the imposition of the new timetable is simply not acceptable. No one in the Chamber is an apologist for First Group, whose performance has remained inadequate and whose punctuality remains appalling. It needs to spend money&mdash;and not a little&mdash;on taking urgent action to clear its maintenance backlog. The issue is not only that the prescribed timetable took out some of the carriages, but the huge problem of maintenance. I hear what has been said about targets, but clearing that backlog would do a lot to increase punctuality, reliability and commuter satisfaction.</p>
	<p pid="a.473.0/4">First Group, in extensive negotiations with the Government, has restored one commuter service since December. It needs to restore more morning rush-hour trains and to increase the evening peak service. First Group will be listening to this debate; the message is that all those things should be done as a matter not of urgency, but of necessity.</p>
	<p pid="a.473.0/5">Several Members have said that they do not want to get too involved in the blame game. As I said, First Group needs to make substantial improvements. Given what the Minister has heard from across the Chamber, he must be in no doubt that Members are clear about why the service is so poor: the problems are due principally to the Department for Transport and the prescribed franchise that it imposed on First Group. Some understanding of whom should be mentioned in the blame game is important for understanding the problems not only on this part of the network, but on the network as a whole.</p>
	<p pid="a.473.0/6">It is true that the Government specified the First Group timetable that has reduced services and led to carriages being withdrawn, and that they extracted the premium from First Group that has forced fare increases. I am sure that the Minister will denounce rail privatisation, forgetting that his party has been in charge of the railways for 10 years and that usage has increased. He will remind us that he has had his brief for only four months and that the franchise re-letting took place before that.</p>
	<p pid="a.473.0/7">I have had the pleasure of sparring with the Minister on transport issues since he has come to the Front Bench and I know him to be one of the good guys. However, he is a representative of the Government, who cannot escape our criticism and questioning. Our debate has proved that the villains of the piece are not only First Group, but the Government.</p>
	<p pid="a.473.0/8">The Minister needs to answer a number of problems that underline not only the issues that have been highlighted today, but those for other franchises. How many civil servants in his Department are now writing timetables? How many timetables were included in the invitation to tender for the First Great Western franchise? Which franchise was chosen? Will he confirm that the Government minimum specification was involved, that the Government continue to use that process to deliver franchises, that the specified timetable reduced services and that the timetable specified the length of trains and the number of carriages to be used?</p>
	<p pid="a.473.0/9">Will the Minister also confirm that between <phrase class="date" code="">1 April</phrase> and <phrase class="date" code="">1 December</phrase> last year, when the finalised timetable was put forward, First Group made numerous representations to the Government, seeking to alter the timetable, and that First Group has gone beyond the minimum timetable specified? Does he agree with Transport 2000's comment in its publication &quot;Growing the Railways&quot; that the Government imposed a timetable and train leasing framework that involved fewer trains? Will he confirm that the timetable took 32 carriages out of service?</p>
	<p pid="a.473.0/10">As I said earlier, no one here wants to be an apologist for First Group; its performance and service are unacceptable. However, the Government wrote to my hon. Friend the Member for Wantage saying:</p>
	<p pid="a.473.0/11" class="indent">&quot;I consider a reasonable balance has been struck in the level and structure of provision of train services from Didcot Parkway.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.473.0/12">Given this debate, the Minister will surely want to recognise that that statement was at least a little early in the making. Will he reconsider it? This debate has highlighted First Great Western service issues and a number of issues in the railway system; overcrowding is easily recognised by my constituents on the South West Trains franchise from Raynes Park and Wimbledon. One of my constituents recently wrote to me about a 47 per cent. increase in fares on the Thameslink line. The Government's micromanagement of the railways is failing.</p>
	<p pid="a.473.0/13">Let us finish the debate in the same way as it has taken place, by accepting that there is blame on both parties. Even if the Minister cannot answer all my other questions, perhaps he will answer this one: having heard the speeches of the 15 to 20 hon. Members in the Chamber, will he guarantee to get the Members who have spoken on behalf of their constituents, the Department and the management of First Great Western into a room to rectify some of the timetable chaos and problems that result in human misery for the commuters who are the constituents of so many hon. Members here today? Will he agree to do that as a matter of urgency?</p>

	<p pid="a.475.1/1">I have seven minutes left to cover one and a half hours of intense debate. I hope that the hon. Lady, who has already made a speech, will forgive me but I do not want to give way. If I do that and do not get round everybody I could justifiably be criticised, and so I apologise.</p>
	<p pid="a.475.1/2">The hon. Member for Wantage described it as &quot;plainly silly&quot; for the Department for Transport to try to micromanage franchises. I totally agree with him, and that is why we do not. The hon. Member for Wimbledon asked how many civil servants are employed by the DFT to write timetables; he does not need to table a written question on that, because the answer is none.</p>

	<p pid="a.476.8/1">The railways are not nationalised; they are in the private sector. The railways are provided by the private sector as specified by the Government, and that is exactly the structure that will work in the long term. In response to his request for a summit meeting, given that First Great Western has now gone on the record to accept culpability for the disastrous performance of the past few weeks, I do not at the moment see a need for any kind of summit that involves First Great Western, local MPs and the Department for Transport. Of course, I shall keep that under review but given what First Great Western has said and what I have repeated, I am not sure why the hon. Gentleman wants to sit in my office and listen to Moir Lockhead say exactly the same as he is about to say publicly.</p>
	<p pid="a.476.8/2"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1755" name="Andrew Smith">My right hon. Friend the Member for Oxford, East (Mr. Smith)</phrase> asked that the Department's monitoring of the franchise should be made public. I reassure him that the public performance measure, which measures the performance of all the train operating companies in four-week sections over the year, is made public and published on the Network Rail website.</p>
	<p pid="a.476.8/3"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1787" name="Sandra Gidley">The hon. Member for Romsey (Sandra Gidley)</phrase> talked about the timetable and the minimum specification. Once again, she will be glad to know that the invitation to tender will be published shortly by the Department. She said that First Great Western cannot afford the premium payments. Once again, a myth is starting to spread throughout the industry about premium payments and their knock-on effect on the service. A number of years ago, the railway industry was a basket case and individual franchises would never have considered paying a premium to the DFT for the privilege of running services. Now we have private companies paying money back into the public purse, and I would have thought that she would have welcomed that. The fact is that there has never been a question mark over First Great Western's ability to pay the premium to which it is committed under the franchise. There is no question that that payment will not be made or that it cannot afford it.</p>
	<p pid="a.476.8/4"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1455" name="Kerry McCarthy">My hon. Friend the Member for Bristol, East (Kerry McCarthy)</phrase> talked about carriage shortages. She will be glad to know that First Great Western is about to issue an apology and explanation for what has happened on the railway. She asked about the additional units. I understand that First Great Western has provided additional units for the franchise from its TransPennine Express franchise. Although that was originally intended as a temporary measure, I am told that those units are there to stay, which will have a knock-on beneficial effect on the rest of the franchise.</p>
	<p pid="a.476.8/5"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1727" name="Richard Benyon">The hon. Member for Newbury (Mr. Benyon)</phrase> banged the drum of his party about prescribed timetables. He was disappointed, as was his hon. Friend the Member for Wimbledon, that we do not write timetables. He talked&mdash;and was absolutely correct&mdash;about the wider social impact on families. I understand the frustration of passengers using the franchise and sympathise with any family that have to suffer the inconvenience and stress of family members returning home from their journey so late that they cannot interact properly with their family. That has to be addressed and I hope that it will be addressed by First Great Western.</p>
	<p pid="a.476.8/6">The hon. Member for Newbury also talked about inflation-busting fares increases. The hon. Member for Wimbledon agreed that fare increases above inflation are unacceptable. In the minute that I have left, I want to plead with the hon. Gentleman as the spokesman for his party: is he saying that capacity can be increased by x amount and that we can reduce fares at the same time&mdash;</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-01-24a.478.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1801" speakername="Andrew George" colnum="478"  time="011:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070124/halltext/70124h0005.htm#07012467000631">
	<p pid="a.478.1/1">I am pleased to have secured this important debate on British arms exports.</p>
	<p pid="a.478.1/2">I visited Angola in the autumn of 2006 with a team from Chatham house. We were reflecting on the 30 years of civil war in that country. It caused mayhem and suppressed development there, and hundreds of thousands of people died or were maimed as a result. I asked the leader of Unita and the MPLA during that tour and as many other people as I could what that war was all about. No one was able to give a proper explanation for the conflict, yet it blighted the country for more than 30 years. We know that it was a proxy for the cold war, but it was fuelled by arms exports from this country and other western countries, who kept that conflict going for many a year.</p>
	<p pid="a.478.1/3">The issue is important because it centres on the fundamental integrity of this country. Our desire is to be perceived by the world as upholders of anti-corruption and anti-bribery practices. I want to concentrate on the question of arms exports. Debating time is necessarily limited today, so I have given the Minister notice of the sorts of questions that I would like to raise. I would have liked to have time to speak about export credit guarantees, the role of overseas subsidiaries, Britain's welcome commitment and promotion of the arms trade treaty, the role of arms brokers, the impact of the millennium development goals on selling arms to developing countries, and the impact of the Export Control Act 2002 and the need to update, embellish and extend it.</p>
	<p pid="a.478.1/4">Today we have an elephant in the room. It raises some serious questions about the Government's integrity. The Department of Trade and Industry is one of a number of Departments that needs to address the issues that I have raised with the Minister and which I said were pre-eminent in the list that I presented to his office earlier this week. They were the al-Yamamah deal&mdash;the Serious Fraud Office bribery investigation that was discontinued in December&mdash;and the investigation into the air traffic control contract in Tanzania.</p>
	<p pid="a.478.1/5"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1663" name="Roger Berry">The hon. Member for Kingswood (Roger Berry)</phrase> would like to contribute to the debate, and I want to give him some time; and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1736" name="Norman Lamb">my hon. Friend the Member for North Norfolk (Norman Lamb)</phrase> has indicated a wish to make a short contribution on the Tanzanian deal.</p>
	<p pid="a.478.1/6">I heard from the Minister's office last night that he cannot comment on the Tanzanian air traffic control contract because the SFO investigation is still under way. I believe that he could still comment on some of the background issues without prejudicing the investigation, especially on which Ministers supported that deal and which objected when the contract was agreed. However, the message from the Minister's office went on to say that, for similar reasons, he could not comment on the Saudi Arabian al-Yamamah deal.</p>
	<p pid="a.478.1/7">I beg to differ. After all, the investigation was discontinued on <phrase class="date" code="">14 December</phrase> last year. The DTI must recognise, as the City clearly does, that upholding the United Kingdom's desire to be recognised internationally for integrity and for our anti-corruption stance is paramount. Attempting to hide from the issue or to sweep it under the carpet is not acceptable. The Minister should relish the opportunity to demonstrate to Parliament and to the outside world the integrity of the Government's approach.</p>
	<p pid="a.478.1/8">My noble Friend Lord Garden received a letter from the Attorney-General about the al-Yamamah deal, giving the background to the case. The letter stated:</p>
	<p pid="a.478.1/9" class="indent">&quot;I should make clear that commercial considerations played no part in the SFO decision. Rather it was based on potential damage to the UK's counter-terrorism strategy, and ultimately on the risk to the lives of our citizens and service people if the case had gone ahead. The judgment was that UK co-operation with Saudi Arabia in the counter-terrorism field is of crucial importance&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.478.1/10">I would be grateful if the Minister were to make clear what national security was at stake.</p>
	<p pid="a.478.1/11">What evidence is there to confirm that the head of the SIS and MI6, Sir John Scarlett, endorsed the proposal to discontinue that investigation? Will the Government publish the explanation that they gave the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development in respect of the decision to halt the investigation? How do the Government square that decision with their anti-bribery laws and their commitment to the OECD anti-corruption convention? Does the Minister accept that, in respect of bribery and corruption, it is as important to be seen to uphold standards and pre-declared commitments as it is to uphold them? What damage would be done if the Government reversed their decision? On what grounds will the Government justify the discontinuation of the al-Yamamah bribery investigation in their report to the OECD in March?</p>
	<p pid="a.478.1/12">Is it not the case that Britain's involvement in the arms trade makes it a bigger target for terrorist attacks? Given that al-Qaeda's stated objective is the elimination of the House of Saud, selling arms to Saudi Arabia is most likely to provoke the kind of terrorist attack that the Government claim they seek to avoid.</p>
	<p pid="a.478.1/13">The Attorney-General's letter to Lord Garden went on to say that</p>
	<p pid="a.478.1/14" class="indent">&quot;Saudi Arabia is a source of valuable streams of intelligence on Al Qa'ida and other terrorist activity which may represent a threat to the UK, our citizens in the UK at home and abroad and to our Armed Forces; and that if Saudi Arabia were to withdraw that co-operation, the UK would be deprived of a key partner in our global counter-terrorist strategy.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.478.1/15">I question the plausibility of that claim.</p>
	<p pid="a.478.1/16">It is incumbent on the Government to explain why Saudi Arabia would not wish to co-operate with the UK. Irrespective of arms or commercial dealings between the two countries, why on earth would they not want to co-operate? It is in our dual interests to ensure that that co-operation on intelligence continues. It is churlish and ridiculous to argue that, because an investigation might uncover fraud and bribery, Saudi Arabia would not wish to co-operate with the United Kingdom for its own national benefit. I seriously question that decision.</p>
	<p pid="a.478.1/17">The Attorney-General's letter continued:</p>
	<p pid="a.478.1/18" class="indent">&quot;I did not consider that it was ever likely to result in a successful prosecution anyway.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.478.1/19">On how many occasions have the Government discontinued such an investigation on the basis of what they consider to be the public interest&mdash;before the investigation has been completed? Some serious questions clearly need to be answered. The Government diminish themselves&mdash;and worse the country&mdash;and damage their reputation as an upholder of standards and a champion of anti-corruption. A parliamentary answer provided for me on <phrase class="date" code="">9 March</phrase> by the Minister for Climate Change and the Environment, who was the Minister for Trade at the time, states that export credit guarantees</p>
	<p pid="a.478.1/20" class="indent">&quot;have been issued to BAE Systems and its subsidiaries in the last five years for the Al Yamamah contracts in Saudi Arabia.&quot;&mdash;[<i>Official Report</i>, <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-09">9 March 2006</phrase>; Vol. 443, c. 1722W.]</p>
	<p pid="a.478.1/21">I am told that the total amount of insurance given through the scheme is &pound;1 billion for that deal. Will the Minister tell us what financial commitments were made by the taxpayer for that contract and what public funds have been invested in that project? In addition, how much money invested to provide guarantees to the project has been recovered by the Government and how much is outstanding? There are serious questions to be raised about this issue.</p>
	<p pid="a.478.1/22">In conclusion, I remind the Minister that on <phrase class="date" code="">9 December</phrase> the Minister for Trade in the Foreign and Commonwealth Office stated at a meeting in Jordan that</p>
	<p pid="a.478.1/23" class="indent">&quot;it was fitting that on the eve of this conference...Governments serious about fighting corruption now have an opportunity to sit down with one another and agree how we can work to reduce the corruption that undermines economic development, limit spending on health and education and hits the poorest people hardest&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.478.1/24">At the same time, the Secretary of State for International Development said in a Government press release:</p>
	<p pid="a.478.1/25" class="indent">&quot;Tackling corruption wherever we find it&mdash;whether here or abroad&mdash;is essential. We will not tolerate those who extort, corrupt and deceive.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.478.1/26">I noted that yesterday the Director of Public Prosecutions, Sir Ken Macdonald, said when speaking to the Criminal Bar Association:</p>
	<p pid="a.478.1/27" class="indent">&quot;It is critical that we understand that this new form of terrorism carries another more subtle, perhaps equally pernicious, risk. Because it might encourage a fear-driven and inappropriate response. By that I mean it can tempt us to abandon our values. I think it important to understand that this is one of its primary purposes.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.478.1/28">I would be grateful if the Minister would address my questions and reflect on whether the circumstances in which the decision to discontinue the investigation of the al-Yamamah deal was made have, in fact, compromised the values of this country.</p>

	<p pid="a.481.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1801" name="Andrew George">my hon. Friend the Member for St. Ives (Andrew George)</phrase> on securing this important debate and I endorse everything that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1663" name="Roger Berry">the hon. Member for Kingswood (Roger Berry)</phrase> has said. I will concentrate on the Tanzanian air traffic control system. Irrespective of the outcome of the investigation by the Serious Fraud Office into the deal, the granting of an export licence for this military air traffic control system is an absolute scandal. I regarded it as such at the time and I continue to be of that view. To be clear, we are talking about selling a military air traffic control system for $40 million to one of the most heavily indebted countries in the world&mdash;a country that does not have an air force worth having a name. At the time, there was no justification for the deal. The British Government and the Prime Minister knew that that was the case and yet they sanctioned granting an export licence. It is a stain on this country's reputation that that deal was permitted.</p>
	<p pid="a.481.0/2">I will focus on one particular aspect of the deal, which so far has not received much attention: the financing of it. As I have said, the deal was worth $40 million. Tanzania had to obtain approval from the International Monetary Fund to borrow the money because it was a heavily indebted country. To get approval from the IMF, it had to demonstrate that it was a concessional loan. Barclays Bank provided Tanzania with a concessional loan and so, in effect, part of the loan was a grant by Barclays to a heavily indebted country. That does not make sense. Commercial banks do not make such concessional loans so why did Barclays Bank? I asked Barclays many times when I was investigating the issue back in 2001-02, but answers were not provided. The spotlight needs to be on Barclays Bank, as well as on BEA Systems and the Government's role in the deal.</p>
	<p pid="a.481.0/3">I end by saying that the Tanzanians are now fighting back and want answers to these questions. I have a letter from the Consortium of Concerned Tanzanians International, in which they ask rather a basic question:</p>
	<p pid="a.481.0/4" class="indent">&quot;How does a military radar that watches over one third of the nation help us defeat AIDS, improve our educational system and create more jobs for our young people?...The deal was not only wrong, it was unethical and indeed immoral&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.481.0/5">The Minister said that he cannot answer questions about that. I do not understand that as it is not sub judice. There are no legal proceedings as it is an investigation. I hope that in this debate or in writing he will be able to provide some answers.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-01-24a.487.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1744" speakername="Ian Gibson" colnum="487"  time="014:31:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070124/halltext/70124h0006.htm#07012467000653">
	<p pid="a.487.1/1">My hon. Friend has also had a mouthful of acid in his time, or alkaline. I welcome the fact that many of us, in our professional lives, have been through the process of doing things in different ways and saying, &quot;Gosh, why didn't we do that?&quot;, &quot;How did that idea come about?&quot; and &quot;Why didn't we develop that?&quot; The world is like that, and we should welcome and encourage such activity. No one mouths pipettes any more; there are now good instruments to suck things up accurately without the need for that. People may wonder why that was not possible before, and there is a real issue about how we get innovation into our world.</p>
	<p pid="a.487.1/2">New challenges arise. My right hon. Friend the Prime Minister has said in relation to information technology and computers that we need new ways of doing things, so that there is interaction between Departments&mdash;so that the press of a button suddenly acknowledges the fact that people have similar problems and they can interact and make things happen that did not happen before. We are encouraging new technology in that respect and making that happen. My hon. Friend the Minister and the rest of us will acknowledge how very difficult it is to make it happen. We want to ensure that the environment and the circumstances are right, so that we can interchange such information.</p>
	<p pid="a.487.1/3">The health service provides an example. I have had reports and I am very grateful to the many people who have put ideas to me about health services and whether we are innovating to the extent that we should be. An organisation representing the pharmaceutical industry has said, &quot;We're not really up to what they do in America.&quot; There are criticisms, under the surface, of doing things better. I think that, in relation to innovation, we always have to admit that there might be another way of doing it and we ought to encourage people or individuals to think about that. I shall talk about the processes involved in how it might happen.</p>
	<p pid="a.487.1/4">I am also very grateful to the Design Society, which says, &quot;It's great to have new products, but why do we not think of design at the same time?&quot; It says, &quot;It's great having a wine glass that's a certain shape, but how do we design that shape.&quot; It is not just a question of functionality or of having something that we can put something in&mdash;things have to look good too. The process is a matter not just of designing the product, but of designing it well, and I shall talk later about countries such as Finland, which have taken up that major issue. I am grateful to the Design Society for saying what it has.</p>
	<p pid="a.487.1/5">I am also grateful to the Royal Society of Chemistry for saying that innovation is important in its world. Indeed, it has produced documents to show the interaction that takes place not only in Britain&mdash;I shall talk in a second about who interacts in this country&mdash;but across Europe and the world. The excitement of chemistry&mdash;whatever the science involved&mdash;and of developing new products in the light of what people do or do not know is important. That is all part of the innovatory process.</p>
	<p pid="a.487.1/6">I have combed the DTI website, and it really is hard work to get through the initiatives that the Department employs to handle some of the problems. Before I come to that, however, let me say that, underlying all this innovation, is the post-neoclassical endogenous growth theory. Hon. Members may not instinctively understand the connection, so let me explain it briefly&mdash;besides talking about the Norwich football team, the Economic Secretary to the Treasury and I spend hours discussing post-neoclassical endogenous growth theory at Carrow Road football ground.</p>
	<p pid="a.487.1/7">Speaking of the theory, Michael Heseltine, who was a right hon. Member of this House at one time, said:</p>
	<p pid="a.487.1/8" class="indent">&quot;It's not Brown's. It's Balls.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.487.1/9">Hon. Members will remember that clever quote. The theory, which took over from neoclassical theory, was an attempt to engage with the origin of growth and ideas and to see how we could make the economy grow. It required that policies had a long-run growth rate in the economy and did not engage aggregate savings. It saw subsidies for research and development and for education increasing the growth rate in an endogenous way by&mdash;this is the main point for our debate&mdash;increasing the incentive to innovate. That amazing idea, which linked those areas with the economy, is now pervasive in the Treasury.</p>
	<p pid="a.487.1/10">Of course, there are many critics of that theory. One of its failings is that it does not explain non-convergence and why some countries are much richer than others. Exogenous growth theory explains the income divergence between the developing and developed worlds, but post-neoclassical endogenous growth theory has still not come to terms with that divergence. However, that is a bit beyond the scope of this debate, although it is fine for Oxford, Cambridge and other places to debate it. I simply make the point that innovation is all part of the theory, and we should remember that when serious politicians talk about innovation.</p>
	<p pid="a.487.1/11">I am very interested in the DTI's point of view because it has published much serious work on this issue. I have been reading its work&mdash;letter by letter, page by page&mdash;since its 2003 report. I pay credit to those who produced that report, and some of them are probably surreptitiously in the room. They have seen that innovation is very much part of developing business and markets and that it provides the products. They have also seen that we need to invest in research and to have a knowledge-based economy. All those phrases fit together around the word &quot;innovation&quot;. I agree with the DTI that Britain is much more innovative than it is has ever been. The report shows how many graduates there are in different parts of the country and it makes it clear that university education plays into and encourages innovation, with university degrees promoting innovative, active enterprises.</p>
	<p pid="a.487.1/12">Of course, universities are supposed to interact with business, but there is a problem there. I have looked at the report, and elements of that interaction are beginning to take place. However, the academic people to whom I talk despise business; they believe that working with it amounts to getting their hands dirty and that they should not get involved with it. I am old enough to remember a culture in which Nobel prizes were the thing&mdash;indeed, they still are in many places&mdash;but there has been a sudden change in that culture. People are saying to themselves, &quot;Maybe this thing we are doing in the laboratory is marketable.&quot; That idea has suddenly taken hold among some people, but it is not pervasive enough. Many of us in the room have worked in laboratories, and we must have done something innovative every day of our lives when carrying out experimentation, collecting data and managing things. We did not write those things up in academic papers, but they were always clever little things. I remember people saying, &quot;That's a clever way to do it. Why did you think of that?&quot; and someone else saying, &quot;It just seemed natural.&quot; However, people did not think that such things were marketable and patentable or that what was going on would improve the process.</p>
	<p pid="a.487.1/13">Things are better now, however, and there are more patents; indeed, that is one way of measuring innovation, but it is not the only way. On this small island of ours, there are thousands of people doing smart things all the time in their jobs. I am talking not just about the academic elite, but about the financial quarter and the health service. People are not doing anything formal, but they are making a difference to how things are measured. However, they do not even know or care that they are being innovative, and that is the problem. The DTI is talking about innovation and is trying to measure it, but the problem is how we get to the reality to see what is happening out there and what people are doing.</p>

	<p pid="a.491.3/1">Yes, that has worried me. It has always happened, actually, that research councils have included business people on those panels. It worries me in relation to the interaction between those people and the more pure academics and their research. I am describing a world in which opinion diverges as to what is important. If that is also reflected in the relevant committee it does UK plc and the development of innovation no good. I shall say something about the training of young people, and the science plan, in a moment.</p>
	<p pid="a.491.3/2">The DTI report, with all the pie charts, does not just deal with science and technology, but goes into the creative industries as well. There is a report by the National Endowment for Science, Technology and the Arts showing clearly that on this small island we underestimate the true innovation that happens in hospitals and health, in design and in the creative industries. Those creative industries are advertising, architecture, the art and antiques markets, leisure software, publishing software, computer games, films and video&mdash;and I could go on. There is more innovation than we know about in those industries, and I challenge the DTI on whether it knows about it, and on what it is doing about it. I may have revolutionary things to say about how we can change the DTI to bring out some of the ideas. As in the case of the Home Office, there may be too many functions in one big building down the road. We may need to take that on.</p>
	<p pid="a.491.3/3">We can consider why some businesses, as the report states, do not innovate. I know people who do not know their regional development agency and do not care. They do not think that they have to innovate, because &quot;we are doing all right&quot;: the profits are up, and so on. That is how they measure success. That is not success. In this competitive world businesses must keep moving, or things will crowd in on them.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-01-24a.492.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1744" speakername="Ian Gibson" colnum="492"  time="014:31:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070124/halltext/70124h0007.htm#07012467000663">
	<p pid="a.492.1/1">As someone who has spent a lot of time trying to teach people ideas, I should say that the best ideas have in many ways always come spontaneously. What is necessary is to set up an environment, not just in universities and institutions, but in schools, so that young people can say, &quot;Let me do this; let me try to find out about this,&quot; and suddenly there is the explosion of an idea. I am not sure that it is possible to structure that in the same way as is relevant to other kinds of success.</p>
	<p pid="a.492.1/2">This island has produced so many good people. I was at a Scottish night&mdash;and shall be at another one tonight&mdash;where the Scots always talk about Simpson, who invented chloroform, and about Kirkpatrick Macmillan and the bicycle, and so on. How did all those inventions and ideas come about? The environment might have been dominated by poverty and might have been excited by a grant from a research council&mdash;although there were no research councils in those days; but we can never know how we get bright ideas to emerge. We need to create the environment and encourage them. My major criticism of school teaching is that young people are not allowed, in the sciences, technology and engineering, to do experimentation. There is a point where someone knows how to find out about things and test them, and how, when a bad result is produced, to try again and learn from it, perhaps getting a good result. We all have experience of seeing people trying and trying again, to explain what happens.</p>
	<p pid="a.492.1/3">I take my hat off to such people as David Attenborough for his series &quot;Blue Planet&quot; and other work. We hear the simplistic view that it is only about the natural world, and is not real science. However, he has excited a generation to ask questions such as &quot;Why do wildebeest charge into a river full of crocodiles? What a mad thing to do; haven't they learned through evolution?&quot; We can think up explanations, but such things excite people and stimulate their imagination. If that does not happen we do not have civilisation. That is what is lacking in much of our training in schools.</p>
	<p pid="a.492.1/4">Cambridge university can run entrepreneurship courses, but in the end does it stultify real creativity? I am not sure. I am very aware of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology-Cambridge course that would involve people from MIT working with people in Cambridge; it was going to be wonderful, with great ideas and innovation. I do not know how that works, really. There has been a rough passage for the administration, but nothing has really emerged from it. That is the point. Innovation does not just happen tomorrow. It is an environment that is created, so that results emerge over a period of time. I remember the discovery of DNA, published in a simple little paper. Gosh, what a discovery that model was&mdash;published in a paper that I should probably have thrown out if I had reviewed it, because there were not enough data; it was an idea. Nevertheless, it really excited people to do other experiments.</p>
	<p pid="a.492.1/5">The DTI, and the way in which it accepts science and technology, is important. We have a very important plan. I was so excited about the ten-year plan, for the years 2004 to 2014. It was a real move forward. We have all studied it and we all welcome it, but we want to make it happen, because if it does not, we shall fail. We must take the science and technology part of the innovation process seriously. I have said something about what we can do about education. It is appalling that many of our brightest young brains will not go into science and technology because of terrible contracts and because there is no future or encouragement for them. We would say that that is not true, and that they will get more money as PhDs. However, that is not how they feel. They do not see that world as a welcoming place in which to use their creativity and brains. The scientific world is not about Isaac Newton any more, or people with money; it is about young people who get married and want mortgages. We must engage with that to make sure that they are excited. They are excited by science, and are enthusiastic, but we must make things happen.</p>
	<p pid="a.492.1/6">We need a strong supply of scientists, engineers and technologists; that is explicit in the plan. How do we make it happen? If we do not make it happen soon, we shall lose out. It is not just a question of the current generation. We are brilliant at science. We do very well, winning our Nobel prizes and all that. However, we must keep the next generation, who are coming up fast, in the game. It does not help when we close chemistry and physics departments, because&mdash;the Royal Society of Chemistry has been very active in this respect&mdash;it is necessary to understand how to make chemistry and physics part of the innovatory process. Chemistry is valuable not just for its own sake; it is part of developing a culture, society and civilisation, and an industry that can compete with the best of the world. I am never sure whether we are really in the shadow of the United States&mdash;perhaps the figures show that we are&mdash;but some of the Americans' ideas have come out of collaboration with people in Britain. We need much more of that kind of interaction.</p>
	<p pid="a.492.1/7">We have talked about research and development, in relation to the DTI document, how we have increased it, our ambitions for it in terms of gross domestic product percentage and how we are making that happen. We must continue to do that, but we have to think about which industries we are talking about. Is it only science-based industry or any industry? How do we make that kind of thing really happen? Do industries talk together?</p>
	<p pid="a.492.1/8">We have talked about universities and business. There is a huge culture gap between university and businesses. We still have a culture, although not 100 per cent., of failing to make that interaction happen. People will say that there have been spin-off companies in Oxford and Cambridge and so on. There are thousands of chemistry and other students out there who have great ideas that could be taken up in the right environment and developed into some new product, if that is how we measure these things, or some new way of doing things.</p>
	<p pid="a.492.1/9">The NESTA document, which is quite revolutionary in some ways, has clearly shown that we measure innovation in funny ways. We measure it in a pipeline way about research and development and pharmaceutical companies. Other companies innovate all the time&mdash;indeed, we all do. If the US ambassador thinks he innovates, I am sure that people here innovate in the way in which they handle their finances. The financial sector innovates all the time. We can argue about whether it is advantageous for people like us, but they are always changing things and looking for new ways of doing things.</p>
	<p pid="a.492.1/10">There are interesting ideas in design and architecture. Our way of measuring innovation varies from one industry to another. I have a whole list of ways in which it is measured. The success of science in Britain used to be measured by the number of spin-off companies we had, and we sat back and said, &quot;Wow, aren't we doing well?&quot; That is just one way of measuring. Another issue to consider is whether those spin-off companies carry on. Do they become big companies or do they just fall? Is it a couple of guys at Cambridge who met in a pub and had a good idea about injecting someone in a certain way with a new drug and then that is the end of it&mdash;they make a million and retire to the south of France? That is innovation, but not continuous innovation. It does not stimulate other things.</p>
	<p pid="a.492.1/11">There are other ways in which people can measure innovation, such as through the market share, brand value and customer satisfaction. It varies between sectors. It is no use saying that something has grown by 15 per cent. if the world market on which it competes has grown by 60 per cent., because that means that we are still behind in the game.</p>
	<p pid="a.492.1/12">Many people are still researching this field. I know a lot of them and it can go on for ever. Somewhere it has to stop. They talk about knowledge spilling over from one organisation to another, and do I know it in Norwich. We have several networks there that are trying to shape the Norfolk future&mdash;and, wow, does it excite me when I go to their meetings! There is not much innovation there; it is all about playing administrative games. There is a Norfolk network of young people that is much more imaginative, but that cannot make things happen because local regional development agency money is not there for them.</p>
	<p pid="a.492.1/13">RDAs have scientific committees, but some of them are appalling. I have had a running battle with the one in East Anglia about wanting to call Norwich a science city. It wants to know why I want to call Norwich a science city. It has three major research centres, a university with five departments, C-Red and the Tyndall centre on climate change, and science schools. The agency told me that there is no use in having a science city because there is no money in it. When I asked, &quot;What do you mean, no money in it?&quot; it replied that it does not get any money from the DTI or Government. But that is not the point. As Nottingham and York have found out, the point is that people will work together. It is about young scientists in schools who want to do science interacting with industries, universities and structures. It is about building up a complex.</p>
	<p pid="a.492.1/14">I once asked Sir David King what he thought a science city was and he said, &quot;Oh you just stick a notice up and say this is a science city.&quot; I said, &quot;Yes, but you've got to build something behind that as well.&quot; People are basically interested in science, technology and engineering and want to make things happen. We have to use every device. Calling Norwich a science city will not cost a penny but it will bring together people from different areas.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-01-24a.497.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1578" speakername="Ian Taylor" colnum="497"  time="015:13:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070124/halltext/70124h0008.htm#07012467000670">
	<p pid="a.497.2/1">Thank you, Mr. Atkinson. I shall obey your ruling.</p>
	<p pid="a.497.2/2">First, I welcome the Minister to his position&mdash;particularly because he is a Member of the House of Commons. Although I much admired his predecessor, he sat in the other House, which meant that debates in this House on science or space were less well informed. I am sure that they will no longer be like that.</p>
	<p pid="a.497.2/3">I shall provide the Minister with one memory from when I was Minister for Science and Technology at the Department of Trade and Industry. I was about to give a speech at the university of Durham, but the vice-chancellor misread the agenda and announced the speech that the person after me was to make on catalysis and its impact on industry. I could not remember what I knew about catalysis and its impact on industry, so after pausing for breath and thought, I said, &quot;I'm from the DTI and I'm here to help,&quot; and someone in the audience said, &quot;That's an innovation.&quot; Early on in my ministerial career, I learned what innovation was.</p>
	<p pid="a.497.2/4">I largely agree with <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1744" name="Ian Gibson">the hon. Member for Norwich, North (Dr. Gibson)</phrase>, although at Coventry City football matches we do not discuss endogenous growth theory. It obviously means that among my local support, I am less elevated than the hon. Gentleman.</p>
	<p pid="a.497.2/5">Let me focus. First, the international challenge is no longer about outsourcing, but about the knowledge economy that is obviously growing in countries such as India and China in particular, although other Asian countries are catching up rapidly. The battle is not only to produce engineers and scientists of quality, but to make the UK an attractive place for them to work. We must attract them to this country.</p>
	<p pid="a.497.2/6">Secondly, we must change the culture in this country so that it is much more receptive to those people who make the knowledge economy possible. One bizarre characteristic of this country is that we love new gadgets and applications and we want instant solutions to complex problems, but we do not admire as heroes the people who make it possible&mdash;the engineers and the scientists. We must therefore have people with skills in this country.</p>
	<p pid="a.497.2/7">I do not have time to go into the problems in education, but the Prime Minister admitted in a speech in November that the Government have not succeeded in securing the right scientific output from schools. That is a serious problem&mdash;the present Government did not create it, but they face it&mdash;which has a knock-on effect for universities: they do not have the right mix of people. We must work out how to encourage more young people to study science, engineering and computational subjects, including mathematics.</p>
	<p pid="a.497.2/8">My third point, which the hon. Gentleman picked up, is that in this country, the people who admire scientists tend to admire them because they work in blue-skies areas and make discoveries. The problem is that we do not have the same esteem for people who turn a discovery into an application. The Minister must consider the research assessment exercise and work out how a bibliometric approach that values publications and citations can be adjusted to value departments with a good track record of turning a discovery into an application. Such work is usually multidisciplinary, taking place not only within one institution, but between different institutions.</p>
	<p pid="a.497.2/9">I have been doing some thinking for the Conservative party, which is not a contradiction in terms, despite the fact that in our last election manifesto, we did not mention science. That was our mistake, and we are now doing some serious thinking. My hon. Friend the shadow Chancellor said in an article in <i>The Daily Telegraph</i> on <phrase class="date" code="">22 November</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="a.497.2/10" class="indent">&quot;We are broadening our approach to boost innovation, encourage science&quot;,</p>
	<p pid="a.497.2/11">as part of remaking our economic policy. Hooray! It is in the national interest that we all take an interest in those subjects.</p>
	<p pid="a.497.2/12">My committee has made two proposals. First, we should use smart public procurement, which the hon. Gentleman mentioned. The figure for Government purchases is about &pound;150 billion, against an Office of Science and Innovation budget of &pound;3.4 billion. We should also use set-aside, which the Americans use, so that small and medium-sized companies benefit from Government procurement.</p>
	<p pid="a.497.2/13">Our second idea is for an innovative projects agency. I was delighted when, on <phrase class="date" code="">30 November</phrase>, the <i>Financial Times </i>said:</p>
	<p pid="a.497.2/14" class="indent">&quot;It has been one of the big ideas of 2006... the re-emergence of serious thinking about research and innovation in the Tory party&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.497.2/15">The reality is simple. Many of the things that the hon. Gentleman mentioned and those in the Department's documentation are so spread out that they do not make a collective impact. Many are based on a linear approach to knowledge transfer, which is not appropriate for most of this country's industries, excluding perhaps the pharmaceutical industry. Another problem is that the hon. Gentleman and the Department push at the supply side, whereas I want to emphasise demand pull.</p>
	<p pid="a.497.2/16">We have suggested the innovative projects agency, which would have a budget of &pound;1 billion taken from existing sources, so I am not promising vast sums of new money. When one looks at the figures, it is interesting to consider the regional development agencies, for which I do not have a high regard. I think we could do a lot better: perhaps the best people from the RDAs could work with the innovative projects agency. The RDAs have several hundred million pounds that could go towards the agency's budget. Some of the DTI's activities could be transferred to it, and the technology strategy board, which has a budget of &pound;178 million, would be absorbed, too.</p>
	<p pid="a.497.2/17">Those are key ideas that would help people in this country to collaborate to ensure that ideas are taken from discovery to application&mdash;obviously, that application would be commercial. I am enthused by those ideas, and I hope that the excitement resulting from a big initiative that we propose would permeate society more widely. It is essential that British people see that scientists and engineers can provide solutions that help to improve quality of life. That would be a great innovation in itself and it is one of the challenges that we all face.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-01-24a.501.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1756" speakername="Evan Harris" colnum="501"  time="015:31:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070124/halltext/70124h0009.htm#07012467000673">
	<p pid="a.501.0/1">I shall start my remarks, which must perforce be brief, by welcoming the Minister to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1578" name="Ian Taylor">his new portfolio, as the hon. Member for Esher and Walton (Mr. Taylor)</phrase> did. This is the first time that I have seen the Minister in the Chamber with his new portfolio. From the point of view of the Science and Technology Committee, I also welcome the fact that he has agreed to continue the tradition of his predecessor in having a question time four times a year. That was an innovation of his predecessor, who is in the House of Lords, and the Minister's decision is to be welcomed. I would not say that it was a brave decision, because we are very nice, but it was open and engaged of him to do that. I am sure that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1617" name="Phil Willis">my hon. Friend the Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough (Mr. Willis)</phrase>, who is the new Chairman of the Committee, shares that view.</p>
	<p pid="a.501.0/2">I should like to thank the former Chairman of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1744" name="Ian Gibson">the Committee, the hon. Member for Norwich, North (Dr. Gibson)</phrase>, for giving us the opportunity to debate this issue. It is hard to do justice to a big subject in 40 minutes, as he showed, let alone in the 20 minutes or 10 minutes that we have. Nevertheless, many of the key issues have been touched on in the debate. We also had the fascinating image of wildebeest leaving the Mara and surging into a river. I am not sure exactly how that image came into the hon. Gentleman's speech, but it has stayed with me.</p>
	<p pid="a.501.0/3">The hon. Gentleman raised a number of important issues, including the importance of improving links between business and universities. The Government commissioned a report on that. The 10-year strategy and the &quot;Next steps&quot; report asked specific questions of researchers and the science community. The response of that community was published in September. It listed a number of responses and a number of positive suggestions, which the Government have said they will take forward. We look forward to the next &quot;Next steps&quot; report, as it were, to take the issue forward.</p>
	<p pid="a.501.0/4">The hon. Gentleman mentioned that there might be something in the water in this country that makes us a little more risk averse. He also suggested that there was something in the education or culture. The issue is a particular problem. There is no doubt that there must be levers that the Government can use to give us the spirit of entrepreneurship and risk-taking that the US has, as I think the Government recognise. There is nothing in our genes that makes us unwilling to go down that path, so it is to be welcomed that the Government are seeking, as far as they can, to find ways of addressing that.</p>
	<p pid="a.501.0/5">I hope that the Government will accept that it is not clear that there is sufficient evidence that the R and D tax credit is working sufficiently&mdash;it is not that it is not working&mdash;to encourage more risk-taking by business. It is also not clear whether the research assessment exercise inhibits people in universities and in basic science from taking risks, as my hon. Friend the Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough said in discussion with the hon. Member for Norwich, North. If we are to make progress towards the Government's target of 2.5 per cent. of GDP going into R and D&mdash;a target that is well below the Lisbon fantasy figure in any case&mdash;we have to ask whether R and D tax credits, among other policies, are working in their current form. I should be interested if the Minister could clarify what research is being conducted into whether they can be used more effectively.</p>
	<p pid="a.501.0/6">The hon. Gentleman also talked about the need to have adequate numbers of physics and chemistry departments. That is an issue on which the Committee, under his chairmanship and the new chairmanship, has made recommendations, to ensure that we do not lose capacity in certain regions because of the closure of departments.</p>
	<p pid="a.501.0/7">The hon. Member for Esher and Walton, in a well-thought-out, albeit perforce brief contribution, pointed out the role of smart public procurement. We would all agree that something must be done to use that huge budget to encourage innovation, and to provide support for small and medium-sized enterprises, not just for the big fish. What is emerging from his work for the Conservative party is new and valuable thinking. It is reasonable to say that the Opposition parties have not, until recently, kept up with the pace on policies coming out of the Department of Trade and Industry in respect of science, and we need to do that.</p>
	<p pid="a.501.0/8">In the little time available to them, the hon. Members for Brighton, Kemptown (Dr. Turner) and for Bolton, South-East (Dr. Iddon) brought their vast experience to bear. They gave local examples of what can be done, but it is unfortunate that we do not have more time.</p>
	<p pid="a.501.0/9">In the brief time left to me, I want to make three points about how we can focus on innovation. We need to focus on innovation without a threat being made to basic science, as my hon. Friend the Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough said. That can be done not by withdrawing funds from basic science, but by removing barriers to innovation, so that the research councils can, as they have said they will do, spend small amounts of money&mdash;not grant-sized amounts&mdash;on training people who receive grants in innovation and entrepreneurship. We can arrange a proper career structure for those academics who need to spend a lot of time drawing up business plans, to ensure that they do not lose out. We can also find ways of either reducing the risk that has to be taken or cushioning it through laws relating to those who have had a financial lack of success in the past. Finally, we can provide a positive climate.</p>
	<p pid="a.501.0/10">I do not think that it is appropriate for the research councils to set targets for spending on translational research. Indeed, that was discussed at the Committee's sitting this morning with Sir David Cooksey, and I had an exchange with the Minister and Keith O'Nions on the issue. In a desperate attempt to meet those targets, there will inevitably be pressure not to think, but just to transfer money from other budgets to translational research budgets, so we should avoid such targets.</p>
	<p pid="a.501.0/11">We have to think about capacity. As the hon. Member for Norwich, North mentioned, we have to have a supply of scientists to start with. We face a vicious circle of not enough people studying physics and chemistry at university or going into teaching as specialists, and therefore not enough people encouraging others to study physics and chemistry at university. It is no good the Government's citing increases of a quarter in the number of science undergraduates since 1997, when we know that there has been no such increase in the core hard sciences. If we strip away information and communications technology and the softer science courses, such as forensic science, we do not see that increase. I hope that the Minister will recognise that the true figures are not what we thought they would be.</p>
	<p pid="a.501.0/12">Another factor is that we must secure the right climate for innovation and science. It is important to take on the forces of anti-science, so that people and businesses are not worried about going down the science path, based on their past experience of how the country as a whole responded to the possibilities offered by genetically modified food and crops, which I considered unfortunate. In a speech in my constituency, the Prime Minister said:</p>
	<p pid="a.501.0/13" class="indent">&quot;The anti-science brigade threatens our progress and our prosperity. We need political and science leadership that stands up to them.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.501.0/14">He also said:</p>
	<p pid="a.501.0/15" class="indent">&quot;Government must show leadership and courage in standing up for science and rejecting an irrational public debate around it.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.501.0/16">He went on to say that</p>
	<p pid="a.501.0/17" class="indent">&quot;in many instances, a powerful and vocal lobby, with access to all the media channels and an interest in polarising the argument, frames the debate.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.501.0/18">The Prime Minister also mentioned the success of Government policy in stem cells. After that speech, everyone was struck by the fact that the Department of Health produced its White Paper on stem cells, which effectively called for a ban on some stem cell research lines that might lead to therapies later on, but without giving good reason. The Committee is conducting an inquiry on the issue, but it does not work for the Prime Minister to say all the right things&mdash;I endorse everything that he said&mdash;but then to cave in to an anti-science lobby, or at least not to give reasons why the Government will not support such research.</p>
	<p pid="a.501.0/19">There is not enough time to mention some of the other things that need to be said, but I urge the House to look at the Science and Technology Committee report &quot;Research Council Support for Knowledge Transfer&quot; and the thoughtful Government response, which set out many of the issues that the hon. Member for Norwich, North would have wanted us to consider in great detail. I thank him again for introducing this debate and look forward to hearing the Minister's response.</p>

	<p pid="a.504.0/1">It is a pleasure to take part in this debate. I join o<phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1744" name="Ian Gibson">thers in congratulating the hon. Member for Norwich, North (Dr. Gibson)</phrase> on introducing it, and doing so with his customary enthusiasm and passion. His wide-ranging speech addressed many of the issues that we need to think about.</p>
	<p pid="a.504.0/2">I also join others in welcoming the Minister to his new brief. He and I spent a lot of time working on energy issues together&mdash;well, not always working together, but certainly discussing them jointly. He won many admirers for his work as Minister for Energy; perhaps that is why the Prime Minister moved him. I hope that the Minister will bring the same commitment, energy and humour to his new brief. I am sure that he will, and that he will win as many admirers in his new role.</p>
	<p pid="a.504.0/3">This debate has made it absolutely clear how vital innovation is to our future prosperity as a country. Much of what is going on is working well, although we have to be wary of the increasing threats posed by other countries and work out how to maintain our competitive advantage. In fact, in many fields we are looking at how to close the productivity gap rather than how to maintain an advantage.</p>
	<p pid="a.504.0/4">Historically, it is fair to say that our record on science, development and innovation, under this and previous Governments, has been good. Many good initiatives have been undertaken; it is no accident that British research work and scientific papers are among the most cited in the world. However, that does not automatically lead to commercial success or mean that such innovation leads to the commercialisation of the new ideas in this country.</p>
	<p pid="a.504.0/5">All our lives, we have been aware that other countries have taken advantage of and got commercial benefit from great British inventions. We owe a great tribute to the British businesses that carry out such work. At the cutting edge of technology and innovation, British businesses still lead the world. A few weeks ago I was fortunate enough to visit the Rolls Royce factory in Derby. Rolls Royce is not just an engine company now; much of its innovation goes into its role as a service company. From a base station, it can monitor every single one of its engines in the sky. It knows whether something is going wrong well before the pilot, and that makes it one of the most successful companies in this country and globally.</p>
	<p pid="a.504.0/6">From the perspective of energy, we can see how a new need for green energy production has transformed the whole debate. Even big companies such as BP or Tesco want to get involved, see what they can do and innovate more. A range of people in universities, often working in conjunction with business, are putting their thought processes to work to see how they can generate the new source of energy that will make the difference.</p>
	<p pid="a.504.0/7">Business is absolutely in the lead on these issues. It is easy for us to think that it takes part because politicians have been urging it to do so, but at the motor show last year, the centrepiece of every single stand was a new hybrid or energy-efficient car. Five years ago, the same companies were thinking about what consumers and political leaders would want and were prepared to lead the investment on that.</p>
	<p pid="a.504.0/8">We need fresh thinking if we are going to maintain our lead&mdash;or, indeed, to close the gap with o<phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1578" name="Ian Taylor">ther countries. I commend my hon. Friend the Member for Esher and Walton (Mr. Taylor)</phrase> on his work. The great advantage of having a policy review is that a great expert in the field comes in with many new ideas and we benefit from a range of other people who would not normally be involved in Conservative party politics. We are seeking to work with my hon. Friend to generate the best ideas.</p>
	<p pid="a.504.0/9">Everywhere I go, people say, &quot;Of course, you'll never be as good as Ian Taylor.&quot; I recognise that, but it is wonderful to have him generating new ideas. He has previously given the example of the solar fridge, which could be fundamental in many developing countries, particularly Africa. If the Government used their purchasing power to carry that project through, rather than just giving it research grants, we could make a difference. If from their international aid budget, the Government placed a contract for, say, 10,000 such fridges, that would make a massive difference to whether production could become commercially feasible. I have also read with great fascination my hon. Friend's suggestions in respect of an innovative projects agency to see how we can use existing funds more efficiently and encourage cross-fertilisation and a more general enthusiasm for science, technology, engineering and mathematics.</p>
	<p pid="a.504.0/10">I agree with my hon. Friend across the board, particularly in what he said about the research assessment exercise. Too often, that focuses not on commercialising ideas but on generating them. It needs to change so that commercialisation becomes a more important part.</p>
	<p pid="a.504.0/11">The key to success is people. In this short debate, there has already been discussion on how we can encourage more people to study science and related subjects at university. I agree with <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1756" name="Evan Harris">the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon (Dr. Harris)</phrase> that the headline figures do not show what is happening. Psychology is certainly important, but if we want to compare like with like, we cannot include psychology graduates among science graduates. We should be concerned about the closure of chemistry, physics and, now, mathematics courses. We need to look at what the rest of the world is doing.</p>
	<p pid="a.504.0/12">I commend &quot;The World is Flat&quot; by Thomas Friedman to every Member; it should be read by every politician, media commentator and business man, because it is a salient call on what is going on in the world at the moment and the threats that we face. Friedman talks of meeting the mayor of Dalian, which is in China and where a lot of outreach work is done for Japan. The mayor told him that in that one city there are 22 universities with 200,000 students, more than half of whom graduate with an engineering or science degree. Even those who do not are directed to spend a year studying Japanese or English and computer science to make them employable. The purpose of that approach is not only to create a scientific community, but to benefit from the business gain that it will bring to that city and province. We need to do more to encourage an enthusiasm for science among our young people and dispel the myths that the work being done is boring, when it is often on the cutting edge of what is happening on our planet. We also need to dispel the myth that if they worked in the sector, they would be on low salaries.</p>
	<p pid="a.504.0/13">There must be a combination: if a company is to be encouraged to innovate, it must have access to the people and the right fiscal framework. It must believe that it will be truly rewarded for its work and that its environment will not be over-regulated. We need to address that issue. The forms that people have to fill out when they apply for a Government grant and support are too long and complicated. We need to focus on that and make it easier for them to do. That issue was also raised by the Society of British Aerospace Companies, which says that there must be a</p>
	<p pid="a.504.0/14" class="indent">&quot;full review of the administrative processes of the Technology Programme. This must lead to more consistent bidding arrangements, call content more applicable to the sector and monitoring that is cost effective and minimises the administrative burden on companies.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.504.0/15">The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development has also been helpful in putting forward things that we should be doing. It has called for the streamlining of fiscal measures to support R and D; as it says, there is still a potential overlap between R and D tax incentives and remaining grant schemes. It calls for the balance of direct funding for R and D between small and medium-sized enterprises and larger companies to be reconsidered to make sure that SMEs get their fair share as well. It says that there is scope to exploit the strength of the science base through further promoting university-business collaboration, on which many have focused this morning.</p>
	<p pid="a.504.0/16">If we had more time, we could focus on other issues&mdash;for example, the contribution that science centres make. I listened with interest to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1432" name="Brian Iddon">the hon. Member for Bolton, South-East (Dr. Iddon)</phrase> talk about Bolton TIC and its contribution to enthusing a new generation of young people about science. However, every single science centre faces budgetary cuts, and some face potential closure. I hope that the Minister will consider such issues and see what more can be done to support them.</p>
	<p pid="a.504.0/17">We should be considering, too, things such as the science week exhibition that we had in the House last year when many brilliant young scientists brought their work to show what they were doing and to talk about how they want to take it to market and to commercialise it. Many other schemes, such as Young Enterprise, will help young people to have the spirit of enterprise and innovation and to consider how the ideas that are generated can be made commercially feasible.</p>
	<p pid="a.504.0/18">This is an extremely exciting time for innovation in this country. The Government have aspects of it right, but if we are to continue with our dynamic approach, we need to address further issues, such as those that I have just outlined.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-01-24a.507.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1523" speakername="Malcolm Wicks" speakeroffice="The Minister for Science and Innovation"  colnum="507"  time="015:50:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070124/halltext/70124h0009.htm#07012467000675">
	<p pid="a.507.0/1">This is the second time today that I have been before you, Mr. Atkinson, although that phrase might suggest that I am in the role of defendant and that you are in the role of a stern magistrate. I do not think that I will pursue that route.</p>
	<p pid="a.507.0/2">I thank <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1913" name="Charles Hendry">the hon. Member for Wealden (Charles Hendry)</phrase> for his kind words, and I thank other hon. Members for their kind words, too. Long may they continue. I also congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1744" name="Ian Gibson">my hon. Friend the Member for Norwich, North (Dr. Gibson)</phrase> on securing this important debate, in which we have had a number of individual and distinguished contributions; there has not been a wildebeest in sight, intellectually. My hon. Friend shared with us&mdash;rightly or wrongly&mdash;the fact that he thought the subject through in his bath. It is a great privilege to be appearing before such a latter-day Archimedes on this occasion.</p>
	<p pid="a.507.0/3">Our policies on innovation aim to maintain and improve the United Kingdom as a knowledge economy by encouraging the successful exploitation of ideas. Maybe that is as good a definition of innovation as any can suggest. Many of those ideas will emanate from a science base, and many will have science-based solutions. It is worth noting that, as colleagues have conceded, not all innovation is about science. Wherever ideas come from, we regard it as a priority to create the opportunities for interaction between knowledge creators and innovators.</p>
	<p pid="a.507.0/4">As many Members present will know, the word &quot;science&quot; comes from the Latin word &quot;scientia&quot;&mdash;the pronunciation of the &quot;c&quot; depended on which side of the river one came from in those times&mdash;which means knowledge. That is a nice coincidence for us today, because in the United Kingdom we are trying to develop a knowledge economy&mdash;and therefore a knowledge society and a knowledge democracy, given some of the issues about society and science mentioned by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1756" name="Evan Harris">the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon (Dr. Harris)</phrase>. Globalisation means that we no longer expect to compete merely on price or to trade in traditional products alone. Indeed, more than 70 per cent. of the economy is in the service sectors. The UK is a truly modern global economy in prime position to take advantage of the opportunities presented. Innovation has contributed to our success in both manufacturing and services. We have open and free markets, we are global players and we stay competitive through innovation, hence the importance of the debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.507.0/5">Innovation is obviously important. Only this week a report from McKinsey considering why New York is losing its lead as a financial centre highlighted that London now has a more attractive legal and regulatory environment&mdash;an environment that enables innovation in financial products. Many of the challenges that we are discussing are challenges for the private sector, but there are challenges for other sectors, too, including our learned professions. The Royal Society of Chemistry is an example of a leading professional body that has now put innovation at its core through its mission statements.</p>
	<p pid="a.507.0/6">I want to focus on what the Government can do about all that to ensure that our economy remains competitive. I shall highlight some developments, almost by way of headlines, given the time that we have available. We are working across government to ensure that public sector procurement&mdash;my hon. Friend was looking for a figure, and it is worth more than &pound;125 billion a year&mdash;stimulates innovative solutions. The Financial Secretary to the Treasury announced yesterday a series of reforms to help promote technological innovation and innovation in public services. Given the size of the procurement budget, in that way alone the Government can drive innovation.</p>
	<p pid="a.507.0/7">A number of agencies play a role. We heard some critical comments about at least one regional development agency, but I believe that the RDAs' innovation policies are working to address challenges in commercialisation, knowledge transfer, the promotion of innovation, the creation of networks and improvements in skills. Science and industry councils have been set up in each region to guide RDA innovation spending. My hon. Friend paid tribute to the work in his region. Innovative businesses need intellectual property protection and clarity on standards and measurement. The DTI and its agencies provide that clarity and protection. Of course, we are considering the implications of the Gowers review of intellectual property.</p>
	<p pid="a.507.0/8">We are working with the Design Council, which is developing a network to improve supply and demand of creativity skills following the review of creativity by Sir George Cox. Design is crucial in terms of modern day products and competition. I look forward to learning more about the work of designers and the Design Council in the months to come. In December, the Leitch review identified the UK's optimal skills mix in 2020. We will be working with the Department for Education and Skills and the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, among others, to respond to that report.</p>
	<p pid="a.507.0/9">We are at the forefront of EU thinking on innovation policy. The research and development scoreboard and value added scoreboard produced by the DTI allow businesses to benchmark themselves against peers. They have also enabled us to dig down into the reasons why, for a predominantly service sector economy such as ours, simple research and development measures are not enough for good policy development.</p>
	<p pid="a.507.0/10">Knowledge transfer has been given a high profile since the Lambert review of business-university collaboration in 2003, the policy set out in the 10-year framework for science and innovation and the more recent updates of that framework. The business-led Technology Strategy Board is increasing the opportunities for business to exploit science and technology through collaborative research and developing the knowledge transfer networks. Of course, one is interested by the ideas that emanate from the distinguished review associated with the Conservative party. I shall not make quips about thinking in the Conservative party as an exciting piece of innovation that has started from the most unlikely sources; this has been a learned and distinguished debate, and it would be wrong to make any such quip.</p>
	<p pid="a.507.0/11">In July, the Technology Strategy Board will become a non-departmental public body, which will improve its ability to operate with flexibility. I shall give two examples of its work. By supporting the integrated wing programme, a pioneering programme led by Airbus UK, the board is putting Britain at the forefront of next-generation, greener, cost-effective aircraft design. By working with a UK-based consortium of companies developing in-body micro-generators that will convert energy from human body movement into power for implanted medical devices, including pacemakers, electrical stimulators, instrumented joints and body area network applications&mdash;an example of our technology being at the forefront&mdash;the board is contributing not only to wealth creation, but to the welfare of people around the world.</p>
	<p pid="a.507.0/12">Innovation platforms, which bring together business and government, are another important example of the work that is going on. Through the higher education innovation fund, the Government provide resources to all universities to increase knowledge transfer activity and business engagement. In addition to the oft-quoted growth in spin-out companies, HEIF has also led to a wider culture change in universities' innovation activity.</p>
	<p pid="a.507.0/13">I took careful note of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1578" name="Ian Taylor">the remarks made by the hon. Member for Esher and Walton (Mr. Taylor)</phrase> about the research assessment exercise. We have to get the balance right between the absolute emphasis on pure and basic research, blue skies thinking and the rest and the need to find measures to complement the well-accepted and traditional measures of academic excellence. This is not about one or the other, or about a conflict or a contest, but about searching for some complementary approach. That is important.</p>
	<p pid="a.507.0/14">Research and development tax credits got a mention. They are important, but we shall consider some of the new evidence on that issue. I listened with care to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1453" name="Desmond Turner">my hon. Friend the Member for Brighton, Kemptown (Dr. Turner)</phrase> and to his thoughts about innovation. Of course, the contribution of the Bolton TIC was also notable. Indeed, we are working with the DFES to introduce innovation and entrepreneurship training to the school curriculum, with pilots starting last week. This has been an important debate, and one that I have enjoyed.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-01-24a.510.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1531" speakername="Andrew Gwynne" colnum="510"  time="016:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070124/halltext/70124h0010.htm#07012467000678">
	<p pid="a.510.3/1">I do. One problem that I shall deal with later is the capacity problem of trains going to Manchester Piccadilly. I contend that if we transferred some of the local services from Piccadilly to Manchester Victoria, using the line through Denton and Reddish South, capacity to Manchester Piccadilly would be increased and there would be more scope for services from the south of England.</p>
	<p pid="a.510.3/2">In years gone by, passengers arriving at Manchester Piccadilly often had to get other mainline services from Victoria. Today, Piccadilly is the main inter-city station and Victoria serves mainly the local catchment area. However, in those days, people could use the Stockport to Stalybridge line and its branches to access services from the north or south without going into the city centre and then having to traipse to the other station. As patterns of travel have altered, and given that most services were linked into Piccadilly, so the number of people using the Stockport to Stalybridge line has dwindled. Even so, until 1991 the line served as a convenient link from Stockport in gaining access to trans-Pennine services at Stalybridge.</p>
	<p pid="a.510.3/3">Another factor led to the decline of Denton station&mdash;its location. Ironically, it is this station's location that today makes it attractive, but that was not the case until fairly recently, and I will explain why. Denton station is not located at the heart of the community. It is about a mile from Crown Point, Denton's town centre, and is bounded by industrial units, reservoir land and the M67 motorway, which was built in 1981 and which cuts right through the centre of the town.</p>
	<p pid="a.510.3/4">Immediately adjacent to the site is Denton roundabout, where the M67, the M60 Manchester orbital motorway and the A57, the main road into Manchester city centre, all meet. Denton station has no obvious catchment area or hinterland from which it can sustain a viable commuter service. However, all is not what it seems, and I shall explain why later. The other station, Reddish South, is completely the opposite. Despite its misleading name, it is located in the heart of Reddish district centre and is surrounded by shops and houses. It has a good catchment area, and given a decent service, it could easily have a viable future. There is also scope for a local park-and-ride facility at the station.</p>
	<p pid="a.510.3/5">In 1991 everything changed. Because of the dwindling number of passengers travelling from Stockport to Stalybridge, British Rail effectively closed the line and stations by declaring it to be parliamentary line. For the past 16 years, therefore, we have been blessed with just one train a week travelling in just one direction, with Reddish South and Denton stations being request-only stops. So pathetic is the service that one cannot get a return ticket from Stalybridge to Stockport. Indeed, only train enthusiasts ride on the now infamous &quot;ghost train&quot; service.</p>
	<p pid="a.510.3/6">The Minster must be asking why there has been such a fuss to save our stations. The answer, as I will show, is because a viable option is screaming at us that would cost very little to implement. One of the early decisions of this Labour Government, on coming to power in 1997, was to initiate extensive transport studies in parts of the country that were experiencing significant congestion problems. The aim of those studies was to consider the problem in the round and to develop an approach that was an argument not merely for more road building, but for developing public transport alongside other infrastructure projects in order to give people a viable alternative to the motor car.</p>
	<p pid="a.510.3/7">One of the studies commissioned by the Government was the south-east Manchester multi-modal study, or SEMMMS. Reddish and Denton are both covered by SEMMMS. When it comes to judging Network Rail's proposals for the closure of the two railway stations, I would argue that that should be done alongside the aims and objectives of SEMMMS, which in its 2001 report calls for the restoration of passenger services on that line to be considered.</p>
	<p pid="a.510.3/8">I return to Denton station. I might have given the Minister the idea that it has a poor location. Nothing could be further from the truth. I said that Denton Station lies adjacent to the junction of the M60, M67 and A57. SEMMMS identified that roundabout as being at junction capacity, with no scope to improve it without spending massive capital sums, and said that it was a major contributor to traffic congestion through Tameside. Today, we hear that Greater Manchester may introduce a congestion charge on the main routes into the city centre as part of its transport innovation fund submission. Undoubtedly, that would have to include the A57. If so, investment in the railway line and a park-and-ride option are crucial. Councillor Roger Jones, chairman of Greater Manchester passenger transport authority, is quoted in the local papers as saying:</p>
	<p pid="a.510.3/9" class="indent">&quot;We know people will use buses, trains and trams if they are reliable and affordable and I'm confident, given the right levels of investment, we can achieve this.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.510.3/10">I echo his view.</p>
	<p pid="a.510.3/11">Given that much traffic is heading into or away from Manchester at peak times, scope surely exists for a major strategic park-and-ride facility to be developed alongside that junction. There are two possible sites: the spare land next to the reservoirs, or spare capacity at the Sainsbury's superstore immediately to the south of the motorway junction with the A57. Indeed, use of private land for park-and-ride has already been pioneered by the Greater Manchester passenger transport executive at the Siemens site in south Manchester.</p>
	<p pid="a.510.3/12">Again, some brief background information might help. When retail planning permission was applied for in 1988, it was for a Sainsbury's store and a Children's World store, but the latter was never built. However, the car park was constructed as originally planned&mdash;for both stores&mdash;so even on the busiest trading days of the year it is at least one third empty. The car park could be linked to the station by creating a well-lit footpath, utilising a redundant rail bridge under the M67. I have not formally approached Sainsbury, but I believe it would be a real advantage to the company; not only it would utilise the spare capacity in the car park, but some of those who use the parking will go on to shop in the store or use the on-site petrol station.</p>
	<p pid="a.510.3/13">The real issue when arguing against the closures is that preserving the status quo or even increasing the number of trains to Stalybridge and providing a return option will not solve the problem. With the best will in the world, a large number of people from Stockport, Reddish and Denton do not wish or do not need to go to Stalybridge. The vast majority of traffic goes into Manchester and, to a lesser extent, into Stockport. That is where many of my constituents work or shop, and they frequently go there.</p>
	<p pid="a.510.3/14">What is the scope for a commuter service into Manchester using those routes? I would argue that it is very good, and that is what I have been calling for. It would be easy to have a local service running from Stockport along the Stalybridge line through Reddish South and Denton, where we could have a strategic park-and-ride for south-east Manchester. Just past Denton station is an existing rail link connecting the Stalybridge line with the existing Ashton to Manchester Victoria line. I think that it is known as the Crowthorne curve. Indeed, when engineering works take place on the line between Piccadilly and Stockport, that route is used to redirect passenger services into Victoria.</p>
	<p pid="a.510.3/15">Furthermore, as there is a major rail capacity problem at Piccadilly, which is not easy to resolve, and Virgin wishes to increase the number of trains on the west coast main line, it may be desirable for more local services to link into Victoria instead. One further benefit to that suggestion is that it would provide a sizeable section of south-east Manchester with an alternative to road travel. Reddish and Denton have poor public transport links, and given the considerable congestion identified by SEMMMS, a rail link into Manchester is more than just a convenience; it is a necessity. That is even more the case because it would serve a considerable catchment area, on which the proposed Metrolink big bang will not have the slightest impact. Those are the plans that I have put formally to Network Rail in private meetings and as part of the consultation exercise.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-01-24a.515.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1990" speakername="Tom Harris" speakeroffice="The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport"  colnum="515"  time="016:18:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070124/halltext/70124h0011.htm#07012467000684">
	<p pid="a.515.0/1">It is good to see you again after such a short time, Mr. Atkinson. I had imagined that I was the most regular attendee in this Chamber until I saw that you were here again.</p>
	<p pid="a.515.0/2">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1531" name="Andrew Gwynne">my hon. Friend the Member for Denton and Reddish (Andrew Gwynne)</phrase> on securing the debate and on the extremely powerful and thoughtful case he has made on behalf of his constituents. He has clearly given a great deal of thought to the subject and I commend him. I hope to be able in the short time available to me to respond to the points that have been raised.</p>
	<p pid="a.515.0/3">From the outset I should make it clear that no formal application for the closure of Reddish South and Denton stations has been made and that closure is only one of several options being considered for the future of the route. I can confirm, in response to one of his later points, that closure is not a forgone conclusion. As I will explain later, any application would have to meet strict criteria, and a view on whether these procedures should be brought into effect would initially be sought from the Secretary of State for Transport.</p>
	<p pid="a.515.0/4">As my hon. Friend has mentioned, Reddish South and Denton stations are currently served by one train a week, which runs on Saturday mornings from Stockport to Stalybridge. Until the early 1990s, the service was frequent, as it was used as the link to allow connections between the west coast main line inter-city services on to the services between Manchester Victoria and destinations across the Pennines in Yorkshire and to the east coast. The diversion of the services now known as TransPennine into Manchester Piccadilly provided a direct connection and therefore removed the prime need for the frequent service via Reddish South and Denton stations, as my hon. Friend is aware. Low passenger use from those intermediate stations at the time did not warrant the retention of a frequent service. I am informed, and my hon. Friend has confirmed this afternoon, that the current service is mainly patronised by railway enthusiasts&mdash;I do not mean that term in any pejorative sense. The minimal or parliamentary service was retained, as it was not considered appropriate to close the line at that time. We now need to consider the future of rail services as a whole in the north-west, and studies such as SEMMMS will be taken into account.</p>
	<p pid="a.515.0/5">Regional planning assessments for the north-east, north-west and west midlands have already been published, and assessments for the east midlands, Thames valley and south-west will follow soon. The whole country will be covered by the end of this year. Each assessment asks a simple but far-reaching question: over the next 20 years, what regional and economic development can we expect and how can the railway best respond and contribute to that? Using the RPAs, the Department is leading that process of forecasting and consulting to try to deliver a consensus not about whether to grow our railways, but about how best to do so.</p>
	<p pid="a.515.0/6">As part of its future planning process, Network Rail has been producing route utilisation strategies, or RUSs. Those set out Network Rail's strategies for the future of the railways in Britain area by area. The strategies are produced in a highly consultative and inclusive way, involving train and freight operators, passenger representatives, local authorities and others. As such, they should be considered a product not just of Network Rail, but of the whole railway industry.</p>
	<p pid="a.515.0/7">In general, the railway in the north-west is successful and many routes are busy. Punctuality improvements have led to passenger numbers increasing in recent years. The strategy therefore considers areas where growth in passenger demand may require increased capacity, with longer trains, more trains or an additional platform, at Manchester airport station, for example. Opportunities for improved interchange with the Manchester Metrolink system are also being considered.</p>
	<p pid="a.515.0/8">The consultation document for the north-west RUS was published in November 2006, with the consultation period running until <phrase class="date" code="2007-01-05">5 January</phrase> this year. The consultation document included several options for the route and recommended that Reddish South and Denton stations be closed. It also included options for diverting additional services along the route, but those would not call at intermediate stations. Stakeholders and other groups in the Denton and Reddish South area will have had an opportunity to comment on the Network Rail options during the consultation period. The responses to the north-west RUS consultation document will now be considered by Network Rail, and it is planned to introduce the RUS in April or May of this year. That is why the publication this year of our high-level output specification&mdash;that trips off the tongue very neatly&mdash;or HLOS and associated budgets and framework will be so important.</p>
	<p pid="a.515.0/9">Let me set that in context. Since the mid-1990s, passenger demand has risen at about 3 per cent. every year and freight demand has grown at a similar pace. Significant investment in rail has taken place, but that has not always been well managed or prioritised. The cost of the railway infrastructure escalated unacceptably under Railtrack, and we took action to stabilise that with the creation of Network Rail. The Government have taken charge of setting the strategy for the railway, while Network Rail has been given clear responsibility for operating the network and for performance. Track and train companies are being brought closer together.</p>
	<p pid="a.515.0/10">The rail strategy that we publish this summer will establish our long-term plan for the industry, but a plan is, of course, no good without the means to deliver it. That is why our strategy will be underpinned by the HLOS, which will set out the improvements in safety, reliability and, crucially, capacity that we wish to buy over the five years from 2009 to 2014. That will be accompanied by a five-year budget&mdash;the statement of funds available&mdash;and it will be consulted on. The Office of Rail Regulation will scrutinise the output specification to ensure that it can be fairly expected of Network Rail to deliver that within the funds made available.</p>
	<p pid="a.515.0/11">The Department for Transport will work with Network Rail and the train operators to ensure that changes to train services are procured at an affordable price at the right time. It will be the Government who decide what they wish to buy from the railways and the level of public sector funding that is available. Within that framework, the ORR will determine and price the outputs that Network Rail will be obliged to deliver, and we will make clear to everyone what railway expansion we seek to buy.</p>
	<p pid="a.515.0/12">Should any formal proposal be made for the withdrawal of services from Reddish South and Denton stations, the railway closure process as specified in the Railways Act 2005 will come into play. I shall explain how the process would work. Under the Act, closures can be proposed by a rail funding authority or a train or network operating company. The RFAs specified in the 2005 Act are the Secretary of State for Transport, Scottish Ministers, the National Assembly for Wales, the English passenger transport authorities and the Mayor of London.</p>
	<p pid="a.515.0/13">When a train or network operating company proposes a closure, a view on whether it should be brought into effect must be taken by the relevant national authority&mdash;either the Secretary of State or Scottish Ministers. Proposals by operators and RFAs require ratification by the ORR. In their considerations RFAs and operators will take into account a wide range of matters, some of which can be expressed in quantifiable value-for-money assessments. The closure guidance sets out an objective test that must be satisfied if closure is to be permitted. In brief, the test ensures that a closure cannot be pursued in England, Scotland or Wales if the benefit to cost ratio of retaining the service, station or network is 1.5 or more. Where the closure proposal comes from a train or network operating company in relation to a station or network, the operator must carry out an appraisal in accordance with the guidance before submitting it to the national authority, which will then evaluate the appraisal as part of its consideration of the proposal.</p>
	<p pid="a.515.0/14">Schedule 7 to the 2005 Act sets out the requirements on how a consultation about a closure proposal must be initiated, which I hope will give some comfort to my hon. Friend with regard to what may be planned for the stations in his constituency. The schedule also states that the consultation should be carried out in line with the closures guidance. When initiating a consultation, the 2005 Act requires: that a notice be published with details of the proposal for two successive weeks in a local newspaper circulating in the area affected by the closure and two national newspapers; that the notice sets out the date when it is proposed that the services in question are withdrawn or the network or station closed, as well as other details of the proposal and an address where the initial assessment following the closures guidance and a summary of the results of the assessment can be obtained, and the fees payable, if any, for a copy of the assessment and summary. There will be questions on this afterwards.</p>
	<p pid="a.515.0/15">The 2005 Act also requires that views on the proposal should be sent to the organisation carrying out the consultation by a date at least 12 weeks after the date of the second notice published in local and national newspapers, and that copies of the notice must also be published at stations affected by the proposal. The following organisations must be sent a copy of the notice and a summary of the results of the initial assessment: the relevant operator; the relevant national authority; the National Assembly for Wales, if the proposal affects Wales&mdash;which, of course, this one does not&mdash;the Mayor of London, if the proposal affects Greater London; every passenger transport executive whose area is affected; every local authority in whose area people might be affected; the Rail Passengers Council, more popularly known as Passenger Focus; all RFAs party to financial arrangements that may be affected by the proposal; all bodies providing railway services that are affected; all bodies providing station services affected by the proposal; and any organisation designated by the Secretary of State as representing the interests of passengers. It is clear that the closure process is very long. It intended to be that way so that consultation is maximised.</p>
	<p pid="a.515.0/16">To conclude, Network Rail has produced the route utilisation strategy for the north-west to set out its views on the future of rail services in the area. My hon. Friend should be assured that that does not constitute any formal proposal for the closure of Denton or Reddish South stations and, should a formal proposal be put forward, ample opportunity for consultation will be provided. Studies such as the south-east Manchester multi-modal study will be taken into account. Neither is the strategy an opening of the floodgates for network-wide closures. As a result of this debate, I am sure that Network Rail will appreciate the degree of concern about the matter, and consider carefully what my hon. Friend has said when assessing the results of their route utilisation strategy.</p>

	<p pid="a.521.0/1">I entirely agree with the sentiments that my hon. Friend has expressed. Would he support a parallel initiative to try to persuade the public sector to buy locally? I am thinking of local authorities, schools and local hospitals in Somerset, which ought to be buying Somerset produce. I am aware of EU directives for fairness in procurement, but I understand that there is latitude to allow local authorities to buy locally&mdash;to secure taste, freshness and other qualities&mdash;that would circumvent any legal restrictions. The people for whom those bodies would be buying produce would also be getting the best food in the world at competitive prices, so would my hon. Friend support that initiative?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-01-24a.521.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1451" speakername="Ian Liddell-Grainger" colnum="521"  time="016:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070124/halltext/70124h0012.htm#07012467000691">
	<p pid="a.521.1/1">I thank my right hon. Friend and agree with him absolutely. There are two parts to the question. The first, which I am sure the Minister has heard about, is about the ability of such bodies to do what they want or otherwise in Europe. There are little local schools in all our constituencies in Somerset, and little organisations up to the county and district level; yet it has always struck me as bizarre that when one asks them, as I have, where they source their food from, they do not know. One of the problems&mdash;this comes back to the word &quot;tiny&quot;&mdash;is that we are good at being able to buy bulk for schools, but we are unable to buy locally. The purchase managers of schools and other organisations are not able to think outside the famous box. I hope that the Minister will take on board the comments about Europe, because we need guidance on that. With the right wind, I am sure that the county councils and district councils can take the idea on board. I shall of course come on to Somerset county, as my right hon. Friend and the hon. Member for Taunton would both expect me to do.</p>
	<p pid="a.521.1/2">Others are beginning to learn. When this Adjournment debate was announced towards the end of last week, my phone got red hot. First, there was the Minister, clamouring to know which Government agency I was likely to attack in my speech&mdash;I am sorry to disappoint him, but there is nobody. Then came the lobbyists, and to date I have had every major supermarket chain bending my ear. Food pressure groups have done so, too. I have been quite surprised at the amount of lobbying, and the Minister knows that. Many people provided enormously useful information, some of which I shall include in my speech. It proved to me how slick and capable the food industry is at getting its message over, and how slack some agencies that should be helping food producers have become.</p>
	<p pid="a.521.1/3">Nobody called me from Somerset Food and Drink. It is supposed to be the local, premier focal point for anybody who wants to know anything about food production in the county of Somerset. Somerset Food and Drink is run by the county council, but I am afraid that it was a totally silent advocate. I did not get anything from the council, and it was well aware that the debate was taking place.</p>
	<p pid="a.521.1/4">On the other hand, Somerset Food Links, a non-profit-making company set up by South Somerset district council in the seat of the hon. Member for Yeovil was incredibly helpful; it had a very good website with up-to-date information, and it could not have been better at supplying the information that I required. I guess that that is not surprising: Somerset county council is ruled&mdash;dare I say it&mdash;by a bunch of Daleks who want to exterminate all five district councils and turn the county into a faceless unitary authority. It does not grasp the importance of local government, which has come to my aid, so how on earth can we expect it to understand the importance of local food or of saying &quot;buy locally&quot;? Daleks, after all, are constructed from upturned dustbins with sink plungers for arms. They cannot climb stairs, and nouvelle cuisine is somewhere beyond Gallifrey.</p>
	<p pid="a.521.1/5">Come to think of it, I also did not hear a squeak from the funded South West of England Development Agency. I am disappointed about that, considering that I had a meeting with its representatives recently. Its motto is to encourage enterprise and improve communications. It did not communicate with me and it did not seem desperately anxious to encourage anybody's enterprise. Even a little e-mail would have been nice, and welcome. I would have used it.</p>
	<p pid="a.521.1/6">The Minister will have come across Taste of the West. It is a limited company, but it has received funding from Europe, the Countryside Agency, which is now called English Nature, and Food from Britain. One way or the other, the Government have contributed. I am sad to report that apart from an approach by one of my own side, Taste of the West has not been in touch either, although I believe that the chairman or chief executive is ill, so that is understandable.</p>
	<p pid="a.521.1/7">Towards Devon and Cornwall, there is a bizarre bias that all producers in Somerset have suffered at one time or another. When I trawled through the published information, I found that the mentions of Somerset were limited and small. That is a grave pity, and it suggests that Somerset is not worthy of serious mention. All five Somerset Members of Parliament resent it, and we have taken on Avon as well as everyone else.</p>
	<p pid="a.521.1/8">My abiding concern is the same as my observations about Business Link. Nobody is able to think outside the box and laterally to increase the production and purchase of local food. Taste of the West always boasts about organising seminars. That is fantastic; no problem, it is great. However, if one struggles single-handedly to stack crates, make fresh medlar jam, cider, beer or anything else, one does not have time to go to Exeter, where the events are mainly held, to listen to a day's seminar. One is physically unable to do so.</p>
	<p pid="a.521.1/9">Taste of the West also gives awards. That is great&mdash;why not? It is good for morale. However, to qualify that point, if one looks at its website, one sees that the winners are predominantly paid-up members of Taste of the West. It is difficult to understand why one must pay a fee to enter a category to be presented with an award. Why cannot the organisation be made more open? The Minister has a say. Will he please ask it to make itself more accessible to all local producers? I am sure that his officials will have looked at the website and seen how many producers are on it. There are only 20 from Somerset, and they are concerned with meat and fish. That cannot be right. I know that there are more, and there are certainly more in my constituency.</p>
	<p pid="a.521.1/10">If the Minister says, &quot;Fine, what has this got to do with me?&quot;, the answer is that he has a considerable interest in the matter. Recently in Downing street, Taste of the West showed off its wares marvellously with David Fursdon from the Country Land and Business Association. Taste of the West is on good terms with the highest levels of the Government. It also seems to have psychic powers. As the Minister and I have discussed, I was told that it wanted to get in touch with me about my speech. My speech was sent to the Minister on the understanding that he could consider it and reply; I was concerned that it had appeared elsewhere and that I was being pursued. I suppose that I could call that a very locally and organically grown &quot;leek&quot;, and leave it at that.</p>
	<p pid="a.521.1/11">Local food in Somerset needs a huge dose of joined-up government. Most of the time, the spirit of free enterprise means that small producers tick over very nicely, thank you, because they make produce that people are prepared to go out of their way to buy.</p>

	<p pid="a.524.0/1">I am sure that the whole House would agree with <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1451" name="Ian Liddell-Grainger">the hon. Member for Bridgwater (Mr. Liddell-Grainger)</phrase> that locally produced food is of real importance. I strongly support for <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1869" name="Jeremy Browne">the remarks made by the hon. Member for Taunton (Mr. Browne)</phrase> when he talked about the importance of reducing food miles and ensuring minimal packaging and the capacity of local food to deliver those environmental benefits.</p>
	<p pid="a.524.0/2">At one point this afternoon, Mr. Atkinson, I thought that I might have to seek your guidance on how to decline tactfully the bribe of half a jam jar of mincemeat. Fortunately, that did not materialise although I believe that it is still in the possession of the hon. Member for Bridgwater. On a slightly more serious note, I wonder whether he might need to seek your guidance to declare his interest in Jill's jam.</p>
	<p pid="a.524.0/3">I shall focus on what the Government and others are doing to encourage the growth of the regional and local food sector both nationally and in the south-west, and particularly in Somerset. In doing so I hope to paint a less gloomy picture than the one described by the hon. Gentleman. If I want to set out the broader context in which our support is being delivered, I shall have to speak quickly, because only eight minutes of the debate remain.</p>
	<p pid="a.524.0/4">There has never been a time when food and how it is produced has been so high on the public agenda. That is generally perceived to be the case. Yes, our vision for food and farming is driven by economic goals, but it is driven by social and environmental goals, as well. The industry needs to be profitable in the marketplace and be based on skills, innovation, investment, branding and quality, not on the generosity of the taxpayer. The taxpayer has a role in promoting responsible food consumption, taking account of social, economic and environmental sustainability. Consumers want information to help them to make informed decisions, but producers have a key role to play and they will flourish by providing what customers want. One way for farmers to achieve that is through differentiation and reconnection with their consumers.</p>
	<p pid="a.524.0/5">Consumers continue to seek value for money, but that is no longer their only concern. They also want quality assurance and to buy products that reduce or minimise environmental impacts. Those are all opportunities that producers can now exploit. That is borne out by research conducted last year for a report commissioned by Food from Britain that showed that 65 per cent. of shoppers claim to buy local produce when purchasing food and drink. The top reason to buy local is freshness, which was chosen by 64 per cent. of consumers, with the next in the ranking being support for local producers, chosen by 31 per cent., and a concern for the environment, chosen by 25 per cent. Those are all pointers to why there has never been a better time to go into local food production, whether it is cheese making, cider brewing or jam making.</p>
	<p pid="a.524.0/6">Our sustainable food and farming strategy sets out our comprehensive long-term plan for the future development of the industry. The strategy identifies how the Government will work with the whole food chain to ensure a sustainable future for English farming and food. A range of different measures under the strategy is already in place and is contributing to strengthening the food chain at national level.</p>
	<p pid="a.524.0/7">Since 2000 we have awarded more than &pound;14 million in grants given under the agriculture development schemes, including awards to the English Farming and Food Partnership, the Food Chain Centre and the red meat, dairy and cereals industry forums to improve competitiveness. Our food industry sustainability strategy has been drawn up to help the sector to contribute to the UK's sustainability goal through its impact on producing healthy food and balanced diets, and on energy consumption, water use, waste generation and transportation. The larger-scale food processors and retailers have committed to the aims of the strategy. We are addressing the need to encourage greater efficiency in the UK food chain through our support for the Food Chain Centre; likewise, our support for English Farming and Food Partnerships seeks to increase co-operation between farmers and the rest of the food chain.</p>
	<p pid="a.524.0/8">Under our regional food strategy, we are providing &pound;1 million a year until 2008 to support the quality regional food sector in England. Our support under that strategy, which began in 2003, has given us the means to act decisively to support and encourage a flourishing regional food industry. I agree with the hon. Gentleman about the need to take a strategic approach to the promotion of regional foods and to ensure greater co-ordination between bodies with an interest in that work, but I hope to persuade him that the assistance available to such businesses is not quite as haphazard as he fears.</p>
	<p pid="a.524.0/9">In England, Food from Britain takes the lead in the delivery of a national programme of activities focused on trade development, raising consumer awareness and increasing business competitiveness. The type of activities included in the programme are: attendance at international and national food shows; meet-the-buyer activities involving multiple retailers; development of a guide to working with the food service sector for regional food producers; raising the profile of Britain as a food destination to tourists via a three-year marketing agreement between FFB and VisitBritain; producing a &quot;How to Export&quot; guide tailored to the needs of regional food and drink producers; working with the Institute of Grocery Distribution to produce a guide to distribution in order to help regional food producers overcome problems with supply chain logistics and learn about schemes throughout the country that have helped producers find new markets; and a pilot benchmarking programme with regional food producers in the south west.</p>
	<p pid="a.524.0/10">In turn, FFB works closely at regional level with the various English regional food groups who support the national programme. In the south west, the work is being carried out by Taste of the West, which was mentioned by the hon. Gentleman. I shall say more about its excellent work&mdash;but privately, afterwards, rather than rehearse it now.</p>
	<p pid="a.524.0/11">We are now into the fourth year of our programme of support, and it is worth highlighting the key outputs to date. More than 4,000 producers have been supported by the national programme of activity. Total sales generated to date&mdash;a key indicator&mdash;are worth about &pound;6 million, and they continue to grow. All that work is complemented at regional level by the regional development agencies, which encourage food hubs and shared distribution facilities and marketing. I am pleased to say that an independent economic evaluation of our regional food strategy carried out in 2005 concluded that Government intervention in the sector is justified and that the programme of support is tackling the market failures identified in the sector.</p>
	<p pid="a.524.0/12">On all that work, I understand that there is regular contact between Somerset Food Links and Taste of the West so that each knows what the other is doing. However, I shall pursue that point with the hon. Gentleman another time&mdash;perhaps over some samples of his regional produce.</p>
	<p pid="a.524.0/13">One of the first ports of call for a budding business is likely to be Business Link. I was sorry to hear that the hon. Gentleman's wife did not find the offer of assistance in setting up a website helpful. I understand that the offer was made by Connecting Somerset, whose role is to aid new and existing businesses in broadband, IT and web development. For small local food producers, many of which are based in rural areas, websites can offer a valuable and productive route to market. As the hon. Gentleman said, the role of Business Link is to help businesses flourish; it includes the provision of advice on regulatory requirements, sources of funding and marketing, as well as on e-commerce. Officials have spoken to Business Link Somerset, and I understand that its advisers would be pleased to speak to the hon. Gentleman's wife about the business support that they can give. I believe that I may have won my half a jar of mincemeat.</p>
	<p pid="a.524.0/14">One Business Link Somerset initiative of particular relevance to this debate is the specialist focus on helping female entrepreneurs, in response to research showing that women launching a business are not always given the same level of attention from banks and other more regular sources of support as their male counterparts. I understand that Business Link has organised a &quot;Women in Enterprise&quot; event on <phrase class="date" code="">27 February</phrase> at Bridgwater's Exchange, and I urge the hon. Gentleman's wife to find out more.</p>
	<p pid="a.524.0/15">I would also like to mention the rural enterprise gateway service provided through Business Link Somerset, which works on the basis of facilitated groups of land-based businesses working towards common aims. The service offers access to specialist advice, access to information from the knowledge base and access to training. Since 2005, 225 companies have been assisted through the gateway to improve their performance. Some of the Somerset groups benefiting from that initiative include the Somerset orchard group, Somerset farmers markets and the Somerset women's rural enterprise splinter group.</p>
	<p pid="a.524.0/16">Earlier, I highlighted the growing consumer interest in regional and local food, and I outlined how we are helping producers to adapt in order to meet that demand. However, I recognise the need for us and others to facilitate more local sourcing by providing funding to address issues such as distribution, marketing and the encouragement of new outlets.</p>
