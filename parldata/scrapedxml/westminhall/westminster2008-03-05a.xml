<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-03-05a.421.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1419" speakername="Roger Godsiff" colnum="421"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080305/halltext/80305h0001.htm#08030576000456">
	<p pid="a.421.2/1">It is always a pleasure to initiate a debate under your wise and experienced chairmanship, Mr. Benton. I am particularly pleased to have the opportunity to raise the issue of the way in which the mobile phone industry operates, its acquiescence to mobile phone retailers who offer unrealistic cashback offers, and the consequences for customers when retailers go into liquidation.</p>
	<p pid="a.421.2/2">I should first like to talk specifically about Dial a Mobile, which was an independent retailer of mobile phones in the Bordesley Green area of my constituency. It ceased business on <phrase class="date" code="2007-08-30">30 August 2007</phrase> with, it was subsequently revealed, debts of &pound;12 million and more than 90,000 customers who were connected through the company to the networks of the big five providers, Orange, T-Mobile, O2, Vodafone, and 3.</p>
	<p pid="a.421.2/3">Prior to being contacted by constituents who were affected by the collapse of Dial a Mobile, I confess that I did not know much about the mobile phone industry or how it operated. Like an ever-increasing number of people, I use a mobile phone, and I had a contract with an airtime provider, but I did not know how the cashback system operated, the relationship between the airtime provider and the retailers, or the powers of the regulator, Ofcom. Having spent several months dealing with issues arising from the collapse of Dial a Mobile, I now have a good knowledge of how the industry operates, and I find what I have learned extremely disconcerting.</p>
	<p pid="a.421.2/4">My concerns are not mine alone; they are shared by the European Union's communications commissioner, Viviane Reding, who has serious concerns about how the mobile phone industry operates, particularly in this country and, as she calls it, its cosy relationship with Ofcom. She is also&mdash;rightly&mdash;extremely concerned about the vulnerable position in which many customers find themselves when mobile phone retailers go into liquidation.</p>
	<p pid="a.421.2/5">I should explain that cashback is one of a range of incentives offered by mobile phone retailers to attract new customers or to poach customers from the network airtime providers&mdash;the big five to which I referred. In a highly competitive industry, the retailer is paid lucrative commission by the airtime provider for each new customer signed up for the provider's network. To entice customers to sign up, the retailer will offer part of its commission to the customer, which is payable, usually in stages, when the customer has been with the network for a certain period, in most cases 12 or 18 months. That sounds quite innocent; indeed, the customer could, in theory, have a sizeable amount of their contract payment reimbursed by the retailer.</p>
	<p pid="a.421.2/6">However, there is a catch, and it is a very big catch. The retailer in the mobile phone industry is under huge competitive pressure to offer bigger incentives to get customers to sign up to the network that pays the biggest commission. To retain business, therefore, the retailer will offer bigger cashback offers to the customer. Slowly, as happened with Dial a Mobile, a business model evolves whereby if more than four out of 10 new customers claim their cashback, the retailer loses money and goes bust.</p>
	<p pid="a.421.2/7">If a mobile phone retailer simply went into liquidation and could not honour its customers, and the contract&mdash;this is important&mdash;with the customer became null and void, it might not matter too much. It could be put down to the normal cut and thrust of business&mdash;some you win, some you lose. However, there is a clear difference in the mobile phone industry because of the way in which the system operates. To all intents and purposes, two contracts are involved. The contract that includes incentives such as cashback is between the retailer and the customer, but a network supplier insists on a contract with the customer when a customer hooks up to it. Also, as with Dial a Mobile, the network supplier disclaims responsibility for incentives such as cashback that are offered by the retailer. It insists that the customer pays the full amount to the network provider; otherwise, it will take legal action against the customer. That could, as is the case with many customers of Dial a Mobile in my constituency in east Birmingham, result in bailiffs being sent in and the customer getting an adverse credit rating.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-03-05a.423.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1419" speakername="Roger Godsiff" colnum="423"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080305/halltext/80305h0001.htm#08030576000460">
	<p pid="a.423.1/1">My hon. Friend, as always, makes an excellent point. The mobile network operators target the most vulnerable and disadvantaged. They also target people who think that there is such a thing as a free lunch&mdash;but those people then find out that there is no such thing as a free lunch but that a price tag is attached.</p>
	<p pid="a.423.1/2">As my hon. Friend said, many of the customers being pursued, such as those with Dial a Mobile, did not sign a contract with either the retailer or the airtime provider. However, the airtime providers say that once a customer has been linked by the retailer into their network, a contract exists. They expect full payment under that alleged contract&mdash;full stop, no argument.</p>
	<p pid="a.423.1/3">One would have expected Ofcom, the regulator, to have been aware of the problem before the end of 2007, when Dial a Mobile and several other retailers went into liquidation. Ofcom was indeed aware of the problem. On <phrase class="date" code="2007-07-31">31 July 2007</phrase>, it issued a press release stating:</p>
	<p pid="a.423.1/4" class="indent">&quot;Ofcom welcomes new code on mis-selling in mobile markets but warns of consequences of failure.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.423.1/5">It went on to say that the five mobile network operators had more than 66 million active customer accounts, and that Ofcom was receiving in the region of 400 complaints a month from people who believed they had been misled by mobile phone retailers. It said:</p>
	<p pid="a.423.1/6" class="indent">&quot;Ofcom has discussed the nature of these complaints with MNOs directly and industry has responded&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.423.1/7">the industry responded, not the regulator&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.423.1/8" class="indent">&quot;with a code of practice which defines the best approach to promoting and selling mobile services.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.423.1/9">That is commendable.</p>
	<p pid="a.423.1/10">The code of practice, written by the mobile operators, sets out minimum business standards on prohibited sales and marketing practices, details of proactive monitoring, due diligence, and how complaints to mobile network operators should be monitored. Furthermore, it says that mobile operators can determine how to apply those principles to their own retail channels. It also refers to selling incentives. But as is often the case with written documents, the devil is in the detail. One should always read the small print. In my opinion, the code of practice makes the voluntary code not worth the paper it is written on. The most important sentence in it is to be found on page 5, which states:</p>
	<p pid="a.423.1/11" class="indent">&quot;Mobile operators do not, however, underwrite the obligations of other legal entities&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.423.1/12">In a nutshell, it means that the five mobile network operators are happy to encourage retailers to use business models such as the 40 per cent. redemption rate, which everyone knows is unsustainable.</p>
	<p pid="a.423.1/13">The network operators are not interested in whether a retailer goes bust and cannot honour his obligations, because there will always be another one prepared to chance his arm to get business. Once the retailer has linked the customer up to the mobile network operator, the customer is, to use a fishing expression, hooked and netted. If the customer tries to escape, the mobile network operators send in the barristers and bailiffs. Of course, the mobile network operators&mdash;the big five&mdash;will say, &quot;Oh, what you are saying is grossly unfair,&quot; and that they do not expect retailers to use 40 per cent. business models, which are unsustainable. As someone once said, &quot;They would say that, wouldn't they?&quot; One of the five&mdash;3&mdash;certainly encourages its retailers to do just that. In a letter to a retailer, 3 says:</p>
	<p pid="a.423.1/14" class="indent">&quot;As promised, here is confirmation of our belief that many retailers currently operating cash-back schemes are experiencing a 40 per cent. redemption rate. This is based on feedback from a range of businesses operating both a Distant Selling model and a high street retail model. Perhaps the highest profile success story of a business operating this model is Dialaphone, whose results speak for themselves&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.423.1/15">The retailer to whom that letter was written tried it&mdash;and he went bust.</p>
	<p pid="a.423.1/16">The power of the mobile network operators and their absolute determination not to give up these highly lucrative contracts, however they were obtained, can best be seen in their attempts to pressurise local authority trading standards departments, which have valiantly tried to help affected customers. Birmingham's trading standards department was inundated by calls after the collapse of Dial a Mobile. Chris Neville, the head of the department, told the trade magazine <i>Mobile</i> on <phrase class="date" code="2008-09-13">13 September</phrase> that</p>
	<p pid="a.423.1/17" class="indent">&quot;The directors of Dial a Mobile told us that any documents&mdash;any contracts&mdash;were shredded and never passed onto the MNOs&mdash;and that was routine.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.423.1/18">That is the firm in my constituency that went bust. It did not even pass contracts on to the mobile network operators; it shredded them. Chris Neville continued:</p>
	<p pid="a.423.1/19" class="indent">&quot;They said the network providers knew this, and that this has been the case for a few years, and they'd been happy to accept customers via a phone call&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.423.1/20">presumably a mobile phone call.</p>
	<p pid="a.423.1/21">I pay tribute to Chris Neville and his colleagues. Based on the lack of written airtime contracts, they advised customers to give notice to their airtime network provider of their intention to terminate their airtime contracts. Chris Neville said:</p>
	<p pid="a.423.1/22" class="indent">&quot;The air time providers are getting upset at the advice we put out and are putting pressure on us to remove our advice.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.423.1/23">The trading standards department was being told by the mobile network operators that it was not serving the best interests of their clients&mdash;the people who live in Birmingham&mdash;but that the operators were doing so.</p>
	<p pid="a.423.1/24">The mobile network operators say that they have what the Independent Mobile Phone Dealers Association, a reputable body, calculates to be more than 1 million customers of failed retailers since 2005. Mobile network operators are saying, &quot;We have them over a barrel. We don't want trading standards or Government Departments interfering, and Ofcom's in our pocket. We want to be left alone to pursue them through the courts for the millions of pounds that these contracts are worth.&quot; I therefore ask, what is the regulator, Ofcom, doing? It is supposed to be looking after the interests of consumers.</p>
	<p pid="a.423.1/25">I said that the regulator issued a press release in July 2007, saying that mobile network operators had produced a voluntary code, which they hoped would work. Seven months later, Ofcom launched an investigation into cashback and slamming. Slamming is a separate issue, but we all know what it is. Its true name is &quot;erroneous transfers&quot;; that is the posh expression. To mere working class lads such as myself, it is called thieving of business. Nevertheless, I welcome the Ofcom investigation.</p>
	<p pid="a.423.1/26">In a letter to me dated <phrase class="date" code="2007-10-23">23 October 2007</phrase>, Ofcom said it wants:</p>
	<p pid="a.423.1/27" class="indent">&quot;to find a permanent fix to these problems.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.423.1/28">Although I welcome Ofcom's review of the voluntary agreement, that will not help the hundreds of thousands of people, including the 90,000 customers of Dial a Mobile, who are being pursued by the mobile network operators. Indeed Ofcom has already made it clear that the voluntary code of July 2007 is inadequate and has failed, and that Ofcom itself does not have the powers to compel the mobile network operators to tear up Dial a Mobile contracts.</p>
	<p pid="a.423.1/29">The regulator sent me a very blunt e-mail in November, in which he said:</p>
	<p pid="a.423.1/30" class="indent">&quot;Mr. Godsiff, in answer to your questions as to whether I have got any powers, as Dial a Mobile has gone out of business there are no Dial a Mobile contracts to tear up.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.423.1/31">This is the regulator, Ofcom, talking. The e-mail continues:</p>
	<p pid="a.423.1/32" class="indent">&quot;The problem is, rather, that the Dial a Mobile contracts were supposed to give money to customers to part compensate for the money customers were paying to the mobile operators. Now that Dial a Mobile has gone out of business, customers are often having to pay the full amounts to honour airtime contracts with mobile operators, even though they are no longer in receipt of cash-back payments from the retailer who sold the contract to them.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.423.1/33">So here is Ofcom, the regulator, saying, &quot;I am powerless. I know what the mobile network operators are doing and I cannot do anything about it.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.423.1/34">I would like to pose some questions. First, why did it take Ofcom until July 2007 to announce a voluntary code of practice, drawn up by the mobile network operators, which it now admits is inadequate? Secondly, why has Ofcom now acknowledged that it has no powers to force the mobile network operators to underwrite the unsustainable business models that they are encouraging retailers to adopt?</p>
	<p pid="a.423.1/35">It may come as something of a surprise to many mobile phone users, particularly the many hundreds of thousands of people who have been affected by retailers going bust, that one mobile network operator&mdash;Orange&mdash;contributes &pound;2.5 million a year towards Ofcom's running costs. The other mobile network operators are believed to contribute to Ofcom's running costs too. I say &quot;believed&quot;, because when my office sought the information on this from the regulator, Ofcom refused to release it on the grounds that, if it did release that information, it would reveal the turnover of the mobile network operators. So here we have a regulator, which receives &pound;2.5 million from Orange, one of the companies that it is supposed to regulate, and quite possibly receiving other amounts of money from other mobile network operators, refusing to put that information into the public domain on the grounds that, if it did so, it might reveal the turnover of the mobile network operators.</p>
	<p pid="a.423.1/36">I find that very interesting, particularly in the light of Orange's memorandum to the House of Lords Select Committee that looked at the mobile phone industry. In that memorandum to the Select Committee, Orange questioned, quite bluntly, whether the &pound;2.5 million that it was putting into Ofcom every year was:</p>
	<p pid="a.423.1/37" class="indent">&quot;good value for money for their shareholders&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.423.1/38">So Orange is saying there, &quot;We give &pound;2.5 million a year, but we are not so sure that we are getting good value for money.&quot; Well, it hit the jackpot over these cashback contracts, did it not?</p>
	<p pid="a.423.1/39">This sorry saga began with the belated recognition by Ofcom in July 2007 that the industry needed a code of practice; it continued with the inevitable collapse of Dial a Mobile and other retailers who had been encouraged to operate 40 per cent. cashbacks, which were unsustainable business models, and it resulted in hundreds of thousands of customers being ruthlessly pursued by the big five mobile network operators for at least &pound;10 million that is allegedly owed to them. However, if the big five were to reveal the true number of people who have been connected to them through firms that have subsequently gone bust, the independent assessments are that they would have to reveal that the amount that they are pursuing from customers is about &pound;50 million.</p>
	<p pid="a.423.1/40">Finally, there was a belated acceptance by Ofcom that what has happened over the last six months, including the failure of the voluntary code, has, in its own words, &quot;highlighted certain weaknesses&quot;, and that is the reason why</p>
	<p pid="a.423.1/41" class="indent">&quot;Ofcom is now agreeing to launch a formal review to see if formal regulations backed by the full weight of Ofcom's legal powers would provide better protection for customers&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.423.1/42">If Ofcom is saying, as a justification for now launching a review, that it might use &quot;the full weight&quot; of its powers, that prompts the question as to why it has not used those powers before.</p>
	<p pid="a.423.1/43">In my opinion, what I have said this morning clearly shows that the mobile phone industry is not only an industry that is out of control but is operating a system&mdash;the cashback system&mdash;that is a totally discredited relic of the past. Indeed, when the furore arose at the end of last year, even some of the network operators themselves backtracked. Mr. Bernie O'Beirne, 3's dealer and distributor chief, said:</p>
	<p pid="a.423.1/44" class="indent">&quot;We would love to ban cashbacks, but legally we can't.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.423.1/45">He went on to claim:</p>
	<p pid="a.423.1/46" class="indent">&quot;Cashback is really last year's problem. Cashback is always going to create problems&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.423.1/47">Basically, he was saying that cashback had reached its sell-by date. There is nothing like a sinner who repents, but it does not help the large number of people who are being pursued for money by 3 and the other mobile network operators.</p>
	<p pid="a.423.1/48">The mobile network operators could have acknowledged that they were aware of what some retailers were doing in pursuing unsustainable business models. They also could have acknowledged that they themselves were sitting on a mountain of contracts worth up to &pound;50 million, and they could have said something to their customers to the effect of, &quot;We would like to help you.&quot; They have said that they will consider any representations that customers make &quot;on their merits&quot;, but they deny any responsibility whatsoever for the shambles that has occurred.</p>
	<p pid="a.423.1/49">I should make it clear that I not only recognise that the mobile telecommunications industry makes a valuable contribution to the UK economy but I also know that there are mobile phone retailers who will not offer cashback deals, because they know how flawed the business model for such deals is and they are prepared to forgo business rather than adopt a business model that could place their customers in difficulty if they themselves went bust. Many retailers, including some small family firms, contacted me when this furore arose over Dial a Mobile. They wanted it to be known that there are retailers who will not touch cashback deals, but they also wanted the general public to know that the mobile network operators, despite their protestations of innocence, are fully aware of the unsustainable business models being operated and pushed by them on to some retailers, and they are quite happy to turn a blind eye as long as the customers keep getting connected to their networks.</p>
	<p pid="a.423.1/50">Following the representations that I have received, I have developed a great respect for those reputable retailers who have been prepared to say, &quot;I'm not going to con my customers, even if I lose business.&quot; Such dealers deserve respect; they are the sort of people Ofcom should be talking to and encouraging, and I very much hope that it will talk to some of them as part of its review.</p>
	<p pid="a.423.1/51">I have endeavoured to set out the background to this sorry saga, which has impacted on a large number of my constituents and on many other people around the country. Ofcom should have been much more rigorous and should have drawn up a code of practice that gave customers far greater protection, instead of letting the mobile network operators run rings around it.</p>
	<p pid="a.423.1/52">It is still not too late for the big five to make a gesture towards their customers, and I do not have in mind the two-fingered gesture that they seem to be making at the moment. Before Christmas, I had a meeting with the parliamentary representatives of the big five, where I suggested&mdash;it was the season of good will&mdash;that they at least tear up the alleged contracts of people who had not even signed a contract or received the cashback promised by the retailers. I said that the operators could keep the rest and that they were making a fortune, but I suggested that they could at least tear up the alleged contracts of people who had signed nothing. In retrospect, I acknowledge that I was naive to think that fat cats would give up even a drop of their milk, and, sadly, that proved to be the case.</p>
	<p pid="a.423.1/53">I suspect that the Minister will say that he has sympathy for the many people who are suffering, but that this is a matter for Ofcom, and he is of course right, because it is the regulator. However, he, with parliamentary approval, is responsible for setting the parameters within which the regulator operates, and I hope that he will be prepared to raise a number of matters with Ofcom.</p>
	<p pid="a.423.1/54">First, if the regulator was so concerned about slamming and cashbacks because of the number of complaints that it received each month, why did it take until July 2007 to ask the mobile network operators to come up with a voluntary agreement? Secondly, why did it think that a voluntary code was acceptable, only to state that it was flawed and needed reviewing seven months later?</p>
	<p pid="a.423.1/55">Thirdly, I hope that the Minister will emphasise to the regulator that cashback schemes should be scrapped, as even some mobile network operators, such as 3, now suggest they should be. If such schemes are allowed to continue, operators must insist that all retailers who sell mobile phone contracts must get customers to sign and forward contracts to them. Most importantly, I hope that the Minister will emphasise that the mobile network operators must be made responsible for underwriting cashback offers made by retailers who are pushing their goods.</p>
	<p pid="a.423.1/56">I hope that the Minister will also ask Ofcom proactively to engage with the European Commission, which, as I said, is unhappy about the relationship between the regulator and the mobile network operators. I hope that he will instruct Ofcom to make known its yearly contributions from the operators, rather than allowing it to hide behind the cloak of commercial confidentiality.</p>
	<p pid="a.423.1/57">Finally, I very much hope that, as a result of this debate, the mobile network industry will soon be properly regulated by a vigilant regulator that protects the customer from the dodgy business practices and rampant greed that have, I regret to say, characterised the industry over the past few years.</p>

	<p pid="a.428.0/1">It is a pleasure to be under your watchful eye today, Mr. Benton.</p>
	<p pid="a.428.0/2">Let me start by saying where I come from on this issue. My constituency contains the world headquarters of Vodafone, of which I am a great admirer. The company has a very good corporate responsibility record, and there is a scarcely a school, arts body, sporting institution or voluntary organisation in the area that has not received funds or help from it. Although I am great admirer of Vodafone as a business, that is not to say that I come to the House as a mouthpiece for it or, indeed, any of the other network operators. In fact, I consider myself a challenging friend, and I have at times raised issues that would be of particular interest to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1419" name="Roger Godsiff">the hon. Member for Birmingham, Sparkbrook and Small Heath (Mr. Godsiff)</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.428.0/3">I have great respect for the hon. Gentleman, who has been a worthy campaigner for his constituents, many of whom are on low incomes and who have undoubtedly suffered extremely badly as a result of some dodgy dealings by Dial a Mobile. That said, he and I probably look at business issues from different ends of the telescope, and I will seek in my few remarks to add a tone of caution as we perhaps move towards a new regulatory framework for the industry.</p>
	<p pid="a.428.0/4">I recently saw early-day motion 696, which is in the hon. Gentleman's name, but one phrase leaped out and caused me such concern that I was unable to sign it. Speaking of cashback deals, the hon. Gentleman said that he believed</p>
	<p pid="a.428.0/5" class="indent">&quot;network providers to be complicit in the active promotion of an unsustainable business model&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.428.0/6">That is a very sweeping statement. There are five major network providers, and I have not had time to speak to them all since I heard that this debate had been called. However, I have spoken to Vodafone, which takes great exception to the hon. Gentleman's assertion.</p>
	<p pid="a.428.0/7">We must recognise that mobile phones are now cheaper and more reliable, that they cover much more of the British isles and that they do more&mdash;we can access the internet with them, and they have all sorts of other uses. Many of those advances in technology and provision have been achieved through competition. The marketplace is highly competitive, which is a good thing because it has given a lot of people on low incomes access to mobile communications and transformed their lives. I entirely concede, however, that that has resulted in some pretty dodgy dealing, as in all highly competitive marketplaces.</p>
	<p pid="a.428.0/8">In seeking to sift out the bad guys, however, we need to look at the actions of the independent dealers. As we seek to secure value for money and consumer rights for our constituents, we should ensure that our fire is directed at the real culprits, and it is open to debate whether the networks are complicit. In fairness, the hon. Gentleman made a good case, and some network providers may have encouraged activities among independent dealers that might, in the wrong hands, be open to question. However, we are certainly not talking about all network companies and we should all be careful about the words that we use.</p>
	<p pid="a.428.0/9">The hon. Gentleman referred to the mobile networks' self-regulatory code. I have read the code, which I believe was a genuine attempt by the networks to do what they could to set out the principles governing the behaviour of independent dealers. However, anti-competition rules limit the extent to which operators can restrict independent dealers' freedom to set out their own deals. In other industries, such as the airline industry, we have seen how a cartel of large companies can set prices and establish business models in an entirely illegal way, and they pay a heavy price for that. It is not in our interests for network providers to behave in that way; indeed, they should not and would not want to do so. In attacking them, however, the hon. Gentleman might be taking them down a route that is illegal under the EU's very strict competition rules.</p>
	<p pid="a.428.0/10">The Independent Mobile Phone Dealers Association does not think that the code is enough or that it will work. If that is the case, perhaps Ofcom should look at the statutory regulations of the independent dealers. The independents have been offering the deals that have caused consumer harm. People close to me often tease me for my financial caution. The only cashback deal that I would take is the one that put cash in my hand at the time that I was purchasing the contract. Even then, I would question who was getting the money back at another time in another way. I have always been dubious about such arrangements and of snake oil salesmen who may, from time to time, try to sell me things beyond the area of telecommunications. Any cashback deal is surely an area for question.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-03-05a.437.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1523" speakername="Malcolm Wicks" speakeroffice="The Minister for Energy"  colnum="437"  time="010:44:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080305/halltext/80305h0003.htm#08030576000474">
	<p pid="a.437.0/1">I, too, congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1419" name="Roger Godsiff">the Member for Birmingham, Sparkbrook and Small Heath (Mr. Godsiff)</phrase> on securing this debate. I think that all of us have been struck by his commitment and concern on behalf of his constituents, particularly those on low incomes. Many have certainly been badly treated, and I was struck by his comments on the consequent financial distress that some are suffering. I thank him for continuing to highlight the issue.</p>
	<p pid="a.437.0/2">My hon. Friend is right to be concerned; thousands of people feel aggrieved that they have lost money by agreeing to cashback deals. I hope that he will understand that I shall not comment in any detail about the particular case of the collapse of Dial a Mobile, as that would not be appropriate. However, he has raised wider issues, so today's debate is welcome.</p>
	<p pid="a.437.0/3">Consumer protection is a key role of the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform. I know from my constituents and the many people who write to the Department that consumers expect to be treated fairly and expect their voices to be heard by business. Most importantly, they expect the best consumer protection regime that we can provide.</p>
	<p pid="a.437.0/4">Regulation of the telecommunications market in the UK falls to the independent regulator, Ofcom, a statutory corporation set up under the Office of Communications Act 2002 with duties to further the interests of citizens in communications and relevant matters. Ofcom introduced the voluntary code of practice last July with the aim that consumers should be able to trust those who sell to them. As Ed Richards said at the code's launch:</p>
	<p pid="a.437.0/5" class="indent">&quot;We expect this new voluntary code of practice to stamp out mis-selling in mobile; if it does not, we will not hesitate to step in to protect consumers.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.437.0/6">The Department does monitor complaints, which have, unfortunately, continued at a relatively high rate, peaking at an average of 665 per month in September 2007. Given the continuing complaints to Ofcom, it is absolutely right that it has reviewed the voluntary code of practice. I understand that the conclusions of the review will be made public shortly, and I look forward to seeing them. I hope that before Ofcom finalises its voluntary code, it will listen carefully to the voices in this debate, which I know it is monitoring, particularly the complaints of my hon. Friend. That seems the best way of tackling mis-selling and cashback deals that do not materialise in practice.</p>
	<p pid="a.437.0/7">Part of the role of an independent regulator is talking regularly to mobile network operators and retailers about enhancing mechanisms to give consumers improved protection. As we have heard, the mobile telecommunications sector is one of the most intense and competitive in the UK. By the end of 2006, there were nearly 70 million active mobile phone subscriptions in the UK. Further growth is being driven by multiple handset or SIM card ownership. That intense competition has given us one of the most dynamic markets for mobile telecommunications in the world, and it puts pressure on everyone&mdash;vendors, customers and regulators&mdash;to ensure that business is done fairly and contracts are honoured.</p>
	<p pid="a.437.0/8">The Office of Fair Trading can take action against standard terms used by traders in contracts with consumers, seek assurances from anyone using terms that it considers unfair and, if necessary, seek injunctions forbidding the use of specific terms. A term may be unfair not merely in substance but, equally, by being so obscurely worded that the consumer cannot reasonably be expected to understand it. If a trader uses standard terms and conditions but hides away important or onerous contract conditions in the depths of the document, that may be unfair. There are also controls on misleading trading practices. If a trader knowingly misleads a customer about what is on offer or the conditions of the sale, that may be a false trade description or misrepresentation.</p>
	<p pid="a.437.0/9">In a couple of months, we shall bring into force new regulations implementing the unfair commercial practices directive. The regulations will repeal much of the existing law in this area and replace it with a simpler, more general framework. The essence of the new system will be simply that the trader should not mislead the consumer or omit important information if those actions or omissions might lead the consumer to take a different decision. I give that information as general background, as it is not clear that those aspects of the law are of particular relevance to this issue. The central problem in most cases seems to be that the reseller has gone out of business. In those circumstances, the general consumer protection regime is unable to offer any practical assistance.</p>
	<p pid="a.437.0/10">Cashback has been a commonly available offer from independent mobile retailers for the past five years: retailers undertake to pay an amount of money to customers when they take out mobile phone contracts. Cashback contracts are with retailers and are separate from customers' airtime contracts with mobile providers such as Vodafone, Orange and O2. Ofcom recognises and welcomes Vodafone's rescue package for its Dial a Mobile customers. It has offered contract exits and downgrades to affected customers, and Ofcom has urged other providers to adopt similar, generous rescue packages. In most arrangements, cashback is funded by retailers from the commission that they receive from mobile providers for making sales. There has been a welcome focus on operators supplying customers without using third-party suppliers. By May 2007, direct sales accounted for nearly 60 per cent. of sales.</p>
	<p pid="a.437.0/11">It is important that customers ensure that they have as much information as possible before agreeing to anything. However, I recognise that my hon. Friend would argue that people on low incomes who do not have information that many other people might have can be particularly vulnerable. We need to think through the implications of that. My Department is committed to putting knowledgeable, empowered consumers at the heart of a strong UK economy, and to ensuring that the UK has a first-class consumer policy framework. We want confident, well-informed businesses and consumers, because they are key to ensuring that competition benefits us all. We are determined to maintain and, crucially, to enhance a robust, effective consumer and competition regime that gives consumers the knowledge and information they need to shop confidently at home and overseas. We want it to educate consumers so that they know their rights and where to turn for protection.</p>
	<p pid="a.437.0/12">On <phrase class="date" code="2008-05-26">26 May 2008</phrase>, the new consumer protection regulations will usher in the EU's unfair commercial practices directive. The new rules will help consumers by banning all types of unfair selling and marketing methods and by tackling unfair conduct that is not currently illegal. The directive will ban misleading statements or omissions, and deceptions about the value of cashback deals or the conditions necessary to qualify. It will not, however, ban cashback or other incentives.</p>
	<p pid="a.437.0/13">My hon. Friend has raised an interesting issue. I do not think that my words will satisfy him entirely, but it is important to re-emphasise that Ofcom has recognised that the voluntary code needs reforming and strengthening. Although the code is near to publication, I hope that Ofcom will step back for a few moments and consider today's debate and the different contributions that have been made. We should consider in particular the important issues that my hon. Friend has raised.</p>

	<p pid="a.441.2/1">I should like the Gordon Brown Government to be remembered as one who revitalised our democracy and returned power to our people, individually, locally and regionally; who finally ended the privilege of the unelected to vote in our legislature; who allowed people locally to run their own local affairs; and, finally, who enabled the people directly to elect not only their parliamentary representatives but their nation's chief executive, as is commonplace in virtually every other western democracy.</p>
	<p pid="a.441.2/2">The Blair Government did their best to pay their debt of honour to the democratic radicalism of John Smith, especially through Scottish and Welsh devolution, but we knew that in their heart they were not motivated by democratic change. They fatally&mdash;some say deliberately&mdash;delayed efforts to establish English regional government, which could by now be entering its second decade and be a stable part of our democratic arrangements. They were inconsistent on mayors and local cabinets. There was no rebuilding and refurbishment of the vital local party political infrastructure that is required by all parties. There was no tackling of issues around state funding to sustain our democratic parties, and we know the consequences of that: funding is not even at the level at which we rightly fund the BBC. Our parties, politics and democracy apparently are not even worth that amount of money.</p>
	<p pid="a.441.2/3">That all betrayed a Government who, at heart, trusted Whitehall before the localities, and officers and bureaucrats before politics and parties. They preferred to manage the dance between the media and No. 10 that monopolises British politics, rather than re-engage directly with the British people. They presided over well-meaning, policy-light centralism, not the creative, liberated political entrepreneurship of the sort for which many of us hoped.</p>
	<p pid="a.441.2/4">Ten years of massive majorities and unprecedented economic growth gave real space to transform our democracy, but the opportunity was not even seen, let alone grasped. Instead, we have empty shells of elected local councils, people who do not have written rights, an unelected second Chamber, and, perhaps above all, a Parliament that is seen at best as irrelevant, and at worst as the hapless, dependent lapdog of the Government. Parliament can now be popularly defined as the house of sleaze, individualised and greedy. We are pilloried on expenses, and not respected for representing political opinions. Parliament itself has the most to gain from democratic renewal and serious self-appraisal. It, instead of the media, should become the forum of the nation. The &quot;Today&quot; programme and &quot;Newsnight&quot; obviously occupy a good place in the pantheon of British democracy, but so should our Parliament.</p>
	<p pid="a.441.2/5">Parliament should hold the Government to account, rather than be seen as rival supporters' clubs. It should reach out to involve the electorate in law-making, rather than being a shabby rubber stamp. This is the best opportunity in my lifetime for democratic change. In our system, the grossly overdeveloped and unchecked Executive allow the Prime Minister to make change in a way that no other western democracy permits. That is a bad system. Its only advantage is that it enables our new Prime Minister to move forward with real pace and urgency on an agenda that he cares about, and to change for good the way in which we are governed. I have no doubts whatsoever about the Prime Minister's sentiments on the issue, nor those of the Minister, who I regard as an hon. Friend indeed.</p>
	<p pid="a.441.2/6">In his leadership campaign, the Prime Minister made only one commitment to legislation, and that was on democratic reform. He chose to use his precious and unique first speech to Parliament as Prime Minister to outline a new democratic settlement for Britain. However, even with such prime ministerial resolution, the dead-weight of conservative culture, bureaucratic tradition and the soporific comfort zone of colleagues all combine to slow, soften, and suffocate his vision to spread democratic power.</p>
	<p pid="a.441.2/7">I have called the debate today to enable the Minster to reassure those of us who want democratic change that we should keep the faith, and to enthuse and motivate those who wish our Government well in this endeavour. He has been working hard, but he knows that outside there are no torches lit, no passionate debates being held, no sense of this being Philadelphia in 1787. New technology should enable literally millions of people to take part in debates. The media should be abuzz with excitement around creating free-standing, independent local government, democratising the health and police services in regions with elected representatives, enabling taxation and bonds to be raised and spent locally in accord with the wishes of local people, being clear about the federal nature of the United Kingdom and the powers of the nations and the regions of our country, and defining our rights and responsibilities in a British Bill of Rights.</p>

	<p pid="a.444.0/1">Sadly, this goes back to 1993, when I was the shadow home affairs spokesman in the future Prime Minister's home affairs team. We wrote and agreed, and had endorsed by our party conference, not only that we should incorporate the European convention on human rights, but that the second stage would be a British Bill of Rights. Admittedly, that would come some 200 years after that of our compatriots across the Atlantic, but it is better late than never. We had, effectively, a draft of that Bill of Rights: I have a copy and there is, no doubt, one mouldering somewhere, perhaps on shelves in the Cabinet Office, that could be dusted down and used as a basis for debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.444.0/2">Let every school and every sixth form debate what should be in a British Bill of Rights; let every Labour group, Conservative association and Liberal Democrat group in the localities debate what should be included in that; and let us do our job and pull together those thoughts, mediated properly through the Hansard Society, to form the core of what we would want to see in a British Bill of Rights. Those arguments are even more applicable to a written constitution.</p>
	<p pid="a.444.0/3">If we have rights and responsibilities and a democratic framework in this country, let us write it down. What are we afraid of? Why should we have to engage in what John Smith called judicial archaeology to find out what are the responsibilities of a second chamber, a monarch or local government? Why can we not own this so that every schoolboy and schoolgirl, and every local councillor and Member of Parliament, can have it in their back pocket or purse? We could raise people with clarity about what their rights are under a written constitution.</p>
	<p pid="a.444.0/4">One of the sad things about the current debate in the main Chamber is that a so-called constitution for Europe is so vague, woolly and amorphous, rather than being crisp, clear and inspirational and able to lead us to feel that we all want to be European and have our rights written down. Let us not make the same mistake in the United Kingdom. Let us start that debate in this place, start formulating our own written constitution and find out what we need to reform before we write it down.</p>
	<p pid="a.444.0/5">Many things in our current unwritten constitution would be laughable in a written constitution. For example, it would not say: &quot;There shall not be an election for the Prime Minister of the day; Parliament shall send the leader of the main party to Buckingham palace to be anointed as Prime Minister; there shall be an unelected second Chamber; there shall be no British Bill of Rights.&quot; A written constitution could not be produced on the back of that without a lot of belly laughs from other countries around the world. We would need to get the parts in place and then write a written constitution. That is a fundamental thing that we need to do.</p>
	<p pid="a.444.0/6">The Prime Minister cannot kick-start a written constitution given the current state of debate. However, a debate needs to take place in the country and in Parliament in order that a written constitution can first be drafted and modelled. I am sure that that was the Prime Minister's intention in July last year and I hope that it remains his intention today. The opportunity for significant, democratic change has not been missed and has not passed us by, but it requires reinvigoration and reaffirmation from the top. I hope that my hard-working hon. Friend the Minister, who is labouring away in the depths of the Ministry of Justice on so many important and detailed issues, takes that message to the Prime Minister. We need the Prime Minister to reassert leadership of the democratic vision that can sustain our country for the next 100 years.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-03-05a.453.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1498" speakername="Andrew Tyrie" colnum="453"  time="014:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080305/halltext/80305h0005.htm#08030576000503">
	<p pid="a.453.2/1">Absolutely. The Gore report is a scandal. The fact that it has been distributed to our schools reflects badly on the House. It has been comprehensively rubbished by a series of top papers produced by the American Academy of Scientists, so much so that even a judge felt the need to intervene in the debate. It should be withdrawn from our schools. There are many mistakes in it. If hon. Members want to challenge me on that, I will start going through them one by one, but if I do so, others will not get a chance to speak. I am not quite sure how many Members have put in to speak. At the moment, I know of only one, so I do have a bit of time.</p>
	<p pid="a.453.2/2">At the very least, we all have to agree that the Stern report is deeply controversial. It should have been the duty of the Treasury and the Opposition parties to listen to some of the trenchant criticisms, but both, regrettably, have swallowed the Stern report whole. My party's Front-Bench spokesmen welcomed the recommendations of the Stern report before they had even had a chance to read it, and I find that quite shocking.</p>
	<p pid="a.453.2/3">Treasury Ministers, however, have done worse. A full year after the report's publication, and with the benefit of a cacophony of dissenting material to hand, the Treasury published &quot;Moving to a global low carbon economy: implementing the Stern Review&quot;, which recommended that we proceeded as if none of the criticisms had been made. That beggars belief.</p>
	<p pid="a.453.2/4">It is worth briefly examining some of Professor Stern's many mistakes, although perhaps I will pick just one. Nick Stern has applied a discount rate of only 2.1 per cent. to his calculations, although the Treasury requires a discount rate of 3.5 per cent. for any other major project. There are some very good arguments, and some of the world's leading economists, behind the view that the rate should be much higher than 2.1 per cent. The World Bank customarily uses a rate of 8 to 10 per cent., and 3.5 per cent. is considered historically extremely low.</p>
	<p pid="a.453.2/5">This is not a trivial or academic point; it is quite fundamental. Just by using a sensible discount rate, Nick Stern's conclusions would probably be put into reverse. In other words, he would have had to conclude not that we should be rapidly decarbonising the economy, but that we should, for now, be primarily adapting to climate change.</p>
	<p pid="a.453.2/6">To arrive at his conclusion, Nick Stern had to make an extraordinary assumption: that we should value the welfare of every future generation, however far distant, to the same extent as our own. A moment's thought shows us what a ridiculous assumption that is. If it were taken to its logical conclusion, as one of the many eminent professors whom I cited pointed out, we should start saving virtually all our income for the benefit of a future generation. Alternatively, as Ian Little, perhaps the world's greatest post-war welfare economist, put it when I discussed the matter with him to ensure that my head was clear on the subject, we might as well start safeguarding the planet now in case the Martians decide that they have a use for it when they invade.</p>

	<p pid="a.466.1/1">I hope that the hon. Gentleman will forgive me for not giving way.</p>
	<p pid="a.466.1/2">I disagree with the hon. Member for Chichester on a number of points. First, he said that it is the poor who will suffer from decarbonisation. Certainly, in the personal sector, the carbon outputs are coming from driving, and the people who do not have cars are poor people. We are also talking about flights, and the people who do not fly are poor people. On a global scale&mdash;this was what I expected to hear at some point in the hon. Gentleman's speech, but we did not hear it&mdash;if the climate is changing and if sea levels are rising, it is the poor &quot;that's gonna get it&quot; around the world. He argued that decarbonisation is somehow bad news for the poor; carbonisation is bad news for the poor, in the big picture. For that reason, the message that he gave was rather unbalanced.</p>
	<p pid="a.466.1/3">I agree with the hon. Gentleman on the need for a sober cost-benefit analysis. However, as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1755" name="Andrew Smith">the right hon. Member for Oxford, East (Mr. Smith)</phrase> said, my judgment is that the downside risk is potentially cataclysmic, and I do not use that word lightly; some of the things that could happen are pretty dramatic and would have to be seriously weighed in any such cost-benefit analysis. Some of the costs that the hon. Member for Chichester mentioned are not, in my judgment, as great as he suggested.</p>
	<p pid="a.466.1/4">The hon. Member for Chichester also suggested that international leadership is a bit of a con and is irrelevant, and we are a small part of a big problem. I do not think that that is true. Funnily enough, I would cite the example of Germany, which has really gone hell for leather on renewables and made huge strides on them. No doubt the hon. Gentleman may think that Germany perhaps got the cost-benefit analysis on renewables wrong. Nevertheless, if renewables is part of the response to climate change, the fact that Germany has a comparable economy to ours and has seriously gone for renewables and delivered a huge amount in that area enables us to shame the British Government for their pathetic record on renewables. Because the British Government are hearing this all the time&mdash;&quot;Germany has done it, Germany has done it, another country has done it and our country has not done it&quot;&mdash;they are starting to move on renewables. Therefore, it is not an entirely empty argument that, when one country provides a lead, other countries can be shamed, cajoled or encouraged to follow. One country demonstrating that change can be achieved does provide a lead. There is an issue about unilateral action, and there is some evidence that there is a role for leadership.</p>
	<p pid="a.466.1/5">I would like to return to the central point made by the hon. Member for Chichester. I fully accept the argument for a cost-benefit analysis, but I also agree with <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1937" name="Rob Marris">the hon. Member for Wolverhampton, South-West (Rob Marris)</phrase> that adaptation has been very much the Cinderella at the feast; I am not quite sure if that image works, but hon. Members will know what I mean. We have heard little about adaptation and I was thinking about why that should be. I think that the answer is straightforward. From a Treasury point of view, adaptation has a price tag attached to it. Mitigation can be achieved through carbon pricing, emissions trading and all the rest of it, and it is not a Budget line; it is there, it comes through, but it is not a Budget line. Adaptation, by contrast, is a Budget line. I agree with the hon. Gentleman that Chichester needs better flood defences, but that is a public spending line and I think that that is the nub of the problem. That is why we do not hear much about adaptation. As the hon. Member for Wolverhampton, South-West says, adaptation is not only about public spending; planning, reform and other measures could help.</p>
	<p pid="a.466.1/6">I think that that explains why we hear so little about adaptation. The draft Climate Change Bill had virtually nothing&mdash;only a tiny little bit&mdash;about adaptation. I think that it is being beefed up a little, thanks no doubt to the hon. Member for Wolverhampton, South-West. When the Bill comes to this end of the building, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will help to beef it up some more.</p>
	<p pid="a.466.1/7">Where do we go from here? I am puzzled by the suggestion from the hon. Member for Chichester that there is a considerable diversity of opinion on the science. I am not convinced that the scientific viewpoints on climate change and its causes are as diverse as he suggests they are, but we can differ on that. My sense is that the leading- edge science is well ahead of the international consensus of opinion. The IPCC assessment is a consensus document and tends to be what the hon. Gentleman would no doubt call a lagging indicator. It is not a leading indicator at all; it tends to follow behind scientific opinion, because it has to get all the Governments to agree, and some of the scientists who are most worried about climate change cannot get their latest evidence included. Consequently, there is a time lag. The scientific consensus is a lagging indicator in the IPCC and that makes me think that the case for urgent action is growing.</p>
	<p pid="a.466.1/8">Climate change is not a philosophical issue. My sense is that the scientific opinion is much more alarming than the hon. Member for Chichester thinks it is, and so my sense about the cost-benefit analysis is different from his. I accept the need to evaluate mitigation against adaptation and I also accept the need to look after the most vulnerable people, although I conclude that the best strategy to help them is to treat this issue more seriously, because my judgment is that, in the long term, serious global climate change will ultimately hit the poor most of all and that is what I am most concerned about.</p>

	<p pid="a.468.3/1">Absolutely. We are seeing an extraordinary change in weather patterns. With global warming, we could see a 2&deg; rise, which sounds very boring and quite slight. However, the real impact of climate change is an increase in extreme weather patterns, which is why Africa's worst floods in three decades hit 23 countries from Senegal to west Somalia, and affected 2 million people, in 2007; why Nepal, India and Bangladesh were hit by their worst floods in living memory affecting 41 million people; why two category 5 hurricanes and unusually heavy rains in central America and Mexico affected more than 1.5 million people in 2007; and why, at the height of the flood in Mexico, more than 80 per cent. of the state of Tabasco was under water.</p>
	<p pid="a.468.3/2">With climate change, we are seeing not just a steady, manageable, predictable rise in temperatures, but violent, global weather patterns and, of course, fluctuations, which explains the hurricanes and catastrophic losses recorded by the insurance industry. If my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1816" name="Philip Davies">the Member for Shipley (Philip Davies)</phrase> goes to the City of London and asks about pay-out rates from insurance companies 20 years ago, compared with today, he will find an extraordinary seismic shift. That is why the capital markets and business are taking climate change very seriously.</p>
	<p pid="a.468.3/3">Those who doubt the scientists and cannot come to a consensus, should consider what the most progressive businesses, nationally and internationally, are doing. My hon. Friend should go and ask his old employer, Asda, or Wal-Mart, what they are doing about climate change. He will find that his old employer, whom he cites quite frequently, is taking climate change extremely seriously. The chief executive of Wal-Mart has signed up to a massive reduction in its carbon emissions and is not waiting for the Government to tell it how to do it. Progressive, responsible, private-sector organisations, such as HSBC, BP, RTZ, Marks and Spencer and Tesco are not waiting to be told by the Government what they should be doing, but acting now. They are doing that not just because of the imperative of climate change or because that is what their consumers and customers are telling them to do, but because they realise that it makes good business sense. They also realise that squeezing out fossil fuels and decarbonising their production costs makes sound economic sense.</p>
	<p pid="a.468.3/4">Companies such as BP, GlaxoSmithKline, RTZ and General Electric have all managed to reduce their overall operating costs by hundreds of millions of pounds&mdash;BP has saved about $500 million over seven years. That money has gone straight to the bottom line. It is never wrong to get rid of waste and inefficiency, to bear down on the cost of energy and to squeeze out manufacturing costs. I worked in the oil industry. In 1999, the cost of a barrel of oil fell below $10; at times, it now reaches nearly $100&mdash;an extraordinary rise in the cost base.</p>
	<p pid="a.468.3/5">I can tell hon. Members what the single biggest threat to poor people is: it is the spiralling cost of fossil fuels. Never mind climate change&mdash;in the short term, the fuel- poor and those dependent on fossil fuels for heating and cooking will be the ones to suffer. They are the ones being squeezed the most by fossil-fuel dependency and who will benefit the most from actions that we should take to reduce that dependency, to tap into the potential of renewable energy and to ensure the long-term, cheap, predictable cost of renewable energy. The world's poorest people, in places such as south-east Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, will be hit the most if we do not tackle the causes of climate change, and adapt and mitigate. They are the people who require adaptation&mdash;never mind us in the UK, who will probably be among the last to suffer the ill consequences of climate change, which are being felt already by people in Bangladesh and sub-Saharan Africa. They suffer already from drought and flooding and feel now the direct consequences of 200 years of industrialisation. We cannot sit back and wash our hands. We have a moral responsibility, not only to our own people in the UK and those abroad, but to future generations. We cannot sit here complacently.</p>

	<p pid="a.471.1/1">I shall not give way, because I have so little time. We have put in place a world-leading resource, the UK climate impacts programme, to provide information and tools that all types of organisations can use to help them adapt to the risks and opportunities of a changing climate. UKCIP is also working with the Met Office's Hadley centre on the UK 21st century climate change scenarios, known as UKCIP08. Those scenarios are due to be launched in November this year, and they will provide probabilistic UK climate projections up to 2099. They will be absolutely critical for doing the work to which my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1937" name="Rob Marris">the Member for Wolverhampton, South-West (Rob Marris)</phrase> referred. The projections will provide more localised detail than we have ever had, drilling down to 25 km grid squares over land, regions and river catchments. The UKCIP08 scenarios will support risk-based decision-making on adaptation, and they will be a major tool for understanding the risks that we face and how we can respond to them.</p>
	<p pid="a.471.1/2">We have already set up a new adapting to climate change programme, led by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, to co-ordinate action throughout the Government and drive adaptation throughout society, the economy and the natural environment. Reference was made to biodiversity, and as Minister with responsibility for biodiversity as well as for climate change, I know how critical it is. From the work of the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds in particular, on the way in which birds already have difficulties finding suitable habitats and moving north, we already know that we need wildlife corridors to protect our biodiversity. There will have to be a huge programme of work, and Natural England, which is very much devoted to it, already has an adaptation strategy.</p>
	<p pid="a.471.1/3">We have three main areas of work in our adaptation programme: the Climate Change Bill, to which the hon. Member for Chichester referred, the adaptation policy framework document, and the new local government performance framework. The Climate Change Bill, which is on Report in the House of Lords, not only sets statutory targets for emissions reductions, but introduces a legislative framework for adaptation.</p>
	<p pid="a.471.1/4">The Bill requires the Government to produce a national risk assessment on adaptation, which we will follow with a cost-benefit analysis. No doubt, the hon. Gentleman will wish to contribute to that analysis, and I hope that as he approves of adaptation, he will join us as we try to create a national risk assessment so that we can properly develop policies to meet those risks. The Bill also requires that we produce a national programme of work every five years, with interim updates. In addition, it gives the Secretary of State the power to request reports and action plans on adaptation from public bodies and statutory undertakers, such as water companies. Those aspects are new, and I hope that my hon. Friend recognises that we have responded to his arguments in particular, and to the arguments made by many others, who either responded to the consultation on the Bill, or indeed, were critical in the House of Lords.</p>
	<p pid="a.471.1/5">We are also developing an adaptation policy framework, to which my hon. Friend referred. The framework will identify the key impacts and vulnerabilities that we face. It will set out what action the Government are already taking and provide a road map for the way in which we will meet our statutory commitments under the Climate Change Bill. My hon. Friend quoted my parliamentary answer that the document would be available in the spring, and I know how anxious and frustrated he is. We have agreed that it will be produced as the Climate Change Bill becomes an Act, meaning a small delay but one of which he should approve, because it will enable us to take account of the amendments that we are making in the House of Lords. It is more appropriate to align that work with the new framework that will arise from the legislation. The APF will set out a strategic vision for a UK that is adapting well to the impacts of climate change, and it will explain our understanding of the existing barriers to adaptation and the role of the Government in addressing them.</p>
	<p pid="a.471.1/6">We have also introduced climate change adaptation into the new local government performance framework. The new indicator will require local authorities to assess the risks that climate change poses to the delivery of their services, and to draw up and implement action to address those risks. It will help to ensure that local authorities are more prepared for the climate change risks to service delivery, local infrastructure, businesses and the public. Negotiations are still under way, but we have been pleased with the initial positive response from local authorities during our consultations on the indicators.</p>
	<p pid="a.471.1/7">The Local Government Association has also set up its own climate change commission, whose recent report we warmly welcomed. At the heart of our work on climate change is the recognition that it is a cross-cutting issue. An example of that is the recently published water strategy &quot;Future Water&quot;, which was launched last month. That strategy has adaptation at its core. It is amazing that the lack of water in London is comparable with that in many Mediterranean countries. The water problem in many parts of the country is much more serious than many people appreciate, so addressing the questions of drought, water shortage and so on are important. We will do so, and the issues of water efficiency, maintaining sustainable supplies, and surface water drainage will all be critical to the development of that water strategy.</p>
	<p pid="a.471.1/8">We have also been working closely with our colleagues from the Department for Communities and Local Government on the supplement to the new planning and policy statement&mdash;planning and climate change. It was launched in December last year and sets out how planning should help us to shape places with lower carbon emissions that are resilient to the impacts of climate change. Several people mentioned that issue, and again it is critical. We must ensure that the new homes we build, and those that we already have, are protected, because we anticipate more severe weather patterns and more flooding as a consequence. We have dramatically increased the flooding budgets, and we are dealing with coastal erosion, too.</p>
	<p pid="a.471.1/9">The hon. Gentleman did not ask me any questions about that, but he certainly commented on coastal erosion in his constituency. I understand how he feels about that, but DEFRA concluded that the council's scheme appraisal did not adequately demonstrate that the preferred option was the most appropriate. We will not be able to keep in place every inch of our coast, and we will have to understand that at times, allowing nature to come into our coastal areas is one of the best ways in which we can protect against flooding elsewhere. Those are difficult judgments, but I assure the hon. Gentleman that the decision has not been taken lightly; it has been carefully assessed.</p>
	<p pid="a.471.1/10">More widely, throughout the Government, the Department of Health has recently published a report on the health impacts of climate change, and the Department for Transport has plans for its own adaptation strategy. In my Department, we are setting up a dedicated team to work with the agricultural sector to help it adapt its businesses in the most sustainable way.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-03-05a.480.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1936" speakername="Patrick McFadden" colnum="480"  time="016:16:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080305/halltext/80305h0009.htm#08030576000553">
	<p pid="a.480.1/1">The hon. Gentleman says that the national picture is not reflected in his area. I do not know whether that is also true in respect of the figures for people paying bills online. We gave people the option to pay their car tax online, and 1 million a month choose to do so. Perhaps none of them live in Mole valley&mdash;I do not know&mdash;but I suspect that some do. People can still go to the post office to renew car tax, but, given the choice, 1 million a month choose to do it online. That reflects the wider changes that are taking place in society.</p>
	<p pid="a.480.1/2">There is also a cost implication to how benefits and some bills are paid. It costs about 1p for the Government to make a payment directly to a bank. It costs about 80p for the transaction to be done at a post office, and &pound;1.80 to make a payment by girocheque, which is then cashed at a post office.</p>
	<p pid="a.480.1/3">I am not sure whether any Government in the future would reverse the process. We intend to have a successor product to the Post Office card account, and to keep that option available for people, but I doubt that we will ever return to the benefit books of the past. I do not know about the Conservative party. Perhaps it will make a commitment in that direction, but I am not sure that any future Government would do that.</p>
	<p pid="a.480.1/4">Let me say a little about the process and the consultation, which have caused a great deal of controversy. People say, &quot;The consultation cannot be genuine because we do not want the closures but they are still happening.&quot; But it is important to understand that the consultation is actually about how the process will be implemented; it is not about whether people want closures. The overall decision was announced in May last year. Losses are running at such a rate that we cannot just make them go away. Through consultation, Post Office Ltd is trying to ensure that it does the best job of getting right what is already a difficult process. That is why it talks to local authorities, sub-postmasters and hon. Members. It then has to make the difficult decisions.</p>
	<p pid="a.480.1/5">If the hon. Gentleman thinks that, within its criteria, the Post Office got it wrong for individual offices in his constituency&mdash;he touched on that&mdash;my advice to him is that the review process operates through Postwatch, which would say to the Post Office that it got it wrong. That starts on a local basis and builds up through the Post Office structure. Ultimately, Allan Leighton, the chairman of Royal Mail Group, will make a final decision. The decision does not come to Ministers, and I believe that that is right. I am not sure that Ministers should make decisions about which post office should close and which should stay open.</p>
	<p pid="a.480.1/6">The financial implications are real. I cannot speak about the individual post offices in Mickleham, Abinger Hammer and the other attractive sounding places in the hon. Gentleman's constituency, but the average cost to Post Office Ltd of the post offices that are closing is &pound;18,000 per branch per year. The Government are committed to subsidising the Post Office network and have contributed a significant amount of money to do so&mdash;&pound;150 million a year&mdash;but even that cannot sustain a network in which three out of four offices lose money. The loss is some &pound;18,000 per branch per year, depending on the individual circumstances of the branch.</p>
	<p pid="a.480.1/7">One of the branches that the hon. Gentleman mentioned appears to be profitable from the sub-postmaster's point of view. I would make two points on that. It may be profitable in terms of a retail business and the post office going together. Post Office Ltd obviously does not take into account the retail side. On the post office side alone, the sub-postmaster does not see the central infrastructure costs&mdash;things such as IT support, delivery of cash to pay benefits, delivery of various Government forms such as passport forms and so on&mdash;for supporting the branch. They do not appear in his or her branch accounts, but when both the central infrastructure costs and the payments to the sub-postmaster themselves are taken into account, three out of four branches lose money, including, I have to say, some relatively busy branches, depending on whether they are close to others and so on.</p>
	<p pid="a.480.1/8">The hon. Gentleman disputed the customer usage figures given to him by Post Office Ltd for some of the individual branches in his constituency. He is right to say that we have asked the company to write to him about how they are calculated. Perhaps I should not go into them today, but the figures indicate that fewer than 200 customer transactions a week take place in some of the branches that he mentioned. I appreciate the value that his local communities put on the branches, but a relatively small number of transactions take place in some of them on a weekly basis.</p>
	<p pid="a.480.1/9">I appreciate the hon. Gentleman's points. I also appreciate the nature of his constituency. Because it has many small villages and towns, it has 29 post offices in the first place. I appreciate that the closure process is difficult, but even with the large subsidies that the Government have put into the network and have guaranteed for the next few years, some closures are, unfortunately, necessary. That is the difficult process that we are going through at present.</p>
	<p pid="a.480.1/10">The Post Office criteria for access are that, broadly speaking, most of the population in urban areas should be within 1 mile of a post office and, in rural areas, within 3 miles. Other factors are also taken into account. If the hon. Gentleman thinks that the criteria are wrong, he should ask Postwatch if it would be willing to refer the decisions on some individual branches to appeal. That is the way to deal with the issue. I cannot make decisions about individual branches, nor should I be able to.</p>
	<p pid="a.480.1/11">The process is difficult, but at the end of it there will still be a larger number of post offices than all the banks put together, and three times as many post offices as outlets of the five major supermarket chains put together. I hope that the network will be more stable in future.</p>
