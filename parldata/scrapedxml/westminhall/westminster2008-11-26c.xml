	<p pid="c.237.6/1">I assume that the hon. Gentleman is talking about the number of people in temporary accommodation, not those in bed and breakfast. There is no doubt that there has been an increase. I understand why local authorities feel the need to use temporary accommodation and there is no question but that, in some cases, people in temporary accommodation&mdash;whether a house or a flat&mdash;live in far better conditions than those in which people in similar situations lived some time ago. However, there is still a problem. The majority of people in temporary accommodation probably live in London and only a small proportion of those&mdash;less than 25 per cent.&mdash;stay in that temporary accommodation for under six months, while about 40 per cent. of people stay in temporary accommodation for two years or more.</p>

	<p pid="c.242.0/1">I am listening carefully to the hon. Gentleman. One area of supply that he has not yet mentioned is the Government purchasing blocks of flats that are unsellable because of the credit crunch and the current economic situation. I know that the Government have put quite a bit of money towards such a scheme; indeed, we discussed it in this Chamber only last week. However, I encourage the Government to go even further and provide more money so that local authorities, housing associations and social landlords can take that stock off the market. It will help the housing market and the economy generally, and it will certainly help homeless people.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-11-26c.243.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1755" speakername="Andrew Smith" colnum="243"  time="009:55:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm081126/halltext/81126h0002.htm#08112642000560">
	<p pid="c.243.0/1">This is a vital subject, especially in areas under as much housing stress as Oxford. I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1902" name="Neil Gerrard">the Member for Walthamstow (Mr. Gerrard)</phrase> on securing the debate and on his excellent speech.</p>
	<p pid="c.243.0/2">Underpinning all our discussion is the shortage of affordable housing in general, and social housing in particular. In welcoming the announced bringing forward of capital spending for housing, I urge my hon. Friends to ensure that some of it is in Oxford and, moreover, that the Minister looks hard at how to bring forward the planning decisions that are essential to providing the housing that we need in Oxford and in other areas.</p>
	<p pid="c.243.0/3">I know that other Members want to speak, so I shall keep my remarks succinct. As my hon. Friend the Member for Walthamstow acknowledged, there has been a decline in the number of people in temporary housing. That is welcome, especially when it results from genuinely preventive work, such as mediation to help avoid family breakdown. However, that welcome fall in the headline rate cannot disguise the fact that underlying problems remain, not least because one way that councils, including Oxford, prevent statutory homelessness is by encouraging people&mdash;for example, through help with deposits&mdash;to move into the private rented sector.</p>
	<p pid="c.243.0/4">It is important to understand that people who are moved into the private rented sector often see themselves as being worse off, and in many respects they are. If they are in temporary accommodation, they can expect a social rented tenancy in the future, with less chance of having to move in the meantime; but in the private sector they are all too often in temporary accommodation, on a six month or yearly tenancy, with no priority for social housing and no long-term prospect of anywhere affordable.</p>
	<p pid="c.243.0/5">The other consequence, as my hon. Friend the Member for Walthamstow mentioned, is that whichever form of temporary accommodation people are in, rent levels are such, especially in high-demand areas such as Oxford and London, the disincentives to work are enormous. In February this year, of 130 households in temporary accommodation provided directly by Oxford city council, only five included someone in work. I am sure that can be multiplied across the country.</p>
	<p pid="c.243.0/6">The situation gives rise to at least five big policy implications. The first is the need to consider whether the current requirement to give &quot;reasonable preference&quot; to those in temporary accommodation is fair in the circumstances. As I said, it does not look fair to those who have been forced into private rented accommodation.</p>
	<p pid="c.243.0/7">Secondly, there is a need to raise standards in the private rented sector, both because the sector is important in its own right and because it houses many who would previously have been in more tightly regulated temporary accommodation, with all the shortcomings mentioned by my hon. Friend. That underlines points that I have previously made to the Minister&mdash;we look forward to showing him the situation when he visits Oxford in the near future&mdash;in particular, about the need for city-wide regulation of houses in multiple occupation and the licensing of landlords.</p>
	<p pid="c.243.0/8">The third policy implication was mentioned by my hon. Friend the Member for Walthamstow. It is the need to address the disincentives to work and to explore extending the sort of approach that was piloted in the Working Future project in East London. Although the project involved only relatively small numbers of people, those taking part who received the additional rent subsidy had a 40 per cent. higher rate of job entry than those in the control group, who received similar treatment but without the subsidies. Without doubt, such initiatives, along with wider reform of the benefit system, must form part of the answer.</p>
	<p pid="c.243.0/9">Fourthly, and obviously&mdash;we are all stressing this point&mdash;we should build more affordable homes and accelerate social housing provision, which is long overdue. I agree with the point made by my hon. Friend: single homeless people must be included in the provision. If they are not, the consequences for lives and communities will be devastating.</p>
	<p pid="c.243.0/10">Finally&mdash;this point has not been mentioned yet&mdash;I urge my hon. Friend the Minister and his colleagues to bin the Chartered Institute of Housing's ludicrous proposal to end security of tenure for council tenants, whether new or existing, which would in effect turn all social housing into temporary housing. That would be grotesquely unfair to council and other social tenants, and would be disastrous for communities, because it would create concentrated ghettos of the most disadvantaged people and deepen the spiral of worklessness, which, as I just said, is such a problem. I hope that my hon. Friend will make it clear that the Government will have no truck with that proposal.</p>

	<p pid="c.247.0/1">Does the hon. Gentleman agree that there have been some particularly egregious cases in which local authority housing departments have rented very large, expensive houses when that is not the best value for public money? That has had the effect both of wasting money and of stoking the prejudices that are often evidenced in the national press, especially in the <i>Evening Standard, </i>against those who are homeless or in need of affordable housing.</p>

	<p pid="c.247.1/1">Yes, the <i>Evening Standard </i>and other papers seem quick to find someone who has been housed in a particularly valuable home so that they can blame the tenant for being placed there by a local authority. Such a story becomes quite unpleasant and intrudes on that person's life. The reality is that the person probably had no choice about where they were placed. If it is a good property, that is fine, but such stories detract from the real issue, which is the cost to all of us of the private rented system. It is time for us to look at the models that successfully operate in many other parts of the world. There are better systems for registration of private and rented authorities, much better inspection and much tougher standards on the operation of them.</p>
	<p pid="c.247.1/2">It is fairly clear that when one is in the ultra-commercial private rented sector, conditions are often very good. We are talking about extremely high rents in central London. The conditions are good; there are concierges, caretakers, repair teams and all the rest. However, the rented properties leased to local authorities, or rented to tenants nominated by local authorities, are appalling. Repairs are not done. The properties are often vermin-infested, dangerous and totally unsuitable for children. Is it not time that we were much tougher on regulation, and that we brought in rent regulation?</p>
	<p pid="c.247.1/3">The Labour Government of 1974 managed to introduce rent regulation. Harold Wilson, the then Prime Minister, threatened to keep the House sitting throughout August unless that piece of legislation went through. Well done him. He showed determination to do something about the scandal of the private rented sector. I hope that in this crisis we will be prepared to make similar efforts to protect people.</p>
	<p pid="c.247.1/4">The losers in temporary accommodation are vulnerable people, and the children who have to move schools frequently and cannot build up a network of friends. The community also loses out because there is no stability and people cannot contribute to school governing bodies, tenants' associations and residents' groups and all the rest. We end up with an increasingly fractured, transient society. What we desperately need is stability through secure, affordable rented accommodation delivered mainly through local authorities, as our party has always campaigned for and proudly delivered in the past to many people in desperate housing need.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-11-26c.248.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1777" speakername="Karen Buck" colnum="248"  time="010:14:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm081126/halltext/81126h0002.htm#08112642000568">
	<p pid="c.248.0/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1902" name="Neil Gerrard">the Member for Walthamstow (Mr. Gerrard)</phrase> on securing this debate. I introduced a debate on temporary accommodation a year ago, and a number of the points remain valid. I will be reinforcing many of the issues that my hon. Friends have raised.</p>
	<p pid="c.248.0/2">In dealing with the current housing situation, we seem to want to pursue a number of incompatible objectives. Individually, such objectives might be entirely reasonable, but they are not consistent with each other. For example, we want to reduce the number of households living in temporary accommodation, which is absolutely unarguable. Temporary accommodation is not a good thing, nor is it a desirable place to be. We also want to reduce expenditure on housing benefit, yet one of the strategies that we are adopting is to divert people from temporary accommodation and move them into private-sector leasing, which can be even more expensive.</p>
	<p pid="c.248.0/3">We want to achieve the target of reducing temporary accommodation by 50 per cent. However, we do not want to do it in such a way that we increase overcrowding or pressure on the social housing stock. I am afraid I have to tell my hon. Friend that that is completely impossible. We want to maintain the Department for Communities and Local Government's code of practice on the limited use of out of borough temporary accommodation placements. None the less, we want to cut expenditure on temporary accommodation, which has the perverse consequence of encouraging the use of out of borough placements.</p>
	<p pid="c.248.0/4">For understandable and, in many cases, good reasons, we are in a mess. Part of the problem is that we desired to use the example of the successful and sensible decision to set a target for ending the use of bed-and-breakfast accommodation and apply it to temporary accommodation. We have done that in a way that has had a number of perverse consequences.</p>
	<p pid="c.248.0/5">I shall run through a few points. I cannot apologise for the fact that they will be stressing the same issues that my hon. Friends have raised. We must remember that we are dealing with real human beings who are going through the homelessness process. I am sorry to say that our approach to homeless households is one that we do not adopt for anyone in need of services and support in any other area of public policy. If someone is sick, we do not say, &quot;It does not matter how good your doctor is, because if you are sick, you will just be very grateful to have a doctor.&quot; If someone has a child coming up to school age, we do not say, &quot;If you are desperate to have your child educated, it does not matter how bad the education is because you will just be very pleased to have a school for your child.&quot; Yet, when it comes to housing people who are in housing need or homeless, we adopt an approach that is fundamentally no different from the Poor Law Amendment Act 1834, which says that if someone is in housing need, it does not matter in what conditions they are housed because they are so desperate for a home that they will be grateful. That is the legal position adopted by local authorities when determining their duties under housing legislation.</p>
	<p pid="c.248.0/6">In my surgeries, time and time again I see people from the borough of Westminster who have been told that if they make a housing application, they will be housed in Barking and Dagenham or Walthamstow. If they refuse the accommodation that they are offered, the case will be classed as &quot;duty discharged&quot;. We then end up with a situation such as this:</p>
	<p pid="c.248.0/7" class="indent">&quot;I take this opportunity to write to you and explain my situation. I am a family man of 5 children and a wife, my children are from the ages of 14 years old, 12 years old, 10 years old, 8 years old and a baby boy of 7 months old.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="c.248.0/8">He said that he was living near the Harrow road,</p>
	<p pid="c.248.0/9" class="indent">&quot;near to members of my family, my brothers and sisters. On the 16 of January I was asked by the court to evacuate as the landlord was not up to date with the mortgage payment, at the time I was paying rent direct to his agent...On the date of my evacuation I went to the Westminster Housing service...for advice and was asked to fill in an application for temporary homeless, and I was then put up in a hotel in east London.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="c.248.0/10">His wife suffers from numerous health problems and is registered in Paddington. He said:</p>
	<p pid="c.248.0/11" class="indent">&quot;My children attend a school in the Westminster area which makes this difficult for us to commute every morning. In March, the council offered us an accommodation in Victoria&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="c.248.0/12">However, the property was too small for the family and was not of a decent standard. The individual in question refused the offer and the case went to review. The housing offer was cancelled and he added:</p>
	<p pid="c.248.0/13" class="indent">&quot;From the 7th of July my family and I will be homeless. I was wondering if there is any way you could help in this matter&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="c.248.0/14">In other words, if accommodation is not in a location or condition that families feel able to accept, the duty to them has been discharged, and they end up on the streets. In many cases a slightly perverse consequence is that they end up being supported by social services in the same local authority where the housing department has discharged the duty, at a fantastic cost. Social workers from that very local authority ring me to ask whether there is anything I can do about a family, because their housing authority has refused, and the social workers are acting as housing officers because so many families are caught in those difficult circumstances.</p>
	<p pid="c.248.0/15">My hon. Friend the Member for Walthamstow mentioned out of borough nominations, which is a persistent and serious problem in my constituency. A family came to see me two weeks ago. They had lived in the Church street area of Westminster since Mr. A was born. The two younger children are in a school in Church street, and the family now commute daily from Barking to bring the children to school. Families do that all the time, having decided that the school is the one place of safety and stability in their entire turbulent family life. They commute with their children an hour and a half in the morning and at the end of the day, at huge expense, to keep the children in a stable environment. Mr. A works near Marble Arch, and Mrs. A is the registered full-time carer for her father-in-law, who also lives in Church street. In my view such a case is in clear breach of the code of guidance applied by the local authority. It is under review at the moment so I do not know what the outcome will be, but it strikes me as a case in which the principle of the code of guidance, that families with a clear local connection and good reasons for remaining in a community should be assisted in doing so, should be applied.</p>
	<p pid="c.248.0/16">In a third case, from a little while ago, a lady, Mrs. S, wrote to me:</p>
	<p pid="c.248.0/17" class="indent">&quot;I used in live in Harrow Road...I was moved to Dagenham three years ago by Westminster after I separated from my husband after domestic violence...My husband, who was coming to see my son, knew that because I was isolated from my family and friends and vulnerable, he could dominate me easily...I now feel more vulnerable than ever. I asked...for help and support by transferring me back to the...area where all my friends and family are but they refused. Being a Muslim it is much more difficult to socialize in this part of London&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="c.248.0/18">Of course there is a further dimension in that case, which is the housing of homeless families from black and minority ethnic communities in parts of the city where community cohesion is a real and pressing problem.</p>
	<p pid="c.248.0/19">What makes the matter worse at present is the fact that several temporary accommodation leases are coming to an end, partly because of pressure to achieve the target of a 50 per cent. reduction in the use of temporary accommodation. That means that families, some of whom have already had eight different temporary addresses&mdash;in my borough there are families who have stayed in temporary accommodation for up to a decade, making the term something of a misnomer&mdash;must move yet again. A few weeks ago I was dealing with a family who were due for eviction because the lease on the property came to an end, and who had to sit all day on the pavement, with their young children and their luggage, waiting for alternative accommodation to be provided. In such cases families receive a standard letter:</p>
	<p pid="c.248.0/20" class="indent">&quot;When we offered you your current home we explained that we do not own it&mdash;we lease the property from Notting Hill Housing Association who in turn leases it from the owner. As you may already know the owner wants the property back and we are in the process of ending your tenancy. This means we have to find you somewhere else to live.</p>
	<p pid="c.248.0/21" class="indent">We do not have anything for you at the moment but as soon as we find another home we will contact you. Unfortunately, we cannot say when this will be as we cannot predict when a suitable property will become available. We will try to find you another home before the Court ends your tenancy, however, please contact us immediately if you receive a notice of eviction from the court bailiff.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="c.248.0/22">That tenancy is due to end before Christmas. I know of several others due to end on <phrase class="date" code="2008-12-30">30 December</phrase>, including that of a woman who is the chair of governors of a struggling primary school, where she has been an enormous inspiration to the local area. She has been told that her tenancy will end. There is no indication of how and when alternative accommodation will be provided for her. Some of the families affected will be told to expect to have to go back to bed and breakfast&mdash;after all they have been through, including bed and breakfast in the past&mdash;because there is no comfortable match between the supply of temporary accommodation and their needs.</p>
	<p pid="c.248.0/23">With all those problems, there are about 53,000 households, not including single people, in temporary accommodation at the moment, whose lives are under constant pressure of disruption. As my hon. Friends have said&mdash;I think everyone has made this point&mdash;it is at a fabulous cost to the public purse. The standard charge for our accommodation is &pound;435 a week, which adds up comfortably to &pound;500 million a year just for families in temporary accommodation on housing benefit.</p>
	<p pid="c.248.0/24">My hon. Friends also all said that the situation means that families wanting to work face an impossible hurdle. We understand that around 90 per cent. of households in temporary accommodation are unemployed, compared to a 60 per cent. average for working age households in social housing tenancies as a whole. There is a clear gap that can be explained by no other factor than the sharply steeper rents in private sector leased accommodation and temporary accommodation. It seems strange to me that we did not want to pursue the &quot;Working Futures&quot; model and treat rent through the block grant system in the same way as we would treat people on social tenancies. That would enable people to go back to work.</p>
	<p pid="c.248.0/25">There is much more that we can do. We need to carry on improving the standard of temporary accommodation, because although some properties are in good condition still too many are not. We need to deal with the issues of work incentives and people on housing benefit; we need to deal with out of borough nominations, and to enforce the code of practice in the interest of community cohesion, family stability and mixed communities. We need to review the application of the 50 per cent. reduction target for temporary accommodation. It is having a catastrophic effect on transfers for people already in social rented accommodation, and leading to perverse consequences in the private leased sector, which has given rise to all the high-profile cases on which the media have recently reported.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-11-26c.252.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1445" speakername="Sarah Teather" colnum="252"  time="010:29:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm081126/halltext/81126h0003.htm#08112642000572">
	<p pid="c.252.1/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1902" name="Neil Gerrard">the hon. Member for Walthamstow (Mr. Gerrard)</phrase> on securing this vital debate and I agree entirely with the points that he made. The real problem with temporary accommodation is how long people often remain in that situation.</p>
	<p pid="c.252.1/2">I also agree strongly with <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1777" name="Karen Buck">the hon. Member for Regent's Park and Kensington, North (Ms Buck)</phrase>, who made a typically thoughtful and insightful speech on housing. I have exchanged views with her in many such debates, and I think that her constituency is similar to mine in this regard. She made the point that we often treat people who are homeless far worse than we would treat anybody else who is vulnerable.</p>
	<p pid="c.252.1/3">Something about having a home and the nature of that home is critical to a person's identity, but all too often, because of rationing, we give people the bare minimum and make them beg for it. The fact that local authorities force people to wait on their doorsteps with their belongings around them and their children in their arms is but one example. Local authorities all over the country do it because they do not want the extra cost of a night in accommodation and because accommodation is so scarce.</p>
	<p pid="c.252.1/4">I have a couple of examples from my constituency that address many of the points made by hon. Members. Miss A, a single mother with four children, has been in temporary accommodation since 1997. She has moved many times since, but has been in her current property for three years. She has medical problems, but none that would require her to be upgraded, so under the Locata system&mdash;the choice-based letting scheme&mdash;she is in band C. That means that she is in housing need, but that she has not got a cat's chance in hell of moving within the time it will take for her children to grow up. She bids every fortnight, but is getting nowhere.</p>
	<p pid="c.252.1/5">Ms D lives in two-bedroom accommodation. She has been in temporary accommodation for seven years and lives with her two adult granddaughters, aged 20 and 21. The 21-year-old is eight months pregnant and has sickle cell disease, and the accommodation is in a poor state of repair.</p>
	<p pid="c.252.1/6">I am afraid that I see an awful lot of cases like those. Predominantly, London Members are here today, but the problem is one that hon. Members right across the country speak about. The cases are devastating to listen to and extremely frustrating, as one knows that it will be difficult to get the people involved moved on. The problem, particularly for children, as many hon. Members have mentioned, is the frequency with which people in temporary accommodation move. The hon. Member for Regent's Park and Kensington, North spoke about how much travelling parents often do with their children. I have many similar examples; I am afraid that my local authority often places people in Hackney.</p>
	<p pid="c.252.1/7">The difficulty is not just cost, which the hon. Members for Islington, North (Jeremy Corbyn) and for Regent's Park and Kensington, North mentioned, but availability of accommodation. That lies at the root of the matter; it is about supply. Lack of supply creates lack of choice about where to place people, and they are often placed a long way from their homes and families, usually when they are at their most vulnerable&mdash;not necessarily when they are given long-term placements in temporary accommodation, where they may have some chance to establish themselves, but usually when they arrive at the housing department, having been evicted or having become completely homeless, and the local authority tries to decide whether it has a duty to house them. Those occasions are particularly stressful for families. Because of the lack of decent temporary accommodation, people often end up being moved long distances from where they live.</p>
	<p pid="c.252.1/8">A number of hon. Members, including the hon. Member for Walthamstow, spoke about the difficulty of keeping work while moving around, but I agree with other hon. Members that the issue is more about the combination of housing benefit and high rents, and the disincentive to work that that creates. Even though the new policies allow people a period in which they do not lose their housing benefit, most families know that, in the long term, if they are paying high rents in temporary accommodation or private accommodation in which they were not placed by the council, they know that it is simply not worth it&mdash;and the cost to the taxpayer is enormous.</p>
	<p pid="c.252.1/9">The issue of poor standards has been raised; I mentioned it in relation to one of the cases I spoke about a few moments ago. The hon. Member for Islington, North discussed some local authorities' over-closeness with particular agencies, but we must also be realistic about the fact that a lot of private landlords do not want people on housing benefit placed in their property. Most local authorities are not terribly good at administering housing benefit, especially if people go in and out of work or their circumstances change, which creates a disincentive for landlords because they know that the rent will not be paid on time. How many cases have we all dealt with in our local areas where housing benefit has been overpaid and then withdrawn for extended periods? It is unfortunately no wonder that there is a disincentive for private landlords who rely on housing benefit for their income to take people in that situation.</p>
	<p pid="c.252.1/10"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1755" name="Andrew Smith">The right hon. Member for Oxford, East (Mr. Smith)</phrase> raised a number of interesting points about quality in the private sector. Over-regulation is a danger. Particularly now, when we are trying to get private property back into use, we do not want to create an incentive to leave it empty. I am rather more attracted to the idea of landlord accreditation schemes, which a number of local authorities have begun. I wonder whether we can encourage such schemes to become more common and to raise the bar for standards.</p>
	<p pid="c.252.1/11">The hon. Member for Walthamstow mentioned people in hostels. I have an example in my constituency and just this week I was discussing the issue with Octavia housing association. Four or five years ago, just after I was elected, I opened one of its hostels to house young people leaving care. It was supposed to be a supported housing centre to ensure that young people can move on to independence, but the truth, as he said, is that most never move on because there is nowhere for them to go.</p>
	<p pid="c.252.1/12">I am afraid that all the problems that I have discussed come back to supply, and I shall take a few minutes to mention a couple of the issues. It is likely that the difficulties will only get worse along with the economic situation and that we will see an increase in the number of people whose homes are repossessed, the number who arrive at the council's door asking to be housed and the number who are left waiting with their belongings around them and their children in their arms, housed in temporary accommodation and then moved on and on. We know that that will happen.</p>
	<p pid="c.252.1/13">The Government's priority needs to be to keep people in their homes for as long as possible. I recognise that the Government have made advances on that, and I support much of what they have said on the issue of repossessions, but I do not think that the pre-action protocol that came into force recently goes far enough.</p>
	<p pid="c.252.1/14">I am disappointed that the Government have not taken advantage of the Banking Bill, which is likely to finish its progress through the House of Commons today, to update mortgage law, much of which is extremely outdated. I do not think that there is any place for remedies such as foreclosure. The Government could have amended the Bill so that the courts had the teeth to deal with the things that they want the courts to deal with to ensure that people have a chance to stay in their homes if they can repay their debt over a long period.</p>
	<p pid="c.252.1/15">I also want the Government to make it a priority to tackle commercial mortgage rescue products, which, again, will only increase the number of people arriving into temporary accommodation. I have seen this in my constituency. People are encouraged to allow their houses to be bought out at a fraction of their value, and one knows that in 12 months' time those people will be evicted and will land at the council's door. The Office of Fair Trading has recommended that the Government tackle it, but they still have not responded. Now is the time to respond. The matter is urgent, and I hope that the Government will ensure that such products are properly regulated by the Financial Services Authority.</p>
	<p pid="c.252.1/16">I hope that the Minister will make it easier for housing associations and councils to buy up land now, while it is cheap, as well as suitable property, to ensure that we can house many of the people in desperate need. I recognise that the pre-Budget report included &pound;770 million more for that purpose. Of course, &pound;400 million of that had already been announced, but there is no reason why the Government could not front-load the money that has already been allocated in the comprehensive spending review for this area, which would also ensure that we unblocked those obstacles that are preventing housing associations from building now.</p>
	<p pid="c.252.1/17">The issue for housing associations is that their social build has relied on cross-subsidy from private sales and shared equity, and we know that, at the moment, that subsidy is not coming through. Unless the Government are prepared to accept that, in the short term, each unit will require higher subsidy, there is no way that those units will be built and we will end up in a worse situation at the end of this economic crisis than we are in now.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-11-26c.254.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1917" speakername="Grant Shapps" colnum="254"  time="010:40:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm081126/halltext/81126h0003.htm#08112642000573">
	<p pid="c.254.0/1">I start by congratulating <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1902" name="Neil Gerrard">the hon. Member for Walthamstow (Mr. Gerrard)</phrase> on securing an excellent debate on a subject that I know he cares about a great deal. Temporary accommodation and homelessness is a subject that I have spent a lot of time dealing with in the last couple of years.</p>
	<p pid="c.254.0/2">A couple of figures mentioned at the beginning of the debate go against the official records. The Department for Communities and Local Government says that, on <phrase class="date" code="2008-03-31">31 March</phrase>, there were 78,000 homeless households in England in temporary accommodation, which is nearly twice as many as in 1997. It also says that three quarters of those households in temporary accommodation contain children who are dependants. Indeed, I published a report a year ago almost to the day that showed that there are 130,000 homeless children living in various forms of temporary accommodation, which is double the number 10 years ago.</p>
	<p pid="c.254.0/3">Those are the facts. What about the reasons? It seems clear that the lack of supply has been the biggest contributory factor to those enlarged figures and the supply side has created a range of problems. It does not really matter whether one is looking at temporary accommodation, lack of social or affordable housing, or housing in general. As has been discussed many times in similar debates, for every type of housing fewer houses have been built in the last decade, which I know is as deeply troubling to many Labour Members as it is to us in the Conservative party.</p>
	<p pid="c.254.0/4">The simple lack of housing provision has led to many of the chronic problems that were described today in great detail, with individual case histories being provided during the debate. As was mentioned, it is a fact that only 27,000 affordable homes will be built this year. It will be interesting to hear a projection for next year from the Minister.</p>
	<p pid="c.254.0/5">One of the key issues that has emerged from this morning's debate is the problem of lack of provision for people who are not priority cases. Had I had more time, I would have outlined a case that I encountered in my surgery a few weeks ago. At 5 pm on a Friday, the local council was saying, &quot;Sorry, we've gone as far as we can, we've gone beyond our statutory duty and we cannot help you,&quot; yet I was sitting in my surgery with a man who had nowhere to go and nowhere to sleep over the weekend other than his car, where he had spent the week beforehand. I appreciate that simply adding more people to the priority list is not an answer in itself, because it just makes the priority list larger. Once again, however, the overall lack of housing and the failure to provide supply are the central cause and problem that absolutely must be addressed by this Government, or indeed the next.</p>
	<p pid="c.254.0/6">There is another problem, which is very revealing. In conversation, Charles Fraser&mdash;chief executive of St. Mungo's, which is a large London charity&mdash;told me that back in the 1980s 84 per cent. of the people living in its hostels were in work, but nowadays just 4 per cent. are in work.</p>
	<p pid="c.254.0/7">That problem of worklessness, which is due to factors such as a change in the profile of available jobs, creates an additional layer of difficulty, as does the fact that housing benefit means that there is a positive disincentive for people to get back into work, as was mentioned earlier. It is verging on criminal that it is more expensive for people to go out and do something productive than it is for them to claim housing benefit. On many occasions in the many hostels that I have visited, I have spoken to people who are distressed beyond belief by that situation&mdash;it is an urgent case of a priority review.</p>
	<p pid="c.254.0/8">In a Westminster Hall debate a couple of weeks ago, I pressed the Minister for Housing as to when the Government will pronounce on that review. There was a suggestion that it would be before the end of the year. I take it that that will not now be the case and I urge the Minister who is here today to tell us when the review might take place.</p>

	<p pid="c.256.7/1">I do not want to get too far off the subject. The simple facts are that, on average, 145,000 homes have built each year under this Government, compared with 175,000 under the previous Government, meaning that over 10 years about a third of a million fewer homes have been built. If those homes had been built and were in play and in the marketplace, it is reasonable to expect that rents would be lower.</p>
	<p pid="c.256.7/2">That situation is what we need to get back to, but we cannot do it through top-down targets; we need to do it through bottom-up incentives. That is a fundamental argument at the heart of this debate and every other debate on housing that takes place here in Westminster Hall. Until the Government recognise that they cannot force the targets down on unsuspecting communities without giving them something in return&mdash;those communities need to be provided with a carrot or an incentive to build new homes&mdash;we will continue in the mess that we find ourselves in today. Labour Members are happy to complain about that mess, but they will not recognise the source or the real reasons behind the catastrophic situation in relation to temporary housing, homelessness and, indeed, the cost of housing overall.</p>
	<p pid="c.256.7/3">I will end soon because I want to hear the Minister's response, not least how he will build more homes than the Government have managed to do in the last few years. Before I finish, however, I want to ask a number of questions. First, there was an announcement of &pound;750 million&mdash;I think that was the figure&mdash;in the pre-Budget report the other day. However, there was no description of how that money would be spent, how it would be brought forward and how it would encourage the creation of more housing. I assume that that money has already been allocated in the budget of the Homes and Communities Agency, so perhaps the Minister will take a minute to explain how that money will ease the housing crisis.</p>
	<p pid="c.256.7/4">Given that we know that there has been less affordable housing built every year in the last 10 years and that the market is likely to crash this year and next, perhaps the Minister will also tell us his estimates of housing numbers in the affordable sector for this year and next.</p>
	<p pid="c.256.7/5">I was interested in the comments by some hon. Members about secure tenure. There now seems to be a tradition of new Housing Ministers coming in about every three months and making some fairly outrageous statements to some newspaper, only to row back from them a few days later. We remember that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1543" name="Caroline Flint">the right hon. Member for Don Valley (Caroline Flint)</phrase>&mdash;now Minister for Europe and predecessor of the current Minister for Housing&mdash;came in and immediately made statements about throwing people who do not work out of their homes, without realising that the local authority would have to house those families if they were in priority need. Will the Minister explain whether that policy is on or off the table?</p>
	<p pid="c.256.7/6">Finally, on security of tenure, will the Minister say whether that is an idea put forward by the Minister for Housing, or is it simply an idea from a think-tank?</p>

	<p pid="c.257.0/1">It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Mr. Gale. Earlier this year, you ably steered the Housing and Regeneration Bill Committee, in which many of the issues that we have discussed today were initially raised. I am grateful to you for presiding over an excellent debate, albeit a sombre one&mdash;as befits the subject. I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1902" name="Neil Gerrard">the Member for Walthamstow (Mr. Gerrard)</phrase> on securing the debate and on the excellent way in which he advanced his argument, and I congratulate other hon. Members from both sides of the House on the quality of their speeches.</p>
	<p pid="c.257.0/2">Tackling homelessness and reducing fear about housing, as well as housing policy in general, are at the heart of what the Government want to do&mdash;they are at the top of our domestic priorities. We have achieved a lot in recent years by making substantial and sustained cuts in the worst form of homelessness; namely, rough sleeping. Hon. Members will be aware that I was able to announce last week our new rough sleeping strategy, which states our ambition to end rough sleeping once and for all by 2012. That target will be incredibly challenging and difficult to achieve, but if we have focus and determination, and if we work in partnership with local authorities and the voluntary sector, we will achieve it.</p>
	<p pid="c.257.0/3">We have also ended the long-term reliance on bed and breakfast accommodation for families, and we are well on the way to ending it for 16 and 17-year-olds. I was pleased that hon. Members from both sides of the House acknowledged the great advances that we have made on that in the past decade. There have been reductions of more than 50 per cent. in new cases of statutory homelessness since 2004. Subsequently, numbers in temporary accommodation have fallen by 26 per cent. In 2008, the number has fallen by 11 per cent., from 87,120 to 77,510. My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1677" name="David Taylor">the Member for North-West Leicestershire (David Taylor)</phrase> said that in his region&mdash;the east midlands&mdash;the target to reduce the number of households living in temporary accommodation by 50 per cent. by 2010 has already been achieved. It has also already been achieved in the south-east and north-east.</p>
	<p pid="c.257.0/4">There is a lot to be proud of on temporary accommodation, but I do not want to be complacent. There is an awful lot left to be done. We are committed to reducing, as much as possible, reliance on temporary accommodation, but I am under no illusion, given the current economic circumstances, about the challenges we face. The main task for the Government is ensuring that we minimise, as far as possible, the number of people who are forced to lose their home through repossession or other means. I was taken with what <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1445" name="Sarah Teather">the hon. Member for Brent, East (Sarah Teather)</phrase> said about that. It is important: people are frightened that they will lose their homes, and the Government are determined to do all it takes to ensure that they do not.</p>
	<p pid="c.257.0/5">The hon. Lady will be aware of the announcements in Monday's pre-Budget report. The Government will help to protect people who are at risk of repossession by driving through support for vulnerable households via the mortgage rescue scheme, providing direct support for some individuals through support for the mortgage interest regime, and ensuring that we have fair treatment by lenders, with lenders absolutely committed not to initiate repossession proceedings within at least three months of an account going into arrears. We are committed to working with lenders to create sustainable solutions to help borrowers to stay in their homes.</p>
	<p pid="c.257.0/6">My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1777" name="Karen Buck">the Member for Regent's Park and Kensington, North (Ms Buck)</phrase> mentioned something that disturbed and concerned me. She talked about a family who were renting in the private rented sector losing their home through no fault of their own, because the landlord had failed to pay the mortgage. I will work on that problem to see what can be done. I am worried that vulnerable households&mdash;through no fault of their own&mdash;may be at risk of losing their homes because landlords have not paid. I am keen to work on that problem and to put something solid in place.</p>
	<p pid="c.257.0/7">Because of the lack of certainty about the future and the disruption caused by frequent moves, which has been made all too clear in the debate, we need to do much more. About 87 per cent.&mdash;92 per cent. of families with children&mdash;are now living in self-contained temporary accommodation, with their own front door and cooking and washing facilities. However, as has been made clear to me this morning, they are not settled homes, because people do not feel at all stable or secure in them. That is why we are retaining the target to halve the number of households in temporary accommodation.</p>
	<p pid="c.257.0/8">The point about cleanliness and standards in temporary accommodation was also well made in the debate. I met Professor Suzanne Fitzpatrick from the university of York earlier this year, who presented me with the key findings of research into the causes and impacts of statutory homelessness for families and 16 and 17-year-olds in England. It is the first nationally representative survey of families and children who have been homeless for more than 10 years, and the first such survey of 16 and 17-year-olds. The findings are incredibly interesting.</p>
	<p pid="c.257.0/9">As hon. Members would expect, the research shows greater incidences of problems with physical conditions in self-contained temporary accommodation compared with settled housing. However, interestingly, there seems to be no substantial difference between self-contained temporary accommodation and settled housing in respect of the state of repair or the levels of cleanliness when families first arrive. As hon. Members would expect, the research shows that although the homelessness system is working well, families and children have an improved quality of life once they are in settled housing. That underlines the importance of pressing forward on meeting the temporary accommodation target.</p>

	<p pid="c.259.0/1">Will the Minister comment on the departmental code of practice on out of borough placements? We are talking about settled accommodation, but being settled a long way from the community in which one has schools, employment, family and friends is important. There is a code of practice, and it should be enforced.</p>

	<p pid="c.259.1/1">I was going to mention that later, but as we are on the subject, there is an inter-borough agreement on the issue. It is worrying. I know that my hon. Friend has had meetings on the matter with the previous housing Minister, my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1543" name="Caroline Flint">the Member for Don Valley (Caroline Flint)</phrase>. In early December, I will meet officials of Westminster city council and I will raise that key issue along with other things that arose from a previous meeting, especially the problem of overcrowding. The matter is important. I am instructing my officials to work closely with London councils to encourage all boroughs to abide fully by the agreement. I agree that more can be done, and if I have time later in my speech I will mention the wider prospect of supply and its importance.</p>
	<p pid="c.259.1/2">Key to achieving the target is prevention. We need to ensure that we do not have a reactive, ad hoc approach to producing temporary accommodation to solve the problem. Intervening at the trigger points when people might become homeless, and fully involving friends, family and the wider community to stop people reaching crisis point, is absolutely crucial. We have achieved our successes by encouraging and providing significant investment in homelessness prevention. Approximately a third of local authorities have already met the 2010 target. They have strengthened their efforts, and provide prevention services such as rent deposit schemes, mediation to help resolve family and relationship breakdowns or problems between tenants and landlords, and debt counselling. Last year, 201 local authorities operated rent deposit schemes and a further 45 were planning to put such a scheme in place. That proves that private rented accommodation is an effective housing option for preventing homelessness and providing a means of settled accommodation, when it is what the household wants.</p>
	<p pid="c.259.1/3">Many hon. Members mentioned the housing benefit regime, which is crucial, and my hon. Friend the Member for Walthamstow asked a question about it last Tuesday in the House. Everyone is aware that local authorities must administer the local housing allowance, which was introduced in April 2008, in accordance with regulations. Local authorities can, and in the vast majority of cases do, take responsible decisions about providing housing for families in their area. However, as was said time and again in the debate, perverse disincentives ensure that people who are reliant on housing benefit do not work.</p>
	<p pid="c.259.1/4">Questions were asked about whether the taxpayer gets value for money from the housing benefit regime. That is why there has been housing benefit reform to ensure that we can provide value for money and improve standards. Officials in the Departments for Communities and Local Government and for Work and Pensions and others are working closely together on developing proposals to reform the way in which housing benefit subsidy is calculated and paid to local authorities for people in temporary accommodation.</p>

	<p pid="c.268.2/1">It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Mr. Gale, and through you I thank Mr. Speaker for allowing this debate, which is important for many people across the country.</p>
	<p pid="c.268.2/2">I have always thought that, for a parliamentary democracy to work, everybody in the country should feel that somebody is speaking up for them. Sex education is one of those subjects where, for far too long, we have had a cosy consensus of all the political parties and have accepted that a never-ending increase in sex education is the only possible solution to the problems of teenage pregnancies, unwanted pregnancies and sexually transmitted diseases. Many people in the country are, like me, rather nervous about that and feel that it is perhaps more the cause of the problem than the solution. I intend to mention some reasons why I think sex education has failed in this country and some examples that we can learn from in other countries, and I want to find out what the Government's plans are for the future.</p>
	<p pid="c.268.2/3">My starting point is that I am philosophically against sex education in schools, because in far too many cases we are taking responsibilities away from parents. Being a parent is a responsible position; it is a big thing and with it comes big obligations that parents cannot farm out to the state and things that they have to do for themselves. I am a parent of two young boys. I understand my responsibilities to my children and do not take them lightly. Part of the problem in this country is that we have a culture in which the Government basically says to people, including parents, &quot;These are your responsibilities, but if you don't perform them, don't worry&mdash;it doesn't matter, it's not a problem&mdash;because we'll do them for you. We'll take these responsibilities away from you.&quot; That is a dangerous slippery slope for the country to go down.</p>
	<p pid="c.268.2/4">People say that some parents are not capable of teaching their children about sex education. I have no doubt that some parents find it a tricky subject, but I am equally sure that many teachers do not teach it particularly well, either. Using a minority of people who find it difficult as an example for scrapping the whole thing seems to me to be rather pointless.</p>

	<p pid="c.268.3/1">I admire the hon. Gentleman's total confidence in parents, which for the most part we must have, but what about children who are being abused within the family home? Is there not a case for sex and relationship education in relation to such situations?</p>

	<p pid="c.268.4/1">There are always children who are taken into care by the state and obviously the state has a responsibility in respect of their parents, but the example that the hon. Lady gives is not a reason for having compulsory sex education for every child, of whatever age, who goes to school. That is the direction in which this Government are taking us. If she thinks that we should treat certain individuals on an exceptional basis, I might be sympathetic to that idea, but I do not have a universal belief in the beauty and desirability of sex education in schools.</p>
	<p pid="c.268.4/2">The point is that this is not all about sex education. Much of the argument is about the fact that parents should be, above all else, responsible for the moral upbringing of their children. That cannot be farmed out to the state. It is a parental responsibility. As a parent, I do not want my children to go to school to have the moral compass and values of the teacher instilled in them. That is my job and my responsibility. I want my children to go to school to learn about the things that I cannot teach them, not about the things that are my direct responsibility.</p>

	<p pid="c.270.0/1">I apologise if I gave the impression that every teacher agrees with me. I was trying to make the opposite point, which is that not every teacher agrees with the idea that sex education is a good thing. The position that is often portrayed is that all parents and teachers think that this is a universally good thing. My point is that some people disagree. I take it from the hon. Gentleman's intervention that he acknowledges that people disagree on the issue. There is not just one view.</p>
	<p pid="c.270.0/2">I forgive the hon. Gentleman for missing the first minute or so of my speech; he did not miss anything of great noteworthiness. I also forgive him for disagreeing with his own union, because I often find myself in the unfortunate position of disagreeing with my party from time to time. I think we can forgive him on all counts.</p>
	<p pid="c.270.0/3">I might set aside my philosophical objections to sex education in schools if I could be persuaded that there was an overwhelming case for it and that it was a roaring triumph, but the opposite seems to be the case and, at best, that indicates that sex education makes no positive difference to the things it was set up to tackle. For example, the earliest figures I have show that in 1994 there were 7,795 teenage pregnancies among girls under 16. In 2006, the last year for which I have figures, there were 7,800 teenage pregnancies in that age group, which is exactly the same number&mdash;it has not reduced in the slightest&mdash;and it has been even higher in the intervening years.</p>
	<p pid="c.270.0/4">The number of pregnancies among under-19s was 85,000 in 1994 and in 2004, the last year for which I have information, it was 101,000. The problem is getting worse. In England and Wales, the number of abortions for under-16s in 1994 was 3,900, and in 2006 it was 4,700; for under-19s in 1994 it was 29,600 and in 2006 it was 40,500. Surely, if sex education was such a great success, the situation would have improved as there was more and more of it.</p>

	<p pid="c.274.3/1">I understand my hon. Friend's enthusiasm and if it were just a matter of sex education, I would have much sympathy with her point. However, I am conscious that many businesses are struggling in the current economic climate. I am not a big fan of adding huge amounts of red tape to a business's bottom line when it is struggling. It is understandable that businesses might want to shy away from such measures at the moment, but I accept the point that if we were simply looking at sex education, flexible working would certainly help.</p>
	<p pid="c.274.3/2">The article in <i>The Times </i>goes on to make the telling point:</p>
	<p pid="c.274.3/3" class="indent">&quot;The Dutch Government still penalises single mothers under 18, who are expected to live with their parents if they become pregnant. Until six years ago the Government gave them no financial support.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="c.274.3/4">Perhaps people should reflect on whether the operation of the benefit system in Holland is a more important factor than providing lots of sex education in explaining why there is a low rate of teenage pregnancy in that country.</p>
	<p pid="c.274.3/5">A lady called Mena Laura Meyer, who produced the seven-part documentary series &quot;Sexy&quot; for Dutch TV last year, says that sex education is the least relevant aspect of the country's success in having lower levels of teenage pregnancies than other European countries. The article in <i>The Times </i>ends:</p>
	<p pid="c.274.3/6" class="indent">&quot;Maybe, instead of expecting schools to teach children morality and the missionary position, the British should adopt a few other Dutch lessons. Employers could encourage staff to go home at 5pm for a family supper,&quot;</p>
	<p pid="c.274.3/7">which was something my hon. Friend the Member for Basingstoke mentioned. The article continues,</p>
	<p pid="c.274.3/8" class="indent">&quot;parents could discuss contraception with their children, and the BBC could ask David Attenborough to turn his attention to human reproduction.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="c.274.3/9">Although I am not entirely comfortable with all those suggestions, they are probably all better than having a never-ending supply of sex education in our schools.</p>
	<p pid="c.274.3/10">It would not be so bad if standards in our schools were so high that teachers had nothing but sex education to worry about. However, I am afraid that anything but that is true. The Government should be ashamed of the literacy and numeracy rates for school leavers. Some 2,500 pupils failed to achieve functional adequacy in English, and just under 3,500 failed to achieve functional literacy and numeracy. Surely, the Government should concentrate on ensuring that people can read and write when they leave school, rather than taking every opportunity to fill their heads with sex education, which is clearly making no difference whatever. As one parent said:</p>
	<p pid="c.274.3/11" class="indent">&quot;We entrust our teachers to provide our children with a sound education in traditional subjects, not instruct them on explicit sexual matters, which they can neither cope with physically nor emotionally. With failing standards in reading and writing upon leaving primary school, the Government should concentrate on using valuable lesson time on improving the literacy skills of our children.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="c.274.3/12">That is a very good point.</p>

	<p pid="c.279.2/1">I believe that in many places parents can do that, and schools can too. It should happen by consent. In my city, we are interested in putting together a broader package&mdash;not just sex and relationship education, and indeed not just personal, health and social education, which includes the broader relationship possibilities that are taught.

	<p pid="c.279.2/2">If someone has all the relevant social facilities&mdash;the ability to interact and converse, to resolve arguments without violence and to establish clear relationships, as well as an understanding of what it is like to have a family or a baby&mdash;that can be life-changing and life-moulding. Someone with those facilities can do well in life even without great qualifications. I think that great qualifications follow from them. If someone has the currency and vocabulary within them for such social interaction, the rest happens. Such people can create a good family and hold down a job; they will have attainments and, I hope, would go to university or college.</p>
	<p pid="c.279.2/3">I know about the problems in this context from my constituency. One aspect is that we have the lowest number of people who go to university. That is not because of some innate problem with the people in my constituency. It is because often they do not get the chance to make good some of the disadvantages that they suffer, in their early years in particular.</p>
	<p pid="c.279.2/4">It is important that sex and relationship education and other such education are given age-appropriately. The hon. Member for Shipley left in the air an inference that a five-year-old is taught the basics of reproduction. That is not and will not be the case. I feel that such education is very important, and I know that it must be done at an age-appropriate level. That means on occasion&mdash;perhaps in a constituency such as mine, with 218 teenagers having a baby in one year&mdash;that there is a need for them to know about abortion, contraception and the long-acting injection that can provide defence against pregnancy, and about chlamydia and sexually-transmitted diseases.</p>
	<p pid="c.279.2/5">If those people do not know about those things, they will, out of ignorance, make wrong life choices and there will be more little ones growing up like those the hon. Gentleman talked about. They will be in a similar position and the problem will worsen.</p>
	<p pid="c.279.2/6">I agree that we should not be complacent about sex and relationship education. It has its deficiencies, but that is bad sex and relationship education. The hon. Gentleman's argument would be much stronger if he were urging better and improved sex and relationship education, which would benefit people. It is part of broader social and emotional development.</p>
	<p pid="c.279.2/7">One of my criticisms of past Governments would be that they sometimes saw such education as merely a matter of the physical and reproductive, not as a question of relationships and the social interactions that are needed to develop effective people. Speaking as we are in the wake of the Baby P episode and the news of the family in Sheffield this morning, we are clearly not yet raising young people to be effective parents and to optimise their parenting ability. Heaven knows that not only do we need a short-term strategy for resolving the difficulties in particular processes and in particular cases, but that hon. Members need a strategic view on how to ensure that in generations to come we reduce the number of those one-off cases, and allow people to benefit and flourish as individuals, so that they can realise themselves as effective parents.</p>
	<p pid="c.279.2/8">I agree with the hon. Gentleman on parental responsibility to this extent: there are those who cannot exercise the responsibility that he clearly does, and I hope everyone in the Chamber does, and we need to ensure that it is possible for everyone to do so. What is good enough for him and for me is good enough for the kids who are having children in my constituency. The help that they need is not just SRE and education on making good life choices.</p>
	<p pid="c.279.2/9">Those young people, or young mothers&mdash;the hon. Gentleman talked about parents, and I do not mean to pick him up linguistically, but in my experience it is often more correct to talk about one parent&mdash;can benefit incredibly from having a one-to-one relationship with a health visitor who teaches them how to raise their child in a loving way, and teaches that child how to get the best out of school. That takes a little bit of money early on.</p>
	<p pid="c.279.2/10">The hon. Gentleman may know that I am a disciple of early intervention. A pound spent in the early days is worth &pound;100 spent later on. Primary SEAL&mdash;social and emotional aspects of learning&mdash;enables young people who do not get the relevant learning at home to learn the basics of how to get on in life and what to do socially to make the best of themselves.</p>
	<p pid="c.279.2/11">I have one minor criticism of the Government, but I must preface it by saying that this Government, and above all the Minister, have done incredible things in the relevant area. The criticism relates to the space that schools and head teachers need to teach the subject effectively. If they teach SRE and social and emotional development effectively, they will be able to improve their scores. It is not a matter of either/or. It is not possible to crank up achievement without doing something with the raw material and helping youngsters to get better socially and emotionally so that they have the ability to learn.</p>
	<p pid="c.279.2/12">I ask the Minister to think carefully about ensuring that when we introduce PHSE&mdash;I hope it will be called something that mums can understand, and I suggest life skills, not SRE, PHSE or any of the acronyms that we have to confuse people&mdash;heads know that they have the space within the curriculum to cover it effectively. That would be a fantastic contribution.</p>
	<p pid="c.279.2/13">Are parents adequately trained? Are teachers adequately trained? I must agree that no, often they are not. We need to spend much more money on ensuring that teachers are comfortable in talking about sexual intercourse, contraception, abortion or relationship-building, rather than knocking out a few things on the photocopier, handing them out and sending the kids home early. That is no good for anyone. Equally, parents, too, sometimes need to feel a little more relaxed so that they can talk spontaneously to their children about such matters.</p>
	<p pid="c.279.2/14">The hon. Gentleman threw in several ideas that would complement what the Government are doing. It is not a matter of either/or. By all means, let us see whether we can get David Attenborough to do a documentary. I do not have a problem with that. Perhaps the Minister can take that idea away and ask Sir David to do a video. We are doing a great video with single mums in Nottingham, funded by One Nottingham, the organisation that I chair. We are going to do one for absent fathers too.</p>
	<p pid="c.279.2/15">Why should not absent fathers know that there is a consequence, and a benefit consequence, to their actions? Perhaps we have gone in the wrong direction in the past six months in letting people off the hook. That word of mouth has gone and young people&mdash;young boys, certainly&mdash;have been allowed to think that there is a free hit here. If they think there is no free hit, there is more likely to be the self-discipline, even after a few drinks, that most people manage to achieve.</p>
	<p pid="c.279.2/16">I am outstaying my welcome, Mr. Gale, so I shall finish on this note: the choice put in hon. Members' minds by the hon. Gentleman&mdash;he made his case honestly and forthrightly, and should be respected for doing so&mdash;is between education and ignorance. From my standpoint, I believe that the more people know and the more they understand, the more they will make the right life decisions. The less they know and the less they understand, the more likely it is that my statistic of 218 teenage mums in a year will go up rather than down.</p>
	<p pid="c.279.2/17">I hope that the hon. Gentleman does not lose his edge, but I hope, too, that he understands why, in this instance, some of us strongly disagree with him.</p>

	<p pid="c.281.0/1">I am grateful to have the opportunity to follow two interesting speakers. The first was my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1816" name="Philip Davies">the Member for Shipley (Philip Davies)</phrase>, who bravely raised an important issue. The second was <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1747" name="Graham Allen">the hon. Member for Nottingham, North (Mr. Allen)</phrase>, who may have put his finger on the core of the problem. However, I shall try to put it in a slightly more tactful way than the hon. Gentleman.</p>
	<p pid="c.281.0/2">There certainly is a problem in our society at the moment, with young women's pregnancies being caused by young males&mdash;as we heard, not always once but sometimes on multiple occasions. The children are effectively being brought up by the state. Those who are parents can imagine how difficult it must be for young, inexperienced teenagers to bring up children on a deprived council estate.</p>
	<p pid="c.281.0/3">I always try to avoid using the term &quot;single mother&quot; or phrases such as &quot;out of wedlock&quot;. They are rather emotive, and I assume that all hon. Members would agree that it is completely unfair to stigmatise someone who happens to be a single mother. There are all sorts of reasons for women ending up as single mothers. Indeed, most single mothers do an extremely good job in bringing up their children. We are not talking today about single mothers; we are talking about a particular problem that is confined to deprived estates, where people are having more than one child.</p>
	<p pid="c.281.0/4">People make mistakes. Women can become pregnant because of one-off mistakes. We should not be too judgmental about that, either, as I suspect that many in this Room will have been in the position of waiting for a phone call to find out if they were about to become parents rather sooner than expected. That is life. That is reality. However, some young people living in deprived areas think that it is perfectly reasonable, acceptable or even normal to have one child after another, often by different fathers. That is unacceptable, and society needs to be able to say something about it&mdash;and not only to those young women but very much to the young men. That is the sort of problem that we are trying to address today.</p>
	<p pid="c.281.0/5">The question is whether more sex education in schools is the answer. It is obvious from the trade in statistics that we heard that more sex education is not the answer. There is no statistical evidence to suggest it. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1455" name="Kerry McCarthy">The hon. Member for Bristol, East (Kerry McCarthy)</phrase> asked what was the link between less sex education and lower pregnancy rates. That question needs to be directed at the Government. They will not be able to show a link. The hon. Member for Nottingham, North spoke of the increase in under-age pregnancies and babies being born out of wedlock in his constituency, but the reality is that there is far more sex education now in his constituency than there was 20 years ago, so the answer is not more sex education.</p>

	<p pid="c.283.3/1">I would be interested to go down that route, talking about Liberal Democrat policies and the sort of culture that we live in and how it may or may not benefit us. However, Mr. Gale, I suspect that you would stop me.</p>
	<p pid="c.283.3/2">I am not against having some form of sex education in secondary schools, although I might differ slightly from my hon. Friend the Member for Shipley on that question. My big concern is sex education in primary schools. As a father of three children under the age of 10, I think that it is completely inappropriate that primary schools should be expected to provide it.</p>
	<p pid="c.283.3/3">It is a clich&eacute;, but I believe that schools should concentrate on reading, writing and arithmetic. The statistics given by my hon. Friend are indisputable. One in five people leaving school at the age of 16 is unable to read and write properly. A report in 2005 suggested that one in three children at the age of 11 was unable to state what a paragraph was, or put commas in the right place. That suggests to me that schools are not doing properly the job that we expect of them. I went to a state primary school in my constituency, and I was able to read by the age of six. The schools in my constituency attended by my children are good, but the schools in many areas are failing. We are now expecting them to undertake sex education as well.</p>
	<p pid="c.283.3/4">It comes down to the fundamental question, what are the roles of the school and of the parent. I believe that the school's role is to impart basic educational knowledge to children. It is the parents' role to decide what young children should be taught about sex, and what their young children should be taught about the facts of life. It is not only the role of the parents; it is their right. That is why I commend my hon. Friend the Member for Shipley for raising the subject today.</p>

<gidredirect oldgid="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-11-26c.284.0" newgid="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-11-26d.284.0" matchtype="changes"/>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-11-26c.284.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1546" speakername="Annette Brooke" colnum="284"  time="015:28:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm081126/halltext/81126h0008.htm#08112642000628">
	<p pid="c.284.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1816" name="Philip Davies">the hon. Member for Shipley (Philip Davies)</phrase> on securing this debate. However, I do not like the title, which is not a good starting point. I believe that we should never talk about sex and relationships, but always about sex and relationship education. The two must go together.</p>
	<p pid="c.284.0/2">At times during the hon. Gentleman's speech, I felt that I was living in a parallel universe, but I agree with some aspects of what he said. I am passionate about supporting the family, whatever shape or size it is. Family stability and loving relationships within the family are so important, and I certainly value the aspect of a family sitting around the table and dining together. On that point, the hon. Gentleman and I do not differ.</p>
	<p pid="c.284.0/3">I, too, refer to some of the stark facts. I start with teenage pregnancy rates. The United Kingdom has the highest teenage birth and abortion rates in Europe. Rates of teenage births here are six times those in the Netherlands, nearly three times those in France and more than twice those in Germany. I have said before that the Government are to be congratulated on having a teenage pregnancy strategy, which seeks to tackle the causes and the consequences of teenage pregnancy. Teenage conception rates have fallen to their lowest level for 20 years, but we have a long way to go.</p>
	<p pid="c.284.0/4">Until last month, the Government had resisted a commitment to make personal, social and health education, including sex and relationship education, a compulsory part of the national curriculum. I have raised this cause at every possible opportunity since being elected. Education must be a vital part of the teenage pregnancy strategy, and I welcome the Government's conversion, at long last.</p>
	<p pid="c.284.0/5">I was extremely distressed when the latest abortion figures were published. In Britain, the number of abortions performed on under-16s rose by 10 per cent. last year to 4,376. For under-14s, there has been a 21 per cent. increase, and half of all pregnancies in under-18s end in abortion. I am not an anti-abortionist, but having an abortion at such a young age cannot be a good start to life. We need more information on sexually transmitted infections. We cannot allow young people to remain in ignorance. Every statistic on most sexually transmitted infections shows that we have the highest diagnosis rate among women aged 16 to 19. Indeed, 12 per cent. of women in that age group are infected with chlamydia.</p>
	<p pid="c.284.0/6">Today's question is: cause and effect&mdash;which way around? Obviously I do not support the argument that sex education has led to the current situation. We have not had adequate sex and relationship education in this country, but of course other factors are at play. However, the key is quality sex and relationship education by trained teachers who wish to do it. We also need to involve other professionals and young people.</p>
	<p pid="c.284.0/7">To counter the points made by the hon. Member for Shipley, we need look no further than the United Kingdom Youth Parliament survey, which throws light on the causal relationship. Twenty two thousand teenagers were surveyed, more than 70 per cent. of whom rated the teaching of sex education in school as poor, very poor or merely average, while only a quarter said that it was good. Furthermore, nearly half said that they had never been taught about the effects of teenage pregnancy and would not know where to find their local sexual health clinic. The survey also revealed that 55 per cent. of all 12 to 15-year-olds, and 57 per cent. of girls between 16 and 17, had not been taught how to use a condom, despite a Government recommendation on that issue.</p>
	<p pid="c.284.0/8">Overall, 55 per cent. of respondents said that they had been taught about teenage pregnancy, leaving just less than half who had not. Many of the young people to whom UKYP spoke while carrying out the survey felt that they knew about how having a baby could impact on their lives, but knew little about the development of a baby in the womb and about the impact that pregnancy could have on their bodies. Most alarmingly, as has already been alluded to, 61 per cent. of boys and 70 per cent. of girls over the age of 17, and 43 per cent. of all the children surveyed, reported having not received any information at school about personal relationships.</p>
	<p pid="c.284.0/9">A study earlier this year by UNICEF, and further work by the National Children's Bureau and the Sex Education Forum, reinforce those points. The National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children has also produced some very interesting material. A snapshot of calls to ChildLine in May 2008 showed that nearly 50 children a day call because they feel under pressure to have sex or lack basic knowledge about sexual health, relationships, pregnancy and puberty. Children as young as 12 call to talk to a counsellor because they are worried that they might be pregnant and lack the facts about safer sex, sexual relationships and peer pressure. Some girls say that they feel pressurised into having sex before they are ready.</p>
	<p pid="c.284.0/10">Those callers to ChildLine, like the rest of us, live in a highly sexualised culture and are influenced by media and marketing, but they are not being equipped to deal with the pressures. Alcohol also comes into the equation. Young people sometimes use alcohol to cope and become more vulnerable as a result. Their lives are complex, and they need knowledge, advice and support to help them to avoid engaging in sexual activity that they later regret.</p>
	<p pid="c.284.0/11">I declare that I am an ambassador for the NSPCC and the views that I shall put forward are not only those of the NSPCC, but very strongly mine. Children need to learn from an early age about appropriate behaviour and how to stay safe in relationships. PSHE needs to receive dedicated teaching time to enable teachers to use different strategies to help children and young people to develop the necessary skills. That should help young people to build their self-esteem and make informed choices in later life. Children and young people should be given the opportunity to gain some understanding about abuses of power and inappropriate and dangerous relationships, and learn what support is available. They need to understand why it is not appropriate to tolerate abuses of power within a relationship, and should be given clear examples of such behaviour, such as child abuse, rape and domestic abuse.</p>
	<p pid="c.284.0/12">I believe passionately that sex and relationship education should begin at five. Much has been made in the press about sex education for five-year-olds&mdash;&quot;condoms for five-year-olds!&quot;&mdash;but I shall explain why I believe that it should start at age five. During deliberations on the Sexual Offences Act 2003 and the police parliamentary scheme, in which I participated&mdash;I spent time with the Metropolitan police's child protection unit&mdash;I learned a great deal about things that I did not know even happened. For example, a child living in an abnormal family does not know that they are living in abnormal circumstances, because they do not have a yardstick by which to measure normality. I came across an example of a child brought up in a household where pornographic material was being made and assembled. That child went out into the street and engaged in a sexual activity with a dog. I rest my case! We need appropriate education at five describing what normal touching is and what normal relationships are.</p>
	<p pid="c.284.0/13">As education progresses we must emphasise qualities within relationships, such as self-esteem, self-respect, respect for others, honesty, choice and so on. We must give young people the ability to make their own choices and have the confidence to say &quot;no&quot;. I have some more examples: one 16-year-old boy told ChildLine that he had had unprotected sex with a girl for a dare and was now concerned that he might have caught a disease. A 14-year-old girl said that her boyfriend wanted to have sex with her, but that she did not know how to do it. Another young girl rang to say that she was worried that she was pregnant after she did not dare to say &quot;no&quot; to sex with her boyfriend in case he dumped her.</p>
	<p pid="c.284.0/14">We must not underestimate the importance of those points. Members will gather that I have been passionate about it for a long time. However, the answer is not just sex and relationship education, but in the whole PSHE programme. A range of health issues must be taught relative to age, maturity and understanding, including emotional and health well-being, diet and exercise, alcohol, tobacco, drugs, careers and safety. Sex and relationship education is just one part of that&mdash;but never should it be just sex education, without the &quot;relationship&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="c.284.0/15">Working with parents is vital. I would not imagine such education being introduced without full parental consultation. Schools should run individual schemes. Work force training is also vital, because no teacher should have to teach a subject on which they are not confident. Furthermore, we must make full use of professionals and young people. I commend the Government on setting up the committee. It delays the introduction of that sort of education, but this time they are right, because it will ensure that the content and any exemptions are firmly discussed.</p>

	<p pid="c.286.0/1">It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Mr. Gale, on this important debate. I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1816" name="Philip Davies">the Member for Shipley (Philip Davies)</phrase> on securing it. He always speaks powerfully on behalf of his constituents and is always willing to put his point of view, for which we should applaud him.</p>
	<p pid="c.286.0/2">My hon. Friend correctly identifies the worsening problems that we face in this country, and the fact that many parents want a close involvement in this part of their children's upbringing. He referred in some detail to examples from Italy and Holland. He rightly pointed out that family structure and stable family environments can do much to help children have a better start in life and to help them make good decisions about the way in which their lives will develop and progress.</p>
	<p pid="c.286.0/3">It is a shame that the Government have not paid more attention to how we can support stable family environments. There are too many policies, such as the couple penalty, which deters couples from coming together and staying together and providing the sort of stable environment about which my hon. Friend talks. I think that he makes some very important and powerful points.</p>
	<p pid="c.286.0/4"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1546" name="Annette Brooke">The hon. Member for Mid-Dorset and North Poole (Annette Brooke)</phrase> talked compellingly about the deterioration in some areas. In particular, she mentioned the 69 per cent. increase in sexually transmitted infections over the past decade. We have the highest level of teenage pregnancies in western Europe, and the number of teenage abortions has increased by 15 per cent. in the past five years. Those statistics should concern us all, and I echo the views eloquently expressed by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1719" name="David Davies">the Member for Monmouth (David T.C. Davies)</phrase> in his contribution.</p>
	<p pid="c.286.0/5">The pivotal point of the debate is whether or not sex education works. Speaking from the Conservative Front Bench, I say that it should work. At the moment, however, there is plenty of room for improvement. For more than six years, Ofsted has been calling for sex and relationship education to be taught by teachers who know how to deliver the subject and, more appropriately, by specialists who have the sort of experience to make a difference in this area.</p>
	<p pid="c.286.0/6">I know that the Minister understands the importance of the matter, and has been dissatisfied with the progress that has been made in this area. I will be interested to hear what he has to say today because he has done a great deal of work to improve an unacceptable situation. None the less, I should like him to pick up on a couple of points. I am concerned that too much emphasis has been placed on making sex and relationship a statutory subject. It is seen as a panacea for the way in which we will improve the current situation. As my hon. Friend the Member for Shipley says, sex education is not something that will be dealt with in the same way in every school, community and family. Simply by saying that the subject will be compulsory will not make it more effective. It is a sticking plaster and something that grabs a headline rather than provides a solution.</p>
	<p pid="c.286.0/7">Two or three years ago, Ofsted said that making something statutory&mdash;this was in the context of sex and relationship education&mdash;does not ensure that it is effective. That is correct. While the Minister considers a number of other measures to improve the effectiveness of sex and relationship education, I urge him not to see making it statutory as some sort of panacea that will solve all ills, because he will be disappointed.</p>
	<p pid="c.286.0/8">I was quite disappointed that the recent report from the Government seemed to side step the role of parents. As my hon. Friend the Member for Shipley said, parents want to have an important role in this part of their children's lives. For many parents, it can be a difficult issue to talk about. Others, however, want to ensure that they have control over the way in which sex and relationships are talked about, particularly to young children. Like my hon. Friend, I have a six-year-old and I know that I want to talk to him about the matter in a way that is proper and right.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-11-26c.288.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1389" speakername="Maria Miller" colnum="288"  time="015:39:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm081126/halltext/81126h0009.htm#08112642000631">
	<p pid="c.288.0/1">I share my hon. Friend's concern that parents may feel that they are being marginalised in the process. At the moment, we are fortunate that very few parents withdraw their children from sex and relationship education&mdash;I think that it is less than 1 per cent. The Government must understand how that might change if sex and relationship education were made statutory. I know from talking to various organisations that in cases in which the issues are a little sensitive&mdash;either for cultural or any other reason&mdash;ways are found to ensure that children have the information that they may require. If the subject is made statutory, will that flexibility still be there? I will be interested to hear what the Minister has to say about that. The last thing that he wants to do is to push more parents than currently is the case towards excluding their children from such discussions.</p>
	<p pid="c.288.0/2">It is important that we understand the concerns of the teaching profession when it comes to sex and relationship education. Too many feel that there is inappropriate, or insufficient, training to be able to undertake the roles that they are all too often given in school. I urge the Minister to consider the work done by organisations such as Relate in developing good, solid, very professionally developed course work that can be delivered in a way that will help children to understand such important issues.</p>
	<p pid="c.288.0/3">I urge the Minister to reassure us about the role of parents within this process, and pick up on some of the points that my hon. Friend the Member for Shipley has made. Will he also talk about the importance of age appropriateness? I probably share the concerns of the hon. Member for Mid-Dorset and North Poole that some of the media coverage on the matter has been less than helpful. Perhaps the Minister should shoulder some of the blame for that. It is important that the media is on our side and working with us. A great variety of briefings went out to various newspapers at the time of the Government statement, and there was a great broadness of interpretation as to what would happen. I know that the Rose review will consider the content of sex and relationship education. I hope that the Minister can reassure us that that will not include primary school-age children being exposed to inappropriate sexual material, because that is very important.</p>
	<p pid="c.288.0/4">I should like to pick up on the importance of relationships in sex education. In her intervention, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1455" name="Kerry McCarthy">the hon. Member for Bristol, East (Kerry McCarthy)</phrase> mentioned the Youth Parliament. It is important to ensure that sex education is delivered in the context of relationship education. That is something that has been lacking and has been picked up in the Youth Parliament's work. It is important that we have a good structure for young people in this country to learn about appropriate behaviour.</p>
	<p pid="c.288.0/5">In the past couple of weeks, the headlines have been talking about the increasing problems of inappropriate behaviour. There has been a worrying increase in the numbers of children who witness domestic violence, and who are abused and neglected. There is a powerful argument for parenting skills to be included in the sort of relationship education that we are talking about. That argument was put powerfully to me by a group of students who were studying children's care in education at Basingstoke College of Technology. I ask the Minister to consider in detail the proposals that they have put forward.</p>
	<p pid="c.288.0/6">Time is running out, so I should like to end by applauding the contribution of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1747" name="Graham Allen">the hon. Member for Nottingham, North (Mr. Allen)</phrase>. He had to leave to be in a meeting elsewhere. As always, he made a very powerful case for the importance of earlier intervention in such cases.</p>
	<p pid="c.288.0/7">In closing, I should like to say that my hon. Friend the Member for Shipley is right to question whether we are being effective in what we are doing here. He is right to make us debate and consider in detail some of these issues. I urge him always to challenge us and to bring his thoughts on such issues to the fore. It is right that all communities have a different approach. We must ensure that that flexibility continues and that the Government instil flexibility in the systems that are used for sex and relationship education.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-11-26c.289.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1548" speakername="Jim Knight" speakeroffice="The Minister for Schools and Learners"  colnum="289"  time="015:49:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm081126/halltext/81126h0009.htm#08112642000632">
	<p pid="c.289.0/1">I thank <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1816" name="Philip Davies">the hon. Member for Shipley (Philip Davies)</phrase> for securing this debate. He made an interesting and provocative speech. He seemed to spend the first half arguing that higher rates of teenage pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections in this country were due to sex education and the second half arguing that low rates elsewhere had nothing to do with sex education.</p>
	<p pid="c.289.0/2">My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1747" name="Graham Allen">the Member for Nottingham, North (Mr. Allen)</phrase> gave a thoughtful speech based on his experience representing an area where the consequences of inadequate sex and relationship education are acute. I was particularly struck by his phrase &quot;The more they know, the more they understand.&quot; That is the basis of our argument.</p>
	<p pid="c.289.0/3"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1719" name="David Davies">The hon. Member for Monmouth (David T.C. Davies)</phrase> repeated some of the misconceptions about the quality of schooling in this country. Perhaps, because he does not represent an English constituency, he is not fully aware that this year, for example, 88 per cent. of 11-year-olds achieved the national standard of level 4 in their SATs in reading. Every year, 100,000 more young people leave primary school able to read, write and add up than when his party was last in power.</p>
	<p pid="c.289.0/4"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1546" name="Annette Brooke">The hon. Member for Mid-Dorset and North Poole (Annette Brooke)</phrase> gave a passionate speech and usefully set out the detail of what the UK Youth Parliament says on the matter in its authoritative work. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1389" name="Maria Miller">The hon. Member for Basingstoke (Mrs. Miller)</phrase> made a welcome speech, and I appreciate her constructive approach. I will certainly consider the proposals that Basingstoke college of technology came up with. The new personal, social, health and economic education programme of study on personal well-being includes the roles and responsibilities of parents, carers and children, but at the moment, obviously, it is non-statutory.</p>
	<p pid="c.289.0/5">Sex education is a serious subject that we should not shy away from, which is why I welcome this debate. It is the Government's ambition not only to build a world-class education and children's services system for our young people but to make this country the best place in the world to grow up. Sex and relationships are a crucial part of the process of growing up, and our approach to those relationships, the choices that we make and our ability to keep ourselves safe is what marks us as independent, free-thinking adults. All are fundamentals of any good education.</p>
	<p pid="c.289.0/6">It is no less than part of our moral duty to teach young people how to relate one another, keep themselves safe and treat each other with respect in order to stand them in good stead for happiness and success in later life. Sex and relationship education is a vital part of that, and it is particularly important for young people growing up in the highly sexualised climate of this country in this century. Mass marketing aimed at children, a celebrity and image-conscious culture, T-shirts for girls as young as six reading &quot;So many boys, so little time&quot;, magazines, soaps and music videos create an increasingly sexualised climate in which young people are regularly confronted with sex in some form.</p>
	<p pid="c.289.0/7">It is vital that we get the other side of the story across&mdash;information about sex and relationships, advice on how young people can keep themselves safe and straight answers to their questions&mdash;so that they are well equipped to cultivate meaningful relationships and make safe choices. In the classic comedy series, Blackadder proudly declares himself to be</p>
	<p pid="c.289.0/8" class="indent">&quot;a fully rounded human being with a degree from the university of life, a diploma from the school of hard knocks and three gold stars from the kindergarten of getting the shit kicked out of me&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="c.289.0/9">Our children's social and emotional development cannot be as haphazard as that. By the time they get to the university of life, it is too late. It is particularly important during those years when young people are tempted to experiment with alcohol, drugs, cigarettes and other things, and when they are operating within different social situations and the parameters of peer pressure. Our education system must not shy away from the task of preparing young people for life as fully rounded human beings.</p>
	<p pid="c.289.0/10">That is why, following the sex and relationship education review that I chaired and whose report was published last month, we took the decision to make PSHE statutory in order to ensure that every child benefits from high-quality education on those issues and establish greater consistency across the country, so that those not receiving good advice at home get it at school.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-11-26c.294.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1982" speakername="John Barrett" colnum="294"  time="016:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm081126/halltext/81126h0010.htm#08112642000640">
	<p pid="c.294.1/1">The hon. Gentleman is one step ahead of me today, as I was about to congratulate him later in my speech for that Bill. No doubt he will agree with what I am about to say in this debate.</p>
	<p pid="c.294.1/2">There is a credit card summit today, at which some of the issues that I have mentioned may well be addressed. Almost everything that is charged on anything that is bought can result in high, sometimes outrageous, rates of interest being charged. That can result in real hardship, misery or even worse situations for those who are paying those interest rates.</p>
	<p pid="c.294.1/3">My own constituency is in Edinburgh, which is well known as a centre for banking and finance. In my constituency, I have the global headquarters of the Royal Bank of Scotland and there are many other people in my constituency who work for the Halifax Bank of Scotland and other employers in the financial sector. Much has been said about the problems facing the banking sector, from big city bonuses to the Government investing billions in banks to keep them afloat. I would like to be able to say that the banks have been prudent, have lent wisely and have been victims of the actions of others. Sadly, however, that has not always been the case.</p>
	<p pid="c.294.1/4">I can give the example of a constituent who visited me at my advice surgery. He detailed how he was in debt, having lost his job, and he could not manage his debt repayments. He could not manage the debt that he had, yet he was lent a further &pound;2,000 by HBOS at what appeared to be a reasonable 19 per cent. interest rate over three years. However, after other charges and insurances were added on, he was charged 75 per cent. interest on top of his original loan to clear his debt. He could not afford that and he should not have been given more money when he could not live within his existing means. What he needed was good financial advice, not a loan. However, I agree that it takes two. Borrowers should read the small print and, at times, just say &quot;no&quot; and do without the purchase.</p>
	<p pid="c.294.1/5">A more extreme example of an individual facing higher charges that I discovered was that of Sharlene Britton. When she became the proud owner of a second-hand car, little did she realise that the total cost had more than tripled from the &pound;7,000 for the car to &pound;21,500 minutes before she drove it away. Sharlene had signed a credit agreement that included a loan with a massive 42.5 per cent. interest rate and payment protection insurance that cost more than the vehicle itself. It was those add-ons, coupled with the 42.5 per cent interest rate, that pushed the cost of her financial package sky-high. On top of the &pound;7,080 sale price of the car, she agreed to pay &pound;3,228 in payment protection insurance. However, because the cost of the premiums was added to the loan, which made it subject to the 42.5 per cent. interest charge, the figure swelled to &pound;8,957. She then had to pay interest on the original price of the car, plus related charges, which pushed the total balance that she was expected to pay from &pound;7,000 to &pound;21,540.</p>
	<p pid="c.294.1/6">Although that sounds bad enough, there are much worse cases. One of the most extreme examples that has been quoted in the press involved interest rates that worked out in excess of 2.6 million per cent. An example that I can give is that of a woman in York who took out a loan one week for &pound;320 with the firm Early Pay Day Loans, which attracted 80 per cent. interest over seven days. When the cost of the credit was calculated over a 12-month period, the annual percentage rate of the loan worked out to be 2,639,385.9 per cent. Early Pay Day Loans was contacted and it insisted that its charges are &quot;competitive&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="c.294.1/7">From the basic 6 per cent. of a mortgage to 2 million per cent. interest, which I know is hard to believe, there is everything in between. The reason for giving these examples is to highlight the link between what we have at one end of the spectrum, which is a bank base rate at 3 per cent. and falling, while at the other end we have sky-high interest rates, which can undermine individuals and businesses who are doing all they can to survive.</p>
	<p pid="c.294.1/8">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2020" name="Jim Devine">the hon. Member for Livingston (Mr. Devine)</phrase>, who has introduced a private Member's Bill for a maximum limit to interest rates. As a co-sponsor of that Bill, I wish him well.</p>
	<p pid="c.294.1/9">Much of the personal wealth of the country is tied up in property. Millions of people are mortgage holders and pay interest, not only on their mortgage but on other loans. Properties are often used as the security for old age of those who have worked and paid for them during their working years. A property is often the single largest financial investment that most people will ever make and it should be secure. It is true that having money does not make people happy, but not having any money is guaranteed to make life much more miserable.</p>
	<p pid="c.294.1/10">It is absolutely vital that the stability of the property market is restored so that millions of citizens and our economy as a whole can again return to a belief in a secure future; confidence is the key. Part of that process will depend on sensible lending at reasonable interest rates. I look forward to hearing from the Minister what he thinks can be done to curb the excesses in the market of extreme interest rates. That is now more important than at any other time in recent years as we now have a combination of factors, as well as those interest rates, which are affecting mortgage holders. The combination of high utility costs and increasing food and fuel prices is a recipe for financial disaster for many but, hopefully, utility costs have peaked and will begin to fall soon.</p>
	<p pid="c.294.1/11">One group who are in a particularly perilous position are those who are currently unemployed with mortgages who receive mortgage interest relief. Their plight was brought to my attention by a constituent from Carrick Knowe who visited my advice surgery recently. I would like to thank her for alerting me to the problem. She outlined the impact that a fall in the base rate from 4.5 per cent. to 3 per cent. would have on those receiving mortgage interest relief , but who were paying a fixed rate mortgage.</p>
	<p pid="c.294.1/12">I am sure that hon. Members will be aware that income support mortgage interest is designed to cover the cost of mortgage interest to ensure that families who may already be reeling from a redundancy are not also faced with the prospect of losing their home. Since <phrase class="date" code="2004-12-05">5 December 2004</phrase>, the standard interest rate used to calculate support for mortgage interest payments has been the Bank of England base rate plus 1.58 per cent. Prior to that, it was based on an average basket of building society interest rates. The new formula has proved to be sufficient to cover the interest on most mortgages when rates have been fairly stable. However, with interest rates cut to 3 per cent. and set to fall further, my constituent rightly pointed out that the top level of support available to her and others in her position would tumble to slightly more than 4.5 per cent., which is significantly lower than all fixed and variable-rate mortgages. Given that fixed-rate mortgages alone make up 62 per cent. of the UK mortgage market, that is a concern.</p>
	<p pid="c.294.1/13">Recognising the urgency of the issue, I wrote last week to the Prime Minister and the Minister of State, Department for Work and Pensions, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1618" name="Tony McNulty">the right hon. Member for Harrow, East (Mr. McNulty)</phrase>, who has responsibility for employment and welfare reform, to highlight the shortfall. Although I have yet to receive a reply from either, it was gratifying to note in the pre-Budget statement that the Government had indeed noted the problem and taken some action. The Chancellor's statement says that for six months, the level of interest rates covered by the scheme will remain, despite the base rate fall, at slightly more than 6 per cent. Will the Minister clarify whether that is for existing claimants only, or will it apply to new applicants?</p>
	<p pid="c.294.1/14">Although the measure is to be welcomed, it nevertheless prompts the question what will happen after six months. If the Government believe that the economy will have recovered in six months' time to a point at which interest rates will once again stand at 4.5 per cent., their optimism surely knows no bounds. In reality, it is far more likely that the economy will be in as bad, if not a worse, state by then, as yesterday's OECD report pointed out. The report indicated that interest rates will stay low, and they might even be lower in six months' time. At that time, people who depend on help to pay interest on their mortgage will see the cliff edge of support that they are on crumbling away beneath their feet.</p>
	<p pid="c.294.1/15">To give hon. Members an indication of the potential scale of the problem, anyone who has taken out a mortgage in the last three years would not be covered by the scheme&mdash;it would not cover the interest on their payments. To be fair, the Government have not sat idly by while the situation has deteriorated. I welcome the extension in Government help for those people struggling to pay home loan bills, and the decision to start mortgage interest relief after 13 rather than 39 weeks is excellent news. Similarly, the fact that help will be available on mortgage amounts up to &pound;200,000 rather than &pound;175,000 will also be welcomed by many of my constituents.</p>
	<p pid="c.294.1/16">However, with unemployment shooting up&mdash;it is now at an 11-year high and predicted to rise to 3 million by 2010&mdash;that will be a bigger problem in the coming months, as more people come to depend on Government help with their mortgage payments. The Government have bought themselves 6 months with this week's announcement, but I look forward to hearing from the Minister what plans they have to change the formula by which help is calculated, to ensure that the benefit more accurately reflects the help that families need. I hope that if the Minister is unable to answer those questions today, he would be good enough to write to me.</p>
	<p pid="c.294.1/17">Looking to the future, we are faced with a set of circumstances such as I have never known. Base rates are low and they are predicted to fall again next year. Compared with other countries, our base rates could certainly fall further. As well as low interest rates, we have a frozen housing market, falling house prices, the potential collapse of Northern Rock, and building societies that once gathered savings so that they could lend to house purchasers at reasonable rates are turning into banks and suffering from the same failings: reckless borrowing and irresponsible lending. Something that we thought was the prerogative of the foolish has become the accepted behaviour for the financial institutions that we have grown to trust for hundreds of years. That trust has been shattered and the outlook for many is bleak.</p>
	<p pid="c.294.1/18">The current solution being put forward by the Government to the financial problems that fill the media every day is to provide a financial stimulus to the economy; to increase people's spending to kick-start the economy; and to put more money into people's pockets. I doubt whether that is actually the solution to the problem but, to give the benefit of the doubt to the Chancellor, even if it was, it could all be undermined if interest rates being paid by the public and businesses are not brought back to reasonable levels. If they are not, any increase in cash in the pockets of Joe Public will be swallowed up paying interest before he can spend it on goods and services. Unless mortgage holders believe that their property will hold its value and is worth paying for, the basis of domestic finance for millions could crumble. I look forward to hearing the Minister's comments on those issues.</p>

	<p pid="c.301.1/1">I thank Mr. Speaker for selecting this debate, which is very important to constituents throughout the UK. I am deeply appreciative. I am also extremely grateful that so many colleagues have turned up to listen to and, I hope, participate in the debate. They all know as well as I do the damage that has been caused to many of our constituents who are victims of pleural plaques.</p>
	<p pid="c.301.1/2">I know, Mr. Gale, that it is always wrong specifically to thank people, but may I take this opportunity to mention two colleagues who have worked tirelessly on the whole question of pleural plaques? The first is my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1386" name="Michael Clapham">the Member for Barnsley, West and Penistone (Mr. Clapham)</phrase> who, due to other parliamentary business, unfortunately is not with us today. No one has worked harder than he has. Likewise, I would like to make special mention of my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1673" name="John Battle">the Member for Leeds, West (John Battle)</phrase>, who has been working on asbestos-related diseases for longer than some of us have been in the House. I put on record my appreciation for his work.</p>
	<p pid="c.301.1/3">I also mention the work of the trade unions on pleural plaques, and Thompsons, the lawyers who work with the trade unions on such issues. Their assistance is greatly appreciated and welcomed.</p>
	<p pid="c.301.1/4">Finally, I make special mention of the workers from the whole of the UK who came to Parliament to lobby some weeks ago, sacrificing a day's wages to do so. To me, that demonstrates the strength of feeling among victims and their families about losing compensation for pleural plaques. When people make the choice to lose a day's wages to come to the mother of democracy and express their concern, they demonstrate their commitment.</p>
	<p pid="c.301.1/5">On the subject of commitment, our Prime Minister said clearly on two public occasions that I know of&mdash;at the Scottish Labour party conference and at the Scottish TUC conference&mdash;that he was working to resolve the matter of compensation for pleural plaques. I and other colleagues will certainly be holding him to that, and I have every reason to believe that he will deliver his promise.</p>
	<p pid="c.301.1/6">The question is whether pleural plaques cause any symptoms. The insurers say that they do not.</p>

	<p pid="c.303.1/1">My hon. Friend is right. He, too, has been actively campaigning and he is right about solving the problem. In many ways, we have solved the problem in the United Kingdom by bringing in health and safety legislation that will go some way to protect workers, but the important thing to remember is that the problem has moved on and there is clear evidence that asbestos producers are moving into third world countries, so a problem that was started in this country is now moving there. We need to set an example and, through our Ministers, ask the producers to endorse the same safety measures in the third world countries that they have in the UK.</p>

	<p pid="c.304.3/1">I thank the hon. Gentleman for that contribution. I genuinely welcome his and his party's support on this issue. That underlines why we need legislation covering the four countries of the UK, rather than have people going off and doing their own thing and what have you. For me, that resonates and is important.</p>
	<p pid="c.304.3/2">I am conscious of the time. We want to leave the Minister some time to respond to the major concerns that have been raised and, hopefully, she will be able to do so.</p>
	<p pid="c.304.3/3">In terms of compensation, for more than 20 years the courts recognised pleural plaques as a compensatable injury; they accepted that plaques, together with the increase of developing asbestos-related malignant disease and the resulting anxiety that flowed from that diagnosis, amounted to significant harm. Actionable damage claims proceeded through that period without any difficulty. That was the position before the Law Lords' decision and, hopefully, we can get back to that. People with pleural plaques have suffered identifiable harm from exposure to asbestos and it is right that they should be compensated. I am sure that the Minister will be aware that today's turnout of hon. Members from across the UK, representing their constituents, demonstrates the interest that is shown on this matter.</p>
	<p pid="c.304.3/4">There is significant evidence suggesting that pleural plaques are not the symptomless condition that the five judges thought. Indeed, it is a matter of record that their judgment was unanimous and I accept that that makes it difficult to overturn, but legislation is needed to offer hope to the victims.</p>
	<p pid="c.304.3/5">I vigorously disagree with the Law Lords' decision that the companies that were named earlier and which polluted people with asbestos were not responsible for people developing pleural plaques or full-blown mesothelioma. So who was responsible? Was it the irresponsible doctors who told sufferers that they had pleural plaques, because that caused their anxiety? It is ridiculous to blame doctors for telling people that they are unwell, and I am sure that the people I represent and those my hon. Friends represent find it incredible and cannot understand it.</p>
	<p pid="c.304.3/6">I was a Member of the House when farmers and their livestock were affected by the foot and mouth disease and bluetongue outbreaks. Hon. Members were up in arms and demanded compensation for the animals that were destroyed to halt the spread of disease. I do not wish denigrate the plight of farmers whose livelihoods were threatened or even ruined, but when human beings contract a killing disease, the House does not afford them the same attention. I want the Minister to understand that pleural plaques are a working-class disease.</p>

	<p pid="c.307.0/1">We know that we have a friend in the Minister on this issue, but such is the anger in the country, that it is looking to the House of Commons to overturn the Lords' decision, and the Government must lead on that. My constituents are outraged, and 600 of them signed a petition organised by Brian Prosser because they were so angered by the Lords' decision. I hope that the Government will make a positive response.</p>
	<p pid="c.307.0/2">It is right to pay tribute to my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2007" name="Jim Sheridan">the Member for Paisley and Renfrewshire, North (Jim Sheridan)</phrase>. Every Wednesday, he and I meet the Prime Minister as shop stewards representing the parliamentary Labour party, and hardly a week goes by when he does not raise the matter with the Prime Minister. The message is getting across, and our message today is that we expect action from our Government.</p>

	<p pid="c.307.1/1">I am grateful to my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1657" name="Don Touhig">the Member for Islwyn (Mr. Touhig)</phrase> for reminding me of his petition and the fact that he and my hon. Friend the Member for Paisley and Renfrewshire, North are keeping the matter at the centre of the Government's consciousness. As a result of that and campaigning by my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1673" name="John Battle">the Member for Leeds, West (John Battle)</phrase> and my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1386" name="Michael Clapham">the Member for Barnsley, West and Penistone (Mr. Clapham)</phrase> who, unfortunately, cannot be here today, we went out to consultation to see how we should best respond to the House of Lords judgment.</p>
	<p pid="c.307.1/2">We asked specific and complex questions. We asked how to raise awareness of pleural plaques so that people understand the issue and we can help to allay their concerns. We invited views on whether the House of Lords' judgment should be overturned, and it is clear from every hon. Member here what their response is. I will forcefully make their view known to the Secretary of State and my ministerial colleagues. We also asked about the merit of offering no financial support to people who are diagnosed with pleural plaques. We set out two possible ways of dealing with that.</p>
	<p pid="c.307.1/3">The issues are complex and it is important to set out the benefits and difficulties that arise in relation to all the possible options. The fact that we had so many responses&mdash;from individuals, the trade union movement and colleagues&mdash;shows just how important the issue is to people. In the final part of the consultation, we wanted to ensure that whatever our decision, we made it with the best possible medical evidence available to us. We have therefore asked the chief medical officer and the Industrial Injuries Advisory Council to respond and tell us what they think the best way forward is.</p>
	<p pid="c.307.1/4">As I said, we received a total of 224 responses to the consultation. I do not know whether my hon. Friends are aware that 125 of those were from individuals who suffer from pleural plaques. In a sense, that underlines the passion and commitment that my hon. Friends have put into their contributions. Of course, we have also received responses from the legal profession and, not surprisingly&mdash;as my right hon. Friend the Member for Leeds, West will know&mdash;we received responses from the insurance industry, as well as from employers, business organisations, trade unions and asbestos victims.</p>

	<p pid="c.308.4/1">I re-emphasise what my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1657" name="Don Touhig">the Member for Islwyn (Mr. Touhig)</phrase> said: the House must find an answer to the problem. I say that because I am aware that a chap who has pleural plaques and is originally from the Rochdale area has moved into my constituency. The last thing that he wants is to be caught up in a wrangle between English and Scots law, so it is important that the House determines a solution.</p>
