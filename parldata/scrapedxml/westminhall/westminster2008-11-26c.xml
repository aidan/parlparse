	<p pid="c.237.2/1">I am pleased that we are having this debate because the issue of temporary housing affects many of my constituents. Almost every time I hold an advice surgery and see people with housing problems, someone who lives in temporary accommodation will attend. The problem has been and still is huge, particularly in London.</p>
	<p pid="c.237.2/2">The housing statistics show that, by the end of 2006-07, 87,000 households were living in temporary accommodation. By March this year, that figure had fallen to 77,000, which is certainly an improvement. In some ways, we are in a much better situation than we were a few years ago, when many of the people concerned would have been in bed and breakfasts, rather than in flats or houses. We have virtually got rid of the use of bed and breakfasts&mdash;I think that about 5 per cent. of people in temporary accommodation now live in them.</p>

	<p pid="c.237.3/1">I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for bringing this important debate to the House. As we approach Christmas, homelessness and temporary accommodation is a serious matter, particularly for families with children. During the past 10 years, things have definitely improved and I congratulate the Government on their efforts in trying to deal with the problem, but there is still too much use of bed-and-breakfast accommodation, which is, in some ways, used by my council to threaten and cajole people. Bed-and-breakfast accommodation is often particularly unsuitable for people with young families because it is sometimes rat infested or damp. That type of accommodation must be stamped out completely.</p>

	<p pid="c.237.4/1">I agree. The figure is down to 5 per cent., which is good, but I know that some local authorities still use bed-and-breakfast accommodation. My local authority does not and has not for some time, and I am pleased about that because it has made a positive difference.</p>

	<p pid="c.237.5/1">For the sake of accuracy, does the hon. Gentleman agree that the figures are in fact twice those of 10 years ago, even though they have fallen in the past couple of years?</p>

	<p pid="c.237.6/1">I assume that the hon. Gentleman is talking about the number of people in temporary accommodation, not those in bed and breakfast. There is no doubt that there has been an increase. I understand why local authorities feel the need to use temporary accommodation and there is no question but that, in some cases, people in temporary accommodation&mdash;whether a house or a flat&mdash;live in far better conditions than those in which people in similar situations lived some time ago. However, there is still a problem. The majority of people in temporary accommodation probably live in London and only a small proportion of those&mdash;less than 25 per cent.&mdash;stay in that temporary accommodation for under six months, while about 40 per cent. of people stay in temporary accommodation for two years or more.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-11-26c.238.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1677" speakername="David Taylor" colnum="238"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm081126/halltext/81126h0001.htm#08112642000546">
	<p pid="c.238.0/1">As an occasional critic of my Government's housing policy and their attitude to local authorities, I feel that it is important to start on a positive note. The target to halve the use of temporary accommodation by 2010 was set in 2004 and has been achieved in a number of regions, particularly my region of the east midlands. However, there is still an issue in relation to those in bed and breakfast and, indeed, hostel accommodation. The majority of people in hostel accommodation are ready to move into something permanent, if only it existed.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-11-26c.238.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1902" speakername="Neil Gerrard" colnum="238"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm081126/halltext/81126h0001.htm#08112642000547">
	<p pid="c.238.1/1">I accept that point. Many local authorities are moving towards that target, but there are still serious problems in London and doubts about whether we can meet it. My hon. Friend made a point about hostels, but the figure of 87,000 households in temporary accommodation masks the true situation because it does not include the people whom local authorities do not accept as priority homeless and whom they do not take on. Those are generally young, single people, and they can end up in some of the worst situations and in hostels. I shall return to that point.</p>
	<p pid="c.238.1/2">Clearly, we will not solve this problem without doing something about the supply side and increasing the supply of affordable rented housing through registered social landlords. I know that the Government are now making welcome moves in that direction and are considering what can be done to increase supply, but obviously that will not happen in the short term. I do not want to focus too much on the issue of new build, although that matter is obviously critical, but there is the question of the 50 per cent. target, how we can attain it and what we can do in the meantime to make conditions and costs more bearable for people who are in temporary accommodation and likely to be so for some time.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-11-26c.238.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1655" speakername="Jeremy Corbyn" colnum="238"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm081126/halltext/81126h0001.htm#08112642000548">
	<p pid="c.238.2/1">Is my hon. Friend aware that in London the 50 per cent. affordability target appears to have been virtually abandoned by the Mayor in favour of borough-wide negotiations? In any event, only a third of those properties would be available for rent; the rest would, in effect, be unaffordable for people with desperate housing need because the costs are simply too high.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-11-26c.238.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1902" speakername="Neil Gerrard" colnum="238"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm081126/halltext/81126h0001.htm#08112642000549">
	<p pid="c.238.3/1">I am aware of that, because it is an enormous problem for London. I am sure that it will be impossible for most London boroughs to solve their housing problems on their own. We need London-wide solutions, but we seem to be moving away from that. The consequences for people in temporary accommodation&mdash; particularly those who are in it for long periods&mdash;are fairly obvious.</p>
	<p pid="c.238.3/2">I am sure that many hon. Members will have seen the insecurity that such a situation creates for people. It is not unusual for people to move from one temporary property to another. In many cases in London, people are not even moved within the borough that they come from; they are moved to another borough, miles away from family and friends. Just last week, I saw someone who has been put in temporary accommodation in Walthamstow by Hammersmith and Fulham council. That is not his first temporary place. Before that, he had been in temporary accommodation in Edmonton, although his family and friends live in Hammersmith and Fulham.</p>
	<p pid="c.238.3/3">Such movement creates problems in getting children into schools and moving them from one school to another. When people are constantly being moved from one place to another, there are also consequences for them when they try to find and keep work. Some pilot schemes have been run to try to deal with that issue. Waltham Forest was one of the boroughs that ran the working future pilot, which considered what could be done to help to get people in temporary accommodation into work. I would be interested to know whether the Minister has assessed how those pilots worked and whether we might be able to extend them.</p>
	<p pid="c.238.3/4">A further issue for many people who are put into temporary accommodation relates to the conditions in which they live. Again, I frequently see people who live in temporary accommodation and who have been put into the most appalling places. I sometimes wonder what checks are carried out before some of those properties are used. Last week, I saw a case in which someone had moved into a flat that had no hot water or heating, and within a week the bathroom ceiling had collapsed and there were rats in the property. Through public money&mdash;housing benefit&mdash;we are paying more than &pound;300 a week to keep someone in such accommodation.</p>
	<p pid="c.238.3/5">Another case I have recently seen involved someone who was put in temporary accommodation that, again, cost more than &pound;300 a week. The place was a tip and was more or less unfit for human habitation. The person concerned, who was a pensioner, ended up moving out and sleeping on a camp-bed in her daughter's kitchen because she simply could not bear to stay in that place any longer.</p>
	<p pid="c.238.3/6">One issue that I would like us to examine is what we can do to try to ensure that the condition of properties used for temporary accommodation is decent, because frequently it is not.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-11-26c.239.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2038" speakername="Bob Spink" colnum="239"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm081126/halltext/81126h0001.htm#08112642000550">
	<p pid="c.239.0/1">I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for raising the issue of the condition of accommodation. I represent two communities: an island community, Canvey Island, and a mainland community, and the division is about 50:50. Islanders are islanders. Sometimes the local council will threaten islanders with bed-and-breakfast accommodation that is out of borough, totally unsuitable and in very poor condition if they do not accept a place that they are offered on the mainland, which is completely outwith their community, friends, schools and so on. People are threatened and cajoled. They are told that if they do not accept the place, they will have to go into a bed and breakfast. That is intolerable in this day and age.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-11-26c.239.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1902" speakername="Neil Gerrard" colnum="239"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm081126/halltext/81126h0001.htm#08112642000551">
	<p pid="c.239.1/1">I am not familiar with the hon. Gentleman's local authority, but if what he says is accurate, it does not sound like how I would hope a local authority would behave in dealing with housing applicants.</p>
	<p pid="c.239.1/2">An issue that I have touched on and want to return to is costs, because the rents for many properties that people are put into temporarily are unaffordable. Again, I recently dealt with someone who was moved out of a council property, for very good reasons; it was not her fault. She had been paying &pound;84 a week rent in the council flat, but she was put into temporary accommodation outside the borough and the rent was &pound;360 a week. For her, that was completely unaffordable. She is working, but obviously the housing benefit is not sufficient to make up the gap and she is considering whether to give up work, because otherwise she will be unable to afford to stay in the place. Time and again, we are paying out very large amounts in housing benefit&mdash;public money&mdash;for very poor-quality accommodation.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-11-26c.240.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1755" speakername="Andrew Smith" colnum="240"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm081126/halltext/81126h0001.htm#08112642000552">
	<p pid="c.240.0/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend on securing this important debate. Does he agree that the perversity of the financial situation is underlined by the fact that, often, more is being paid out to house people in awful conditions than it would have cost to build social housing of a decent standard for people to live in, and in some cases the properties in unsatisfactory condition are council properties that were sold off?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-11-26c.240.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1902" speakername="Neil Gerrard" colnum="240"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm081126/halltext/81126h0001.htm#08112642000553">
	<p pid="c.240.1/1">I absolutely agree. We need to get to grips with the financing and how we are spending so much public money on temporary accommodation.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-11-26c.240.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1677" speakername="David Taylor" colnum="240"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm081126/halltext/81126h0001.htm#08112642000554">
	<p pid="c.240.2/1">On that important point, research by the Supporting People programme shows that the cost of providing 50,000 bed spaces for single homeless people per year is about &pound;250 million. That is &pound;5,000 per bed space, which makes our right hon. Friend's point even more vivid and undeniable.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-11-26c.240.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1902" speakername="Neil Gerrard" colnum="240"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm081126/halltext/81126h0001.htm#08112642000555">
	<p pid="c.240.3/1">I take that point. There have been questions about what the subsidy levels should be for housing benefit where local authorities are leasing properties, and some reductions have been made. The London councils in particular are concerned that that might happen again and make it difficult for them to lease. One consequence of the pressure on the London boroughs has been competition between them to find properties in what they regard as the cheapest areas, so now people are frequently housed temporarily outside their borough of origin. If one looks at the statistics, it is obvious that certain boroughs make a practice of that and very significant numbers of the families they accept as homeless end up in temporary accommodation in another borough. That leads to some of the problems that I mentioned earlier, of security, work and schools. Moving people around in that way often leads also to problems in ensuring that they receive the council tax benefit and other benefits to which they are entitled. Such competition between the London boroughs is very unhealthy. I understood that there were agreements between the boroughs to try to avoid too much of that shopping around, but they do not seem to be working at the moment.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-11-26c.240.4" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1655" speakername="Jeremy Corbyn" colnum="240"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm081126/halltext/81126h0001.htm#08112642000556">
	<p pid="c.240.4/1">Does my hon. Friend share my concern at the over-close relationship that a number of boroughs seem to have with particular letting agencies, which almost do block lettings, apparently with very little pre-inspection or aftercare when people are moved into those properties?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-11-26c.241.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1902" speakername="Neil Gerrard" colnum="241"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm081126/halltext/81126h0001.htm#08112642000557">
	<p pid="c.241.0/1">I think that is the case with certain boroughs. Not with all but certainly with some boroughs, there are those sorts of problem.</p>
	<p pid="c.241.0/2">Much of what I have said about what happens to people who are placed in temporary accommodation by local authorities does not apply to single people because, in general, single people will not be accepted as priority homeless, so they end up in an even worse situation. They are forced into hostels or night shelters. Sometimes they have to rely on the charity of friends or relatives. As my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1677" name="David Taylor">the Member for North-West Leicestershire (David Taylor)</phrase> mentioned, 50,000-plus single homeless people have ended up in hostels. Some of them are helped by the Supporting People programme, which certainly makes a difference, but not all the people in hostels will end up being helped by that programme. For some of the people in hostels, what should be a short-term, temporary measure turns into a long-term problem because there is simply nowhere for them to move on to easily from the hostel. Again, if they are in a hostel where the rents are high and they are reliant on housing benefit, it is extremely difficult for them to get out of that place and get into their own property and into work. In addition, the conditions can be extremely poor.</p>
	<p pid="c.241.0/3">I shall refer to an example from my constituency. Recently, I have been dealing with some of the tenants of a hostel called Lea Bridge house, which is owned by a registered social landlord, Chiltern Hundreds Charitable Housing Association, and managed through Paradigm Housing, an organisation in its group. It is being run as a commercial hostel, is not using the Supporting People programme and is charging market rents, although I think that the rents being charged are significantly more than market rents. What seems rather strange&mdash;I am still trying to have it clarified&mdash;is that although I am told that it is being run as a commercial hostel and market rents are being charged, the organisation appears to be treated as a registered social landlord for housing benefit purposes, so those inflated rents are paid for through housing benefit.</p>
	<p pid="c.241.0/4">There are people living in that place&mdash;temporary accommodation&mdash;paying &pound;130 a week altogether in rent and service charges. What they get for that is a tiny room, and in the room is a single bed, a small table, one chair and perhaps a small fridge. That is it&mdash;that is the total amount of furniture in the room. Everything else is shared. There are shared washing facilities, shared toilets and shared kitchens&mdash;by the way, there are both men and women in the hostel&mdash;and most of that &pound;130 a week is paid through housing benefit.</p>
	<p pid="c.241.0/5">What disturbs me even more is what happens when people who find themselves in that situation try to challenge the rent. Two of the tenants in the hostel went to rent assessment committees. In one case, the committee said that it believed that the rent increase that had been imposed was invalid and it could not adjudicate on it. In the other case, the committee decided that it could adjudicate; it found that the rent should not be &pound;130 a week but &pound;75 a week, and the rent was reduced. No one else's rent was reduced. The consequence was that eviction proceedings were started against both tenants. In one case the eviction has already happened; in the other, it is still proceeding. Under section 21 of the Housing Act 1988, no reason has to be given for eviction because they are assured shorthold tenancies, and it is virtually impossible for tenants to defend themselves.</p>
	<p pid="c.241.0/6">That is the sort of situation that results in people ending up in hostels. Their rent is far more than I believe the justifiable market rent should be, and they are living in poor conditions. When they try to do something about it&mdash;if they challenge the rent and go to the rent assessment committee&mdash;the consequence is eviction; but they have virtually no protection against eviction because of the nature of the tenancy.</p>
	<p pid="c.241.0/7">When I questioned the housing association about its policy of eviction, it said:</p>
	<p pid="c.241.0/8" class="indent">&quot;We do not have a policy of evicting tenants who challenge the Rent Increase Notices sent to them&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="c.241.0/9">that sounds fairly straightforward. However, it continued,</p>
	<p pid="c.241.0/10" class="indent">&quot;but financially we cannot afford to house tenants who are paying &pound;75 a week. Unless tenants pay a commercial rent which is acceptable to the Association, we have no option but to replace those tenants with others who are willing to do so.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="c.241.0/11">If that is not an eviction policy, I do not know what else it could be.</p>
	<p pid="c.241.0/12">It concerns me that a registered social landlord can take that sort of attitude to vulnerable people living in a hostel. I appreciate that the Minister will not know the details of the case, but it is not the sort of thing that we should expect from a registered social landlord, even if things are being run as a commercial operation. I know of other hostels where conditions are probably worse and where rents are higher. Those are the sort of situations in which single homeless people find themselves.</p>
	<p pid="c.241.0/13">We are right to want to build more decent, quality family housing and to help stop families having to go into temporary accommodation, but we should not forget single homeless people. They are faced with the sort of hostel that I have described&mdash;and often far worse. None of these problems will be solved without the supply side being addressed with new build and doing more to bring empty properties into use, and in London doing it on a city-wide basis, as local authorities cannot solve the problem only within their own boundaries.</p>

	<p pid="c.242.0/1">I am listening carefully to the hon. Gentleman. One area of supply that he has not yet mentioned is the Government purchasing blocks of flats that are unsellable because of the credit crunch and the current economic situation. I know that the Government have put quite a bit of money towards such a scheme; indeed, we discussed it in this Chamber only last week. However, I encourage the Government to go even further and provide more money so that local authorities, housing associations and social landlords can take that stock off the market. It will help the housing market and the economy generally, and it will certainly help homeless people.</p>

	<p pid="c.242.1/1">I would certainly like to see that done. I recall that 30 years ago, when I chaired a local authority housing committee, we used to buy properties on the open market. In one instance, we bought a complete estate that had been built by a private developer who was having trouble selling the properties. It did not distort the housing market in the area, and it made a significant contribution to our being able to re-house people in decent property. I have never seen a problem with local authorities doing that.</p>
	<p pid="c.242.1/2">We should consider other solutions as well as looking at the supply side. I know that housing benefit reform is being considered. As part of that process, I hope that the Government will consider the impact of housing benefit on temporary housing and what might be done to change the system. I hope that they will look at what can be done to improve the standards and conditions in which people have to live, and to ensure that if people have to live in temporary accommodation&mdash;we must accept that will happen for some time to come in London, however well we do against our targets&mdash;they can live in decent places at a reasonable cost to them and to the public purse, through what we pay out in benefits.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-11-26c.243.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1755" speakername="Andrew Smith" colnum="243"  time="009:55:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm081126/halltext/81126h0002.htm#08112642000560">
	<p pid="c.243.0/1">This is a vital subject, especially in areas under as much housing stress as Oxford. I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1902" name="Neil Gerrard">the Member for Walthamstow (Mr. Gerrard)</phrase> on securing the debate and on his excellent speech.</p>
	<p pid="c.243.0/2">Underpinning all our discussion is the shortage of affordable housing in general, and social housing in particular. In welcoming the announced bringing forward of capital spending for housing, I urge my hon. Friends to ensure that some of it is in Oxford and, moreover, that the Minister looks hard at how to bring forward the planning decisions that are essential to providing the housing that we need in Oxford and in other areas.</p>
	<p pid="c.243.0/3">I know that other Members want to speak, so I shall keep my remarks succinct. As my hon. Friend the Member for Walthamstow acknowledged, there has been a decline in the number of people in temporary housing. That is welcome, especially when it results from genuinely preventive work, such as mediation to help avoid family breakdown. However, that welcome fall in the headline rate cannot disguise the fact that underlying problems remain, not least because one way that councils, including Oxford, prevent statutory homelessness is by encouraging people&mdash;for example, through help with deposits&mdash;to move into the private rented sector.</p>
	<p pid="c.243.0/4">It is important to understand that people who are moved into the private rented sector often see themselves as being worse off, and in many respects they are. If they are in temporary accommodation, they can expect a social rented tenancy in the future, with less chance of having to move in the meantime; but in the private sector they are all too often in temporary accommodation, on a six month or yearly tenancy, with no priority for social housing and no long-term prospect of anywhere affordable.</p>
	<p pid="c.243.0/5">The other consequence, as my hon. Friend the Member for Walthamstow mentioned, is that whichever form of temporary accommodation people are in, rent levels are such, especially in high-demand areas such as Oxford and London, the disincentives to work are enormous. In February this year, of 130 households in temporary accommodation provided directly by Oxford city council, only five included someone in work. I am sure that can be multiplied across the country.</p>
	<p pid="c.243.0/6">The situation gives rise to at least five big policy implications. The first is the need to consider whether the current requirement to give &quot;reasonable preference&quot; to those in temporary accommodation is fair in the circumstances. As I said, it does not look fair to those who have been forced into private rented accommodation.</p>
	<p pid="c.243.0/7">Secondly, there is a need to raise standards in the private rented sector, both because the sector is important in its own right and because it houses many who would previously have been in more tightly regulated temporary accommodation, with all the shortcomings mentioned by my hon. Friend. That underlines points that I have previously made to the Minister&mdash;we look forward to showing him the situation when he visits Oxford in the near future&mdash;in particular, about the need for city-wide regulation of houses in multiple occupation and the licensing of landlords.</p>
	<p pid="c.243.0/8">The third policy implication was mentioned by my hon. Friend the Member for Walthamstow. It is the need to address the disincentives to work and to explore extending the sort of approach that was piloted in the Working Future project in East London. Although the project involved only relatively small numbers of people, those taking part who received the additional rent subsidy had a 40 per cent. higher rate of job entry than those in the control group, who received similar treatment but without the subsidies. Without doubt, such initiatives, along with wider reform of the benefit system, must form part of the answer.</p>
	<p pid="c.243.0/9">Fourthly, and obviously&mdash;we are all stressing this point&mdash;we should build more affordable homes and accelerate social housing provision, which is long overdue. I agree with the point made by my hon. Friend: single homeless people must be included in the provision. If they are not, the consequences for lives and communities will be devastating.</p>
	<p pid="c.243.0/10">Finally&mdash;this point has not been mentioned yet&mdash;I urge my hon. Friend the Minister and his colleagues to bin the Chartered Institute of Housing's ludicrous proposal to end security of tenure for council tenants, whether new or existing, which would in effect turn all social housing into temporary housing. That would be grotesquely unfair to council and other social tenants, and would be disastrous for communities, because it would create concentrated ghettos of the most disadvantaged people and deepen the spiral of worklessness, which, as I just said, is such a problem. I hope that my hon. Friend will make it clear that the Government will have no truck with that proposal.</p>

	<p pid="c.244.0/1">Not only would the proposal create ghettos, it would run counter to 60 years of Labour party policy to provide mixed communities in local authority estates. We abandon that policy at our peril, both socially and, in particular, politically.</p>

	<p pid="c.244.1/1">My hon. Friend underlines the point effectively. The proposal would stigmatise social housing, and concentrate and deepen social disadvantages.</p>
	<p pid="c.244.1/2">Those in housing need deserve affordable accommodation of a decent standard that enables them to work and to enjoy a more secure life in balanced communities. Temporary accommodation, whatever form it takes, is at best a short-term expedient. It is never the lasting solution that communities need and tenants deserve.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-11-26c.245.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1655" speakername="Jeremy Corbyn" colnum="245"  time="010:03:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm081126/halltext/81126h0002.htm#08112642000563">
	<p pid="c.245.0/1">We seem to have a Westminster Hall housing debate roughly once a week, which is an indication both of the strong feelings among Members about constituents' housing problems and of the continuing direction of travel in this country. Last year, of 191,000 new properties completed, only 27,000 were for the social rented sector. I suspect that the number completed this year, and therefore the number available for the social rented sector, will be much less. We are stacking up problems year on year.</p>
	<p pid="c.245.0/2">Local authorities are stuck with the problem of a statutory obligation to house homeless and vulnerable people, but they simply do not have the stock with which to do it&mdash;certainly in big cities, especially London. As a result, local authorities take the only course open to them, which is to house people in the private sector. My local authority took 2005 as the cut-off date, after which new housing applicants in Islington could not get a housing association or council property. Their only option now is to enter the private sector where although rental deposits might be paid by the local authority, they themselves will have to pay the rent, either through housing benefit or by getting a job.</p>
	<p pid="c.245.0/3">Last year, the housing benefit bill was &pound;4 billion, a large proportion of which I suspect&mdash;I do not have the exact figure&mdash;went to the private landlord system. The average cost of private rented accommodation is between twice and four times that of social rented accommodation, despite the similarity of the properties&mdash;indeed, they are often ex-local authority properties. The amount of public money being poured into the private landlord system is ludicrous. Instead, it should be invested in rented housing for those in desperate housing need.</p>
	<p pid="c.245.0/4">I appeal strongly to the Minister to give us just two bits of good news: first, that the absurd idea of temporary tenancies for local authority tenants will be abandoned. My right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1755" name="Andrew Smith">the Member for Oxford, East (Mr. Smith)</phrase> made the same point. The proposal is immoral, wrong and counter to everything in which our party believes&mdash;everything we have believed in all our lives. Secondly, on Monday, the Chancellor announced a large amount of money to be spent on getting us out of the financial crisis, including a large amount for housing&mdash;&pound;700 million, I think. I hope that the Minister will tell us that a lot of that money will go either to building rental homes or to buying properties, if of a sufficient standard, unsold on the private sector market. We must ensure that the lot of the worst off in society is not made even worse by the crisis.</p>
	<p pid="c.245.0/5">In my borough, 916 households are living in temporary accommodation; 294 of them live out of the borough, which is a fairly normal figure across London. My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1902" name="Neil Gerrard">the Member for Walthamstow (Mr. Gerrard)</phrase> told us about competition between authorities housing people in other boroughs. That is crazy. We have set up a sort of competitive market in which local authorities try to devolve their housing responsibilities to private landlords and then compete for areas in which to do it. A suspiciously large number of out-borough nominations from my borough end up in Enfield or Tottenham.</p>
	<p pid="c.245.0/6">Some boroughs seem able to provide housing wholly within their own borough. For example, Hackney, according to an answer given to my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1777" name="Karen Buck">the Member for Regent's Park and Kensington, North (Ms Buck)</phrase>, has not placed anyone outside the borough. Westminster and Kensington and Chelsea, on the other hand, seem to place very large numbers of people outside their boroughs, although Westminster was unable to report on the exact figure, presumably because it was too big. It is completely unacceptable that a couple of boroughs&mdash;Haringey and Westminster&mdash;seem incapable of reporting the figure.</p>

	<p pid="c.246.0/1">The Haringey figure was reported yesterday in response to a parliamentary question of mine. Haringey has the largest number of children in temporary accommodation, but the figure was not reported for previous years. It has finally counted the number, but it appears that it tried to hide the figure because it is so large.</p>

	<p pid="c.246.1/1">And the numbers are so large because of the lack of building, and the difficulties that local authorities have had in the past with building. We must conquer that problem. However, I am not defending the numbers in private accommodation&mdash;quite the opposite.</p>
	<p pid="c.246.1/2">The Minister may have had the pleasure&mdash;if that is the right word&mdash;of reading the report on the Mayor's London housing strategy, which has an unusually long declamatory introduction from the new Mayor. However, it is woefully short of detailed proposals, except that he will have negotiations with every London borough to achieve a 50 per cent. target. It contains no word about the results of those negotiations or borough meetings&mdash;indeed, I am not sure whether any have been held yet.</p>
	<p pid="c.246.1/3">The report appears to contain a series of aspirations. The Mayor says a great deal about the necessity&mdash;in his view&mdash;of people getting on the housing ladder and purchasing property, but not an awful lot about affordable homes and even less about social rented accommodation. I am sure that the Minister understands that the situation in London is desperate. In a normal constituency, such as mine or those of my hon. Friends the Members for Regents Park and Kensington, North and for Walthamstow or of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1445" name="Sarah Teather">the hon. Member for Brent, East (Sarah Teather)</phrase>, the proportion of people who can afford to buy a property in their own community is probably less than 20 to 30 per cent. For very large numbers of people, home ownership in London is simply a pipe dream, so the only way forward is to build homes for rent.</p>
	<p pid="c.246.1/4">One piece of information in the Mayor's report that is of interest is a chart entitled, &quot;Homeless households: numbers in temporary accommodation and lettings by region.&quot; Last year, all regions had a larger number of social housing lets made to homeless families than there were homeless households in temporary accommodation. In the case of London, however, it was the other way round. Nearly 60,000 households were in temporary accommodation, with only 11,000 new lets during the year. That is a measure of how bad the problem is, and it is getting very much worse.</p>
	<p pid="c.246.1/5">I will be brief because other hon. Members want to speak. The Minister will have seen Shelter's proposals for dealing with housing supply in the current climate. I hope he recognises that Shelter, along with many other organisations, is sensibly proposing that we consider housing as a social priority for the whole country and that we do all we can to invest in new housing for rent at the present time. This is a debate about the supply of temporary and rented accommodation.</p>
	<p pid="c.246.1/6">My final point&mdash;I hope that the Minister will understand its importance&mdash;concerns the enormous amount of money that we are pouring into the private rented market through the housing benefit system. I am not in any way critical of people who claim housing benefit. I absolutely support such claims; it is a right and people should enjoy that right.</p>

	<p pid="c.247.0/1">Does the hon. Gentleman agree that there have been some particularly egregious cases in which local authority housing departments have rented very large, expensive houses when that is not the best value for public money? That has had the effect both of wasting money and of stoking the prejudices that are often evidenced in the national press, especially in the <i>Evening Standard, </i>against those who are homeless or in need of affordable housing.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-11-26c.247.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1655" speakername="Jeremy Corbyn" colnum="247"  time="010:03:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm081126/halltext/81126h0002.htm#08112642000567">
	<p pid="c.247.1/1">Yes, the <i>Evening Standard </i>and other papers seem quick to find someone who has been housed in a particularly valuable home so that they can blame the tenant for being placed there by a local authority. Such a story becomes quite unpleasant and intrudes on that person's life. The reality is that the person probably had no choice about where they were placed. If it is a good property, that is fine, but such stories detract from the real issue, which is the cost to all of us of the private rented system. It is time for us to look at the models that successfully operate in many other parts of the world. There are better systems for registration of private and rented authorities, much better inspection and much tougher standards on the operation of them.</p>
	<p pid="c.247.1/2">It is fairly clear that when one is in the ultra-commercial private rented sector, conditions are often very good. We are talking about extremely high rents in central London. The conditions are good; there are concierges, caretakers, repair teams and all the rest. However, the rented properties leased to local authorities, or rented to tenants nominated by local authorities, are appalling. Repairs are not done. The properties are often vermin-infested, dangerous and totally unsuitable for children. Is it not time that we were much tougher on regulation, and that we brought in rent regulation?</p>
	<p pid="c.247.1/3">The Labour Government of 1974 managed to introduce rent regulation. Harold Wilson, the then Prime Minister, threatened to keep the House sitting throughout August unless that piece of legislation went through. Well done him. He showed determination to do something about the scandal of the private rented sector. I hope that in this crisis we will be prepared to make similar efforts to protect people.</p>
	<p pid="c.247.1/4">The losers in temporary accommodation are vulnerable people, and the children who have to move schools frequently and cannot build up a network of friends. The community also loses out because there is no stability and people cannot contribute to school governing bodies, tenants' associations and residents' groups and all the rest. We end up with an increasingly fractured, transient society. What we desperately need is stability through secure, affordable rented accommodation delivered mainly through local authorities, as our party has always campaigned for and proudly delivered in the past to many people in desperate housing need.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-11-26c.248.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1777" speakername="Karen Buck" colnum="248"  time="010:14:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm081126/halltext/81126h0002.htm#08112642000568">
	<p pid="c.248.0/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1902" name="Neil Gerrard">the Member for Walthamstow (Mr. Gerrard)</phrase> on securing this debate. I introduced a debate on temporary accommodation a year ago, and a number of the points remain valid. I will be reinforcing many of the issues that my hon. Friends have raised.</p>
	<p pid="c.248.0/2">In dealing with the current housing situation, we seem to want to pursue a number of incompatible objectives. Individually, such objectives might be entirely reasonable, but they are not consistent with each other. For example, we want to reduce the number of households living in temporary accommodation, which is absolutely unarguable. Temporary accommodation is not a good thing, nor is it a desirable place to be. We also want to reduce expenditure on housing benefit, yet one of the strategies that we are adopting is to divert people from temporary accommodation and move them into private-sector leasing, which can be even more expensive.</p>
	<p pid="c.248.0/3">We want to achieve the target of reducing temporary accommodation by 50 per cent. However, we do not want to do it in such a way that we increase overcrowding or pressure on the social housing stock. I am afraid I have to tell my hon. Friend that that is completely impossible. We want to maintain the Department for Communities and Local Government's code of practice on the limited use of out of borough temporary accommodation placements. None the less, we want to cut expenditure on temporary accommodation, which has the perverse consequence of encouraging the use of out of borough placements.</p>
	<p pid="c.248.0/4">For understandable and, in many cases, good reasons, we are in a mess. Part of the problem is that we desired to use the example of the successful and sensible decision to set a target for ending the use of bed-and-breakfast accommodation and apply it to temporary accommodation. We have done that in a way that has had a number of perverse consequences.</p>
	<p pid="c.248.0/5">I shall run through a few points. I cannot apologise for the fact that they will be stressing the same issues that my hon. Friends have raised. We must remember that we are dealing with real human beings who are going through the homelessness process. I am sorry to say that our approach to homeless households is one that we do not adopt for anyone in need of services and support in any other area of public policy. If someone is sick, we do not say, &quot;It does not matter how good your doctor is, because if you are sick, you will just be very grateful to have a doctor.&quot; If someone has a child coming up to school age, we do not say, &quot;If you are desperate to have your child educated, it does not matter how bad the education is because you will just be very pleased to have a school for your child.&quot; Yet, when it comes to housing people who are in housing need or homeless, we adopt an approach that is fundamentally no different from the Poor Law Amendment Act 1834, which says that if someone is in housing need, it does not matter in what conditions they are housed because they are so desperate for a home that they will be grateful. That is the legal position adopted by local authorities when determining their duties under housing legislation.</p>
	<p pid="c.248.0/6">In my surgeries, time and time again I see people from the borough of Westminster who have been told that if they make a housing application, they will be housed in Barking and Dagenham or Walthamstow. If they refuse the accommodation that they are offered, the case will be classed as &quot;duty discharged&quot;. We then end up with a situation such as this:</p>
	<p pid="c.248.0/7" class="indent">&quot;I take this opportunity to write to you and explain my situation. I am a family man of 5 children and a wife, my children are from the ages of 14 years old, 12 years old, 10 years old, 8 years old and a baby boy of 7 months old.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="c.248.0/8">He said that he was living near the Harrow road,</p>
	<p pid="c.248.0/9" class="indent">&quot;near to members of my family, my brothers and sisters. On the 16 of January I was asked by the court to evacuate as the landlord was not up to date with the mortgage payment, at the time I was paying rent direct to his agent...On the date of my evacuation I went to the Westminster Housing service...for advice and was asked to fill in an application for temporary homeless, and I was then put up in a hotel in east London.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="c.248.0/10">His wife suffers from numerous health problems and is registered in Paddington. He said:</p>
	<p pid="c.248.0/11" class="indent">&quot;My children attend a school in the Westminster area which makes this difficult for us to commute every morning. In March, the council offered us an accommodation in Victoria&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="c.248.0/12">However, the property was too small for the family and was not of a decent standard. The individual in question refused the offer and the case went to review. The housing offer was cancelled and he added:</p>
	<p pid="c.248.0/13" class="indent">&quot;From the 7th of July my family and I will be homeless. I was wondering if there is any way you could help in this matter&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="c.248.0/14">In other words, if accommodation is not in a location or condition that families feel able to accept, the duty to them has been discharged, and they end up on the streets. In many cases a slightly perverse consequence is that they end up being supported by social services in the same local authority where the housing department has discharged the duty, at a fantastic cost. Social workers from that very local authority ring me to ask whether there is anything I can do about a family, because their housing authority has refused, and the social workers are acting as housing officers because so many families are caught in those difficult circumstances.</p>
	<p pid="c.248.0/15">My hon. Friend the Member for Walthamstow mentioned out of borough nominations, which is a persistent and serious problem in my constituency. A family came to see me two weeks ago. They had lived in the Church street area of Westminster since Mr. A was born. The two younger children are in a school in Church street, and the family now commute daily from Barking to bring the children to school. Families do that all the time, having decided that the school is the one place of safety and stability in their entire turbulent family life. They commute with their children an hour and a half in the morning and at the end of the day, at huge expense, to keep the children in a stable environment. Mr. A works near Marble Arch, and Mrs. A is the registered full-time carer for her father-in-law, who also lives in Church street. In my view such a case is in clear breach of the code of guidance applied by the local authority. It is under review at the moment so I do not know what the outcome will be, but it strikes me as a case in which the principle of the code of guidance, that families with a clear local connection and good reasons for remaining in a community should be assisted in doing so, should be applied.</p>
	<p pid="c.248.0/16">In a third case, from a little while ago, a lady, Mrs. S, wrote to me:</p>
	<p pid="c.248.0/17" class="indent">&quot;I used in live in Harrow Road...I was moved to Dagenham three years ago by Westminster after I separated from my husband after domestic violence...My husband, who was coming to see my son, knew that because I was isolated from my family and friends and vulnerable, he could dominate me easily...I now feel more vulnerable than ever. I asked...for help and support by transferring me back to the...area where all my friends and family are but they refused. Being a Muslim it is much more difficult to socialize in this part of London&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="c.248.0/18">Of course there is a further dimension in that case, which is the housing of homeless families from black and minority ethnic communities in parts of the city where community cohesion is a real and pressing problem.</p>
	<p pid="c.248.0/19">What makes the matter worse at present is the fact that several temporary accommodation leases are coming to an end, partly because of pressure to achieve the target of a 50 per cent. reduction in the use of temporary accommodation. That means that families, some of whom have already had eight different temporary addresses&mdash;in my borough there are families who have stayed in temporary accommodation for up to a decade, making the term something of a misnomer&mdash;must move yet again. A few weeks ago I was dealing with a family who were due for eviction because the lease on the property came to an end, and who had to sit all day on the pavement, with their young children and their luggage, waiting for alternative accommodation to be provided. In such cases families receive a standard letter:</p>
	<p pid="c.248.0/20" class="indent">&quot;When we offered you your current home we explained that we do not own it&mdash;we lease the property from Notting Hill Housing Association who in turn leases it from the owner. As you may already know the owner wants the property back and we are in the process of ending your tenancy. This means we have to find you somewhere else to live.</p>
	<p pid="c.248.0/21" class="indent">We do not have anything for you at the moment but as soon as we find another home we will contact you. Unfortunately, we cannot say when this will be as we cannot predict when a suitable property will become available. We will try to find you another home before the Court ends your tenancy, however, please contact us immediately if you receive a notice of eviction from the court bailiff.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="c.248.0/22">That tenancy is due to end before Christmas. I know of several others due to end on <phrase class="date" code="2008-12-30">30 December</phrase>, including that of a woman who is the chair of governors of a struggling primary school, where she has been an enormous inspiration to the local area. She has been told that her tenancy will end. There is no indication of how and when alternative accommodation will be provided for her. Some of the families affected will be told to expect to have to go back to bed and breakfast&mdash;after all they have been through, including bed and breakfast in the past&mdash;because there is no comfortable match between the supply of temporary accommodation and their needs.</p>
	<p pid="c.248.0/23">With all those problems, there are about 53,000 households, not including single people, in temporary accommodation at the moment, whose lives are under constant pressure of disruption. As my hon. Friends have said&mdash;I think everyone has made this point&mdash;it is at a fabulous cost to the public purse. The standard charge for our accommodation is &pound;435 a week, which adds up comfortably to &pound;500 million a year just for families in temporary accommodation on housing benefit.</p>
	<p pid="c.248.0/24">My hon. Friends also all said that the situation means that families wanting to work face an impossible hurdle. We understand that around 90 per cent. of households in temporary accommodation are unemployed, compared to a 60 per cent. average for working age households in social housing tenancies as a whole. There is a clear gap that can be explained by no other factor than the sharply steeper rents in private sector leased accommodation and temporary accommodation. It seems strange to me that we did not want to pursue the &quot;Working Futures&quot; model and treat rent through the block grant system in the same way as we would treat people on social tenancies. That would enable people to go back to work.</p>
	<p pid="c.248.0/25">There is much more that we can do. We need to carry on improving the standard of temporary accommodation, because although some properties are in good condition still too many are not. We need to deal with the issues of work incentives and people on housing benefit; we need to deal with out of borough nominations, and to enforce the code of practice in the interest of community cohesion, family stability and mixed communities. We need to review the application of the 50 per cent. reduction target for temporary accommodation. It is having a catastrophic effect on transfers for people already in social rented accommodation, and leading to perverse consequences in the private leased sector, which has given rise to all the high-profile cases on which the media have recently reported.</p>

	<p pid="c.251.0/1">I thought that the hon. Lady might point out the need to deal with the supply of housing. In my borough we need about 200 more social housing units, which would help tremendously, but I do not see how we can get them. However, many local authorities are sitting on significant reserves of section 106 money, which is not being spent, but which could help to provide that supply. It could even supplement the additional money that I hope the Minister will announce.</p>

	<p pid="c.251.1/1">The hon. Gentleman is completely right. Last week we had another debate about housing in London, in which we discussed the issue of supply, so I did not want simply to repeat the same points. Of course supply is the key to the matter but, with specific reference to temporary accommodation, it seems far more sensible to capitalise the stream of housing benefit that we are pouring into the pockets of private landlords, often for substandard accommodation, and develop a hugely increased programme of temporary to permanent schemes, so that we provide stability for people in their accommodation.</p>
	<p pid="c.251.1/2">Of course we want to continue driving forward supply. It is a great sadness to me that my local authority managed to achieve a figure last year of only 11 per cent. of all homes being affordable. I have no great optimism, under the present London regime, that the situation will change without what I am looking for, what I hope for, and what I am confident we shall deliver through the Government. There will be tension between local authorities and the Mayor of London. Supply is the key, but I still maintain that even within the present supply regime there are many things we can do to sort out the perverse incentives and conflicting objectives, to improve quality and work incentives and try to ensure that the vulnerable families and single people who through no fault of their own become homeless by definition, because of the way the duty is dealt with, do not have to go through the sheer hell that so many thousands experience every day in London. If we are serious about a social cohesion agenda those families must be at its heart.</p>

	<p pid="c.252.1/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1902" name="Neil Gerrard">the hon. Member for Walthamstow (Mr. Gerrard)</phrase> on securing this vital debate and I agree entirely with the points that he made. The real problem with temporary accommodation is how long people often remain in that situation.</p>
	<p pid="c.252.1/2">I also agree strongly with <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1777" name="Karen Buck">the hon. Member for Regent's Park and Kensington, North (Ms Buck)</phrase>, who made a typically thoughtful and insightful speech on housing. I have exchanged views with her in many such debates, and I think that her constituency is similar to mine in this regard. She made the point that we often treat people who are homeless far worse than we would treat anybody else who is vulnerable.</p>
	<p pid="c.252.1/3">Something about having a home and the nature of that home is critical to a person's identity, but all too often, because of rationing, we give people the bare minimum and make them beg for it. The fact that local authorities force people to wait on their doorsteps with their belongings around them and their children in their arms is but one example. Local authorities all over the country do it because they do not want the extra cost of a night in accommodation and because accommodation is so scarce.</p>
	<p pid="c.252.1/4">I have a couple of examples from my constituency that address many of the points made by hon. Members. Miss A, a single mother with four children, has been in temporary accommodation since 1997. She has moved many times since, but has been in her current property for three years. She has medical problems, but none that would require her to be upgraded, so under the Locata system&mdash;the choice-based letting scheme&mdash;she is in band C. That means that she is in housing need, but that she has not got a cat's chance in hell of moving within the time it will take for her children to grow up. She bids every fortnight, but is getting nowhere.</p>
	<p pid="c.252.1/5">Ms D lives in two-bedroom accommodation. She has been in temporary accommodation for seven years and lives with her two adult granddaughters, aged 20 and 21. The 21-year-old is eight months pregnant and has sickle cell disease, and the accommodation is in a poor state of repair.</p>
	<p pid="c.252.1/6">I am afraid that I see an awful lot of cases like those. Predominantly, London Members are here today, but the problem is one that hon. Members right across the country speak about. The cases are devastating to listen to and extremely frustrating, as one knows that it will be difficult to get the people involved moved on. The problem, particularly for children, as many hon. Members have mentioned, is the frequency with which people in temporary accommodation move. The hon. Member for Regent's Park and Kensington, North spoke about how much travelling parents often do with their children. I have many similar examples; I am afraid that my local authority often places people in Hackney.</p>
	<p pid="c.252.1/7">The difficulty is not just cost, which the hon. Members for Islington, North (Jeremy Corbyn) and for Regent's Park and Kensington, North mentioned, but availability of accommodation. That lies at the root of the matter; it is about supply. Lack of supply creates lack of choice about where to place people, and they are often placed a long way from their homes and families, usually when they are at their most vulnerable&mdash;not necessarily when they are given long-term placements in temporary accommodation, where they may have some chance to establish themselves, but usually when they arrive at the housing department, having been evicted or having become completely homeless, and the local authority tries to decide whether it has a duty to house them. Those occasions are particularly stressful for families. Because of the lack of decent temporary accommodation, people often end up being moved long distances from where they live.</p>
	<p pid="c.252.1/8">A number of hon. Members, including the hon. Member for Walthamstow, spoke about the difficulty of keeping work while moving around, but I agree with other hon. Members that the issue is more about the combination of housing benefit and high rents, and the disincentive to work that that creates. Even though the new policies allow people a period in which they do not lose their housing benefit, most families know that, in the long term, if they are paying high rents in temporary accommodation or private accommodation in which they were not placed by the council, they know that it is simply not worth it&mdash;and the cost to the taxpayer is enormous.</p>
	<p pid="c.252.1/9">The issue of poor standards has been raised; I mentioned it in relation to one of the cases I spoke about a few moments ago. The hon. Member for Islington, North discussed some local authorities' over-closeness with particular agencies, but we must also be realistic about the fact that a lot of private landlords do not want people on housing benefit placed in their property. Most local authorities are not terribly good at administering housing benefit, especially if people go in and out of work or their circumstances change, which creates a disincentive for landlords because they know that the rent will not be paid on time. How many cases have we all dealt with in our local areas where housing benefit has been overpaid and then withdrawn for extended periods? It is unfortunately no wonder that there is a disincentive for private landlords who rely on housing benefit for their income to take people in that situation.</p>
	<p pid="c.252.1/10"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1755" name="Andrew Smith">The right hon. Member for Oxford, East (Mr. Smith)</phrase> raised a number of interesting points about quality in the private sector. Over-regulation is a danger. Particularly now, when we are trying to get private property back into use, we do not want to create an incentive to leave it empty. I am rather more attracted to the idea of landlord accreditation schemes, which a number of local authorities have begun. I wonder whether we can encourage such schemes to become more common and to raise the bar for standards.</p>
	<p pid="c.252.1/11">The hon. Member for Walthamstow mentioned people in hostels. I have an example in my constituency and just this week I was discussing the issue with Octavia housing association. Four or five years ago, just after I was elected, I opened one of its hostels to house young people leaving care. It was supposed to be a supported housing centre to ensure that young people can move on to independence, but the truth, as he said, is that most never move on because there is nowhere for them to go.</p>
	<p pid="c.252.1/12">I am afraid that all the problems that I have discussed come back to supply, and I shall take a few minutes to mention a couple of the issues. It is likely that the difficulties will only get worse along with the economic situation and that we will see an increase in the number of people whose homes are repossessed, the number who arrive at the council's door asking to be housed and the number who are left waiting with their belongings around them and their children in their arms, housed in temporary accommodation and then moved on and on. We know that that will happen.</p>
	<p pid="c.252.1/13">The Government's priority needs to be to keep people in their homes for as long as possible. I recognise that the Government have made advances on that, and I support much of what they have said on the issue of repossessions, but I do not think that the pre-action protocol that came into force recently goes far enough.</p>
	<p pid="c.252.1/14">I am disappointed that the Government have not taken advantage of the Banking Bill, which is likely to finish its progress through the House of Commons today, to update mortgage law, much of which is extremely outdated. I do not think that there is any place for remedies such as foreclosure. The Government could have amended the Bill so that the courts had the teeth to deal with the things that they want the courts to deal with to ensure that people have a chance to stay in their homes if they can repay their debt over a long period.</p>
	<p pid="c.252.1/15">I also want the Government to make it a priority to tackle commercial mortgage rescue products, which, again, will only increase the number of people arriving into temporary accommodation. I have seen this in my constituency. People are encouraged to allow their houses to be bought out at a fraction of their value, and one knows that in 12 months' time those people will be evicted and will land at the council's door. The Office of Fair Trading has recommended that the Government tackle it, but they still have not responded. Now is the time to respond. The matter is urgent, and I hope that the Government will ensure that such products are properly regulated by the Financial Services Authority.</p>
	<p pid="c.252.1/16">I hope that the Minister will make it easier for housing associations and councils to buy up land now, while it is cheap, as well as suitable property, to ensure that we can house many of the people in desperate need. I recognise that the pre-Budget report included &pound;770 million more for that purpose. Of course, &pound;400 million of that had already been announced, but there is no reason why the Government could not front-load the money that has already been allocated in the comprehensive spending review for this area, which would also ensure that we unblocked those obstacles that are preventing housing associations from building now.</p>
	<p pid="c.252.1/17">The issue for housing associations is that their social build has relied on cross-subsidy from private sales and shared equity, and we know that, at the moment, that subsidy is not coming through. Unless the Government are prepared to accept that, in the short term, each unit will require higher subsidy, there is no way that those units will be built and we will end up in a worse situation at the end of this economic crisis than we are in now.</p>

	<p pid="c.254.0/1">I start by congratulating <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1902" name="Neil Gerrard">the hon. Member for Walthamstow (Mr. Gerrard)</phrase> on securing an excellent debate on a subject that I know he cares about a great deal. Temporary accommodation and homelessness is a subject that I have spent a lot of time dealing with in the last couple of years.</p>
	<p pid="c.254.0/2">A couple of figures mentioned at the beginning of the debate go against the official records. The Department for Communities and Local Government says that, on <phrase class="date" code="2008-03-31">31 March</phrase>, there were 78,000 homeless households in England in temporary accommodation, which is nearly twice as many as in 1997. It also says that three quarters of those households in temporary accommodation contain children who are dependants. Indeed, I published a report a year ago almost to the day that showed that there are 130,000 homeless children living in various forms of temporary accommodation, which is double the number 10 years ago.</p>
	<p pid="c.254.0/3">Those are the facts. What about the reasons? It seems clear that the lack of supply has been the biggest contributory factor to those enlarged figures and the supply side has created a range of problems. It does not really matter whether one is looking at temporary accommodation, lack of social or affordable housing, or housing in general. As has been discussed many times in similar debates, for every type of housing fewer houses have been built in the last decade, which I know is as deeply troubling to many Labour Members as it is to us in the Conservative party.</p>
	<p pid="c.254.0/4">The simple lack of housing provision has led to many of the chronic problems that were described today in great detail, with individual case histories being provided during the debate. As was mentioned, it is a fact that only 27,000 affordable homes will be built this year. It will be interesting to hear a projection for next year from the Minister.</p>
	<p pid="c.254.0/5">One of the key issues that has emerged from this morning's debate is the problem of lack of provision for people who are not priority cases. Had I had more time, I would have outlined a case that I encountered in my surgery a few weeks ago. At 5 pm on a Friday, the local council was saying, &quot;Sorry, we've gone as far as we can, we've gone beyond our statutory duty and we cannot help you,&quot; yet I was sitting in my surgery with a man who had nowhere to go and nowhere to sleep over the weekend other than his car, where he had spent the week beforehand. I appreciate that simply adding more people to the priority list is not an answer in itself, because it just makes the priority list larger. Once again, however, the overall lack of housing and the failure to provide supply are the central cause and problem that absolutely must be addressed by this Government, or indeed the next.</p>
	<p pid="c.254.0/6">There is another problem, which is very revealing. In conversation, Charles Fraser&mdash;chief executive of St. Mungo's, which is a large London charity&mdash;told me that back in the 1980s 84 per cent. of the people living in its hostels were in work, but nowadays just 4 per cent. are in work.</p>
	<p pid="c.254.0/7">That problem of worklessness, which is due to factors such as a change in the profile of available jobs, creates an additional layer of difficulty, as does the fact that housing benefit means that there is a positive disincentive for people to get back into work, as was mentioned earlier. It is verging on criminal that it is more expensive for people to go out and do something productive than it is for them to claim housing benefit. On many occasions in the many hostels that I have visited, I have spoken to people who are distressed beyond belief by that situation&mdash;it is an urgent case of a priority review.</p>
	<p pid="c.254.0/8">In a Westminster Hall debate a couple of weeks ago, I pressed the Minister for Housing as to when the Government will pronounce on that review. There was a suggestion that it would be before the end of the year. I take it that that will not now be the case and I urge the Minister who is here today to tell us when the review might take place.</p>

	<p pid="c.256.1/1">No, but what is important is that we have a system of housing benefit that needs to be scaleable. It is absolutely wrong that somebody who is working may lose money each week. That situation is preventing people from getting into work and keeping on housing benefit people who do not want or need to be on it. That is at the heart of the problem.</p>
	<p pid="c.256.1/2">On rent levels, the real issue, of course, is the lack of supply of housing. Rents reflect the housing available and if the Government have failed to build as much affordable housing in every single one of the last 10 years as was built in any of the years prior to that, we have ended up in this situation, where the lack of suitable housing creates a real problem. That is the situation we find ourselves in.</p>

	<p pid="c.256.5/1">No. People would be much better off if they could get out to work and earn more than the housing benefit. The problem is that housing benefit is too rigid in terms of its step; we need more of a sliding scale. I will be interested to hear when the Minister intends to report on that issue. The Government have conceded that there is a problem in this area. Several Labour Members are looking at me as if I am making this up, but it has been conceded by the Government.

	<p pid="c.256.6/1">On the question of housing supply, which the hon.

	<p pid="c.256.7/1">I do not want to get too far off the subject. The simple facts are that, on average, 145,000 homes have built each year under this Government, compared with 175,000 under the previous Government, meaning that over 10 years about a third of a million fewer homes have been built. If those homes had been built and were in play and in the marketplace, it is reasonable to expect that rents would be lower.</p>
	<p pid="c.256.7/2">That situation is what we need to get back to, but we cannot do it through top-down targets; we need to do it through bottom-up incentives. That is a fundamental argument at the heart of this debate and every other debate on housing that takes place here in Westminster Hall. Until the Government recognise that they cannot force the targets down on unsuspecting communities without giving them something in return&mdash;those communities need to be provided with a carrot or an incentive to build new homes&mdash;we will continue in the mess that we find ourselves in today. Labour Members are happy to complain about that mess, but they will not recognise the source or the real reasons behind the catastrophic situation in relation to temporary housing, homelessness and, indeed, the cost of housing overall.</p>
	<p pid="c.256.7/3">I will end soon because I want to hear the Minister's response, not least how he will build more homes than the Government have managed to do in the last few years. Before I finish, however, I want to ask a number of questions. First, there was an announcement of &pound;750 million&mdash;I think that was the figure&mdash;in the pre-Budget report the other day. However, there was no description of how that money would be spent, how it would be brought forward and how it would encourage the creation of more housing. I assume that that money has already been allocated in the budget of the Homes and Communities Agency, so perhaps the Minister will take a minute to explain how that money will ease the housing crisis.</p>
	<p pid="c.256.7/4">Given that we know that there has been less affordable housing built every year in the last 10 years and that the market is likely to crash this year and next, perhaps the Minister will also tell us his estimates of housing numbers in the affordable sector for this year and next.</p>
	<p pid="c.256.7/5">I was interested in the comments by some hon. Members about secure tenure. There now seems to be a tradition of new Housing Ministers coming in about every three months and making some fairly outrageous statements to some newspaper, only to row back from them a few days later. We remember that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1543" name="Caroline Flint">the right hon. Member for Don Valley (Caroline Flint)</phrase>&mdash;now Minister for Europe and predecessor of the current Minister for Housing&mdash;came in and immediately made statements about throwing people who do not work out of their homes, without realising that the local authority would have to house those families if they were in priority need. Will the Minister explain whether that policy is on or off the table?</p>
	<p pid="c.256.7/6">Finally, on security of tenure, will the Minister say whether that is an idea put forward by the Minister for Housing, or is it simply an idea from a think-tank?</p>

	<p pid="c.257.0/1">It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Mr. Gale. Earlier this year, you ably steered the Housing and Regeneration Bill Committee, in which many of the issues that we have discussed today were initially raised. I am grateful to you for presiding over an excellent debate, albeit a sombre one&mdash;as befits the subject. I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1902" name="Neil Gerrard">the Member for Walthamstow (Mr. Gerrard)</phrase> on securing the debate and on the excellent way in which he advanced his argument, and I congratulate other hon. Members from both sides of the House on the quality of their speeches.</p>
	<p pid="c.257.0/2">Tackling homelessness and reducing fear about housing, as well as housing policy in general, are at the heart of what the Government want to do&mdash;they are at the top of our domestic priorities. We have achieved a lot in recent years by making substantial and sustained cuts in the worst form of homelessness; namely, rough sleeping. Hon. Members will be aware that I was able to announce last week our new rough sleeping strategy, which states our ambition to end rough sleeping once and for all by 2012. That target will be incredibly challenging and difficult to achieve, but if we have focus and determination, and if we work in partnership with local authorities and the voluntary sector, we will achieve it.</p>
	<p pid="c.257.0/3">We have also ended the long-term reliance on bed and breakfast accommodation for families, and we are well on the way to ending it for 16 and 17-year-olds. I was pleased that hon. Members from both sides of the House acknowledged the great advances that we have made on that in the past decade. There have been reductions of more than 50 per cent. in new cases of statutory homelessness since 2004. Subsequently, numbers in temporary accommodation have fallen by 26 per cent. In 2008, the number has fallen by 11 per cent., from 87,120 to 77,510. My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1677" name="David Taylor">the Member for North-West Leicestershire (David Taylor)</phrase> said that in his region&mdash;the east midlands&mdash;the target to reduce the number of households living in temporary accommodation by 50 per cent. by 2010 has already been achieved. It has also already been achieved in the south-east and north-east.</p>
	<p pid="c.257.0/4">There is a lot to be proud of on temporary accommodation, but I do not want to be complacent. There is an awful lot left to be done. We are committed to reducing, as much as possible, reliance on temporary accommodation, but I am under no illusion, given the current economic circumstances, about the challenges we face. The main task for the Government is ensuring that we minimise, as far as possible, the number of people who are forced to lose their home through repossession or other means. I was taken with what <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1445" name="Sarah Teather">the hon. Member for Brent, East (Sarah Teather)</phrase> said about that. It is important: people are frightened that they will lose their homes, and the Government are determined to do all it takes to ensure that they do not.</p>
	<p pid="c.257.0/5">The hon. Lady will be aware of the announcements in Monday's pre-Budget report. The Government will help to protect people who are at risk of repossession by driving through support for vulnerable households via the mortgage rescue scheme, providing direct support for some individuals through support for the mortgage interest regime, and ensuring that we have fair treatment by lenders, with lenders absolutely committed not to initiate repossession proceedings within at least three months of an account going into arrears. We are committed to working with lenders to create sustainable solutions to help borrowers to stay in their homes.</p>
	<p pid="c.257.0/6">My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1777" name="Karen Buck">the Member for Regent's Park and Kensington, North (Ms Buck)</phrase> mentioned something that disturbed and concerned me. She talked about a family who were renting in the private rented sector losing their home through no fault of their own, because the landlord had failed to pay the mortgage. I will work on that problem to see what can be done. I am worried that vulnerable households&mdash;through no fault of their own&mdash;may be at risk of losing their homes because landlords have not paid. I am keen to work on that problem and to put something solid in place.</p>
	<p pid="c.257.0/7">Because of the lack of certainty about the future and the disruption caused by frequent moves, which has been made all too clear in the debate, we need to do much more. About 87 per cent.&mdash;92 per cent. of families with children&mdash;are now living in self-contained temporary accommodation, with their own front door and cooking and washing facilities. However, as has been made clear to me this morning, they are not settled homes, because people do not feel at all stable or secure in them. That is why we are retaining the target to halve the number of households in temporary accommodation.</p>
	<p pid="c.257.0/8">The point about cleanliness and standards in temporary accommodation was also well made in the debate. I met Professor Suzanne Fitzpatrick from the university of York earlier this year, who presented me with the key findings of research into the causes and impacts of statutory homelessness for families and 16 and 17-year-olds in England. It is the first nationally representative survey of families and children who have been homeless for more than 10 years, and the first such survey of 16 and 17-year-olds. The findings are incredibly interesting.</p>
	<p pid="c.257.0/9">As hon. Members would expect, the research shows greater incidences of problems with physical conditions in self-contained temporary accommodation compared with settled housing. However, interestingly, there seems to be no substantial difference between self-contained temporary accommodation and settled housing in respect of the state of repair or the levels of cleanliness when families first arrive. As hon. Members would expect, the research shows that although the homelessness system is working well, families and children have an improved quality of life once they are in settled housing. That underlines the importance of pressing forward on meeting the temporary accommodation target.</p>

	<p pid="c.259.0/1">Will the Minister comment on the departmental code of practice on out of borough placements? We are talking about settled accommodation, but being settled a long way from the community in which one has schools, employment, family and friends is important. There is a code of practice, and it should be enforced.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-11-26c.259.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1620" speakername="Iain Wright" colnum="259"  time="010:50:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm081126/halltext/81126h0004.htm#08112642000584">
	<p pid="c.259.1/1">I was going to mention that later, but as we are on the subject, there is an inter-borough agreement on the issue. It is worrying. I know that my hon. Friend has had meetings on the matter with the previous housing Minister, my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1543" name="Caroline Flint">the Member for Don Valley (Caroline Flint)</phrase>. In early December, I will meet officials of Westminster city council and I will raise that key issue along with other things that arose from a previous meeting, especially the problem of overcrowding. The matter is important. I am instructing my officials to work closely with London councils to encourage all boroughs to abide fully by the agreement. I agree that more can be done, and if I have time later in my speech I will mention the wider prospect of supply and its importance.</p>
	<p pid="c.259.1/2">Key to achieving the target is prevention. We need to ensure that we do not have a reactive, ad hoc approach to producing temporary accommodation to solve the problem. Intervening at the trigger points when people might become homeless, and fully involving friends, family and the wider community to stop people reaching crisis point, is absolutely crucial. We have achieved our successes by encouraging and providing significant investment in homelessness prevention. Approximately a third of local authorities have already met the 2010 target. They have strengthened their efforts, and provide prevention services such as rent deposit schemes, mediation to help resolve family and relationship breakdowns or problems between tenants and landlords, and debt counselling. Last year, 201 local authorities operated rent deposit schemes and a further 45 were planning to put such a scheme in place. That proves that private rented accommodation is an effective housing option for preventing homelessness and providing a means of settled accommodation, when it is what the household wants.</p>
	<p pid="c.259.1/3">Many hon. Members mentioned the housing benefit regime, which is crucial, and my hon. Friend the Member for Walthamstow asked a question about it last Tuesday in the House. Everyone is aware that local authorities must administer the local housing allowance, which was introduced in April 2008, in accordance with regulations. Local authorities can, and in the vast majority of cases do, take responsible decisions about providing housing for families in their area. However, as was said time and again in the debate, perverse disincentives ensure that people who are reliant on housing benefit do not work.</p>
	<p pid="c.259.1/4">Questions were asked about whether the taxpayer gets value for money from the housing benefit regime. That is why there has been housing benefit reform to ensure that we can provide value for money and improve standards. Officials in the Departments for Communities and Local Government and for Work and Pensions and others are working closely together on developing proposals to reform the way in which housing benefit subsidy is calculated and paid to local authorities for people in temporary accommodation.</p>

	Secondary Education (Croxteth)
</minor-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-11-26c.261.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2029" speakername="Robert Wareing" colnum="261"  time="011:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm081126/halltext/81126h0004.htm#08112642000585">
	<p pid="c.261.1/1">It is a great pleasure to speak under your stewardship, Mr. Gale, I think for the first time.</p>
	<p pid="c.261.1/2">The future of education in Croxteth, Liverpool, is very much to do with the proposed closure by Liverpool city council of the Croxteth community comprehensive school. I stress the word &quot;community&quot; because the school is at the centre of the community in the area. Croxteth is a post-war housing estate that adjoins the pre-war housing estate of Norris Green. It is a large chunk of north-east Liverpool. I was brought up in Norris Green myself, and I can tell the Minister that 181 pupils at Croxteth comprehensive school come from Norris Green.</p>
	<p pid="c.261.1/3">Croxteth is among the 24 most deprived wards in the country. Its notoriety&mdash;it is unfortunate that I have to use that word&mdash;came to the fore with the murder of young Rhys Jones a year or so ago. It is not an area of great violence, but it has its social problems, which put it among the top 25 most deprived wards. In 1986, during the Thatcher years, unemployment there was no less than 95 per cent. among young people aged between 16 and 25. The area certainly cannot be regarded as affluent. It has been through a traumatic period recently, but one thing about the people of Croxteth is that there is community spirit, and they have kept together in the face of all the difficulties and problems that have beset them.</p>
	<p pid="c.261.1/4">In letters to me, the Minister has given the impression that the decision is not for him to take. One might therefore think that there is nothing that he can do about it. However, I have come to the Chamber armed with a copy of his Department's guide to local authorities and governing bodies, &quot;Closing a Maintained Mainstream School&quot;. I shall refer to certain sections of it. For example, it mentions the need for diversity in an area, stating at paragraph 5:</p>
	<p pid="c.261.1/5" class="indent">&quot;They must...ensure that there are sufficient schools in their area and promote diversity and increase parental choice.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="c.261.1/6">It states that the local authority and governing body should &quot;consult all interested parties&quot;, including the</p>
	<p pid="c.261.1/7" class="indent">&quot;families of pupils, teachers and other staff&quot;</p>
	<p pid="c.261.1/8">and</p>
	<p pid="c.261.1/9" class="indent">&quot;the governing bodies, teachers and other staff of any other school that may be affected.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="c.261.1/10">I emphasise that point.</p>
	<p pid="c.261.1/11">The guide goes on to state that the</p>
	<p pid="c.261.1/12" class="indent">&quot;families of any pupils at any other school who may be affected by the proposals&quot;</p>
	<p pid="c.261.1/13">and the</p>
	<p pid="c.261.1/14" class="indent">&quot;families of pupils at feeder primary schools&quot;</p>
	<p pid="c.261.1/15">should be consulted, along with trade unions representing staff at the school and at any other school affected by the proposals and</p>
	<p pid="c.261.1/16" class="indent">&quot;MPs...whose constituents are likely to be affected by the proposals&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="c.261.1/17">Obviously I am one of those MPs, but there are 16 other MPs whose constituencies are affected by the proposals and who should be consulted. On <phrase class="date" code="2008-12-09">9 December</phrase> the headmaster, Mr. Richard Baker, will bring a lobby to Parliament to lobby those MPs. They need to be consulted, and I suggest that none of them has been.</p>
	<p pid="c.261.1/18">The proposal is to close Croxteth community comprehensive school in 2010. All the children would then be sent off to Fazakerley secondary school, some miles away. In some cases they would have to use two buses to get there. No doubt they would need new school uniforms. The effect on their education would not just be that one move, because there would be two. The proposal is that in 2012 they would return to another school, presumably in Croxteth.</p>
	<p pid="c.261.1/19">A specific duty is placed on local authorities under the Education and Inspections Act 2006 to</p>
	<p pid="c.261.1/20" class="indent">&quot;secure diversity in the provision of schools and to increase...parental choice when planning the provision of schools in their areas. The Government's aim is to secure a more diverse and dynamic schools system which is shaped by parents.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="c.261.1/21">I do not know of any parent at Croxteth comprehensive school who is in favour of Liverpool city council's proposals.</p>
	<p pid="c.261.1/22">Importantly, the guidelines also state that</p>
	<p pid="c.261.1/23" class="indent">&quot;the Decision Maker should consider...the balance of denominational provision in the area.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="c.261.1/24">If the city council's proposals go through, there will not be a single secular secondary school in the whole of Croxteth and Norris Green. The only secondary schools that will remain are two Catholic schools. I believe that the Government have it in mind that one of them, the De La Salle school, should be an academy. A parent who is not Roman Catholic will have to send their children to a Catholic secondary school. There is no other choice in the area, and that cannot be supported. In fact, one of the Catholic schools, St. John Bosco&mdash;an excellent school&mdash;is a girls' school. There will not be a mixed secondary school in the whole of Croxteth and Norris Green. That is very sad, and I suggest that it has been overlooked by the Minister, if not by the city council.</p>
	<p pid="c.261.1/25">Then there is the whole question of transport. Paragraphs 4.39 and 4.40 of the guidelines state:</p>
	<p pid="c.261.1/26" class="indent">&quot;Facilities are to be accessible...changes should not adversely impact on disadvantaged groups...proposals should not have the effect of unreasonably extending journey times or increasing transport costs.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="c.261.1/27">As I said, many of the young people concerned will be forced to take not one but two buses to Fazakerley. It is not that far away, but it is difficult to get to.</p>
	<p pid="c.261.1/28">People should consider the vicinity of the school, because the issue is not just about the school itself. The school is at the centre of a deprived community, which needs all the assistance that it can get. It will be denied facilities on which &pound;5 million has been spent in recent years to improve sports facilities, the IT centre and other necessary provision. If the city council gets its way, and if the Government let it go ahead, that will presumably just be wasted.</p>
	<p pid="c.261.1/29">This is a very sad situation and, as I said, the community is very much alarmed by what is being proposed. I have not received a single letter from anybody to say that they are pleased to hear what the city council is proposing, but I have had droves of letters from parents who believe that the move proposed by the city council will be detrimental. They look on the Government as having done much for education, particularly with school buildings and repairs. I know that has happened in my constituency&mdash;although not in Croxteth&mdash;and people recognise that. Indeed, the spending of &pound;5 million has gone a little way towards the improvement of Croxteth comprehensive school. However, people believe that they are being denied their rights on this matter.</p>
	<p pid="c.261.1/30">According to the guidelines:</p>
	<p pid="c.261.1/31" class="indent">&quot;In considering proposals for the closure of such schools, the effect on families and the community should be considered.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="c.261.1/32">I have had considerable correspondence from the community, saying that to remove the school would be a destabilising influence as far as the community is concerned. The headmaster, Mr. Richard Baker, has proposed a campus school.</p>
	<p pid="c.261.1/33">We must face the fact that the school is a public asset in the middle of a deprived area. It is no use just looking at the rolls and saying, &quot;Well, they've gone down.&quot; They might go up again, of course. The city council says that it is aware that the roll has gone down and that is why it is proposing to close the school. However, the school is a community asset and I know that the headmaster would like to see it used in many other ways on behalf of the community. If the school is closed, that option will no longer be open.</p>
	<p pid="c.261.1/34">Croxteth is an area that really needs the provision of services, not just for children, but for the whole community. Many of the parents attend evening classes at the school&mdash;they give it a good name. The teaching staff are both dedicated and caring; they understand the area. Likewise, the people on the governing board are from the area and they know the area. They know what can be done within the school buildings to improve matters. I hope that the Minister will look at the total environment in which the school is located, and not just at what may well be a passing fall in the student roll.</p>
	<p pid="c.261.1/35">The Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families has been in communication with me, and I am grateful for that. He has the power to issue guidance, to which the decision maker&mdash;the local authority&mdash;must have regard when deciding on the proposals. The school has recently received an excellent Ofsted report, and I will pass a copy of it to the Minister at the end of this debate. He has also received from me a letter requesting a meeting with representatives of the teachers, parents and governors of the school. As I said, they will be in the House on <phrase class="date" code="2008-12-09">Tuesday 9 December</phrase>. I would like him to think seriously about the matter and to meet them at any time that he can fit into his busy schedule.</p>
	<p pid="c.261.1/36">I end by referring to a letter I received from Julie Lyon-Taylor, general secretary of the National Union of Teachers in Liverpool. She referred to the dedicated teaching staff at Croxteth, who</p>
	<p pid="c.261.1/37" class="indent">&quot;are well aware of the social problems in the area and feel that the closure of the school will make the future even bleaker for Croxteth families who have benefited from the stabilising influence the school has had.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="c.261.1/38">I do not think I could have put it better. Knowing the history of Croxteth and Norris Green, I know that the closure would deprive both communities of the educational opportunities those people deserve.</p>
	<p pid="c.261.1/39">No secular secondary school, long journeys, changing schools twice in two years&mdash;that situation cannot be good for the education of our young people. I ask the Minister to consider the matter carefully and perhaps to visit the area again, not just the school. He might afford himself the opportunity of speaking to the Home Secretary, who visited the area after the murder of Rhys Jones, and has a good idea about the problems there.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-11-26c.264.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1548" speakername="Jim Knight" speakeroffice="The Minister for Schools and Learners"  colnum="264"  time="011:16:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm081126/halltext/81126h0005.htm#08112642000586">
	<p pid="c.264.0/1">I start by thanking my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2029" name="Robert Wareing">the Member for Liverpool, West Derby (Mr. Wareing)</phrase> for securing this important debate, which is particularly significant for his constituents. His speech demonstrated his commitment to ensuring the very best for those constituents, particularly those in Croxteth and Norris Green. In respect of his latter comments, I will take care to talk to those who know the area well, including him. Before the debate, I was talking to the Minister for Children, Young People and Families, whose husband was born in Croxteth and knows the area well.</p>
	<p pid="c.264.0/2">I share my hon. Friend's commitment to ensuring high standards of school provision in his constituency. That is why we are undertaking the biggest Government investment in school buildings in the past 50 years. That investment is helping to address decades of under-investment and sending out a strong message to pupils that their education, well-being and communities are a priority. In his constituency, Building Schools for the Future is already under way and funding has also been invested through the national challenge.</p>
	<p pid="c.264.0/3">As my hon. Friend knows, Building Schools for the Future will help Liverpool to ensure a consistently high standard of schools across the city. Seven schools are already involved in the programme as part of wave 2 of Building Schools for the Future and the remaining secondary schools, including those in Croxteth, are part of wave 6, which was rolled out earlier this year. However, I know that the latter wave is at an early stage and that work is still ongoing to ensure that the basic strategy is robust, particularly in areas such as pupil place planning, which is crucial in the context of this debate.</p>
	<p pid="c.264.0/4">The next key milestone will be the submission of the strategy for change by the local authority to the Department. That will provide far more detail of its estates strategy and how Building Schools for the Future will contribute to educational transformation, which is at the heart of that investment, and achieve a step change in standards across my hon. Friend's city. The strategy for change is due to be received by the Department in February next year and must address the issues in Croxteth.</p>
	<p pid="c.264.0/5">Three weeks ago, I met parents from Croxteth community school who were clearly very concerned about the future of their school. That was reflected in my hon. Friend's excellent speech. We talked about the challenges that the community faces, particularly following the tragic events of last year and the murder of Rhys Jones. I was struck and impressed by their drive to move forward as a community. My hon. Friend talked about the people of Croxteth and I was very impressed by their passion and commitment to helping to lift the community from what has obviously been a difficult time over the past year or so.</p>
	<p pid="c.264.0/6">Those people showed me their interesting ideas and plans for co-located services on the Croxteth site, linking adult skills and early learning with mainstream school provision. I thought that those ideas matched my Department's aims for more joined-up working and co-location of services, but, in the end, any decision to close the school rests, in law, with the local authority. That is stated in the Education and Inspections Act 2006.</p>
	<p pid="c.264.0/7">The challenge for the local authority is that falling pupil numbers make it difficult to make the best use of resources and to deploy them to provide a consistently high standard of education across the board. My hon. Friend spoke about the Department's guidance on closing schools and said that he wants to pass the Ofsted report and other information to me. I will be happy to follow up with him exactly what the power in the guidance is and how decisions can be appealed. For example, if he believes that the consultation requirements in the guidance have not been properly followed and that MPs have not been properly consulted, he has an opportunity to represent his constituents and use the mechanisms and proper processes that are in place.</p>
	<p pid="c.264.0/8">Already there are large numbers of surplus places at De La Salle Roman Catholic school and at Croxteth community school, and we know that pupil numbers in Croxteth are expected to fall even further over the next few years. Also, in standards terms, the school is falling well below the threshold of 30 per cent. of pupils achieving at least five high-level GCSEs, including English and maths. The school had just 54 new entrants this year.</p>
	<p pid="c.264.0/9">The local authority has a duty to ensure that such issues are addressed and that every pupil has access to the very best facilities and education. It is now in the final stages of the statutory processes involved in closing the school, with a view to closing it at the end of the next academic year, as my hon. Friend said.</p>
	<p pid="c.264.0/10">The school will be replaced largely by a new Roman Catholic academy based on the neighbouring De La Salle school, which, as my hon. Friend knows, has significantly improved its GCSE results recently. It would take pupils from Croxteth community school. For those who want community places&mdash;I hear what he says about the importance of diversity and how it reflects the duties in the 2006 Act&mdash;I am advised that the current thinking in Liverpool is that there will still be the option of going to Fazakerley, which has 15 per cent. spare capacity. I am also advised, although obviously I do not know the details on the ground or how the logistics work, that Alsop secondary school is within reasonable travelling distance.</p>
	<p pid="c.264.0/11">I take seriously the comments about lack of choice and diversity in the area, particularly for non-Catholic parents. Obviously I can look at that, but principally the local authority must look at it. As I said, there is the option of Fazakerley, which is gaining in popularity and improving its results. I am told that the authority's plans will enable parents in the area to choose between an academy, a single-sex faith school and the community school up the road.</p>
	<p pid="c.264.0/12">My hon. Friend raised the problem of transport. I am told that the longest distance pupils will have to travel is 2 miles. The council acknowledges that that will be an issue for some and is working to provide a direct service to Fazakerley school from Croxteth. In some cases, it may be able to provide free travel. There are requirements in law that if a local authority considers free travel necessary to secure a child's attendance at school, it must provide it. If the authority defines it as necessary, it will have to deliver on it.</p>
	<p pid="c.264.0/13">My officials have been told that local arrangements are being planned to assist with transportation to maximise choice through diversity for pupils and their parents, and that those plans will be announced next year.</p>
	<p pid="c.264.0/14">From the meeting in Liverpool, I know that the changes are not what some parents in Croxteth want. I repeat that, in law, these are matters for the local authority&mdash;they are school organisational matters. The council has to weigh up future demand for places, the wishes of the community and how to drive up standards.</p>
	<p pid="c.264.0/15">I am also advised that the council has made it clear that it does not intend to pull the plug on the extended facilities at Croxteth; I am pleased that my hon. Friend paid tribute to them. It intends to ensure that the full range of existing community facilities in the area is maintained and, indeed, expanded.</p>
	<p pid="c.264.0/16">Beyond the issues for Liverpool's council around school organisation, there is also the priority of addressing school standards, which I mentioned earlier. The standard of education provision is still too inconsistent in Croxteth, and pupil attainment has not improved sufficiently across the board.</p>
	<p pid="c.264.0/17">I wrote to Croxteth community school in November to confirm another &pound;114,600 of investment this year through the national challenge, which is designed to support schools in raising standards and ensuring that at least 30 per cent. of pupils gain at least five high-level GCSEs, including English and maths. The support will include funding for a national challenge adviser to help the school to improve outcomes for its pupils across the board. The adviser will help the school to get the best possible package of support and help to ensure that such support has the greatest impact on achievement.</p>
	<p pid="c.264.0/18">As my hon. Friend knows, the national challenge is designed to raise standards and is part of a &pound;400 million investment in individual schools around the country. The principle behind it is that schools must lead the changes that are needed, but there is also a clear expectation&mdash;indeed, a challenge&mdash;that local authorities and the Government will support improvements.</p>
	<p pid="c.264.0/19">I have noted my hon. Friend's comments and understand the very real concerns expressed by him and his constituents. As I said, I met with parents a few weeks ago and have seen their plans for the school. I noted what he said about their coming to Westminster on <phrase class="date" code="2008-12-09">9 December</phrase>. I will certainly see whether it is possible to adjust my diary to find time for another meeting with them and with him to discuss their concerns further. However, that has to be set against the background that decisions on school organisation such as which schools should be where and what capacity they should have are, by law, decisions for local authorities. I believe that the parents understood that when I met them.</p>
	<p pid="c.264.0/20">Given the falling number of pupils in the area, I would have to say, up front and on the record, that it is difficult to see how Croxteth can continue to support three secondary schools in future. However, we can consider that further as we discuss pupil projections over the next 10 years, in particular for that part of the city.</p>
	<p pid="c.264.0/21">The context in which the council must make decisions on school organisation is difficult, but as long as plans are proposed that improve education provision and standards, I have to approve them. My test is whether the plans will improve standards. It is for me to judge not school organisation, but only whether the school organisation plans and the investment that we will then fund will improve standards.</p>
	<p pid="c.264.0/22">I hope that families in my hon. Friend's constituency understand that if the council decides to close Croxteth community school, that will be done only to ensure that every child can benefit from the very best education possible. I am happy to play my part in working with community representatives to see whether more can be done, but I cannot undermine the legal responsibilities of Liverpool city council.</p>

	<p pid="c.268.2/1">It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Mr. Gale, and through you I thank Mr. Speaker for allowing this debate, which is important for many people across the country.</p>
	<p pid="c.268.2/2">I have always thought that, for a parliamentary democracy to work, everybody in the country should feel that somebody is speaking up for them. Sex education is one of those subjects where, for far too long, we have had a cosy consensus of all the political parties and have accepted that a never-ending increase in sex education is the only possible solution to the problems of teenage pregnancies, unwanted pregnancies and sexually transmitted diseases. Many people in the country are, like me, rather nervous about that and feel that it is perhaps more the cause of the problem than the solution. I intend to mention some reasons why I think sex education has failed in this country and some examples that we can learn from in other countries, and I want to find out what the Government's plans are for the future.</p>
	<p pid="c.268.2/3">My starting point is that I am philosophically against sex education in schools, because in far too many cases we are taking responsibilities away from parents. Being a parent is a responsible position; it is a big thing and with it comes big obligations that parents cannot farm out to the state and things that they have to do for themselves. I am a parent of two young boys. I understand my responsibilities to my children and do not take them lightly. Part of the problem in this country is that we have a culture in which the Government basically says to people, including parents, &quot;These are your responsibilities, but if you don't perform them, don't worry&mdash;it doesn't matter, it's not a problem&mdash;because we'll do them for you. We'll take these responsibilities away from you.&quot; That is a dangerous slippery slope for the country to go down.</p>
	<p pid="c.268.2/4">People say that some parents are not capable of teaching their children about sex education. I have no doubt that some parents find it a tricky subject, but I am equally sure that many teachers do not teach it particularly well, either. Using a minority of people who find it difficult as an example for scrapping the whole thing seems to me to be rather pointless.</p>

	<p pid="c.268.3/1">I admire the hon. Gentleman's total confidence in parents, which for the most part we must have, but what about children who are being abused within the family home? Is there not a case for sex and relationship education in relation to such situations?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-11-26c.268.4" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1816" speakername="Philip Davies" colnum="268"  time="014:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm081126/halltext/81126h0005.htm#08112642000589">
	<p pid="c.268.4/1">There are always children who are taken into care by the state and obviously the state has a responsibility in respect of their parents, but the example that the hon. Lady gives is not a reason for having compulsory sex education for every child, of whatever age, who goes to school. That is the direction in which this Government are taking us. If she thinks that we should treat certain individuals on an exceptional basis, I might be sympathetic to that idea, but I do not have a universal belief in the beauty and desirability of sex education in schools.</p>
	<p pid="c.268.4/2">The point is that this is not all about sex education. Much of the argument is about the fact that parents should be, above all else, responsible for the moral upbringing of their children. That cannot be farmed out to the state. It is a parental responsibility. As a parent, I do not want my children to go to school to have the moral compass and values of the teacher instilled in them. That is my job and my responsibility. I want my children to go to school to learn about the things that I cannot teach them, not about the things that are my direct responsibility.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-11-26c.269.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1548" speakername="Jim Knight" speakeroffice="The Minister for Schools and Learners"  colnum="269"  time="014:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm081126/halltext/81126h0006.htm#08112642000590">
	<p pid="c.269.0/1">I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for giving way as he is being interesting and, some might argue, provocative. In the context of what he has just said, does he think that schools should have an ethos and values? If he thinks that an ethos is valuable in a school, and that religious foundations are useful in a school, should there be any moral background to that ethos?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-11-26c.269.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1816" speakername="Philip Davies" colnum="269"  time="014:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm081126/halltext/81126h0006.htm#08112642000591">
	<p pid="c.269.1/1">I agree that schools should be given more freedom to set their own ethos, but within that freedom there should, therefore, be freedom to say, &quot;In our school, we don't believe that sex education is desirable. We think that it should be left to parents.&quot; Then parents would, perhaps, be able to choose to send their children to a school with such an ethos. If the Minister is arguing that we should leave it to schools to set their own ethos I would be happy with that, but with it must come the freedom for schools to say that they do not want to teach sex education.</p>
	<p pid="c.269.1/2">It is not just me who thinks that sex education is not particularly desirable. I have been inundated with comments from parents and teachers alike, who are nervous about the way things are going. I shall quote a couple of parents, if I may. A mother of two e-mailed me, saying:</p>
	<p pid="c.269.1/3" class="indent">&quot;Failing to consult parents takes away our choice as to how we raise our children.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="c.269.1/4">Another mother said:</p>
	<p pid="c.269.1/5" class="indent">&quot;Education is the primary responsibility of parents, not of schools and not of governments. Parents entrust to schools those aspects of education that they can do more effectively, but PCHE and especially sex education are very delicate matters which parents have every right to give in their own way at home.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="c.269.1/6">I have had many similar e-mails and letters. Even the general secretary of the National Association of Schoolmasters Union of Women Teachers, one of the largest teachers' unions, says:</p>
	<p pid="c.269.1/7" class="indent">&quot;Primary school teachers are already overstretched ensuring that they can meet the demands of the current curriculum. Even if appropriate training was provided, which experience shows is highly unlikely, most teachers would feel extremely vulnerable and uncomfortable if asked to take on this responsibility.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="c.269.1/8">There is no universal desire from parents or teachers for even more sex education. Many people feel that the more sex education we have had, the more teenage pregnancies, sexually transmitted diseases and unwanted pregnancies we have had. The answer to that problem is not even more sex education, but less. We have been trying this for 20 or 30 years. We might think that somebody would have said, at some point, &quot;Hold on a minute, this is not working.&quot;</p>

	<p pid="c.269.2/1">I apologise for missing the first couple of minutes of the hon. Gentleman's speech and congratulate him on securing the debate.</p>
	<p pid="c.269.2/2">I declare an interest as a member of the NASUWT&mdash;at least, I think I am still a member&mdash;although I am not sure that I agree with my union's line on this matter. The hon. Gentleman will have read in the House of Commons Library debate pack a survey undertaken by <i>The Times Education</i><i>al</i><i> Supplement</i> that shows that 60 per cent. of primary teachers want more training and want sex education to be taught in schools. So there is a mixed message, not quite the consistent message that the hon. Gentleman suggests is being given.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-11-26c.270.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1816" speakername="Philip Davies" colnum="270"  time="014:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm081126/halltext/81126h0006.htm#08112642000593">
	<p pid="c.270.0/1">I apologise if I gave the impression that every teacher agrees with me. I was trying to make the opposite point, which is that not every teacher agrees with the idea that sex education is a good thing. The position that is often portrayed is that all parents and teachers think that this is a universally good thing. My point is that some people disagree. I take it from the hon. Gentleman's intervention that he acknowledges that people disagree on the issue. There is not just one view.</p>
	<p pid="c.270.0/2">I forgive the hon. Gentleman for missing the first minute or so of my speech; he did not miss anything of great noteworthiness. I also forgive him for disagreeing with his own union, because I often find myself in the unfortunate position of disagreeing with my party from time to time. I think we can forgive him on all counts.</p>
	<p pid="c.270.0/3">I might set aside my philosophical objections to sex education in schools if I could be persuaded that there was an overwhelming case for it and that it was a roaring triumph, but the opposite seems to be the case and, at best, that indicates that sex education makes no positive difference to the things it was set up to tackle. For example, the earliest figures I have show that in 1994 there were 7,795 teenage pregnancies among girls under 16. In 2006, the last year for which I have figures, there were 7,800 teenage pregnancies in that age group, which is exactly the same number&mdash;it has not reduced in the slightest&mdash;and it has been even higher in the intervening years.</p>
	<p pid="c.270.0/4">The number of pregnancies among under-19s was 85,000 in 1994 and in 2004, the last year for which I have information, it was 101,000. The problem is getting worse. In England and Wales, the number of abortions for under-16s in 1994 was 3,900, and in 2006 it was 4,700; for under-19s in 1994 it was 29,600 and in 2006 it was 40,500. Surely, if sex education was such a great success, the situation would have improved as there was more and more of it.</p>

	<p pid="c.270.1/1">I congratulate the hon. Gentleman on securing the debate. Has he studied the statistics in detail? I understand that a recent survey by the UK Youth Parliament showed that as many as 40 per cent. of young people said that they had received no sex or relationship education at school. Could it be that they are not being taught in sufficient detail, and that they are not being given the right education, rather than being given too much information?</p>

	<p pid="c.270.2/1">That could be the case, but I suggest that it is not. The hon. Lady's intervention was typical of a politician. I am being distracted, but it is a worthwhile distraction. When politicians are faced with a problem, their solution usually encompasses two ingredients. First, they must be seen to be doing something. The bane of politicians is that they must be seen to be doing something whenever a problem arrives on their desk. I long for the day when a Minister says, &quot;This is nothing to do with us. It is for other people to sort out, or for the people concerned to sort out.&quot; I am sure that the Minister will not indulge me with that response today. The second ingredient is that their proposals should not offend anyone. The hon. Lady has fallen into the typical politician's trap of wanting to do something and not wanting to offend anyone. Sex education is a perfect example, because it looks as if we are doing something, and it does not offend anyone to suggest that we should have more of it.</p>
	<p pid="c.270.2/2">My contention is that sex education is not working. For 20 or 30 years, there has been more and more; I am sure that even the hon. Lady will concede that there is more sex education in schools now than in 1994, but that the problems have got worse. Clearly, it is not helping. It may not be as universal as she would like, but given that there is more sex education now, one would expect the figures to show an improvement.</p>

	<p pid="c.271.0/1">I accept that there has been an increase in sex education in schools, although the figure I cited shows that it is still not as prevalent as some of us would like, but is not the issue what children are taught? If facts about reproduction are taught in isolation and not in the context of relationship education, they may fall on deaf ears and not be translated into children's own lives. I understand that the Government want to roll out more relationship education rather than just the bare facts of reproduction.</p>

	<p pid="c.271.1/1">I understand that, and the hon. Lady's desire, which all politicians have, to offer painless panaceas to improve everything without anyone having to go through pain to get there. Unfortunately, things do not work like that, and I shall come to what happens in other countries to illustrate for the hon. Lady why I believe that she is wrong.</p>

	<p pid="c.271.2/1">Referring to the hon. Lady's previous intervention, the Youth Parliament's research shows that for too many people sex education has not been in the context of relationships. That was the main point of the report. Does my hon. Friend agree that if a school chooses to talk to its students about sex education, it should always be in the context of relationships so that it can be properly considered and taken in by young people?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-11-26c.271.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1816" speakername="Philip Davies" colnum="271"  time="014:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm081126/halltext/81126h0006.htm#08112642000599">
	<p pid="c.271.3/1">I certainly take my hon. Friend's point, but my contention is that for 20 or 30 years, since we embarked on the path of sex education, we have been told that the only problem is that it is not being taught properly&mdash;that it is good in itself, but that it is not taught very well. We keep tinkering with it and changing it, but the situation keeps getting worse. Everyone must have their own line in the sand for concluding that it is not working. I would like to know where every hon. Member's line in the sand is, and how long they will wait, while the problem is getting worse, before they come to the inevitable conclusion that sex education is not working and that perhaps we should try something else.</p>
	<p pid="c.271.3/2">Things have not only got worse with teenage pregnancies and abortions; they are even worse with sexually transmitted diseases. Since 1997, the incidence of chlamydia has risen from 72 cases per 100,000 of population to 166 cases per 100,000 in 2004. During the same period, the incidence of gonorrhoea has risen from 22 to 37 cases per 100,000 of population, and for syphilis it has risen from 0.27 to 3.81 per 100,000 of population. The incidence of sexually transmitted diseases in the UK is getting worse, although the figure for syphilis is better than in Holland, which is always held up as a paragon of virtue by those who are obsessed with sex education. I shall talk about Holland shortly.</p>
	<p pid="c.271.3/3">The incidence of HIV/AIDS has also risen massively over the past 10 years. In the UK in 2006, young people aged 16 to 24, who have been filled with sex education from the word go, made up 11 per cent. of new HIV diagnoses, 65 per cent. of all chlamydia diagnoses, 55 per cent. of all genital warts diagnoses, and 48 per cent. of gonorrhoea diagnoses in clinics. The people who have had the most sex education are suffering most from sexually transmitted diseases, which strikes me as hardly a great triumph for sex education in schools.</p>

	<p pid="c.272.0/1">I thank the hon. Gentleman for giving way again. He is being very generous with his time. Will he refer to the evidence that shows a direct correlation between the increase in sex education in schools and the increase in the statistics that he gave? It seems to me that many other factors could be equally or more to blame, particularly the increased sexualisation of our popular culture and what we see on television. Is there any evidence that sex education is the problem, rather than a solution?</p>

	<p pid="c.272.1/1">The hon. Lady makes a fair point; she is right to say that other factors are important, but my contention is that sex education is making no impression, so perhaps other factors should be brought into play. During the first 20 minutes of this debate, we seem to have gone from saying that sex education is good and will help the situation to saying that things might be even worse if we did not have sex education, which is rather startling backtracking in such a short period. I am pleased that I seem to be making progress with my argument that sex education is not good and only prevents things from becoming even worse. That is a novel position for the governing party to take.</p>
	<p pid="c.272.1/2">In the teenage birth league, the UK is second of 28 nations, and only one place behind the USA, but Italy at 23rd and Holland at 25th are the fourth and sixth lowest for teenage pregnancies, and I shall refer to them in more detail shortly. In this country, the average age at which people first have sex has fallen, which indicates that sex education is not a great triumph. Of all the OECD nations, we have the second highest number of young people living in single parent families, whereas the Netherlands is 14th and Italy is the lowest.</p>
	<p pid="c.272.1/3">Of all OECD nations, the UK has much the highest percentage of 15-year-olds who report having had sexual intercourse. The percentage of 15-year-olds who used a condom during their last sexual intercourse is much lower in the UK than in virtually every other OECD nation. I have no idea what people are being taught in sex education, but on every possible indicator of what they may be taught this country is failing badly, not just by itself, but in comparison with every other country.</p>
	<p pid="c.272.1/4">On teenage births and teenage mothers, the estimated percentage of 20-year-olds who had a child in their teens is 3 per cent. in Italy and Holland, but 13 per cent. in the UK, which is higher than any country except New Zealand. That is hardly a great advert for sex education in the UK, and things seem to be getting worse. I concede that even at that point we could say that sex education is failing only in the UK, but that it is a good thing, although we do it badly, and that other countries do it far better.</p>
	<p pid="c.272.1/5">Holland is always held up as the great shining example of sex education being a triumph, because the argument is that Holland has lots of sex education at a very young age, and the level of teenage pregnancies is very low. That is absolutely true. However, the proponents of sex education never mention that Italy has almost no sex education in its schools yet it has low levels of teenage and unwanted pregnancies. Rather than just cherry-picking the figures that we want to sustain our arguments, it would be more useful to consider what Italy and Holland are doing because both countries clearly do things right in a way that we do not. Sex education is not a triumph in relation to Italy and Holland because although one country has lots of it, the other has hardly any.</p>
	<p pid="c.272.1/6">I have tried to consider some of the things that Italy and Holland have in common, and it strikes me that other things in the argument are more important. For example, family structure is much tighter and divorce rates are much lower in Holland and Italy than in the UK. Dutch children are five times less likely to live in a family headed by a lone parent than in this country. The OECD looked at the percentage of families that share a meal together several times a week and the percentage of children who benefit from just talking to their parents several times a week. The percentage of 15-year-olds who eat at least one meal a day with their parents is only 65 in the United Kingdom, but the figures are 90 per cent. in Holland and 94 per cent. in Italy. The UNICEF report on the well-being of children ranks the Netherlands as the best place for children to grow up. Italy comes seventh in that report, after all the other Scandinavian countries. The UK ranks as the worst place to grow up. Other factors, such as the things Italy and Holland have in common, seem to be far more important than sex education.</p>
	<p pid="c.272.1/7">Something that Italy and Holland have in common but that we do not share with them is their benefit structure and the amount of money they pay single parents. It may not surprise people to hear that we are far more generous than Italy or Holland in our support for single parents. If we really want to tackle the issue of teenage and unwanted pregnancies it would be far better&mdash;although it may be tougher and more uncomfortable, which is why politicians shy away from the matter&mdash;to consider the implications of our tax and benefit system. Too often that system rewards people for living on their own and puts teenage mothers at the top of housing allocation lists. It strikes me as perverse that through the housing allocation and benefits that we pay, we reward behaviour that we are trying to discourage. Surely, the tax and benefit system ought to reflect the fact that we try to discourage certain behaviour.</p>
	<p pid="c.272.1/8">I wonder how many 16-year-old girls, in a misguided way, choose wrongly&mdash; perhaps because they have problems in their relationship with their parents and do not like living at home. They think that pregnancy is the solution to their problems and that they should leave home because they will get priority housing. In effect, they are probably lining themselves up for a lifetime of misery and poverty, but the tax and benefit system does not indicate that that will be the case.</p>
	<p pid="c.272.1/9">I ask all hon. Members to read an enlightening article by Alice Thomson called &quot;Sex Education: Why the British are Going Dutch&quot;, in <i>The Times </i>on <phrase class="date" code="2008-11-24">24 November</phrase>. The article is about sex education in Holland and why Holland has low rates of teenage pregnancy. I shall highlight a few aspects of that important article. Alice Thomson refers to Laura Watts,</p>
	<p pid="c.272.1/10" class="indent">&quot;a British mother who has lived in the Netherlands for the past ten years,&quot;</p>
	<p pid="c.272.1/11">who</p>
	<p pid="c.272.1/12" class="indent">&quot;thinks that the lower rate of teenage pregnancy there may have more to do with family structure than with sex education. Dutch children are five times less likely to be living in a family headed by a lone parent, divorce rates are far lower and fewer mothers are in full-time employment.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="c.272.1/13">Laura Watts thinks:</p>
	<p pid="c.272.1/14" class="indent">&quot;It is the family that makes the difference. Parents leave the office by 5pm in Holland and eat dinner with their children at 6pm.&quot;</p>

	<p pid="c.274.0/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend on securing the debate and on producing such compelling evidence on the subject. The point he made about teenage pregnancies in New Zealand concerned me because my teenage daughter is there at the moment. Has he considered the lack of male role models in the education system&mdash;particularly in primary schools? Not long ago, I visited a primary school in my constituency and of 50 teaching staff, only one was male. Will the Government's proposals to increase sex education in primary schools not be counter-productive if there are no male teachers in schools?</p>

	<p pid="c.274.1/1">As ever, my hon. Friend makes a valid and telling point. As he knows, I do not agree with the idea of giving people jobs based on their gender. I want the best people to be recruited to the teaching profession irrespective of whether they are male or female&mdash;as should be the case in any other profession. It is certainly of interest that although the Government are obsessed with having equal numbers of men and women in every single profession, they are not bothered that there are far more women primary school teachers.</p>

	<p pid="c.274.2/1">My hon. Friend mentioned the importance people in Holland put on having mum and dad at home for dinner time and he said that was a vital part of building a stable family life. Does he share my concern about recent comments made by the noble Lord Mandelson in the other place that the Government are considering walking away from their commitments to flexible working? That is the sort of policy that would help families achieve the balance that my hon. Friend is talking about.</p>

	<p pid="c.274.3/1">I understand my hon. Friend's enthusiasm and if it were just a matter of sex education, I would have much sympathy with her point. However, I am conscious that many businesses are struggling in the current economic climate. I am not a big fan of adding huge amounts of red tape to a business's bottom line when it is struggling. It is understandable that businesses might want to shy away from such measures at the moment, but I accept the point that if we were simply looking at sex education, flexible working would certainly help.</p>
	<p pid="c.274.3/2">The article in <i>The Times </i>goes on to make the telling point:</p>
	<p pid="c.274.3/3" class="indent">&quot;The Dutch Government still penalises single mothers under 18, who are expected to live with their parents if they become pregnant. Until six years ago the Government gave them no financial support.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="c.274.3/4">Perhaps people should reflect on whether the operation of the benefit system in Holland is a more important factor than providing lots of sex education in explaining why there is a low rate of teenage pregnancy in that country.</p>
	<p pid="c.274.3/5">A lady called Mena Laura Meyer, who produced the seven-part documentary series &quot;Sexy&quot; for Dutch TV last year, says that sex education is the least relevant aspect of the country's success in having lower levels of teenage pregnancies than other European countries. The article in <i>The Times </i>ends:</p>
	<p pid="c.274.3/6" class="indent">&quot;Maybe, instead of expecting schools to teach children morality and the missionary position, the British should adopt a few other Dutch lessons. Employers could encourage staff to go home at 5pm for a family supper,&quot;</p>
	<p pid="c.274.3/7">which was something my hon. Friend the Member for Basingstoke mentioned. The article continues,</p>
	<p pid="c.274.3/8" class="indent">&quot;parents could discuss contraception with their children, and the BBC could ask David Attenborough to turn his attention to human reproduction.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="c.274.3/9">Although I am not entirely comfortable with all those suggestions, they are probably all better than having a never-ending supply of sex education in our schools.</p>
	<p pid="c.274.3/10">It would not be so bad if standards in our schools were so high that teachers had nothing but sex education to worry about. However, I am afraid that anything but that is true. The Government should be ashamed of the literacy and numeracy rates for school leavers. Some 2,500 pupils failed to achieve functional adequacy in English, and just under 3,500 failed to achieve functional literacy and numeracy. Surely, the Government should concentrate on ensuring that people can read and write when they leave school, rather than taking every opportunity to fill their heads with sex education, which is clearly making no difference whatever. As one parent said:</p>
	<p pid="c.274.3/11" class="indent">&quot;We entrust our teachers to provide our children with a sound education in traditional subjects, not instruct them on explicit sexual matters, which they can neither cope with physically nor emotionally. With failing standards in reading and writing upon leaving primary school, the Government should concentrate on using valuable lesson time on improving the literacy skills of our children.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="c.274.3/12">That is a very good point.</p>

	<p pid="c.275.0/1">I have a bit of experience in this matter. Is the hon. Gentleman really suggesting that over a school year, five or six one-hour sessions in which a school nurse delivers broad-based sex and relationship education will undermine the teaching of other curriculum subjects? He has used words to the effect that the curriculum is full of sex education. The assumption that it is being taught every week or every day simply is not correct. It is taught in a cross-curricular manner, through the existing science curriculum and through personal studies and relationships and sex education. Huge amounts of the school day or week are not being spent on sex education.</p>

	<p pid="c.276.0/1">Given the hon. Gentleman's experience and knowledge of the subject, I am sure that he will acknowledge that it is not the only extra-curricular activity that schools are being invited to do. They are invited to teach children about healthy eating. They are told that they have to teach children about community cohesion. The Government are placing all sorts of burdens on schools that take them away from their core job of teaching children the subjects parents want them to learn about when they are at school. Schools should not be teaching kids about things that parents are more than capable of teaching them. If we want parents to take responsibility for bringing up their children, we have to give them that responsibility. They will never take it on while the state takes it away from them.</p>

	<p pid="c.276.1/1">I perhaps should have asked this question at the beginning of the hon. Gentleman's speech. I am not clear exactly what he means by the term &quot;sex education&quot;. Does that cover other aspects of relationships as well? I think the stance he is taking is that it should be parents who give all sorts of moral guidance to their children. In that case, does he think that schools should not be teaching them about such things as bullying, drugs or alcohol abuse? Is he saying that it should be only about history, geography, maths and English? Where is the border?</p>

	<p pid="c.276.2/1">I think that the hon. Lady is being rather disingenuous. Of course, bullying is something that takes place in schools, so it is right and proper that the school makes clear what its bullying strategy is.</p>

	<p pid="c.276.4/1">The hon. Lady is presumably admitting that sex education is not a great triumph if by her own admission sex is taking place at school. Presumably about five minutes after a sex education lesson is the likeliest time for it to take place. She is not providing a great advert for the success of sex education.</p>
	<p pid="c.276.4/2">Voice, the education professionals' union, has said that</p>
	<p pid="c.276.4/3" class="indent">&quot;it is essential that there is parental support for the way that schools deal with these sensitive issues...Schools...are being required to take on more of the responsibilities that really belong to parents, blurring the boundaries between education and social service...Schools are expected to compensate for parental shortcomings&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="c.276.4/4">That surely is no way to go.</p>
	<p pid="c.276.4/5">However, the Government&mdash;despite all the evidence that sex education is not really making any difference and is not making a great deal of difference in countries that claim that it is&mdash;insist on giving more and more sex education to younger and younger children. We hear that 14-year-old girls could be taught about their right to have an abortion. That is an idea from the Family Planning Association, to which I think the Government are sympathetic. They want to make sex education compulsory. That certainly is not the case in Italy and I do not believe that it is the case even in Holland&mdash;even the Dutch have not gone so far as to make it compulsory. The Government want more school-based clinics to administer jabs that can make girls infertile for up to three months.</p>
	<p pid="c.276.4/6">Surely the message that the Government should be sending is that it is against the law to have sex under the age of 16&mdash;that should be it. We should not be saying that it is okay to have sex under the age of 16, so we will give young people all the tools that they might need to sort themselves out while they are indulging in it. Surely the Government cannot think that is a good message to give young people. What kind of leadership or strategy is that? It is totally offensive to most people.</p>
	<p pid="c.276.4/7">The Minister is trying to slide compulsory sex education into our schools for children as young as five without proper consultation of parents, despite his promise in a letter to CARE&mdash;Christian Action, Research and Education&mdash;that</p>
	<p pid="c.276.4/8" class="indent">&quot;there will be a full public consultation on any substantive recommendations made by the steering group, so that the full range of views and interests are taken into account&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="c.276.4/9">That consultation did not take place. Many parents felt excluded from the process.</p>

	<p pid="c.277.0/1">I will set this point out more clearly when I respond to the debate, but we have put in an additional consultation process by setting up an expert group. However, no changes can be made to the curriculum without full and proper consultation, and we are still some way away from that taking place.</p>

	<p pid="c.277.1/1">I hope that when the Minister responds to the debate, he will confirm that he will meet people and organisations that are not as enthusiastic about sex education as he is, to have a balanced consultation and to get a balanced representation of views. Rather than cherry-picking the people he wants to get responses from, he needs to meet some of the people who are concerned about more and more sex education in schools.</p>
	<p pid="c.277.1/2">Let me quote the words of a few parents. One parent sent an e-mail to say:</p>
	<p pid="c.277.1/3" class="indent">&quot;I can hardly believe that anyone, let alone a Government, would plan to enforce sex education on children in Primary Schools without any consultation with parents. This to me is abuse of the position they hold and will only encourage children much younger to experiment with sex...It's time for us as parents to stand up for our children. They are being robbed of their innocence and childhood.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="c.277.1/4">Another parent said:</p>
	<p pid="c.277.1/5" class="indent">&quot;I am horrified they are thinking of teaching SRE to five-year-olds without even asking parents what they think.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="c.277.1/6">Another said:</p>
	<p pid="c.277.1/7" class="indent">&quot;It's ridiculous that parents aren't given the chance to have their say. I will never allow my child to be exposed to SRE at such a young age, it will do more harm than good.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="c.277.1/8">One parent said that they were &quot;seriously considering home schooling&quot; as a result of the plans. Do the Government really want to encourage that? Another parent said:</p>
	<p pid="c.277.1/9" class="indent">&quot;It is scary that the government has failed to involve parents in this. It seems to be part of a general thrust by them to by-pass parents.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="c.277.1/10">Another said:</p>
	<p pid="c.277.1/11" class="indent">&quot;I think it's absolutely preposterous that parents haven't been consulted. This takes parental powers away and we should have the final say.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="c.277.1/12">I have two children: one is five years old and the other is three. I certainly do not want them to be given sex education at the age of five&mdash;perhaps in the future, when that has not worked, the Minister will want to extend it to three-year-olds. The never-ending insistence that sex education is the only way forward is completely barmy, completely senseless, completely mindless. There is no evidence at all from anywhere in the world that it will help. The problem will continue to get worse, not better, until the Government accept that it is things such as family breakdown and the benefits system, not a lack of sex education in schools, that are driving the increased levels of teenage pregnancies and sexually transmitted diseases. The present Government always go for the easy option, where they can look as though they are doing something without offending anybody. Well, if the Minister persists in insisting on more and more sex education in schools for younger and younger children, particularly at primary school, he will find that more people are offended by that than he thinks. It is time for the silent majority to make their voices known to the Minister.</p>

None the less, certain responses need to be made when he states a particular view&mdash;a view with which I certainly disagree. He has given the Government strong advice today, and I am reminded of Oscar Wilde's saying, &quot;Advice is the most precious gift of all because it is often given by those who need it most themselves.&quot; In talking about the facts of life, the hon. Gentleman may need to hear one or two facts of life from what is perhaps another planet for him&mdash;my constituency of Nottingham, North.</p>
	<p pid="c.278.0/2">Nottingham, North has the highest number of teenage pregnancies not only in the UK, but in the whole of western Europe. That is a very serious problem to us. In my constituency, 218 teenage girls had a baby two years ago&mdash;the latest period for which figures are available. About 60 per cent. of babies are born out of wedlock in my constituency, which is a very high number; I think that the national average is 46 or 47 per cent. So, in many senses we are looking at a different world from the nuclear family that I suspect was the example that the hon. Gentleman had in mind.</p>

Member in this Chamber for their own family arrangements and I think it is important that we ensure that where, as in this case, a majority of people are born out of wedlock, that is taken into account as we discuss policy.</p>
	<p pid="c.279.0/2">What we really need is what the children of the hon. Member for Shipley have, which is social and emotional capability. They have that because he and his partner have provided love, care, attention and nurture for them, and they perhaps do not need assistance of the sort that many other children might need.</p>
	<p pid="c.279.0/3">For example, if the hon. Gentleman were a single parent, or if, sadly, he passed on and left his wife in that situation, it would be a tougher call to ensure that those young people got the education they needed. I am sure he would manage it, but let us imagine for a second a young girl living on her own in one of the working class estates in my constituency, with no extended family and trying to raise a young baby. She clearly would not have the same advantages that I and the hon. Gentleman have had. There are times when assistance is needed.</p>
	<p pid="c.279.0/4">That point leads me to the next part of my argument, about why sex and relationship education has a role to play.</p>

	<p pid="c.279.1/1">Does the hon. Gentleman accept, given what he has just said, that parents should have the right to have their children opt out of sex education in schools, if they feel that it is not right for their child?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-11-26c.279.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1747" speakername="Graham Allen" colnum="279"  time="015:07:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm081126/halltext/81126h0007.htm#08112642000620">
	<p pid="c.279.2/1">I believe that in many places parents can do that, and schools can too. It should happen by consent. In my city, we are interested in putting together a broader package&mdash;not just sex and relationship education, and indeed not just personal, health and social education, which includes the broader relationship possibilities that are taught. We are interested in putting together for the 11 to 16-year-olds a life skills agenda, so that they can be socially and emotionally rounded people.</p>
	<p pid="c.279.2/2">If someone has all the relevant social facilities&mdash;the ability to interact and converse, to resolve arguments without violence and to establish clear relationships, as well as an understanding of what it is like to have a family or a baby&mdash;that can be life-changing and life-moulding. Someone with those facilities can do well in life even without great qualifications. I think that great qualifications follow from them. If someone has the currency and vocabulary within them for such social interaction, the rest happens. Such people can create a good family and hold down a job; they will have attainments and, I hope, would go to university or college.</p>
	<p pid="c.279.2/3">I know about the problems in this context from my constituency. One aspect is that we have the lowest number of people who go to university. That is not because of some innate problem with the people in my constituency. It is because often they do not get the chance to make good some of the disadvantages that they suffer, in their early years in particular.</p>
	<p pid="c.279.2/4">It is important that sex and relationship education and other such education are given age-appropriately. The hon. Member for Shipley left in the air an inference that a five-year-old is taught the basics of reproduction. That is not and will not be the case. I feel that such education is very important, and I know that it must be done at an age-appropriate level. That means on occasion&mdash;perhaps in a constituency such as mine, with 218 teenagers having a baby in one year&mdash;that there is a need for them to know about abortion, contraception and the long-acting injection that can provide defence against pregnancy, and about chlamydia and sexually-transmitted diseases.</p>
	<p pid="c.279.2/5">If those people do not know about those things, they will, out of ignorance, make wrong life choices and there will be more little ones growing up like those the hon. Gentleman talked about. They will be in a similar position and the problem will worsen.</p>
	<p pid="c.279.2/6">I agree that we should not be complacent about sex and relationship education. It has its deficiencies, but that is bad sex and relationship education. The hon. Gentleman's argument would be much stronger if he were urging better and improved sex and relationship education, which would benefit people. It is part of broader social and emotional development.</p>
	<p pid="c.279.2/7">One of my criticisms of past Governments would be that they sometimes saw such education as merely a matter of the physical and reproductive, not as a question of relationships and the social interactions that are needed to develop effective people. Speaking as we are in the wake of the Baby P episode and the news of the family in Sheffield this morning, we are clearly not yet raising young people to be effective parents and to optimise their parenting ability. Heaven knows that not only do we need a short-term strategy for resolving the difficulties in particular processes and in particular cases, but that hon. Members need a strategic view on how to ensure that in generations to come we reduce the number of those one-off cases, and allow people to benefit and flourish as individuals, so that they can realise themselves as effective parents.</p>
	<p pid="c.279.2/8">I agree with the hon. Gentleman on parental responsibility to this extent: there are those who cannot exercise the responsibility that he clearly does, and I hope everyone in the Chamber does, and we need to ensure that it is possible for everyone to do so. What is good enough for him and for me is good enough for the kids who are having children in my constituency. The help that they need is not just SRE and education on making good life choices.</p>
	<p pid="c.279.2/9">Those young people, or young mothers&mdash;the hon. Gentleman talked about parents, and I do not mean to pick him up linguistically, but in my experience it is often more correct to talk about one parent&mdash;can benefit incredibly from having a one-to-one relationship with a health visitor who teaches them how to raise their child in a loving way, and teaches that child how to get the best out of school. That takes a little bit of money early on.</p>
	<p pid="c.279.2/10">The hon. Gentleman may know that I am a disciple of early intervention. A pound spent in the early days is worth &pound;100 spent later on. Primary SEAL&mdash;social and emotional aspects of learning&mdash;enables young people who do not get the relevant learning at home to learn the basics of how to get on in life and what to do socially to make the best of themselves.</p>
	<p pid="c.279.2/11">I have one minor criticism of the Government, but I must preface it by saying that this Government, and above all the Minister, have done incredible things in the relevant area. The criticism relates to the space that schools and head teachers need to teach the subject effectively. If they teach SRE and social and emotional development effectively, they will be able to improve their scores. It is not a matter of either/or. It is not possible to crank up achievement without doing something with the raw material and helping youngsters to get better socially and emotionally so that they have the ability to learn.</p>
	<p pid="c.279.2/12">I ask the Minister to think carefully about ensuring that when we introduce PHSE&mdash;I hope it will be called something that mums can understand, and I suggest life skills, not SRE, PHSE or any of the acronyms that we have to confuse people&mdash;heads know that they have the space within the curriculum to cover it effectively. That would be a fantastic contribution.</p>
	<p pid="c.279.2/13">Are parents adequately trained? Are teachers adequately trained? I must agree that no, often they are not. We need to spend much more money on ensuring that teachers are comfortable in talking about sexual intercourse, contraception, abortion or relationship-building, rather than knocking out a few things on the photocopier, handing them out and sending the kids home early. That is no good for anyone. Equally, parents, too, sometimes need to feel a little more relaxed so that they can talk spontaneously to their children about such matters.</p>
	<p pid="c.279.2/14">The hon. Gentleman threw in several ideas that would complement what the Government are doing. It is not a matter of either/or. By all means, let us see whether we can get David Attenborough to do a documentary. I do not have a problem with that. Perhaps the Minister can take that idea away and ask Sir David to do a video. We are doing a great video with single mums in Nottingham, funded by One Nottingham, the organisation that I chair. We are going to do one for absent fathers too.</p>
	<p pid="c.279.2/15">Why should not absent fathers know that there is a consequence, and a benefit consequence, to their actions? Perhaps we have gone in the wrong direction in the past six months in letting people off the hook. That word of mouth has gone and young people&mdash;young boys, certainly&mdash;have been allowed to think that there is a free hit here. If they think there is no free hit, there is more likely to be the self-discipline, even after a few drinks, that most people manage to achieve.</p>
	<p pid="c.279.2/16">I am outstaying my welcome, Mr. Gale, so I shall finish on this note: the choice put in hon. Members' minds by the hon. Gentleman&mdash;he made his case honestly and forthrightly, and should be respected for doing so&mdash;is between education and ignorance. From my standpoint, I believe that the more people know and the more they understand, the more they will make the right life decisions. The less they know and the less they understand, the more likely it is that my statistic of 218 teenage mums in a year will go up rather than down.</p>
	<p pid="c.279.2/17">I hope that the hon. Gentleman does not lose his edge, but I hope, too, that he understands why, in this instance, some of us strongly disagree with him.</p>

	<p pid="c.281.0/1">I am grateful to have the opportunity to follow two interesting speakers. The first was my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1816" name="Philip Davies">the Member for Shipley (Philip Davies)</phrase>, who bravely raised an important issue. The second was <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1747" name="Graham Allen">the hon. Member for Nottingham, North (Mr. Allen)</phrase>, who may have put his finger on the core of the problem. However, I shall try to put it in a slightly more tactful way than the hon. Gentleman.</p>
	<p pid="c.281.0/2">There certainly is a problem in our society at the moment, with young women's pregnancies being caused by young males&mdash;as we heard, not always once but sometimes on multiple occasions. The children are effectively being brought up by the state. Those who are parents can imagine how difficult it must be for young, inexperienced teenagers to bring up children on a deprived council estate.</p>
	<p pid="c.281.0/3">I always try to avoid using the term &quot;single mother&quot; or phrases such as &quot;out of wedlock&quot;. They are rather emotive, and I assume that all hon. Members would agree that it is completely unfair to stigmatise someone who happens to be a single mother. There are all sorts of reasons for women ending up as single mothers. Indeed, most single mothers do an extremely good job in bringing up their children. We are not talking today about single mothers; we are talking about a particular problem that is confined to deprived estates, where people are having more than one child.</p>
	<p pid="c.281.0/4">People make mistakes. Women can become pregnant because of one-off mistakes. We should not be too judgmental about that, either, as I suspect that many in this Room will have been in the position of waiting for a phone call to find out if they were about to become parents rather sooner than expected. That is life. That is reality. However, some young people living in deprived areas think that it is perfectly reasonable, acceptable or even normal to have one child after another, often by different fathers. That is unacceptable, and society needs to be able to say something about it&mdash;and not only to those young women but very much to the young men. That is the sort of problem that we are trying to address today.</p>
	<p pid="c.281.0/5">The question is whether more sex education in schools is the answer. It is obvious from the trade in statistics that we heard that more sex education is not the answer. There is no statistical evidence to suggest it. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1455" name="Kerry McCarthy">The hon. Member for Bristol, East (Kerry McCarthy)</phrase> asked what was the link between less sex education and lower pregnancy rates. That question needs to be directed at the Government. They will not be able to show a link. The hon. Member for Nottingham, North spoke of the increase in under-age pregnancies and babies being born out of wedlock in his constituency, but the reality is that there is far more sex education now in his constituency than there was 20 years ago, so the answer is not more sex education.</p>

	<p pid="c.282.0/1">I am sorry to have missed the start of the debate, although I watched <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1816" name="Philip Davies">the hon. Member for Shipley (Philip Davies)</phrase> on the annunciator screen, and I congratulate him on securing this debate.</p>
	<p pid="c.282.0/2">Is <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1719" name="David Davies">the hon. Member for Monmouth (David T.C. Davies)</phrase> saying that the answer to the problem of unwanted teenage pregnancies and sexually transmitted diseases is more ignorance? That is the opposite of what is being proposed, with more information being given through sex and relationships education.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-11-26c.282.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1719" speakername="David Davies" colnum="282"  time="015:21:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm081126/halltext/81126h0008.htm#08112642000623">
	<p pid="c.282.1/1">No, the answers to dealing with more teenage pregnancies and sexually transmitted disease were eloquently put by my hon. Friend the Member for Shipley. We need to look at the benefits system, the over-sexualisation of society and changing the culture in which we live, and not simply employing more sex education workers to do what they presumably have not been doing very well for the past 20 years.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-11-26c.283.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1816" speakername="Philip Davies" colnum="283"  time="015:21:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm081126/halltext/81126h0008.htm#08112642000624">
	<p pid="c.283.0/1"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1756" name="Evan Harris">The hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon (Dr. Harris)</phrase> made the same point as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1747" name="Graham Allen">the hon. Member for Nottingham, North (Mr. Allen)</phrase>&mdash;that it is either more education or more ignorance. That would make sense if we were starting from the year dot and trying to decide whether or not to introduce sex education. However, we have had sex education for 20 or 30 years and the problem has got worse, which indicates that what the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon proposes&mdash;more sex education or more ignorance&mdash;is not the real choice.</p>

	<p pid="c.283.1/1">I agree with my hon. Friend. As far as we can tell, there is no link between sex education and a reduction in teenage pregnancies, abortion or under-age sex&mdash;unless the hon. Gentleman can enlighten me further.</p>

	<p pid="c.283.2/1">I think that there is evidence, and I am sure that we will hear of it in some of the summating speeches. More information and age-appropriate language early on&mdash;before the giggle factor prevents us transmitting that information&mdash;equips young people to resist peer pressure to have sex. We live in the society that we live in, and I regret some of its factors as much as the hon. Gentleman. However, given where we are, surely we must equip young people with knowledge and self-confidence; more ignorance is not the way forward, given the society and the media that we have today.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-11-26c.283.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1719" speakername="David Davies" colnum="283"  time="015:21:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm081126/halltext/81126h0008.htm#08112642000627">
	<p pid="c.283.3/1">I would be interested to go down that route, talking about Liberal Democrat policies and the sort of culture that we live in and how it may or may not benefit us. However, Mr. Gale, I suspect that you would stop me.</p>
	<p pid="c.283.3/2">I am not against having some form of sex education in secondary schools, although I might differ slightly from my hon. Friend the Member for Shipley on that question. My big concern is sex education in primary schools. As a father of three children under the age of 10, I think that it is completely inappropriate that primary schools should be expected to provide it.</p>
	<p pid="c.283.3/3">It is a clich&eacute;, but I believe that schools should concentrate on reading, writing and arithmetic. The statistics given by my hon. Friend are indisputable. One in five people leaving school at the age of 16 is unable to read and write properly. A report in 2005 suggested that one in three children at the age of 11 was unable to state what a paragraph was, or put commas in the right place. That suggests to me that schools are not doing properly the job that we expect of them. I went to a state primary school in my constituency, and I was able to read by the age of six. The schools in my constituency attended by my children are good, but the schools in many areas are failing. We are now expecting them to undertake sex education as well.</p>
	<p pid="c.283.3/4">It comes down to the fundamental question, what are the roles of the school and of the parent. I believe that the school's role is to impart basic educational knowledge to children. It is the parents' role to decide what young children should be taught about sex, and what their young children should be taught about the facts of life. It is not only the role of the parents; it is their right. That is why I commend my hon. Friend the Member for Shipley for raising the subject today.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-11-26c.284.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1546" speakername="Annette Brooke" colnum="284"  time="015:28:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm081126/halltext/81126h0008.htm#08112642000628">
	<p pid="c.284.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1816" name="Philip Davies">the hon. Member for Shipley (Philip Davies)</phrase> on securing this debate. However, I do not like the title, which is not a good starting point. I believe that we should never talk about sex and relationships, but always about sex and relationship education. The two must go together.</p>
	<p pid="c.284.0/2">At times during the hon. Gentleman's speech, I felt that I was living in a parallel universe, but I agree with some aspects of what he said. I am passionate about supporting the family, whatever shape or size it is. Family stability and loving relationships within the family are so important, and I certainly value the aspect of a family sitting around the table and dining together. On that point, the hon. Gentleman and I do not differ.</p>
	<p pid="c.284.0/3">I, too, refer to some of the stark facts. I start with teenage pregnancy rates. The United Kingdom has the highest teenage birth and abortion rates in Europe. Rates of teenage births here are six times those in the Netherlands, nearly three times those in France and more than twice those in Germany. I have said before that the Government are to be congratulated on having a teenage pregnancy strategy, which seeks to tackle the causes and the consequences of teenage pregnancy. Teenage conception rates have fallen to their lowest level for 20 years, but we have a long way to go.</p>
	<p pid="c.284.0/4">Until last month, the Government had resisted a commitment to make personal, social and health education, including sex and relationship education, a compulsory part of the national curriculum. I have raised this cause at every possible opportunity since being elected. Education must be a vital part of the teenage pregnancy strategy, and I welcome the Government's conversion, at long last.</p>
	<p pid="c.284.0/5">I was extremely distressed when the latest abortion figures were published. In Britain, the number of abortions performed on under-16s rose by 10 per cent. last year to 4,376. For under-14s, there has been a 21 per cent. increase, and half of all pregnancies in under-18s end in abortion. I am not an anti-abortionist, but having an abortion at such a young age cannot be a good start to life. We need more information on sexually transmitted infections. We cannot allow young people to remain in ignorance. Every statistic on most sexually transmitted infections shows that we have the highest diagnosis rate among women aged 16 to 19. Indeed, 12 per cent. of women in that age group are infected with chlamydia.</p>
	<p pid="c.284.0/6">Today's question is: cause and effect&mdash;which way around? Obviously I do not support the argument that sex education has led to the current situation. We have not had adequate sex and relationship education in this country, but of course other factors are at play. However, the key is quality sex and relationship education by trained teachers who wish to do it. We also need to involve other professionals and young people.</p>
	<p pid="c.284.0/7">To counter the points made by the hon. Member for Shipley, we need look no further than the United Kingdom Youth Parliament survey, which throws light on the causal relationship. Twenty two thousand teenagers were surveyed, more than 70 per cent. of whom rated the teaching of sex education in school as poor, very poor or merely average, while only a quarter said that it was good. Furthermore, nearly half said that they had never been taught about the effects of teenage pregnancy and would not know where to find their local sexual health clinic. The survey also revealed that 55 per cent. of all 12 to 15-year-olds, and 57 per cent. of girls between 16 and 17, had not been taught how to use a condom, despite a Government recommendation on that issue.</p>
	<p pid="c.284.0/8">Overall, 55 per cent. of respondents said that they had been taught about teenage pregnancy, leaving just less than half who had not. Many of the young people to whom UKYP spoke while carrying out the survey felt that they knew about how having a baby could impact on their lives, but knew little about the development of a baby in the womb and about the impact that pregnancy could have on their bodies. Most alarmingly, as has already been alluded to, 61 per cent. of boys and 70 per cent. of girls over the age of 17, and 43 per cent. of all the children surveyed, reported having not received any information at school about personal relationships.</p>
	<p pid="c.284.0/9">A study earlier this year by UNICEF, and further work by the National Children's Bureau and the Sex Education Forum, reinforce those points. The National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children has also produced some very interesting material. A snapshot of calls to ChildLine in May 2008 showed that nearly 50 children a day call because they feel under pressure to have sex or lack basic knowledge about sexual health, relationships, pregnancy and puberty. Children as young as 12 call to talk to a counsellor because they are worried that they might be pregnant and lack the facts about safer sex, sexual relationships and peer pressure. Some girls say that they feel pressurised into having sex before they are ready.</p>
	<p pid="c.284.0/10">Those callers to ChildLine, like the rest of us, live in a highly sexualised culture and are influenced by media and marketing, but they are not being equipped to deal with the pressures. Alcohol also comes into the equation. Young people sometimes use alcohol to cope and become more vulnerable as a result. Their lives are complex, and they need knowledge, advice and support to help them to avoid engaging in sexual activity that they later regret.</p>
	<p pid="c.284.0/11">I declare that I am an ambassador for the NSPCC and the views that I shall put forward are not only those of the NSPCC, but very strongly mine. Children need to learn from an early age about appropriate behaviour and how to stay safe in relationships. PSHE needs to receive dedicated teaching time to enable teachers to use different strategies to help children and young people to develop the necessary skills. That should help young people to build their self-esteem and make informed choices in later life. Children and young people should be given the opportunity to gain some understanding about abuses of power and inappropriate and dangerous relationships, and learn what support is available. They need to understand why it is not appropriate to tolerate abuses of power within a relationship, and should be given clear examples of such behaviour, such as child abuse, rape and domestic abuse.</p>
	<p pid="c.284.0/12">I believe passionately that sex and relationship education should begin at five. Much has been made in the press about sex education for five-year-olds&mdash;&quot;condoms for five-year-olds!&quot;&mdash;but I shall explain why I believe that it should start at age five. During deliberations on the Sexual Offences Act 2003 and the police parliamentary scheme, in which I participated&mdash;I spent time with the Metropolitan police's child protection unit&mdash;I learned a great deal about things that I did not know even happened. For example, a child living in an abnormal family does not know that they are living in abnormal circumstances, because they do not have a yardstick by which to measure normality. I came across an example of a child brought up in a household where pornographic material was being made and assembled. That child went out into the street and engaged in a sexual activity with a dog. I rest my case! We need appropriate education at five describing what normal touching is and what normal relationships are.</p>
	<p pid="c.284.0/13">As education progresses we must emphasise qualities within relationships, such as self-esteem, self-respect, respect for others, honesty, choice and so on. We must give young people the ability to make their own choices and have the confidence to say &quot;no&quot;. I have some more examples: one 16-year-old boy told ChildLine that he had had unprotected sex with a girl for a dare and was now concerned that he might have caught a disease. A 14-year-old girl said that her boyfriend wanted to have sex with her, but that she did not know how to do it. Another young girl rang to say that she was worried that she was pregnant after she did not dare to say &quot;no&quot; to sex with her boyfriend in case he dumped her.</p>
	<p pid="c.284.0/14">We must not underestimate the importance of those points. Members will gather that I have been passionate about it for a long time. However, the answer is not just sex and relationship education, but in the whole PSHE programme. A range of health issues must be taught relative to age, maturity and understanding, including emotional and health well-being, diet and exercise, alcohol, tobacco, drugs, careers and safety. Sex and relationship education is just one part of that&mdash;but never should it be just sex education, without the &quot;relationship&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="c.284.0/15">Working with parents is vital. I would not imagine such education being introduced without full parental consultation. Schools should run individual schemes. Work force training is also vital, because no teacher should have to teach a subject on which they are not confident. Furthermore, we must make full use of professionals and young people. I commend the Government on setting up the committee. It delays the introduction of that sort of education, but this time they are right, because it will ensure that the content and any exemptions are firmly discussed.</p>

	<p pid="c.286.0/1">It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Mr. Gale, on this important debate. I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1816" name="Philip Davies">the Member for Shipley (Philip Davies)</phrase> on securing it. He always speaks powerfully on behalf of his constituents and is always willing to put his point of view, for which we should applaud him.</p>
	<p pid="c.286.0/2">My hon. Friend correctly identifies the worsening problems that we face in this country, and the fact that many parents want a close involvement in this part of their children's upbringing. He referred in some detail to examples from Italy and Holland. He rightly pointed out that family structure and stable family environments can do much to help children have a better start in life and to help them make good decisions about the way in which their lives will develop and progress.</p>
	<p pid="c.286.0/3">It is a shame that the Government have not paid more attention to how we can support stable family environments. There are too many policies, such as the couple penalty, which deters couples from coming together and staying together and providing the sort of stable environment about which my hon. Friend talks. I think that he makes some very important and powerful points.</p>
	<p pid="c.286.0/4"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1546" name="Annette Brooke">The hon. Member for Mid-Dorset and North Poole (Annette Brooke)</phrase> talked compellingly about the deterioration in some areas. In particular, she mentioned the 69 per cent. increase in sexually transmitted infections over the past decade. We have the highest level of teenage pregnancies in western Europe, and the number of teenage abortions has increased by 15 per cent. in the past five years. Those statistics should concern us all, and I echo the views eloquently expressed by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1719" name="David Davies">the Member for Monmouth (David T.C. Davies)</phrase> in his contribution.</p>
	<p pid="c.286.0/5">The pivotal point of the debate is whether or not sex education works. Speaking from the Conservative Front Bench, I say that it should work. At the moment, however, there is plenty of room for improvement. For more than six years, Ofsted has been calling for sex and relationship education to be taught by teachers who know how to deliver the subject and, more appropriately, by specialists who have the sort of experience to make a difference in this area.</p>
	<p pid="c.286.0/6">I know that the Minister understands the importance of the matter, and has been dissatisfied with the progress that has been made in this area. I will be interested to hear what he has to say today because he has done a great deal of work to improve an unacceptable situation. None the less, I should like him to pick up on a couple of points. I am concerned that too much emphasis has been placed on making sex and relationship a statutory subject. It is seen as a panacea for the way in which we will improve the current situation. As my hon. Friend the Member for Shipley says, sex education is not something that will be dealt with in the same way in every school, community and family. Simply by saying that the subject will be compulsory will not make it more effective. It is a sticking plaster and something that grabs a headline rather than provides a solution.</p>
	<p pid="c.286.0/7">Two or three years ago, Ofsted said that making something statutory&mdash;this was in the context of sex and relationship education&mdash;does not ensure that it is effective. That is correct. While the Minister considers a number of other measures to improve the effectiveness of sex and relationship education, I urge him not to see making it statutory as some sort of panacea that will solve all ills, because he will be disappointed.</p>
	<p pid="c.286.0/8">I was quite disappointed that the recent report from the Government seemed to side step the role of parents. As my hon. Friend the Member for Shipley said, parents want to have an important role in this part of their children's lives. For many parents, it can be a difficult issue to talk about. Others, however, want to ensure that they have control over the way in which sex and relationships are talked about, particularly to young children. Like my hon. Friend, I have a six-year-old and I know that I want to talk to him about the matter in a way that is proper and right.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-11-26c.287.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1816" speakername="Philip Davies" colnum="287"  time="015:39:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm081126/halltext/81126h0009.htm#08112642000630">
	<p pid="c.287.0/1">My hon. Friend will note that the Liberal Democrats, who did not want to indulge in a debate on the subject, showed that they were neither liberal nor democratic because they support making the subject compulsory. Can my hon. Friend tell me why the hon. Member for Mid-Dorset and North Poole and the Minister know so much more than their constituents or I about how to bring up children and how to tell them about such things? Surely, parents should be the ones to decide what is right for their children, and not Ministers or Liberal Democrat spokesmen.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-11-26c.288.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1389" speakername="Maria Miller" colnum="288"  time="015:39:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm081126/halltext/81126h0009.htm#08112642000631">
	<p pid="c.288.0/1">I share my hon. Friend's concern that parents may feel that they are being marginalised in the process. At the moment, we are fortunate that very few parents withdraw their children from sex and relationship education&mdash;I think that it is less than 1 per cent. The Government must understand how that might change if sex and relationship education were made statutory. I know from talking to various organisations that in cases in which the issues are a little sensitive&mdash;either for cultural or any other reason&mdash;ways are found to ensure that children have the information that they may require. If the subject is made statutory, will that flexibility still be there? I will be interested to hear what the Minister has to say about that. The last thing that he wants to do is to push more parents than currently is the case towards excluding their children from such discussions.</p>
	<p pid="c.288.0/2">It is important that we understand the concerns of the teaching profession when it comes to sex and relationship education. Too many feel that there is inappropriate, or insufficient, training to be able to undertake the roles that they are all too often given in school. I urge the Minister to consider the work done by organisations such as Relate in developing good, solid, very professionally developed course work that can be delivered in a way that will help children to understand such important issues.</p>
	<p pid="c.288.0/3">I urge the Minister to reassure us about the role of parents within this process, and pick up on some of the points that my hon. Friend the Member for Shipley has made. Will he also talk about the importance of age appropriateness? I probably share the concerns of the hon. Member for Mid-Dorset and North Poole that some of the media coverage on the matter has been less than helpful. Perhaps the Minister should shoulder some of the blame for that. It is important that the media is on our side and working with us. A great variety of briefings went out to various newspapers at the time of the Government statement, and there was a great broadness of interpretation as to what would happen. I know that the Rose review will consider the content of sex and relationship education. I hope that the Minister can reassure us that that will not include primary school-age children being exposed to inappropriate sexual material, because that is very important.</p>
	<p pid="c.288.0/4">I should like to pick up on the importance of relationships in sex education. In her intervention, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1455" name="Kerry McCarthy">the hon. Member for Bristol, East (Kerry McCarthy)</phrase> mentioned the Youth Parliament. It is important to ensure that sex education is delivered in the context of relationship education. That is something that has been lacking and has been picked up in the Youth Parliament's work. It is important that we have a good structure for young people in this country to learn about appropriate behaviour.</p>
	<p pid="c.288.0/5">In the past couple of weeks, the headlines have been talking about the increasing problems of inappropriate behaviour. There has been a worrying increase in the numbers of children who witness domestic violence, and who are abused and neglected. There is a powerful argument for parenting skills to be included in the sort of relationship education that we are talking about. That argument was put powerfully to me by a group of students who were studying children's care in education at Basingstoke College of Technology. I ask the Minister to consider in detail the proposals that they have put forward.</p>
	<p pid="c.288.0/6">Time is running out, so I should like to end by applauding the contribution of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1747" name="Graham Allen">the hon. Member for Nottingham, North (Mr. Allen)</phrase>. He had to leave to be in a meeting elsewhere. As always, he made a very powerful case for the importance of earlier intervention in such cases.</p>
	<p pid="c.288.0/7">In closing, I should like to say that my hon. Friend the Member for Shipley is right to question whether we are being effective in what we are doing here. He is right to make us debate and consider in detail some of these issues. I urge him always to challenge us and to bring his thoughts on such issues to the fore. It is right that all communities have a different approach. We must ensure that that flexibility continues and that the Government instil flexibility in the systems that are used for sex and relationship education.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-11-26c.289.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1548" speakername="Jim Knight" speakeroffice="The Minister for Schools and Learners"  colnum="289"  time="015:49:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm081126/halltext/81126h0009.htm#08112642000632">
	<p pid="c.289.0/1">I thank <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1816" name="Philip Davies">the hon. Member for Shipley (Philip Davies)</phrase> for securing this debate. He made an interesting and provocative speech. He seemed to spend the first half arguing that higher rates of teenage pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections in this country were due to sex education and the second half arguing that low rates elsewhere had nothing to do with sex education.</p>
	<p pid="c.289.0/2">My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1747" name="Graham Allen">the Member for Nottingham, North (Mr. Allen)</phrase> gave a thoughtful speech based on his experience representing an area where the consequences of inadequate sex and relationship education are acute. I was particularly struck by his phrase &quot;The more they know, the more they understand.&quot; That is the basis of our argument.</p>
	<p pid="c.289.0/3"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1719" name="David Davies">The hon. Member for Monmouth (David T.C. Davies)</phrase> repeated some of the misconceptions about the quality of schooling in this country. Perhaps, because he does not represent an English constituency, he is not fully aware that this year, for example, 88 per cent. of 11-year-olds achieved the national standard of level 4 in their SATs in reading. Every year, 100,000 more young people leave primary school able to read, write and add up than when his party was last in power.</p>
	<p pid="c.289.0/4"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1546" name="Annette Brooke">The hon. Member for Mid-Dorset and North Poole (Annette Brooke)</phrase> gave a passionate speech and usefully set out the detail of what the UK Youth Parliament says on the matter in its authoritative work. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1389" name="Maria Miller">The hon. Member for Basingstoke (Mrs. Miller)</phrase> made a welcome speech, and I appreciate her constructive approach. I will certainly consider the proposals that Basingstoke college of technology came up with. The new personal, social, health and economic education programme of study on personal well-being includes the roles and responsibilities of parents, carers and children, but at the moment, obviously, it is non-statutory.</p>
	<p pid="c.289.0/5">Sex education is a serious subject that we should not shy away from, which is why I welcome this debate. It is the Government's ambition not only to build a world-class education and children's services system for our young people but to make this country the best place in the world to grow up. Sex and relationships are a crucial part of the process of growing up, and our approach to those relationships, the choices that we make and our ability to keep ourselves safe is what marks us as independent, free-thinking adults. All are fundamentals of any good education.</p>
	<p pid="c.289.0/6">It is no less than part of our moral duty to teach young people how to relate one another, keep themselves safe and treat each other with respect in order to stand them in good stead for happiness and success in later life. Sex and relationship education is a vital part of that, and it is particularly important for young people growing up in the highly sexualised climate of this country in this century. Mass marketing aimed at children, a celebrity and image-conscious culture, T-shirts for girls as young as six reading &quot;So many boys, so little time&quot;, magazines, soaps and music videos create an increasingly sexualised climate in which young people are regularly confronted with sex in some form.</p>
	<p pid="c.289.0/7">It is vital that we get the other side of the story across&mdash;information about sex and relationships, advice on how young people can keep themselves safe and straight answers to their questions&mdash;so that they are well equipped to cultivate meaningful relationships and make safe choices. In the classic comedy series, Blackadder proudly declares himself to be</p>
	<p pid="c.289.0/8" class="indent">&quot;a fully rounded human being with a degree from the university of life, a diploma from the school of hard knocks and three gold stars from the kindergarten of getting the shit kicked out of me&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="c.289.0/9">Our children's social and emotional development cannot be as haphazard as that. By the time they get to the university of life, it is too late. It is particularly important during those years when young people are tempted to experiment with alcohol, drugs, cigarettes and other things, and when they are operating within different social situations and the parameters of peer pressure. Our education system must not shy away from the task of preparing young people for life as fully rounded human beings.</p>
	<p pid="c.289.0/10">That is why, following the sex and relationship education review that I chaired and whose report was published last month, we took the decision to make PSHE statutory in order to ensure that every child benefits from high-quality education on those issues and establish greater consistency across the country, so that those not receiving good advice at home get it at school.</p>

	<p pid="c.290.0/1">What gives the Minister the right to know better how to bring up my child than I do as that child's parent? Why does he insist on making it compulsory? Why can he not allow parents to decide for themselves what is in their own children's best interests?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-11-26c.290.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1548" speakername="Jim Knight" colnum="290"  time="015:49:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm081126/halltext/81126h0009.htm#08112642000634">
	<p pid="c.290.1/1">As I will go on to say, parents certainly need to be actively engaged with schools in how it is delivered, but we need greater consistency because some are not getting good enough advice at home.</p>
	<p pid="c.290.1/2">We need consistency to help us to make inroads in three major areas. First, we will be able to provide better-quality and more consistent advice, something that young people themselves tell us that they want. We heard from the UK Youth Parliament report that 40 per cent. of the 20,000 young people who responded on sex and relationship education rated the information that they received as poor or very poor. That is not good enough. By requiring schools to provide high-quality PSHE, we can raise standards across the board and increase the priority that it receives in schools.</p>
	<p pid="c.290.1/3">Secondly, high-quality PSHE education will help us make major inroads into tackling some of the wider social issues that we face, such as rising rates of sexually transmitted diseases, obesity, aggression, violence and teenage pregnancy, the rate of which, although falling, is still high compared to other European countries. Thirdly, and perhaps most importantly, we want sex and relationship education to help build a partnership between parents and their children as they approach the issues. At the moment, almost a third of teens&mdash;I say this to the hon. Member for Shipley&mdash;say that sex is not discussed openly at home. We want to help parents address the issues with their children.</p>

	<p pid="c.291.2/1">I really do not have time, I am afraid.</p>
	<p pid="c.291.2/2">I know that some people are concerned that talking about sex might give young people ideas, but the fact is that they are having those ideas anyway. There is strong international evidence that comprehensive SRE, linked to easier access to contraception when young people become sexually active, results in lower teenage pregnancy rates. That is the strategy that we have used in this country since the teenage pregnancy strategy was introduced, with good results. Our teenage pregnancy rates are at their lowest for 20 years.</p>
	<p pid="c.291.2/3">I quote an academic study by Douglas Kirby last year on positive outcomes from comprehensive SRE:</p>
	<p pid="c.291.2/4" class="indent">&quot;Virtually all of the comprehensive programs also had a positive impact on one or more factors affecting behaviour. In particular, they improved factors such as knowledge about risks and consequences of pregnancy and STD; values and attitudes about having sex and using condoms or contraception; perception of peer norms about sex and contraception; confidence&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="c.291.2/5">crucially&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="c.291.2/6" class="indent">&quot;in the ability to say 'no' to unwanted sex, to insist on using condoms or contraception or to actually use condoms or contraception; intention to avoid sex or use contraception; and communication with parents or other adults about these topics.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="c.291.2/7">That is the international evidence. In contrast, there is no evidence that abstinence-only education is effective. A recent study examining the role of abstinence and contraceptive use in the decline in US teenage pregnancy rates found that 86 per cent. of the decline was due to improved use of contraception. It is also the case that children whose parents talk to them honestly about sex and relationships are less likely to have sex before 16 and more likely to use contraception when they do.</p>
	<p pid="c.291.2/8">It is clearly better for our young people to get their information from parents and professionals than from their friend's ill-informed brother or the hushed rumours of the locker room. It is clearly better to rely on facts in the classroom rather than myths in the playground. Given that young people spend only 15 per cent. of their time in school, parents are clearly our most valuable partners in educating young people. PSHE needs to be a partnership between parents and schools. We want parents to have greater input and to influence the content of schools' SRE programmes.</p>
	<p pid="c.291.2/9">However, it is also important to view SRE in its proper context. Our announcement was not that sex education only would be made statutory; it included personal, social, health and economic education. There has been much comment in the media and elsewhere that we are focusing on sex education for five-year-olds. That is not accurate, and it misses the point. We have always been clear that any teaching in that area must be age-appropriate. The focus in primary school is on giving children the skills that they need to develop and sustain positive relationships. Those skills will be taught in the context of relationships with family and friends, and they are the same skills that will help them to develop positive, mutually respectful sexual relationships in later life.</p>
	<p pid="c.291.2/10">There is plenty more that I would love to say about what we want to do to improve the quality of delivery, staff training and so on, but time escapes me. In conclusion, as we continue to build a world-class education system, we must also create an environment in which young people feel able to discuss issues important to them, understand the risks that they face as they make the transition to adulthood and have the confidence and knowledge to keep themselves healthy and safe.</p>
	<p pid="c.291.2/11">Sex and relationships are a part of life. Sex education needs to be more than just a biology lesson; it must reflect the issues that young people face, enhance their social and emotional development and be relevant to the complex issues of sexuality and different types of relationships that they face in this century. If we get it right, the lessons learned at school will stay with them for the rest of their lives. Although Euclidean geometry and the dates of the English civil war may fade from memory, the knowledge of how to practise safe sex will not.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-11-26c.293.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1982" speakername="John Barrett" colnum="293"  time="016:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm081126/halltext/81126h0009.htm#08112642000638">
	<p pid="c.293.1/1">I am glad to have triggered this debate today, because in recent months we have witnessed financial turmoil both at home and abroad. Currently we are in a recession, with the outlook for 2009 and beyond being as uncertain as at any time since the last world war, which happened long before I was born.</p>
	<p pid="c.293.1/2">I requested this debate today because I believe that its full title&mdash;the effect of interest rates on mortgage holders&mdash;covers much of what has been at the core of our economy for many years. What has been the aspiration of the majority of householders in the UK? It has been to become home owners. At the heart of the property-owning dream is the need for a system of finance that makes that dream a reality. In most cases, that means having access to a mortgage. Although having a mortgage and owning property is right for some, it is not right for all and for some people renting is the correct option.</p>
	<p pid="c.293.1/3">The Chancellor's statement on Monday was designed to stimulate the economy and to turn around our economic fortunes. However, I would like to put it on the record today that I have no faith in that prescription to cure a country that has a sick economy. Cutting VAT to help people to buy imported products will not solve the problem. Investing in a new deal with public works programmes, including the construction of hospitals and schools and house building to help those in the construction industry who have been laid off might help. I accept that that was part of the Chancellor's programme. Investing in the infrastructure of the country, with the construction of a high-speed rail link, would not only produce jobs and boost the economy but would be good for the environment, by cutting down on polluting short-haul flights. However, before I digress on to a wider subject, I will return to the subject of today's debate.</p>
	<p pid="c.293.1/4">In the last 25 years, much has changed. Interest rates have gone up and down, and house prices have generally only gone up, with a few exceptions. Conventional wisdom would have indicated that low interest rates would be good for mortgage owners and high interest rates would be bad. As I go into more detail in this speech, it will become clear that that is not necessarily the case.</p>
	<p pid="c.293.1/5">Today we have falling interest rates, which are at an all-time low. The Bank of England base rate has fallen this month by 1.5 per cent. to 3 per cent, which is the lowest rate in living memory. Mortgage rates are also low. Why then has the housing market frozen, with sales and mortgages granted also falling to an all-time low, house builders being made redundant and even estate agents and lawyers involved in conveyancing going on to short time or losing their jobs?</p>
	<p pid="c.293.1/6">Like many property owners with a mortgage, I believe that paying rent produces little or nothing at the end of the day. Although my mortgage produces the home over my head for myself and my family, it also produces something else, which is an asset to leave to the next generation. I have watched the value of the houses that I have owned in Edinburgh grow steadily in recent years and the mortgage rates that I have had were more than double their current level. While there was relative job security and a steady if not spectacular rise in property values, that situation was okay. The construction industry and building societies worked together effectively to produce a solid system of sensible lending, which produced stability at a reasonable price.</p>

	<p pid="c.294.1/1">The hon. Gentleman is one step ahead of me today, as I was about to congratulate him later in my speech for that Bill. No doubt he will agree with what I am about to say in this debate.</p>
	<p pid="c.294.1/2">There is a credit card summit today, at which some of the issues that I have mentioned may well be addressed. Almost everything that is charged on anything that is bought can result in high, sometimes outrageous, rates of interest being charged. That can result in real hardship, misery or even worse situations for those who are paying those interest rates.</p>
	<p pid="c.294.1/3">My own constituency is in Edinburgh, which is well known as a centre for banking and finance. In my constituency, I have the global headquarters of the Royal Bank of Scotland and there are many other people in my constituency who work for the Halifax Bank of Scotland and other employers in the financial sector. Much has been said about the problems facing the banking sector, from big city bonuses to the Government investing billions in banks to keep them afloat. I would like to be able to say that the banks have been prudent, have lent wisely and have been victims of the actions of others. Sadly, however, that has not always been the case.</p>
	<p pid="c.294.1/4">I can give the example of a constituent who visited me at my advice surgery. He detailed how he was in debt, having lost his job, and he could not manage his debt repayments. He could not manage the debt that he had, yet he was lent a further &pound;2,000 by HBOS at what appeared to be a reasonable 19 per cent. interest rate over three years. However, after other charges and insurances were added on, he was charged 75 per cent. interest on top of his original loan to clear his debt. He could not afford that and he should not have been given more money when he could not live within his existing means. What he needed was good financial advice, not a loan. However, I agree that it takes two. Borrowers should read the small print and, at times, just say &quot;no&quot; and do without the purchase.</p>
	<p pid="c.294.1/5">A more extreme example of an individual facing higher charges that I discovered was that of Sharlene Britton. When she became the proud owner of a second-hand car, little did she realise that the total cost had more than tripled from the &pound;7,000 for the car to &pound;21,500 minutes before she drove it away. Sharlene had signed a credit agreement that included a loan with a massive 42.5 per cent. interest rate and payment protection insurance that cost more than the vehicle itself. It was those add-ons, coupled with the 42.5 per cent interest rate, that pushed the cost of her financial package sky-high. On top of the &pound;7,080 sale price of the car, she agreed to pay &pound;3,228 in payment protection insurance. However, because the cost of the premiums was added to the loan, which made it subject to the 42.5 per cent. interest charge, the figure swelled to &pound;8,957. She then had to pay interest on the original price of the car, plus related charges, which pushed the total balance that she was expected to pay from &pound;7,000 to &pound;21,540.</p>
	<p pid="c.294.1/6">Although that sounds bad enough, there are much worse cases. One of the most extreme examples that has been quoted in the press involved interest rates that worked out in excess of 2.6 million per cent. An example that I can give is that of a woman in York who took out a loan one week for &pound;320 with the firm Early Pay Day Loans, which attracted 80 per cent. interest over seven days. When the cost of the credit was calculated over a 12-month period, the annual percentage rate of the loan worked out to be 2,639,385.9 per cent. Early Pay Day Loans was contacted and it insisted that its charges are &quot;competitive&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="c.294.1/7">From the basic 6 per cent. of a mortgage to 2 million per cent. interest, which I know is hard to believe, there is everything in between. The reason for giving these examples is to highlight the link between what we have at one end of the spectrum, which is a bank base rate at 3 per cent. and falling, while at the other end we have sky-high interest rates, which can undermine individuals and businesses who are doing all they can to survive.</p>
	<p pid="c.294.1/8">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2020" name="Jim Devine">the hon. Member for Livingston (Mr. Devine)</phrase>, who has introduced a private Member's Bill for a maximum limit to interest rates. As a co-sponsor of that Bill, I wish him well.</p>
	<p pid="c.294.1/9">Much of the personal wealth of the country is tied up in property. Millions of people are mortgage holders and pay interest, not only on their mortgage but on other loans. Properties are often used as the security for old age of those who have worked and paid for them during their working years. A property is often the single largest financial investment that most people will ever make and it should be secure. It is true that having money does not make people happy, but not having any money is guaranteed to make life much more miserable.</p>
	<p pid="c.294.1/10">It is absolutely vital that the stability of the property market is restored so that millions of citizens and our economy as a whole can again return to a belief in a secure future; confidence is the key. Part of that process will depend on sensible lending at reasonable interest rates. I look forward to hearing from the Minister what he thinks can be done to curb the excesses in the market of extreme interest rates. That is now more important than at any other time in recent years as we now have a combination of factors, as well as those interest rates, which are affecting mortgage holders. The combination of high utility costs and increasing food and fuel prices is a recipe for financial disaster for many but, hopefully, utility costs have peaked and will begin to fall soon.</p>
	<p pid="c.294.1/11">One group who are in a particularly perilous position are those who are currently unemployed with mortgages who receive mortgage interest relief. Their plight was brought to my attention by a constituent from Carrick Knowe who visited my advice surgery recently. I would like to thank her for alerting me to the problem. She outlined the impact that a fall in the base rate from 4.5 per cent. to 3 per cent. would have on those receiving mortgage interest relief , but who were paying a fixed rate mortgage.</p>
	<p pid="c.294.1/12">I am sure that hon. Members will be aware that income support mortgage interest is designed to cover the cost of mortgage interest to ensure that families who may already be reeling from a redundancy are not also faced with the prospect of losing their home. Since <phrase class="date" code="2004-12-05">5 December 2004</phrase>, the standard interest rate used to calculate support for mortgage interest payments has been the Bank of England base rate plus 1.58 per cent. Prior to that, it was based on an average basket of building society interest rates. The new formula has proved to be sufficient to cover the interest on most mortgages when rates have been fairly stable. However, with interest rates cut to 3 per cent. and set to fall further, my constituent rightly pointed out that the top level of support available to her and others in her position would tumble to slightly more than 4.5 per cent., which is significantly lower than all fixed and variable-rate mortgages. Given that fixed-rate mortgages alone make up 62 per cent. of the UK mortgage market, that is a concern.</p>
	<p pid="c.294.1/13">Recognising the urgency of the issue, I wrote last week to the Prime Minister and the Minister of State, Department for Work and Pensions, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1618" name="Tony McNulty">the right hon. Member for Harrow, East (Mr. McNulty)</phrase>, who has responsibility for employment and welfare reform, to highlight the shortfall. Although I have yet to receive a reply from either, it was gratifying to note in the pre-Budget statement that the Government had indeed noted the problem and taken some action. The Chancellor's statement says that for six months, the level of interest rates covered by the scheme will remain, despite the base rate fall, at slightly more than 6 per cent. Will the Minister clarify whether that is for existing claimants only, or will it apply to new applicants?</p>
	<p pid="c.294.1/14">Although the measure is to be welcomed, it nevertheless prompts the question what will happen after six months. If the Government believe that the economy will have recovered in six months' time to a point at which interest rates will once again stand at 4.5 per cent., their optimism surely knows no bounds. In reality, it is far more likely that the economy will be in as bad, if not a worse, state by then, as yesterday's OECD report pointed out. The report indicated that interest rates will stay low, and they might even be lower in six months' time. At that time, people who depend on help to pay interest on their mortgage will see the cliff edge of support that they are on crumbling away beneath their feet.</p>
	<p pid="c.294.1/15">To give hon. Members an indication of the potential scale of the problem, anyone who has taken out a mortgage in the last three years would not be covered by the scheme&mdash;it would not cover the interest on their payments. To be fair, the Government have not sat idly by while the situation has deteriorated. I welcome the extension in Government help for those people struggling to pay home loan bills, and the decision to start mortgage interest relief after 13 rather than 39 weeks is excellent news. Similarly, the fact that help will be available on mortgage amounts up to &pound;200,000 rather than &pound;175,000 will also be welcomed by many of my constituents.</p>
	<p pid="c.294.1/16">However, with unemployment shooting up&mdash;it is now at an 11-year high and predicted to rise to 3 million by 2010&mdash;that will be a bigger problem in the coming months, as more people come to depend on Government help with their mortgage payments. The Government have bought themselves 6 months with this week's announcement, but I look forward to hearing from the Minister what plans they have to change the formula by which help is calculated, to ensure that the benefit more accurately reflects the help that families need. I hope that if the Minister is unable to answer those questions today, he would be good enough to write to me.</p>
	<p pid="c.294.1/17">Looking to the future, we are faced with a set of circumstances such as I have never known. Base rates are low and they are predicted to fall again next year. Compared with other countries, our base rates could certainly fall further. As well as low interest rates, we have a frozen housing market, falling house prices, the potential collapse of Northern Rock, and building societies that once gathered savings so that they could lend to house purchasers at reasonable rates are turning into banks and suffering from the same failings: reckless borrowing and irresponsible lending. Something that we thought was the prerogative of the foolish has become the accepted behaviour for the financial institutions that we have grown to trust for hundreds of years. That trust has been shattered and the outlook for many is bleak.</p>
	<p pid="c.294.1/18">The current solution being put forward by the Government to the financial problems that fill the media every day is to provide a financial stimulus to the economy; to increase people's spending to kick-start the economy; and to put more money into people's pockets. I doubt whether that is actually the solution to the problem but, to give the benefit of the doubt to the Chancellor, even if it was, it could all be undermined if interest rates being paid by the public and businesses are not brought back to reasonable levels. If they are not, any increase in cash in the pockets of Joe Public will be swallowed up paying interest before he can spend it on goods and services. Unless mortgage holders believe that their property will hold its value and is worth paying for, the basis of domestic finance for millions could crumble. I look forward to hearing the Minister's comments on those issues.</p>

	<p pid="c.297.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1982" name="John Barrett">the hon. Member for Edinburgh, West (John Barrett)</phrase> on securing the debate and welcome the support he expressed for a number of elements of the pre-Budget report. I was disappointed that he was rather sceptical about the impact of the VAT reduction, but I simply refer him to the evidence given yesterday by the Governor of the Bank of England to the Treasury Committee, which was a fair and positive assessment of the impact that the announcement will have.</p>
	<p pid="c.297.0/2">The hon. Gentleman is right to focus on mortgage lending; it is always an important topic, but especially in these difficult times. The interest rates charged by lenders will obviously have an effect on the affordability of mortgages and the ability of borrowers to repay. As he indicated, the Government have taken a number of steps to address the challenges as part of our comprehensive action to support the financial system in the UK.</p>
	<p pid="c.297.0/3">The hon. Gentleman will be familiar with the broader programme, which includes the recapitalisation scheme announced in early October. In addition, a number of conditions have been applied to the public funding that is being invested in preference shares in Lloyds TSB, the Royal Bank of Scotland and HBOS. The banks have signed up to specific conditions, including on mortgage lending. For example, they have signed up to maintaining in the next three years the availability and active marketing of competitively priced lending to borrowers at 2007 levels. Copies of those agreements are available in the Libraries of both Houses, and UK Financial Investments Ltd, the new organisation, will monitor implementation of the conditions for the Government. The hon. Gentleman will be aware of the special liquidity scheme and the credit guarantee scheme. The latter offers up to &pound;250 billion-worth of guarantees for new debt issued by participating banks.</p>
	<p pid="c.297.0/4">The downturn is a global event, but its effects are being felt on a local scale. Home owners are finding it significantly harder, as the hon. Gentleman said, to remortgage their homes. That is the sharp end of the credit crunch&mdash;it is not bankers but families who feel the pinch.</p>
	<p pid="c.297.0/5">It is not Government policy to influence the individual interest rate decisions taken by the Monetary Policy Committee. To do so would compromise the arrangements for independence that the Government put in place in 1997, which have worked well. To attempt to influence those decisions would squander the credibility gains of the arrangements.</p>
	<p pid="c.297.0/6">However, from the beginning of the current financial turmoil, central banks around the world undertook co-ordinated action to help ease global monetary conditions. In the past few weeks, major central banks, including the Bank of England, the European Central Bank and the Federal Reserve, have announced co-ordinated reductions in policy interest rates, and extended their swap agreements. On <phrase class="date" code="2008-11-06">6 November</phrase>, the MPC voted to reduce the Bank's base rate by 1.5 per cent. to 3 per cent., and in recent weeks, we have seen LIBOR rates steadily falling. As a consequence, the spread between the LIBOR rate and the Bank of England's base rate has fallen to levels not seen for some time. Those are positive developments.</p>

	<p pid="c.298.0/1">When I presented my ten-minute Bill I highlighted particular companies, as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1982" name="John Barrett">the hon. Member for Edinburgh, West (John Barrett)</phrase> has. Provident charged an interest rate of 183 per cent, and other companies were charging 432 per cent. and 9,885 per cent. None of those companies has reduced its credit card interest rates. We are doing a superb job of protecting hard-working families, but surely a cap on loans for credit cards, loans and suchlike should be part of the package.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-11-26c.298.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1563" speakername="Stephen Timms" colnum="298"  time="016:15:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm081126/halltext/81126h0010.htm#08112642000643">
	<p pid="c.298.1/1">My hon. Friend raises an important point, which the Prime Minister commented on in Question Time earlier today. The Government have considered a cap in law on a number of occasions. The difficulty that has always arisen is whether it should be illegal for somebody to borrow &pound;20 on Friday on condition that they will pay back &pound;25 on Monday. Of course, one could say that a friendly arrangement such as that would not be affected, but it is a difficult matter. I have not yet had the opportunity to study my hon. Friend's proposal, which I shall happily do, but it is difficult to frame legislation so as not to catch things that one would wish to continue to be permissible. He makes an important point about some very antisocial practices&mdash;or worse&mdash;in parts of the lending market.</p>
	<p pid="c.298.1/2">There are good reasons why the business models of banks and other lenders have changed in the past year. Lenders face inaccessible and expensive funding. They are concerned about solvency and are trying, perfectly properly, to strengthen their balance sheets. In those circumstances, it is natural that they should be conservative about products and pricing and move away from higher-risk lending. Individual decisions about offering loans and the price of those loans need to remain commercial decisions for lenders.</p>
	<p pid="c.298.1/3">However, banks are at the heart of our economy and need to play their part in helping the UK through these difficult times, and the Government are absolutely determined that they will. The recent cut in the base rate of interest announced by the Bank of England Monetary Policy Committee is having a positive effect on inter-bank lending and on credit markets more generally. As credit conditions ease, we should see the banks pass savings on to their customers. My right hon. Friend the Chancellor has met chief executives of the major UK banks to make that clear, and he reiterated the importance of that today in the House. Since his meeting with the chief executives, there have been some welcome announcements by banks on that front.</p>
	<p pid="c.298.1/4">It is perhaps worth making the point that lenders fund themselves from a variety of sources, some of which have already reflected much of the fall in the base rate. Others, such as deposits from savers and market borrowing, are less directly affected. Ten major British financial institutions are now offering new standard variable rate mortgages that reflect the full 1.5 per cent. drop in the base rate. For existing mortgage holders, banks often have no leeway to offer lower rates. About 50 per cent. of mortgages are fixed, so by definition those customers will not have the cut passed on to them, and about 40 per cent. are trackers, so by definition those customers will. Banks have that discretion only in the case of the 10 per cent. of mortgages that are on standard variable rates.</p>
	<p pid="c.298.1/5">The Government are absolutely committed to helping people who are struggling with their mortgages, and I am grateful to the hon. Member for Edinburgh, West, for acknowledging some of the announcements that have been made this week. In 2004, we extended the scope of the Financial Services Authority's regulation to cover mortgages. That ensures that borrowers are afforded important protection and have appropriate means of redress. The FSA will continue to keep under review its regime for borrowers, including those facing repayment problems. I suspect that the hon. Gentleman would agree that recent calls from some Members for mortgage regulation to be abolished now look rather ridiculous. It is absolutely clear that introducing that regulation was the right thing to do.</p>
	<p pid="c.298.1/6">On <phrase class="date" code="2008-10-22">22 October</phrase>, the Government confirmed that the Master of the Rolls had approved a new protocol for mortgage possession cases, complementing existing regulation and setting out clear standards that judges can expect from lenders bringing repossession cases to the courts. On Monday, as the hon. Gentleman said, the Chancellor announced in the pre-Budget report a number of policies that will support households facing financial difficulties. We are working with lenders to ensure that the industry does everything that it can to support borrowers facing repayment difficulties, and that we can consider all options before repossessing homes as a last resort. We are establishing a lending panel, bringing together Government, regulators, lenders, trade bodies and consumer groups to monitor lending to both households and businesses.</p>

	<p pid="c.300.1/1">In addition, there is a commitment for the coming year by the major mortgage lenders on the lending panel&mdash;Abbey, Barclays, Bradford &amp; Bingley, GE Money, HBOS, Lloyds, Nationwide, Northern Rock and the Royal Bank of Scotland&mdash;not to repossess homes within three months of an owner-occupier going into arrears.</p>
	<p pid="c.300.1/2">In September, we launched a mortgage rescue scheme which will help up to 6,000 borrowers facing repayment difficulties to remain in their homes, and in the pre-Budget report, my right hon. Friend the Chancellor announced an extension to mortgage rescue to cover second-charge lending. The major mortgage lenders are committed to giving their full support to mortgage rescue products, including shared equity.</p>
	<p pid="c.300.1/3">The Government also provide direct support to individuals&mdash;the hon. Member for Edinburgh, West raised this point&mdash;through support for mortgage interest, which is available to those who are out of work and to pensioners. It is delivered through social security benefits. We will make the scheme more generous, as he requested, by increasing the size of mortgage for which support is payable for new working-age claimants. At present, it is &pound;100,000. We announced that it was going up to &pound;175,000, then this week announced that it will go up to &pound;200,000. In addition, we will increase net support for beneficiaries of support for mortgage interest through maintaining payments at the current interest rate for the next six months for existing claimants.</p>
	<p pid="c.300.1/4">The hon. Gentleman asked about new claimants who might be in a difficult position. I will drop him a line to respond specifically to that.</p>
	<p pid="c.300.1/5">The Government are also determined to ensure that every household struggling with debts can access free and impartial debt advice. My right hon. Friend announced in the pre-Budget report an additional investment of &pound;5.85 million to March 2011 for telephone advice, and &pound;10 million to March 2010 for citizens advice bureaux to expand face-to-face debt advice capacity, and to ensure that advice and support are available for borrowers who may need it. I believe that the hon. Gentleman will welcome that, and it will be particularly important for the group of people about whom my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2020" name="Jim Devine">the Member for Livingston (Mr. Devine)</phrase> was concerned.</p>
	<p pid="c.300.1/6">We recognise that tighter credit conditions are making life significantly harder for a large group of home owners across the country. What we need to be doing is not pushing lenders into operating in a risky or non-commercial way, but rather fostering appropriate long-term conditions for economic stability and growth. In the shorter term, we are targeting support on those home owners who most need help. That is the right approach, and we will continue to do everything we can to support those who get into difficulties.</p>

	<p pid="c.301.1/1">I thank Mr. Speaker for selecting this debate, which is very important to constituents throughout the UK. I am deeply appreciative. I am also extremely grateful that so many colleagues have turned up to listen to and, I hope, participate in the debate. They all know as well as I do the damage that has been caused to many of our constituents who are victims of pleural plaques.</p>
	<p pid="c.301.1/2">I know, Mr. Gale, that it is always wrong specifically to thank people, but may I take this opportunity to mention two colleagues who have worked tirelessly on the whole question of pleural plaques? The first is my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1386" name="Michael Clapham">the Member for Barnsley, West and Penistone (Mr. Clapham)</phrase> who, due to other parliamentary business, unfortunately is not with us today. No one has worked harder than he has. Likewise, I would like to make special mention of my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1673" name="John Battle">the Member for Leeds, West (John Battle)</phrase>, who has been working on asbestos-related diseases for longer than some of us have been in the House. I put on record my appreciation for his work.</p>
	<p pid="c.301.1/3">I also mention the work of the trade unions on pleural plaques, and Thompsons, the lawyers who work with the trade unions on such issues. Their assistance is greatly appreciated and welcomed.</p>
	<p pid="c.301.1/4">Finally, I make special mention of the workers from the whole of the UK who came to Parliament to lobby some weeks ago, sacrificing a day's wages to do so. To me, that demonstrates the strength of feeling among victims and their families about losing compensation for pleural plaques. When people make the choice to lose a day's wages to come to the mother of democracy and express their concern, they demonstrate their commitment.</p>
	<p pid="c.301.1/5">On the subject of commitment, our Prime Minister said clearly on two public occasions that I know of&mdash;at the Scottish Labour party conference and at the Scottish TUC conference&mdash;that he was working to resolve the matter of compensation for pleural plaques. I and other colleagues will certainly be holding him to that, and I have every reason to believe that he will deliver his promise.</p>
	<p pid="c.301.1/6">The question is whether pleural plaques cause any symptoms. The insurers say that they do not.</p>

	<p pid="c.301.2/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend on securing the debate. In his introduction, he gave thanks and endorsements to various people. He may also want to pay tribute to our late colleague, John MacDougall, the former MP for Glenrothes, who died from an asbestos-related disease.</p>

	<p pid="c.301.3/1">I thank my hon. Friend for that intervention. He is absolutely right. John MacDougall was a great champion of tackling asbestos-related disease. Unfortunately, he was a victim himself. Anyone who has seen the unfortunate circumstances of someone who is dying of mesothelioma will know that it is probably the most horrible death that they will ever see. I pay tribute to John MacDougall for the work that he did to raise awareness of asbestos-related disease.</p>
	<p pid="c.301.3/2">Are there any symptoms of pleural plaques? The arguments have been well-rehearsed in many meetings. On this occasion, I praise the Minister, who has been accessible to colleagues who are concerned about the issue. She has always made herself available, and she has always been prepared to listen to the arguments. We have certainly appreciated that and hope that it continues.</p>
	<p pid="c.301.3/3">Once diagnosed, people with pleural plaques experience anxiety, and some develop psychologically induced breathlessness. Anxiety levels are highest in the trades that have seen former colleagues such as John MacDougall die. Some people develop anger or feelings of helplessness as well as anxiety, and a small number develop psychiatric illnesses.</p>

	<p pid="c.302.0/1">Does my hon. Friend agree that one of the sorriest parts of the decision by the lawyers was their refusal to accept that pleural plaques can induce stress in people who have the condition? Things may be all right where lawyers live in the leafy suburbs of Berkshire, Surrey or wherever, because they never come across anyone with pleural plaques, but in places such as Tyneside or Clydeside, where my hon. Friend lives, two people die each week of mesothelioma. Workmen and former workmen go to funerals every week. If that is not stress, what is?</p>

	<p pid="c.302.1/1">My hon. Friend is absolutely right. There is not much chance of lawyers or people in the City catching an asbestos-related disease. It is highly unlikely, given the circumstances in which they work. He is right to say that it is a working-class disease, and we need a working-class Government to sort it out quickly.</p>
	<p pid="c.302.1/2">My hon. Friend rightly raised another issue. I do not think that the number of victims of pleural plaques has peaked yet. There are still more cases to come, and it is important to make that point. If we do not overturn the decision by the Law Lords now, what hope is there for those who will come in the years ahead? I do not think that the problem has peaked yet.</p>

	<p pid="c.302.2/1">I commend my hon. Friend on securing the debate. It is important to keep this matter alive. As he knows, I represent a part of West Lothian&mdash;Bathgate&mdash;which used to have a car plant, but now we are seeing cases, including one well-documented case about which there was a television programme, of someone who is gasping for breath and who caught the disease so long ago that we have all forgotten that there was a car plant in Bathgate. Is it not surprising that the Law Lords' judgment is that pleural plaques are not to be considered, except in exceptional circumstances? How can it be right for people to be compensated for pleural plaques in some circumstances, but not in most cases?</p>

	<p pid="c.302.3/1">My hon. Friend has been involved in many important campaigns. Likewise, he has been vociferous in the campaign on pleural plaques. He is right. The common denominator for victims of pleural plaques is that people cannot get the disease unless they come into contact with asbestos. Returning to my previous point, not many lawyers or people in the City will contract the disease, because they do not come near asbestos, unless it is found in their offices or whatever.</p>

	<p pid="c.303.0/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend on bringing this matter to Westminster Hall. Does he agree that we have not peaked? That is common knowledge. The Minister must also address the fact that we have to change the structure in respect of where people are acquiring the disease. Changes must take place in the workplace now, because resolving the problem in payment terms is not dealing with the issue. The main issue has to be dealt with, as well as the compensation.</p>

	<p pid="c.303.1/1">My hon. Friend is right. He, too, has been actively campaigning and he is right about solving the problem. In many ways, we have solved the problem in the United Kingdom by bringing in health and safety legislation that will go some way to protect workers, but the important thing to remember is that the problem has moved on and there is clear evidence that asbestos producers are moving into third world countries, so a problem that was started in this country is now moving there. We need to set an example and, through our Ministers, ask the producers to endorse the same safety measures in the third world countries that they have in the UK.</p>

	<p pid="c.303.2/1">I, too, congratulate my hon. Friend on securing the debate and on keeping the campaign at the forefront of Parliament's and the Government's mind. I thank him for his kind comments earlier.</p>
	<p pid="c.303.2/2">Does my hon. Friend agree that the villain of the piece now is not so much the Government or the medical profession, which is on-side, and not the lawyers or the companies, but the insurance companies? I have not yet seen an insurance company go to the wall, although I have seen a few banks go that way. The time has come to take on the insurance companies, which have tried every trick in the book, including the Law Lords' decision, to avoid their justifiable liabilities. Is it not time that our Government cut through this legal knot and delivered justice to people who have already won the case?</p>

	<p pid="c.303.3/1">My right hon. Friend is right. The insurers have used every trick in the book to try to dodge their responsibilities. Indeed, some years ago they tried to blame a Department for lodging a claim against compensation. That is perverse. It is ridiculous to try to blame the Government. The Government should be in a position to rebut that.</p>

	<p pid="c.303.4/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend on securing the debate. Is it not obvious what the insurers are up to? Last week, with the result of the so-called trigger litigation on mesothelioma cases, the leader of the Forum of Insurance Lawyers said:</p>
	<p pid="c.303.4/2" class="indent">&quot;We welcome this clarification of the law. We hope this will now unlock the flow of damages to mesothelioma victims.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="c.303.4/3">If that is so, why does he think that the insurers have gone ahead with appealing the Law Lords' decision? He could have said, &quot;We now accept it. We have been caught bang to rights. Let's pay these people with pleural plaques what they are due.&quot;</p>

	<p pid="c.303.5/1">I thank my hon. Friend for his contribution. He is right. For the insurance lawyers to take such an altruistic approach to life, as if they were offering good will and looking after the workers, is ridiculous and should be condemned at every level.</p>

	<p pid="c.304.0/1">I thank my hon. Friend for giving way and I congratulate him on securing the debate. As a former trade union lawyer, I say that although the legal decision in the House of Lords may, on its facts, legally have been correct, in terms of justice we Members of Parliament must, if necessary, change the law. I urge that course on the Government. The insurance companies have had the premiums&mdash;the money&mdash;on their employers' liability insurance policies for potential pleural plaques, for which people have had compensation for years. Now they are trying to wriggle out of having to pay out the money. It is unjust, unfair and the Government should change the law.</p>

	<p pid="c.304.1/1">My hon. Friend is right. I sincerely hope that the Minister is listening to what colleagues are saying about changing and overturning the Law Lords' decision. I hope that we go some way to achieving that&mdash;if not today, then in the near future. We will certainly be looking closely at that.</p>
	<p pid="c.304.1/2">We have just finished the consultation on pleural plaques, to which there were a number of submissions. It would be helpful if the Minister gave us, today or in the near future, some indication about when those findings will be made public so that we can make an informed decision and move forward somehow on dealing with pleural plaques.</p>
	<p pid="c.304.1/3">I am concerned about some of the figures, particularly those suggested by the insurance companies, that show that if the Law Lords' decision is overturned it could lead to hundreds of thousands of victims claiming throughout the UK. Those figures are grossly exaggerated. Is it possible for the Minister to investigate exactly, or approximately, how many people would be affected by pleural plaques, in terms of compensation?</p>
	<p pid="c.304.1/4">People are also concerned about the Scottish dimension. The Scottish Parliament has made it clear that it will overturn the Law Lords' decision. I have said it publicly before and I will say it again: best of luck. I hope the Scottish Parliament overturns the decision, because at the end of the day the victims do not care who legislates, as long as they get the compensation that they are entitled to. I say to the Scottish people and the Scottish Parliament, &quot;Best of luck. I hope you overturn this decision.&quot; But the cynic in me suggests that they may not be able to do that and will, therefore, end up blaming someone else. I have no doubt that that someone else will be us. That seriously worries me.</p>

	<p pid="c.304.2/1">I congratulate the hon. Gentleman on securing this important debate. In Northern Ireland, the Department for which I have responsibility is currently undertaking a consultation on this issue. We have followed closely what Scotland has done and proposes to do. The matters that the hon. Gentleman and other hon. Members are raising are so important. We must make a priority of dealing with and tackling the issues facing ordinary families, who have been devastated by the consequences of this disease and other effects of asbestosis. Hopefully, we in Northern Ireland will be able to move forward on this issue at the earliest opportunity, taking account of the consultation process.</p>

	<p pid="c.304.3/1">I thank the hon. Gentleman for that contribution. I genuinely welcome his and his party's support on this issue. That underlines why we need legislation covering the four countries of the UK, rather than have people going off and doing their own thing and what have you. For me, that resonates and is important.</p>
	<p pid="c.304.3/2">I am conscious of the time. We want to leave the Minister some time to respond to the major concerns that have been raised and, hopefully, she will be able to do so.</p>
	<p pid="c.304.3/3">In terms of compensation, for more than 20 years the courts recognised pleural plaques as a compensatable injury; they accepted that plaques, together with the increase of developing asbestos-related malignant disease and the resulting anxiety that flowed from that diagnosis, amounted to significant harm. Actionable damage claims proceeded through that period without any difficulty. That was the position before the Law Lords' decision and, hopefully, we can get back to that. People with pleural plaques have suffered identifiable harm from exposure to asbestos and it is right that they should be compensated. I am sure that the Minister will be aware that today's turnout of hon. Members from across the UK, representing their constituents, demonstrates the interest that is shown on this matter.</p>
	<p pid="c.304.3/4">There is significant evidence suggesting that pleural plaques are not the symptomless condition that the five judges thought. Indeed, it is a matter of record that their judgment was unanimous and I accept that that makes it difficult to overturn, but legislation is needed to offer hope to the victims.</p>
	<p pid="c.304.3/5">I vigorously disagree with the Law Lords' decision that the companies that were named earlier and which polluted people with asbestos were not responsible for people developing pleural plaques or full-blown mesothelioma. So who was responsible? Was it the irresponsible doctors who told sufferers that they had pleural plaques, because that caused their anxiety? It is ridiculous to blame doctors for telling people that they are unwell, and I am sure that the people I represent and those my hon. Friends represent find it incredible and cannot understand it.</p>
	<p pid="c.304.3/6">I was a Member of the House when farmers and their livestock were affected by the foot and mouth disease and bluetongue outbreaks. Hon. Members were up in arms and demanded compensation for the animals that were destroyed to halt the spread of disease. I do not wish denigrate the plight of farmers whose livelihoods were threatened or even ruined, but when human beings contract a killing disease, the House does not afford them the same attention. I want the Minister to understand that pleural plaques are a working-class disease.</p>

	<p pid="c.305.0/1">Does my hon. Friend agree that most people seem to regard mesothelioma and pleural plaques as diseases emanating from shipyards and car factories, although they affect other workers? I have a friend, John Manzie, whose father was a school janitor and died of mesothelioma because he was forced to work in a school where there was asbestos. These are not diseases only of shipyard and car workers.</p>

	<p pid="c.305.1/1">My hon. Friend is absolutely right. The disease does not affect only workers from shipyards, engineering factories and other major industries; it affects families, because when people took their clothes and overalls home, their wives and daughters came into contact with asbestos. It is important not to have a narrow view, because the disease may affect people in many areas of industry.</p>
	<p pid="c.305.1/2">The disease is a working class one, and the problem must be solved by a Labour Government. We are hoping that they will overturn the judges' decision. Our constituents want compensation for being exposed to damage that others were not subjected to. I would dearly love to spread some asbestos in the porridge of the Law Lords so that they understand what the disease does to people.</p>
	<p pid="c.305.1/3">As well as the moral objections to the Law Lords' decision, one of the most frequently encountered problems when pursuing a disease claim is identifying defendants and their insurers. For most victims, asbestos exposure occurred more than 25 years ago, and many of the companies that employed them have gone into liquidation and are no longer in business. A considerable amount of time is spent identifying defendants and carrying out searches and inquiries to locate their insurers. That is especially true in the construction industry because companies may be short-lived and periods of employment may be extremely brief. Someone diagnosed with asbestos-related pleural plaques now has no claim, so there is no obligation on any employer or insurer to respond to any claim. There is no possibility of recovering the cost of trying to locate employers and insurers if someone who was exposed to asbestos develops a compensatable condition.</p>
	<p pid="c.305.1/4">I am conscious that other hon. Members may want to make a contribution to the debate, and I would welcome that. I am extremely keen to hear what the Minister has to say about what we can do to restore people's confidence in the Labour Government and to obtain compensation. It is right to have this debate, and hon. Members are expressing the views of their constituents who are suffering, with their families, from the disease. The trade unions and lawyers are doing what they can to help victims and their families. It is now up to us, the politicians, to argue the case and, more importantly, to ensure that the Government listen. Our Prime Minister said on two occasions that he supports the campaign, and we will support him when he comes up with a solution for compensating the victims of this horrible disease who are suffering through no fault of their own.</p>

Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1386" name="Michael Clapham">the Member for Barnsley, West and Penistone (Mr. Clapham)</phrase> who, unfortunately, cannot be here today, we went out to consultation to see how we should best respond to the House of Lords judgment.</p>
	<p pid="c.307.1/2">We asked specific and complex questions. We asked how to raise awareness of pleural plaques so that people understand the issue and we can help to allay their concerns. We invited views on whether the House of Lords' judgment should be overturned, and it is clear from every hon. Member here what their response is. I will forcefully make their view known to the Secretary of State and my ministerial colleagues. We also asked about the merit of offering no financial support to people who are diagnosed with pleural plaques. We set out two possible ways of dealing with that.</p>
	<p pid="c.307.1/3">The issues are complex and it is important to set out the benefits and difficulties that arise in relation to all the possible options. The fact that we had so many responses&mdash;from individuals, the trade union movement and colleagues&mdash;shows just how important the issue is to people. In the final part of the consultation, we wanted to ensure that whatever our decision, we made it with the best possible medical evidence available to us. We have therefore asked the chief medical officer and the Industrial Injuries Advisory Council to respond and tell us what they think the best way forward is.</p>
	<p pid="c.307.1/4">As I said, we received a total of 224 responses to the consultation. I do not know whether my hon. Friends are aware that 125 of those were from individuals who suffer from pleural plaques. In a sense, that underlines the passion and commitment that my hon. Friends have put into their contributions. Of course, we have also received responses from the legal profession and, not surprisingly&mdash;as my right hon. Friend the Member for Leeds, West will know&mdash;we received responses from the insurance industry, as well as from employers, business organisations, trade unions and asbestos victims.</p>

	<p pid="c.308.0/1">It is no surprise that the insurance companies responded because when the ruling was given 13 months ago, Deloitte Touche said that the insurance companies stood to make &pound;1.4 billion if the ruling was not changed. That is one reason why we are having this debate. The issue is not about money; it is a moral case about people who are dying. In the 13 months since the matter was put on hold, lots of people will have died without receiving compensation, and that should not have happened.</p>

I say that because I am aware that a chap who has pleural plaques and is originally from the Rochdale area has moved into my constituency. The last thing that he wants is to be caught up in a wrangle between English and Scots law, so it is important that the House determines a solution.</p>
