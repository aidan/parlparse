<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-01-25a.422.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1644" speakername="Celia Barlow" colnum="422"  time="009:31:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060125/halltext/60125h01.htm#60125h01_spnew8">
	<p pid="a.422.3/1">I agree that there are concerns, although I would not say that they are as desperate as my hon. Friend suggests. In the present climate, however, every rail and underground safety issue is of desperate interest.</p>
	<p pid="a.422.3/2">Perhaps it would be useful at this point to remind ourselves of the history of the debate. The Fire Precautions (Sub-surface Railway Stations) Regulations 1989, to which I shall simply refer as &quot;the regulations&quot; for the purposes of this debate, were introduced under section 12 of the Fire Precautions Act 1971. The regulations were added on the recommendation of the Fennell report into the 1987 King's Cross fire, which claimed 31 lives.</p>
	<p pid="a.422.3/3">I was on the BBC TV news desk that day, watching the terrible video rushes as they were fed in by satellite, and assessing the risks to camera crews and reporters at the scene. It is believed that the blaze began when a match was dropped through a wooden escalator&mdash;such escalators have, of course, now been banned&mdash;in a non-smoking area during the evening rush hour. An accumulation of grease and other debris under the tracks led to a fireball, which scorched up the escalator, trapping many people underground. Years later, one survivor, who ran from the upper concourse, said:</p>
	<p pid="a.422.3/4" class="indent">&quot;If Hell existed it was on display that night.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.422.3/5">Following the fire, the Fennell report called for changes, including minimum staffing standards and means of detecting, warning of and fighting fires. It also called for standards of fire-resistant construction, training and other precautions. There was a scandal in 1991, when a report found that only eight of the 26 safety recommendations made after the inquiry had been fully implemented. They were later complied with and provided a cushion of safety around staff, firefighters and customers.</p>
	<p pid="a.422.3/6">It is important to remember that the regulations apply not only to London underground stations, but to sub-surface stations throughout Britain, including underground systems in Tyne and Wear and several national rail stations with sub-surface stations, such as New Street station in Birmingham.</p>
	<p pid="a.422.3/7">The regulations were introduced to help to prevent a repeat of the terrible events at King's Cross, and I think that all hon. Members would agree that they have stood the test of time. They set down essential minimum statutory requirements for safety, covering issues such as means of escape, means of fighting fire, means of detection and giving warning, fire-resistant construction, instruction and training, and the keeping of records. Additional precautions covered in the regulations include practicable steps to prevent smoking and minimum staffing requirements, which are almost invariably exceeded in the railway network.</p>
	<p pid="a.422.3/8">No one doubts the Minister's strong commitment to fire safety. I hope that he will agree that the Government must not replace the current regulations lightly, and that they should do so only if they can guarantee at least the same statutory&mdash;I stress, statutory&mdash;level of safety for the public, rail staff and emergency services. As I understand it&mdash;he will correct me if I am wrong&mdash;the Government's view is that the current regulations and the protection that they provide will be adequately replaced by the provisions of the Regulatory Reform (Fire Safety) Order 2005, associated guidance, and the proposed Railways and Other Guided Transport Systems (Safety) Regulations. For the purposes of this debate and for my hon. Friends' sake, I shall refer to the legislation simply as &quot;the order&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.422.3/9">When the order comes into force, it will cover general fire precautions in different categories of workplace and public place and abolish the use of fire certificates. It will signal a move to a risk assessment-based approach to fire safety&mdash;that is one of the key issues. In addition, a series of guides will be produced to assist those preparing risk assessments. Although my hon. Friends, the trade unions and I do not necessarily have difficulty with the principles of the order, we are concerned about the proposition that it will remove the regulations for sub-surface stations. That is a really important point. We feel that sub-surface rail stations are a special case and require an assured minimum standard of protection, which cannot be afforded by risk assessment and guidance alone.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-01-25a.427.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1628" speakername="Andrew Dismore" colnum="427"  time="009:49:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060125/halltext/60125h01.htm#60125h01_spnew15">
	<p pid="a.427.1/1">My hon. Friend makes an important point. The difficulty with guidance notes is that they are not legally enforceable. They do not even have the force of a code of practice, which would be rather more useful than mere guidance notes. I have nothing particular against safety assessments, but they should go hand in hand with the underpinning of the detailed regulations that we are debating. It is not either/or; let us have both. I am concerned that there will be a watering down.</p>
	<p pid="a.427.1/2">There have been many improvements on the tube since the King's Cross fire. The fact that we now have steel escalators rather than the old wooden ones that caught fire is the most visible and obvious example, which everyone can see. However many other underpinnings are important. The tube is used so much; there are, on average, 3 million passengers a day&mdash;far more than at the time of the King's Cross fire&mdash;and use is growing. That puts greater pressure on the underground system and staff and means that there are greater safety risks.</p>
	<p pid="a.427.1/3">A key element of the Fennell report was his criticism of the fragmentation of the management, which was then operating under one company, London Underground Ltd. He also criticised the inability of the management to communicate within itself and the lack of clear lines of responsibility. Through the public-private partnership, of which I was not a great advocate&mdash;although I recognise that it is bringing investment to the tube&mdash;there is fragmentation within London Underground. Although residual responsibilities lie ultimately, I suppose, with the Mayor of London, several companies are now involved.</p>
	<p pid="a.427.1/4">For the Northern line, the infrastructure company responsible for the track, tunnels and signalling is Tube Lines; a separate company, Alstom, runs the train maintenance contract; and London Underground has overarching responsibilities. That fragmentation has the potential to create the sort of gaps that the Fennell inquiry identified, and the situation could be made worse if the proposed safety regime is introduced.</p>
	<p pid="a.427.1/5">We must be sure that there is seamless management of safety. The recent problems on the Northern line in particular with the failure of brake systems that was identified in autumn, are an example of where such gaps arise&mdash;obviously not in the context of fire, but with train maintenance. That highlights some of the potential problems with gaps. It is a case not of &quot;Mind the gap between the platform and the train&quot;, but of mind the gap within the management. That is one of the key criticisms in the Fennell report, and it is not answered by the proposals.</p>
	<p pid="a.427.1/6">There was also some criticism of the lack of record-keeping. My hon. Friend the Member for Hove identified that as a problem when she so ably opened the debate. We must recognise that one product of the PPP is the huge investment that there will be in the underground to modernise tracks, signalling and stations. Huge, large-scale engineering works will affect the network for years to come. They are welcome and long overdue, but engineering works are hazardous and might give rise to fire risks. That is an inevitable consequence of major engineering works, but, in those circumstances, now is not the time to start downgrading fire protection.</p>
	<p pid="a.427.1/7">Those engineering works are necessary because of the long-term neglect of the underground over many years and successive Governments. Until those works are complete, the underground will remain subject to various safety risks or problems, such as the problem with the signalling system that was identified at Camden Town last year. Therefore, until the underground is running properly and modernised, and until we deal with some of the core management problems, we should not start messing around with safety regulations.</p>
	<p pid="a.427.1/8">I end my remarks by reminding people of what happened on <phrase class="date" code="2006-07-07">7 July</phrase> and the work that the emergency services did then. Their ability to function through the correct levels of staffing, skill and co-ordination enabled them to deal so effectively with the consequences of that day. The Metropolitan Police Commissioner warned us of the inevitability of further terrorist attacks; we must be prepared for the risk of further attacks on the underground. In those circumstances, I ask my hon. Friend the Minister to think again.</p>
	<p pid="a.427.1/9">Would my hon. Friend the Minister like to be responsible were there to be another terrorist attack and the London underground system was not able to cope because of the effect of the changes that he is proposing? I ask the Government to postpone their move to bring in the new arrangements, at least until the modernisation works to the tube are completed. We can then review safety in the round with a new modernised tube until we have seen some progress towards dealing with the appalling terrorist threat that bedevils our country in general, and our capital city in particular, which is served so well by our transport workers.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-01-25a.429.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1624" speakername="John McDonnell" colnum="429"  time="010:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060125/halltext/60125h01.htm#60125h01_spnew16">
	<p pid="a.429.0/1">Let me declare an interest as the chair of the National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers parliamentary group and the secretary of the Fire Brigades Union parliamentary group, as noted in the Register of Members' Interests. I also congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1644" name="Celia Barlow">the Member for Hove (Ms Barlow)</phrase> not only on securing the debate, but on her superb detailed exposition of the argument. I shall not go over the ground that she covered, but I just want to make a few comments.</p>
	<p pid="a.429.0/2">As has been explained by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1628" name="Andrew Dismore">the Member for Hendon (Mr. Dismore)</phrase>, we all bring to the debate our personal experiences as does the Minister. In my earlier career, I was chief executive of the then Association of London Authorities and on the evening of the King's Cross fire I had a meeting at Camden town hall. Instead of travelling by tube as I usually would do to King's Cross, alighting and going to the town hall, I walked and missed the fire. I would have been on the train at the time. I was attending the social services committee at Camden town hall and that night we had to suspend the committee to enable officers and members to prepare emergency morgues for the bodies coming from King's Cross.</p>
	<p pid="a.429.0/3">The debate is of personal concern to several hon. Members, especially those who represent London constituencies and had any experience of the King's Cross tragedy. That concern has now been replicated on several occasions by accidents on the tube, of which Chancery Lane is an example. We come to the debate as a result of the King's Cross fire on the basis of a strict precautionary principle; that we do not do anything that undermines or may undermine the safety of the travelling public; that we will not take any measure that may enhance the risk and that we will do everything we possibly can to reduce the risk.</p>
	<p pid="a.429.0/4">The Fennell inquiry was a model of an inquiry. It took evidence in detail from front-line workers. It arrived at several conclusions, which, on a consensual basis, were accepted by those on all sides of industry; management, front-line workers on the London underground, firefighters and the Fire Brigades Union. On the basis of a precautionary principle and the combined consensual wisdom of the various authorities at the time, the inquiry behoves the Government to have a strong justification for moving forward or moving away from the Fennell recommendations.</p>
	<p pid="a.429.0/5">Many arguments have been advanced this morning, but when the proposals were brought forward, they were reviewed by the Regulatory Reform Committee. Although I was not a member of that Committee, I spoke at the meeting. It is important to remind ourselves that a Select Committee said to the Government at the time&mdash;clearly it did not endorse the introduction of the order&mdash;that</p>
	<p pid="a.429.0/6" class="indent">&quot;On the evidence presently before us, we are not convinced that the provisions will be adequately carried forward under the general provisions of the draft Order . . . We consider that the provisions . . . should remain in force.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.429.0/7">The Minister responded by saying,</p>
	<p pid="a.429.0/8" class="indent">&quot;Having considered the Committee reports, together with other representations received . . . we do accept that there is a need not only for this protection to continue but also that it can be clearly seen to be continued.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.429.0/9">The Committee expressed its worries about any change and the Minister responded accordingly. At the time, I thought that we would have a more fundamental review of the order itself. Instead, all we have experienced is delay and the order's reintroduction with virtually no amendment to the original proposals. The debate is taking place today on that basis.</p>
	<p pid="a.429.0/10">There is confusion about the Government's real intentions. As a result of the delays, some consultation has commenced on guidance but, as has already been said, it will have no legal basis or any firm use whereby it can be used to secure safety on the London underground. Instead of having more detailed consultation of the order and considering a fundamental amendment, all we have had is limited consultation on the guidance. That goes against the spirit of what the Regulatory Reform Committee was arguing for at the time.</p>
	<p pid="a.429.0/11">The Committee had firm views. At paragraph 126 of its report, it said:</p>
	<p pid="a.429.0/12" class="indent">&quot;In our view the Department has not yet made a convincing case for the revocation&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.429.0/13">of the existing regulations.</p>
	<p pid="a.429.0/14">Since then, the Government have not put forward a subsequent case. They have certainly not reported back to the Regulatory Reform Committee with a case that could change the Committee's mind. The first step that the Government should have undertaken&mdash;it is not too late to undertake it now&mdash;is to have gone back first to the Regulatory Reform Committee to see whether it could be convinced of the need for change. The Committee set out its arguments as to why the order should not go ahead in one of the strongest reports that it has produced. Such matters should be considered by the Government and there should be a proper debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.429.0/15">As my hon. Friends the Members for Hove and for Hendon have said, time has moved on in respect of the practices of the London underground. More than 700 million people use the underground each year. There has been a 20 per cent. increase in passenger traffic. Management systems are now dramatically different; even within the past two years because of the fragmentation of London Underground's management. The proposals need to be reviewed in the light of the day-to-day practices of the London underground now as against two years ago. As my hon. Friend the Member for Hove said, the Government should go back to all the stakeholders about the detail of the order, not only the guidance.</p>
	<p pid="a.429.0/16">People are becoming confused by the different orders that have been issued. The latest statement made by the Government on <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-12">12 January</phrase> advised us that they had put back the date of the implementation of the order. I believe that there is an attempt to coincide that with regulations in Scotland, too. We are told that the change is to allow businesses and fire safety experts more time to get ready for the new regulations, not to consult on the detail of them or to secure amendments to them. We are now in a state of absolute confusion about when the regulations will come into effect.</p>
	<p pid="a.429.0/17">A carry-over period between six and 12 months when both systems will run in tandem will cause even greater confusion. As my hon. Friend the Member for Hove said, it will hardly be a realistic trial of the new order because companies will fail to act on it and will put off any changes until the 12 months are over to avoid the onus being placed on increased investment or any change of practice design under the new system.</p>
	<p pid="a.429.0/18">The Government need to give us clarity on where we are going. What is the status of the order? What is the time scale for its introduction? What consultations will take place? In the light of discussions that have taken place so far, we need to step back again and have a more fundamental consultation with the stakeholders. We need to go back to the Regulatory Reform Committee and discuss matters to see whether it would be satisfied with any new proposals coming forward after that consultation. In addition, we must recognise that things have moved on within the industry.</p>
	<p pid="a.429.0/19">My hon. Friend the Member for Hendon mentioned the fact that, as a result of the Government's significant investment via the public-private partnership&mdash;although some of the investment has been diverted&mdash;we are now seeing major infrastructure projects on the system. I am not talking about the result of the PPP, as that is a waste of resources. Is now the time to confuse matters with the establishment of new orders, new systems and new regulatory principles in such a sensitive part of the system itself?</p>
	<p pid="a.429.0/20">This is a special case. My hon. Friend the Member for Hove has it exactly right. As experts will tell us, underground fires and underground risks are so much more difficult and hazardous than they are on the surface, purely because of access and other arrangements. That is a key lesson of Fennell. If the access arrangements and the problems of underground working will be made worse as a result of the current significant investment and works, the last thing that we will want to do is to interfere with existing practices that have served us well over the past 20 years or so.</p>
	<p pid="a.429.0/21">The Government have delayed again, so it is not too late to think again, to put the matter out to consultation again, to take on board the expert advice or to take into account changes. I dread us introducing such measures as a result of what is almost a stubborn belligerence about not taking other views into account. Sometimes there is almost a sense of bloody-mindedness, and a sense that Governments will not change their mind once the wheels of Government mechanisms start in motion. I just thank God for the Regulatory Reform Committee, which halted that process over a year ago.</p>
	<p pid="a.429.0/22">I hope that this debate will contribute towards our telling the Government that just because an element of momentum has built up around the order, they do not inevitably have to proceed to make a mistake that we will live to regret, and that some people may not live to regret. The key element is consultation and involvement.</p>
	<p pid="a.429.0/23">The process involves a step change; there is a change in the onus of responsibility. At the moment, it is clear in law where responsibility lies; we rely on those providing the service to ensure that they meet the regulation requirements. The proposal will mean that the onus shifts to the fire authorities, who will have to prove that the providers are not meeting the requirements. That is a significant principle change and, in practice, will be a dramatic change to what went before. It would undermine the practices of the fire authorities, which will have to cope in that way. In addition, it would undermine the confidence of the travelling public and those who work on the system.</p>
	<p pid="a.429.0/24">There is an element of trust involved in this issue, too. Why are the Government making the proposals at this point in time, and what pressures are on the Government to move in this way? What reason is there for the haste with which the Government tried to introduce the regulations previously, with, we believe, inadequate consultation? I am at a loss to see why that change in principle needs to take place at this moment.</p>
	<p pid="a.429.0/25">Finally, I ask the Minister to clarify where we are and where we are going. More importantly, I appeal to the Government to step back from this hazardous measure, which will put lives at risk and undermine the confidence of the travelling public.</p>

Member for Hove (Ms Barlow)</phrase> on securing the debate and thank <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1628" name="Andrew Dismore">the hon. Member for Hendon (Mr. Dismore)</phrase> for rightly reminding us of the appalling tragedy of the King's Cross fire.</p>
	<p pid="a.432.0/2">I am pleased that the hon. Member for Hove made clear the wider relevance of this debate; I am one of many Members from the Greater Manchester and north-west area who have pressed for an extension to the Metrolink system. As a regular rail user myself, I share concerns about fire safety issues on the railway network.</p>
	<p pid="a.432.0/3">As others have said, I shall be interested to hear the Minister's views on whether the delay, announced a couple of weeks ago, in implementing the Regulatory Reform (Fire Safety) Order 2005 means that the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister will reconsider what many think is at best a discretionary approach to, and at worse a relaxation of, regulations on the facilities concerned. Of course, the proposals come at a time when Members do not need reminding of possible threats in the places concerned.</p>
	<p pid="a.432.0/4">The regulations made under section 12 of the Fire Precautions Act 1971, which were inspired by the Fennell report, have been a key part of safety on the underground for a number of years, so I would appreciate any assurances that can be given today on those regulations, and indeed on the wider issue of fire safety on the underground and on subterranean railway stations. Also, can we assume from the delay that the Government are in the mood to compromise on the wider issue of fire safety regulations? Will the Minister tell us this morning whether that mood extends to the specific regulations to which I, and others, have referred?</p>
	<p pid="a.432.0/5">On the new fire safety order, I wholeheartedly agree with the Minister's statement of <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-12">12 January</phrase> that we should not seek to impose new regulations on stakeholders without giving them the necessary time to implement them, so I suppose that the announcement is to be welcomed. However, I should be grateful if Minister told us why the guidance documents are apparently not yet available.</p>
	<p pid="a.432.0/6">As I said, I did not intend to make a long contribution. It is obvious that I am not alone in seeking assurances not just on the future of fire safety on the underground, but on the future of the wider regulations.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-01-25a.433.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1764" speakername="Robert Syms" colnum="433"  time="010:15:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060125/halltext/60125h01.htm#60125h01_spnew18">
	<p pid="a.433.0/1">I, too, congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1644" name="Celia Barlow">the hon. Member for Hove (Ms Barlow)</phrase> on securing this debate, which is a useful opportunity to air a number of issues and concerns felt by hon. Members. We have had a short but good debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.433.0/2">It is important that we get this matter right. On occasions, I felt that I was more in sympathy with the Minister than some of his own Back-Benchers were; I do not get the impression that the Government are rushing the proposal. They have put the decision off and they seem to be consulting. We do not know exactly what the final package will be, but it seems to me that they have taken a very sensible approach to complex regulations.</p>
	<p pid="a.433.0/3">Broadly speaking, Her Majesty's Opposition support the review of fire safety regulations. Moving a system to risk assessment is sensible. Clearly, one has to look at the guidance, and some sensible points were made about the force of that guidance in determining how successful the system will be when implemented. Earlier, the matter of the accreditation of inspectors was raised, and that, too, was a sensible point.</p>
	<p pid="a.433.0/4">I know that the private sector, in particular, has raised the issue of cost. There have been some concerns on that point, so we have to keep an eye on whether there is to be a transfer of resources. The difficulty with such regulations, particularly on subjects such as fire, is that things can be very much set in stone, and there can always be arguments for no change. There is an argument for change, but it is a question of getting it right. This is a useful opportunity for the Minister to stand up and give some assurances.</p>
	<p pid="a.433.0/5">I noticed earlier in the week that the Government have announced further fire prevention grants, another &pound;11.4 million. Under the Housing Act 1996, we dealt with houses in multiple occupation and aspects of their rating to do with fire. Quite a lot has been happening across the piece in terms of fire prevention and fire reform.</p>
	<p pid="a.433.0/6">I listened carefully to what <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1628" name="Andrew Dismore">the hon. Member for Hendon (Mr. Dismore)</phrase> said and was interested to hear his comments about the King's Cross disaster. Clearly, if one had to encapsulate the matter and say which one area gave concern, it would be sub-surface regulations. I hope that the Minister can give reassurances on that subject today. When the hon. Gentleman was a young, thrusting, campaigning lawyer, I was perhaps not quite so young, but I was certainly on Wiltshire county council's public protection committee, which dealt with the fire brigade. Our concern, post-King's Cross, was that there were major underground workings underneath Corsham and Box in Wiltshire, where the Ministry of Defence has major stores. Although the principal people dealing with the fire would have been the MOD fire service, the Wiltshire fire brigade would have been asked to support it. The key problem that the chief fire officer found was the issue of command and control underground, because radio equipment does not work as effectively there. So there are certainly special issues to do with sub-surface working and disasters; I hope that the Minister can give some reassurances on that subject.</p>
	<p pid="a.433.0/7"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1624" name="John McDonnell">The hon. Member for Hayes and Harlington (John McDonnell)</phrase> asked some very challenging questions, in his customary way. He pointed out the Regulatory Reform Committee's concerns about that aspect of the regulations. I hope that, at the end of the debate, we will have a little bit more sketched in about Government proposals on this subject.</p>
	<p pid="a.433.0/8">We need to know a little more about the time scale&mdash;that is one issue that has come out today&mdash;and when the order will be implemented. We have already heard that both systems will run in tandem. What will be the cost of that? One hon. Member asked whether it would be fair to run the new system with the old regulations still, effectively, in force. We need to hear a little bit more about time scales. Certainly, if the private sector and public corporations are going to have to take on a larger role, it is right and proper that we should at least give them a reasonable warning and a reasonable opportunity to adjust their working practices to carry out the new regulations. The key issue, which was raised by the hon. Member for Hendon, is management&mdash;including line management and joined-up management&mdash;particularly when it comes to major organisations, such as the tube.</p>
	<p pid="a.433.0/9">We need a somewhat clearer view than we have had from the Government over recent weeks. I hope that the Minister is able to reassure us today about the time scale and the sub-surface regulations, about which there is general concern and that he will, perhaps, say a little bit more about the guidance, and the force of the guidance, and how it will effectively underpin the new system that the Government wish to implement.</p>

	<p pid="a.435.3/1">I will certainly try to do so in my comments.</p>
	<p pid="a.435.3/2">We agreed with the Committees involved and made a statement on bringing the Regulatory Reform (Fire Safety) Order 2005 before the House for scrutiny the second time:</p>
	<p pid="a.435.3/3" class="indent">&quot;However, to ensure public certainty and confidence, the Department accepts the view expressed by both Committees that if the highly prescriptive 1989 regulations are to be revoked then substantive guidance must be in place so that the protection can clearly seen to be maintained. Consequently, the regulations will be retained on a temporary basis and only removed once guidance has been produced in consultation with all parties. We have therefore removed reference to the regulations from Schedule 5.&quot;</p>

	<p pid="a.448.0/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1562" name="John Cummings">the Member for Easington (John Cummings)</phrase> on securing this debate on the future of Easington PCT. I also express my thanks, as well as those of my right hon. and hon. Friends at the Department of Health, for his counsel and advice since we were appointed last May. He has ensured that Easington's voice has been heard at the highest levels in the debates over the reforms that we have made.</p>
	<p pid="a.448.0/2">The level of investment in the NHS is rising rapidly, as my hon. Friend said, from &pound;33 billion in 1997&ndash;98 to more than &pound;92 billion in 2007&ndash;08. That increased investment, along with the hard work of 1.3 million NHS staff, is transforming our hospitals, reducing waiting lists and lowering mortality rates for some of the diseases that afflict my hon. Friend's constituents.</p>
	<p pid="a.448.0/3">There can be no resting on our laurels, however. Over the weeks to come we shall be explaining how the next phase of health reform needs to take the health service forward. The vast majority of patient contact with the NHS&mdash;90 per cent.&mdash;takes places in a primary care setting. Having spent seven years reducing waiting lists to record lows, we now face the challenge of strengthening primary and community services as well. We need to meet the needs of patients with long-term conditions far better, which my hon. Friend will welcome because it is such a priority in his constituency. There are still too many people waiting far too long for treatment.</p>

Does he also agree that one reason why we did not spot the problem before is because as parliamentarians, we were misled by the management? In other words, to compound the developing financial crisis, there was also a cover-up; a cover-up that has now been terminated by the much more effective and transparent management who have taken over the trust's operations, and for whom I am very thankful.</p>

	<p pid="a.456.2/1">I agree completely with the hon. Gentleman. In fact, I should go further; as I said at the outset, the crisis in Shropshire is indicative of a general malaise that is affecting the entire NHS. We have seen reports of deficits of &pound;620 million anticipated for the current year; a figure that the Department of Health acknowledges. The most recent figure I saw was from the Royal College of Nursing, which estimates the deficits at &pound;1.2 billion, a sum that will escalate in the future. The issue will have resonance well beyond this Chamber and our constituencies.</p>
	<p pid="a.456.2/2">I want to concentrate on what some of the cost-cutting choices would mean to my constituents. I will touch briefly on each of the three community hospitals that I know well. Bridgnorth hospital serves the south-east of Shropshire. It has 25 beds and four theatre beds and employs 110 people. Last year, 700 in-patients, 11,000 out-patients and 13,500 minor injuries were treated at Bridgnorth hospital. After many years of hard-fought campaigning, Shropshire county primary care trust last year started a flagship redevelopment of the hospital to bring all health care services in the area on to a single site. That is very welcome in the community.</p>
	<p pid="a.456.2/3">Construction is mid-way through on this &pound;6.5 million project. Ironically, it is celebrated by an enormous sign on the hospital wall that proudly proclaims:</p>
	<p pid="a.456.2/4" class="indent">&quot;Department of Health: Building for the Future&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.456.2/5">Underneath, it says:</p>
	<p pid="a.456.2/6" class="indent">&quot;Bridgnorth Hospital Redevelopment, Investing for Improvements to Buildings and Standards&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.456.2/7">There are uncomfortable parallels with what happened in Kidderminster immediately after a substantial capital investment under this Government's stewardship. According to the management consultants, closure of the hospital would &quot;save&quot; a mere &pound;600,000 a year. The hospital in Telford is nearly 20 miles from Bridgnorth, which has a population of 11,891. Last week, the petition that I have referred to was signed by 11,871 residents, who objected in the strongest possible terms to the closure of Bridgnorth hospital or a cut in services there.</p>
	<p pid="a.456.2/8">The community hospital in Ludlow serves most of the district of South Shropshire. It has 72 beds and treats 810 in-patients annually, including those in the mental health ward and the maternity unit. The maternity unit is housed in a building that was originally the town's workhouse. It may even be one of those places often cited, although not by name, by the Secretary of State to justify the modernisation programme. Last year, the hospital treated 11,000 out-patients, including X-ray and physiotherapy patients. Doctors and other health professionals in the town and the surrounding area would like to see services at the hospital maximised to consolidate their activities on the site, as is happening in Bridgnorth. Instead, it is threatened with closure because that would save &pound;1 million, according to the same management consultants' report.</p>
	<p pid="a.456.2/9">The hospital is one of the largest employers in the town, with some 150 jobs at stake. The Royal Shrewsbury hospital is 25 miles from Ludlow, up a busy and dangerous road. According to the 2001 census, Ludlow has a population of 9,250. Last week, I presented a petition signed by 10,220 residents who were protesting at the threatened closure of Ludlow hospital or a cut in services there. Perhaps some people signed twice, such is their anger. I could hardly blame them.</p>
	<p pid="a.456.2/10">The community hospital at Bishop's Castle serves the south-west of my constituency and the area across the Welsh border. No savings have been assumed in the management consultants' report since Shropshire county primary care trust has advanced plans to close the hospital anyway, to offer its site to the neighbouring residential home operator and to commission nursing home beds, under the supervision of local doctors, from a redevelopment of the enlarged site. This time last year, there were 24 beds in Bishops Castle hospital; today only 18 are being commissioned. The threat posed by the review is that the number of beds will be reduced further, with the loss of up to 35 skilled staff. I am concerned to ensure that this proposal does not fall victim to the same cost-cutting mantra afflicting other services in the county. I will seek reassurance that the number of PCT-commissioned beds will not fall further and that the contract offered will be a genuine, long-term one so that rehabilitation beds with proper nursing care under doctors' supervision are maintained in Bishop's Castle in the long term.</p>
	<p pid="a.456.2/11">The precedents are not encouraging. The old cottage hospitals in Broseley and Much Wenlock&mdash;both in my constituency&mdash;were turned into residential care homes some years ago. Each retained PCT-commissioned beds, but the number of beds the PCT committed to fund has gradually been whittled away over the years so that all remaining beds are once more threatened with termination, at the end of the financial year.</p>
	<p pid="a.456.2/12">The so-called saving that will come from the closure of the three community hospitals amounts to &pound;1.6 million. In my view, that is not a saving, but a mirage. It is a short-term quick fix with much longer-term and higher cost implications. It completely ignores the cost to the community of having to travel miles to visit their loved ones or an outpatient clinic; these are just some of the challenges posed by distance and rurality to health care outcomes. I have received many letters from constituents detailing the problems that closure of the hospitals would pose to asthmatics, diabetics, pregnant mums and the mentally ill, to mention a few.</p>
	<p pid="a.456.2/13">People who live in those communities will still get ill, unfortunately. If community hospitals are closed, the acute hospitals will come under intense pressure. Admissions will rise and discharges will slow because the vital rehabilitation role of the community hospitals will have gone. That will reduce productivity in acute hospitals at a time when management consultants require significant improvements in productivity. The acute hospitals do not have the capacity to cope, especially not in winter. They are already operating at above optimal occupancy rates. I have hard evidence of that in an e-mail, dated <phrase class="date" code="2005-12-19">19 December 2005</phrase>, from a senior manager at the acute trust:</p>
	<p pid="a.456.2/14" class="indent">&quot;Shrewsbury and Telford Hospital NHS Trust are under acute pressure from emergency admissions and in the night were on the verge of declaring a major incident. I should be grateful therefore if you would consider all possible options before taking the decision to refer a patient for admission. The options will vary in the different areas and as the community hospitals will be endeavouring to accept as many transfers as possible from the Royal Shrewsbury hospital and Princess Royal hospital it would be preferable if you would consider intermediate care and rapid response as a first line although these services also have a limit on how many patients they can care for at any one time.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.456.2/15">This e-mail was sent to all GPs in Shropshire.</p>
	<p pid="a.456.2/16">On <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-05">5 January</phrase>, the same manager appealed to GPs throughout Shropshire to suspend the referral of patients, saying that the trust</p>
	<p pid="a.456.2/17" class="indent">&quot;are experiencing acute post Christmas break pressures and are currently operating at Level 4 of their Escalation Plan and will therefore potentially be declaring a Major Incident. Please could you once again consider the potential for re-routing patients.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.456.2/18">Last week, a district councillor in Ludlow had evidence of acute hospitals begging to offload patients into the community hospital because they could not cope. The Shropshire ambulance service wrote to me to voice its concern about closure.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-01-25a.459.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1696" speakername="Philip Dunne" colnum="459"  time="014:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060125/halltext/60125h03.htm#60125h03_spnew14">
	<p pid="a.459.1/1">My hon. Friend makes a characteristically strong point. I posed the same question to the author of that report, and I was assured that it was an estimate of a net saving. However, as I shall go on to say, there are many other ramifications for the acute trusts&mdash;including additional costs for the ambulance service&mdash;of having to cope with the extra bed-blocking and so on that would arise. The estimate is clearly based on very flimsy data; I shall return to that point presently.</p>
	<p pid="a.459.1/2">The ambulance service is very concerned about the closure of community hospitals, because closure will place it under additional pressures. A letter to me from the ambulance service says that closure:</p>
	<p pid="a.459.1/3" class="indent">&quot;may produce an increase in demand and as Shropshire ambulance service resource configuration is finely balanced and matched to available resources, i.e. Acute Trust and Community Hospital facilities, this potential increase in demand may require additional funding&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.459.1/4">These factors that are not taken into account in the Finnamore report.</p>
	<p pid="a.459.1/5">Personally, I believe that the costs of patient stays at community hospitals are less than at acute hospitals. When I sought a breakdown of costs for Shropshire hospitals in order to prove that point, I received the following reply last week in the name of the Minister, which I hope that she will not mind my repeating:</p>
	<p pid="a.459.1/6" class="indent">&quot;There is no data collected centrally at individual patient per bed level. Data is collected on a finished consultant episode basis and at National Health Service trust level, within which one or more hospitals will operate.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.459.1/7">The fact that those data cannot be given does not inspire confidence that such critical decisions for our community hospitals are made on the basis of proper information.</p>
	<p pid="a.459.1/8">Our community hospitals are vital to deliver key Government health care priorities. In urban areas, care in the community may work without hospitals, but rural Shropshire does not have the pool of nursing talent that is needed to deliver such care. The community hospitals provide a hub around which community nursing services can be delivered. The management consultants' report seeks to reduce the cost of the district nursing skill mix within the Shropshire county primary care trust to the same skill-mix cost as Telford district nurses, who provide what is essentially an urban service. That entirely ignores the extra time and cost involved in serving a widespread rural area. Moreover, the current hiring freeze in Shropshire raises a host of questions about how the services will be provided in the coming years without trained nursing staff coming through the system.</p>
	<p pid="a.459.1/9">The review has other implications, and I do not have time to go in detail into them all. However, I shall just mention the impact on mental health services in the county. Shropshire performs very well in financial terms. Its mental health team operates without deficit at substantially less than the national average cost of such provision; 21 per cent. less, in fact. That is partly because most beds are in Shelton hospital in Shrewsbury, which is one of the last two Victorian asylums left operating in England. Much work has gone into developing advanced plans to replace it with a modern facility, but all of that is now on hold, so Shropshire now looks set to have the unique distinction of operating the very last Victorian asylum in the country.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-01-25a.460.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1696" speakername="Philip Dunne" colnum="460"  time="014:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060125/halltext/60125h03.htm#60125h03_spnew16">
	<p pid="a.460.1/1">The hon. Gentleman anticipates what I am going to say. It is absolutely true that the families of these most vulnerable people are those who will suffer from having to travel such long distances.</p>
	<p pid="a.460.1/2">That has not stopped health chiefs insisting on finding savings of between &pound;1.2 million and &pound;2.2. million from next year's mental health budget, despite current efficiency. There are advanced plans for closure of the two remaining mental health wards, both at Ludlow and Whitchurch hospitals, placing further pressure on their viability, and presenting the families of existing patients and staff with enormous stress, not to mention the patients themselves, who, as the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire was saying, are some of the most vulnerable people in our community. In my recent survey of the GPs in my constituency, 87 per cent. regarded closure of mental health wards in our community hospitals as short-sighted, given the ageing demographics that apply particularly to Shropshire.</p>
	<p pid="a.460.1/3">So what can be done? To try to adopt a slightly more positive note for the Minister, I shall set out three areas in which she could help local health chiefs in making such critical decisions. The first would be to acknowledge that the historic debts are a Government responsibility. Returning those debts to the NHS would clearly be the first choice, but a second best would be to provide a substantially longer period for their repayment. A 10-year repayment term would reduce the annual cuts by &pound;8 million.</p>
	<p pid="a.460.1/4">The second way in which savings could be made without compromising the community hospitals is through prescription charges. I have discussed this with several doctors in my constituency. The recommendation in the management consultant's report gives rise to hope that significant savings could be made from reducing prescription charges, and many of the doctors believe that that could be achieved over time at no cost to health care quality and at relatively little cost to the community. Those savings would dwarf the notional savings from closing community hospitals.</p>
	<p pid="a.460.1/5">Thirdly, I draw to the Minister's attention the fact that there is no mention of administrative savings in the management consultant's report. Given that the current reconfiguration consultations are under way for both the strategic health authority and primary care trusts in Shropshire, surely any review of health care spending in the county should take account of what savings can be made from those administrative reconfigurations before cuts in patient services are actioned.</p>
	<p pid="a.460.1/6">I appreciate that I have been given a great deal of time, although there have been some interruptions. I conclude my remarks by saying that the Minister will doubtless give us in her winding-up speech a litany of how much has been invested and how many more doctors and nurses are now working in Shropshire than in 1997. Well before she embarks on that journey, I must tell her that the people of Shropshire will not wear it, especially when they see savage cuts in services or, God forbid, hospital closures.</p>
	<p pid="a.460.1/7">The Prime Minister, we are led to believe, is looking to his legacy. In Shropshire, he risks being remembered as the axe man who has closed community hospitals, slashed hospital beds and cut off rural communities from local access to health care. I look to the Minister to ride to his rescue, and to offer my constituents and the people of Shropshire concrete evidence that the NHS is indeed safe in his hands.</p>
	<p pid="a.460.1/8">In closing, I have a simple question for the Minister, to which I, and I suspect the many people in Shropshire who are listening to the debate, would be grateful for an answer in her closing remarks; will she instruct the strategic health authority to rule out the closures of Bridgnorth and Ludlow community hospitals as options for formal consultation? If she did so, she would make many thousands of people in Shropshire sleep easier tonight, and she would absolve the Prime Minister of blame for his legacy to Ludlow.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-01-25a.462.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1871" speakername="David Wright" colnum="462"  time="015:03:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060125/halltext/60125h03.htm#60125h03_spnew20">
	<p pid="a.462.1/1">Indeed, my apologies. I start by saying that I agree with the hon. Member for Ludlow that Shropshire has a unique rural structure, but it is also important to note that health care services were originally designed very much with that rural status in mind. There is a large hospital in Shrewsbury, as well as smaller community-based hospitals.</p>
	<p pid="a.462.1/2">The advent of Telford new town in the 1960s placed greater pressures on the health economy in Shropshire; that is just a fact. Telford is now the largest town in Shropshire, and several of its wards exhibit significant deprivation. The community in Telford fought extremely hard throughout the 70s and 80s to secure a district general hospital, and it very much wants to protect it and ensure that it provides comprehensive services for the largest population centre in the county. That throws up significant challenges; that, too, is just a fact.</p>
	<p pid="a.462.1/3">Because Telford is new and continues to grow, the challenge facing us is how to provide health services for a growing population. Telford is a regional housing growth point. According to the regional planning guidance and the local development framework, between 2001 and 2021 a net increase in housing provision of 20,300 dwellings is envisaged in the Telford and the Wrekin area. That is a significant number of new homes in the county, based in Telford. It is crucial that any design of services acknowledges that point. It is also fair to say, and I think I would get agreement throughout the House, that both Shrewsbury and Telford deserve full, district and general hospital services&mdash;the services that they have enjoyed for some years.</p>
	<p pid="a.462.1/4">In setting the scene for this debate, it is important that we remember that staff are working hard in our hospitals throughout Shropshire and in Telford and the Wrekin; they do an incredible job and I pay tribute to them today. It is important that we manage this debate carefully, so we can sustain their morale and ensure that they continue to provide high-quality services to people at the front line. They deserve our thanks and I am sure that colleagues will join me in passing those on today.</p>
	<p pid="a.462.1/5">It is also important to say that the two main acute hospitals are meeting six of the seven national targets laid down by the Government. They are meeting their access targets on in-patients and out-patients, 98 per cent. of people visiting accident and emergency are seen within four hours, and they are on-target in terms of beating MRSA. On cancer, they are meeting the 14, 31 and 62-day targets. They are following the Government's agenda on booking and they are signed up for &quot;Agenda for Change&quot;. The only area in which they failing is financial balance.</p>
	<p pid="a.462.1/6">The hon. Member for Ludlow outlined in some detail a story&mdash;it almost sounded like fiction&mdash;about the management, and the financial mismanagement, of the health economy in Shropshire in recent years. I am delighted that we have a new chief executive and management team. Tom Taylor is a dynamic individual with whom all Shropshire Members can do business. He takes a constructive approach to what is happening in the local health economy.</p>
	<p pid="a.462.1/7">It is important to consider some of the conclusions that the strategic review document has come up with. That document was produced on behalf of all the health trusts in the county. It concluded that the primary care trusts spend &pound;20 million less than the national average on general acute and accident and emergency services, and &pound;20 million more than the national average on community services and primary care. That is a real challenge. In examining the wider health economy, we must ensure both that primary care services and community based services are extremely efficient, and that our general acute and accident and emergency services are receiving the funding that they deserve. That is important in the context of the community hospitals debate, which the hon. Gentleman mentioned. I am concerned that if community hospitals close, we will not be able to deal with some of the bed-blocking problems that will arise in the acute sector. I hope we will not pursue that false economy.</p>
	<p pid="a.462.1/8">The other conclusions of the strategic review of the two acute hospitals are that they are low-cost providers per patient, above-average performers in terms of patient activity, and their commissioners are driving down acute sector income. Interestingly, however, the hospitalisation rate in the county is still rising. Too many people are coming into the acute hospitals and not being dealt with in the community. That is a real challenge for us in terms of primary care.</p>
	<p pid="a.462.1/9">It is also true to say that the two acute hospitals do not recover all the income for the work that they do. Under payment by results, our local hospitals would gain significantly, but we have a problem because we cannot wait for full implementation of payment by results. We have to sort out the financial issues as they are presented to us now.</p>
	<p pid="a.462.1/10">The hon. Member for Ludlow went through a series of options produced by Finnamore, the financial consultants, in relation to the health economy in Shropshire and in Telford and the Wrekin. The options referred to a range of issues, including reconfiguration, rationalisation of sites and referral management&mdash;there is a raft of proposals. Finnamore produced what it called an abacus of options between lower and upper quartile levels of savings from each of those options. We need to pursue those options, but we have to bear several points in mind. Patient services must come first. There must be a more open dialogue within the county about what is happening in the health service in Shropshire&mdash;clearly there has not been the openness with elected representatives, officials and the public that we deserve and that would help us to understand what is happening.</p>
	<p pid="a.462.1/11">The county must retain two district general hospitals with A and E services. I am delighted to say that, a week last Monday, at a meeting I attended with the Telford and Wrekin senior citizens forum, Tom Taylor, the chief executive of the acute hospital trust, made it clear that he is committed to trying to ensure that we retain those two hospitals with their A and E services. That is crucial. I should particularly like to hear the Minister's comments on that in her winding-up speech.</p>
	<p pid="a.462.1/12">In any examination of the county's health economy, it is important that there is an understanding of the population trends that I outlined at the beginning of my speech. Telford people should receive the services that they deserve because it is a growing town and the largest population centre in the county.</p>
	<p pid="a.462.1/13">We should focus on the points made by the hon. Member for Ludlow about options for resolving the financial crisis. I hope that the Minister will say something about historic debt, which we should reconsider. We must have greater brokerage on the time scale for the repayment of debt on which the acute hospital sector and, indeed, the PCT are working.</p>
	<p pid="a.462.1/14">The hon. Gentleman's point about prescription charges is also important. We must get the maximum level of efficiencies and administration savings out of the system if we are to protect our acute and community hospitals and our primary care services. All five of the Shropshire Members want to achieve that.</p>

	<p pid="a.464.1/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1696" name="Philip Dunne">the Member for Ludlow (Mr. Dunne)</phrase> on securing the debate. I shall have to make my 10-minute speech in four minutes.</p>
	<p pid="a.464.1/2">I shall address directly some of the comments made by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1871" name="David Wright">the hon. Member for Telford (David Wright)</phrase>. He talked about sustaining staff morale. I suggest that one of the best ways of doing that is to retain existing services and allow staff to retain their jobs. We know that 280 jobs are under threat, including those of front-line staff such as doctors and nurses. That would, of course, affect front-line patient care. He also said that patient services must come first. Of course, both back-office support and front-line staff such as doctors and nurses are needed to ensure that patients continue to come first.</p>
	<p pid="a.464.1/3">I do not believe that Health Ministers lie awake at night wondering how they can make life more difficult for patients or our constituents in Shropshire. The Government have introduced many well intentioned reforms to the health service, but unfortunately things have gone badly wrong across the country. There is no doubt that changes are needed to health care provision and the way in which customers, consumers and clients of health care view and receive it.</p>
	<p pid="a.464.1/4">We have discussed increasing primary care and care in the community, or community care, and about having super-GP surgeries and a beefed up and thriving independent sector. That is fine in principle, but only if those things are in place before services at the acute hospitals are reduced. In my constituency, in which the Princess Royal hospital is located, we do not have super-GP surgeries or a thriving independent sector and&mdash;unlike Ludlow&mdash;we do not have community hospitals, although some of my Albrighton constituents use the community hospital in Bridgnorth.</p>
	<p pid="a.464.1/5">It would be easy for Members to say that we should have one or the other, but given the sparsity of the population and the size of Shropshire, which is the largest inland county in England, I think that we need both. One might say that that is unreasonable, but is it? Every week we hear the Prime Minister remind Members from the Dispatch Box that all of the money from tax rises has gone to improve health and public services, particularly education and the health service. A lot of my constituents are saying, &quot;Where has all the money gone? We have paid the taxes. We deserve the health services.&quot; Now, they are being asked to accept that they will have to pay more taxes over a long period but get fewer health services in return. It is a massive swindle of the taxpayers of Shropshire.</p>
	<p pid="a.464.1/6">The changes will affect patient care. I should like to ask the Minister some brief questions. Can he guarantee that the accident and emergency unit at the Princess Royal hospital will remain consultant-led, not nurse-led? The hon. Member for Telford supported the principle of an accident and emergency unit and referred to the comments of the trust's chief executive that one will be retained at the Princess Royal, but nowhere has it been said that there is a cast iron guarantee that unit will be consultant-led. It is no good people in the most densely populated part of the county&mdash;Telford and Wrekin&mdash;only having a nurse to patch them up, when for very serious incidents people have to be rushed by blue-light ambulance down to Shrewsbury. In extremis that will cost lives. If someone has a heart attack in Shifnal, Newport or Wellington in my constituency, by the time they get to Shrewsbury they may well be dead. That is hardly patient care.</p>
	<p pid="a.464.1/7">Will the Government consider a debate on whether the two hospital trusts should de-merge? Has it worked? If it has not, let us have a mature debate about it. Let us de-merge the hospital trusts. It is a large county as hon. Members have said. We are a large county and we deserve a full district general hospital in both Telford and Shrewsbury and the other hospitals too.</p>
	<p pid="a.464.1/8">Finally, can the Minister give a guarantee that there will be no land disposals at the Princess Royal hospital that would jeopardise plans for the new Severn hospice or the mental health unit that may well be placed on the site of the hospital? In conclusion, the Government's plans to rationalise, which is a euphemism for cutting services at the Princess Royal, are flawed. They will cost lives. I humbly ask the Government to rethink in the interests of patients and, indeed, their own interests, given that Telford is now a marginal seat.</p>

	<p pid="a.466.0/1">I congratulate my fellow Shropshire MP, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1696" name="Philip Dunne">the Member for Ludlow (Mr. Dunne)</phrase>, on landing this debate. It is of great importance and real relevance to all our constituents.</p>
	<p pid="a.466.0/2">Before Christmas I went to a public meeting in Whitchurch, the town where I was born. There were 500 in the hall and at least 100 outside, standing in the cold. We had a petition, which my hon. Friend and I handed in last week, with 10,000 signatures&mdash;and it is growing, so I have not put it behind the Speaker's Chair. We had a march, with more than 2,000 people, on a freezing cold Saturday morning. That is an expression of feeling about the importance of primary care to my constituents, which cannot be ignored. We had representatives from Market Drayton, Wem, Ellesmere and Audlem, over the border in the constituency of my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1567" name="Stephen O'Brien">the Member for Eddisbury (Mr. O'Brien)</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.466.0/3">Those people are not just nimbys who want to hang on to their services. They have a real case. To bring the subject down to earth, I shall outline the example of Mrs. Schofield. She had a near fatal accident and was in an acute hospital for three months. She said:</p>
	<p pid="a.466.0/4" class="indent">&quot;If I had had to stay in my acute bed for a further three months, this would have cost double the amount for my bed alone and added to the hospital waiting lists; I cannot see how, on this basis, closing our Community Hospital will save money. The local hospitals in this area i.e . . . The Royal Shrewsbury and The Princess Royal . . . will end up with dozens of 'bed blockers' because once the small community hospitals have been closed there will be nowhere to send the patients for rehabilitation.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.466.0/5">Rehabilitation is vital. Mrs. Schofield had four months more rehabilitation in Whitchurch community hospital, and as she said:</p>
	<p pid="a.466.0/6" class="indent">&quot;I could not physically have undertaken this journey&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.466.0/7">to Shrewsbury&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.466.0/8" class="indent">&quot;as my muscles were weak from four months inactivity.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.466.0/9">That is a quick glimpse of the sort of service that those primary care hospitals offer. They take the pressure off the district general hospitals about which other hon. Members have spoken so eloquently.</p>
	<p pid="a.466.0/10">That is flagged up in the famous Finnamore report, which states:</p>
	<p pid="a.466.0/11" class="indent">&quot;An alternative approach to the community hospitals has been discussed that maximises the utilisation of community hospitals.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.466.0/12">But, incredibly, it then says:</p>
	<p pid="a.466.0/13" class="indent">&quot;The financial implication of this approach has not been modelled at this stage but this could be carried out at the detailed option development stage.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.466.0/14">May we have a cast-iron guarantee that there will be a real study of the value of the community hospitals? My hon. Friend the Member for Ludlow flushed out the fact that the Minister does not have a clue what the comparative costs of running primary care and acute care are. Will she take up my suggestion, which was proposed by doctors whom I met over Christmas, that social services should run the hospitals? We know that the PCTs will not be able to be providers and that there is already 93 per cent., and sometimes 99 per cent., bed occupancy in Whitchurch. If there was better liaison with social services and better co-ordination, the needs of someone who has had a fall, or who wants a lift, a commode or another piece of equipment could be met more efficiently by the community hospitals.</p>
	<p pid="a.466.0/15">I hope that the Minister gets the message. It is absolutely out of the question to consider the option of saving &pound;800,000 a year, which is a completely bogus figure in my opinion. It is politically a non-starter, and I would like the Minister to say today that she accepts that.</p>
	<p pid="a.466.0/16">The Minister knows about my patch. She kindly met doctors from Ellesmere and Wem in July, who told her that with better primary care centres they could reduce referrals to the expensive acute hospitals, where costs are running up, by 20 per cent. The doctors gave her a telling example: diabetes will double in the next 20 to 30 years, and whereas 75 per cent. of diabetics in Shropshire are treated by GPs, in Birmingham 75 per cent. of diabetics are treated in district general hospitals. It is inconceivable to imagine the impact on the two main acute hospitals if the ratio for treating diabetes, let alone any other ailment, were the same as that in Birmingham.</p>
	<p pid="a.466.0/17">As for the financial position, we touched on savings, which were flagged up in the report and show possible productivity gains of &pound;10 million; the possible figure for prescribing is &pound;10 million, for referral management &pound;2.5 million, and for reconfiguration &pound;2.1 million. My deal is that for enhanced primary care, and an absolute guarantee not to touch the community hospitals, I would go along with any sensible efficiency savings within the two main acute sites, so long as they did not reduce services. To my constituents it would not matter which of those sites provided the services, because in either case it is a 15-mile drive.</p>
	<p pid="a.466.0/18">I was alarmed by a report in <i>The Sun</i> by George Pascoe-Watson, under the headline, &quot;Blitz on NHS big spenders&quot;. It stated:</p>
	<p pid="a.466.0/19" class="indent">&quot;Hit squads of money men will be ordered into overspending hospitals.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.466.0/20">I believe that it referred to a letter from the Secretary of State last night to me and to other hon. Members stating that KPMG are to be brought in, &quot;driving large-scale financial turnarounds&quot;. Like <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1871" name="David Wright">the hon. Member for Telford (David Wright)</phrase> and my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1946" name="Mark Pritchard">the Member for The Wrekin (Mark Pritchard)</phrase>, I admire Tom Taylor, who has come in to an appalling mess, which was the result of thoroughly bad mismanagement. It is laughable that we had a chief executive who had faked getting a first at Nottingham university. We may not like what we hear from Tom Taylor, but he tells it to us as it is, because he has had time to get a grip on the problems. The last thing we want now is a lot of expensive busybodies from KPMG muddling around with yet more meetings. If anybody understands how to sort out the mess it is Tom Taylor and his team.</p>
	<p pid="a.466.0/21">I want to know how long the busybodies will be in, how much they will cost and who is going to pay for them. I very much hope that it will not be the trust. I hope that it will come out of central funds, run by the Minister.</p>
	<p pid="a.466.0/22">In my last two minutes I want to ask the Minister about mental health in Shelton. How far advanced are the plans to redevelop the second to last Victorian asylum?</p>
	<p pid="a.466.0/23">Finally, the picture is not all gloom. There is a world-class hospital in my constituency at Gobowen, which is in the top tier for cleanliness and already has three-star status. There were only two MRSA cases per 10,000 patients at the Robert Jones and Agnes Hunt hospital, which is going for foundation status. However, one of the brakes on gaining that status is the fact that it needs clarification of the tariff for work done to put right mistakes made in other orthopaedic hospitals. Only four orthopaedic hospitals in the country can do that work, and my local hospital needs to know the details. May I bring the chairman and the chief executive to see the relevant Minister to discuss this matter so that they can push on and get foundation status? I invite the Minister to come to Shropshire at any time, and we will show her the value of primary care, and how to take pressure off the expensive acute hospitals.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-01-25a.469.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1720" speakername="Lembit Öpik" colnum="469"  time="015:31:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060125/halltext/60125h03.htm#60125h03_spnew27">
	<p pid="a.469.2/1">I, too, congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1696" name="Philip Dunne">the hon. Member for Ludlow (Mr. Dunne)</phrase> on securing this debate. I express my solidarity with those who have raised concerns on a cross-party basis, or on a non-party basis in the case of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1949" name="Richard Taylor">the hon. Member for Wyre Forest (Dr. Taylor)</phrase>, who is, indeed, a champion of the people. Those concerns are shared in Shropshire and across the border in mid-Wales.</p>
	<p pid="a.469.2/2">On <phrase class="date" code="1998-04-13">13 April 1998</phrase>, the Royal Shrewsbury hospital saved my life. I had a very serious paragliding accident, in which I fell about 30 m, broke my back in 12 places and smashed my ribs, sternum and jaw. It was a 64-mile journey to the Royal Shrewsbury, partly by car, but primarily by ambulance, and there is no doubt that the hospital's quick, expedient and highly professional service prevented me from dying that day. As a result, I am forever in its debt. It so happens that it was me who had that experience, but thousands of other individuals in Shropshire could have a similar one. I am sure that such people would testify to the benefits and importance of community hospitals. Indeed, it was Llanidloes hospital that initially stabilised my condition so that I could travel the remaining 48 miles in the ambulance to Shrewsbury.</p>
	<p pid="a.469.2/3">Hon. Members are therefore completely right to talk about the essential nature of what could be described as a hub-and-spokes infrastructure. The district general hospitals provide certain facilities&mdash;they have been accurately described, so I do not need to repeat them&mdash;while the community hospitals play an essential supporting role. It is little wonder, then, that so many thousands of people marched&mdash;once again, on a cross-party basis&mdash;to defend the facilities in Shropshire, and I pay tribute to the hon. Member for Ludlow for working with Matthew Green and Labour representatives on those marches to show that this is not a party political issue, but a people political issue. In that sense, the Minister can be in no doubt that no one is trying to score points off the Government&mdash;<i>[Interruption.]</i> To be precise, I am not trying to score points off the Government. People are, however, working hard in the interests of those whom we all represent.</p>
	<p pid="a.469.2/4">On the specifics, there is no question but that there was a cover-up. Members of Parliament and others were misled about the financial circumstances in the trust and in Shropshire, to such an extent, that one would not need parliamentary privilege to say so. Indeed, it was scandal, and the individuals concerned would not dare to sue anyone who condemned them unreservedly for playing roulette with the services in the area. As has been said, Tom Taylor has already secured the trust and recognition of hon. Members from all parties in a way that his predecessor did not. I have a slight difference of opinion about who is to blame for that, but the Minister will be delighted to know that I do not blame her. It would be difficult for her to keep such a detailed eye on various appointments throughout the country that she or, indeed, many of the rest of us would spot a fake CV or someone who was utterly hell bent on getting a job through false means.</p>
	<p pid="a.469.2/5">However, as the body politic, it is our responsibility to make sure that the citizens who evidently were not responsible for the debt problems do not end up being the victims of those debts. Others have already described the consequences of the debts and I hope that the Minister will take seriously our worries that, in Tom Taylor's efforts to resolve the enormous eight-figure debt, he is not forced to compromise the services that have so eloquently been described by others today.</p>
	<p pid="a.469.2/6">Will the Minister respond to the suggestions either to write off the debt or to renegotiate the repayment period for the reasons that have been given? Secondly, will she comment on the hub-and-spokes arrangement that is so important in rural areas and which has done so much good for individuals? I wish to highlight the importance of recognising that it is cheaper to put people into a community hospital bed to recuperate than it is to force them to go to a district general hospital because of the lack of community hospital spaces. Moreover, maternity units themselves are highly treasured by the communities and, once again, ease a further burden on the district general hospitals.</p>
	<p pid="a.469.2/7">In non-technical language, community hospitals do lots of bits that do not have to go to the big hospitals. That is one reason why they are cheaper, why they are loved by local people and why I believe that they aid convalescence, especially for the elderly. They find it easier and less stressful to be in the more homely environment of a community hospital where their relatives and friends can visit them more easily than being transported many tens of miles on occasion to a hospital that, by its nature, will tend to be a less personal and slightly more sterile environment in which to recover.</p>
	<p pid="a.469.2/8">My third and final point concerns the various alternatives to save money, one of which is productivity savings. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1818" name="Owen Paterson">The hon. Member for North Shropshire (Mr. Paterson)</phrase> estimates that &pound;10 million could be saved. I consider that perhaps &pound;7.5 million could be saved, but let us recognise that we are to some extent splitting hairs on the detail because, if the Minister cannot provide us with an assurance that the Government will be amenable to helping us resolve such a crushing debt problem in other ways, services will necessarily need to be cut. It is not Tom Taylor's fault. His only crime is to be honest with the public and the politicians. It is not the public's fault. Their only crime is to live in an area that has had its health services mishandled to some extent and, by virtue of rurality, they pay more for health services because there is no other way in rural areas.</p>
	<p pid="a.469.2/9">As we hear the Minister's response, we will be listening to see if she is willing to debate the facilities with us. There is no downside for the hon. Lady in working with us on a cross-party basis. There is an enormous downside for the local population if she does not. I think that she can show that the Government are serious about the promises that they have made repeatedly on the Floor of the House to work in the interests of the public and to ensure that the significant investments that they have made in the health service are actually used to enhance it, a situation that is the antithesis of what faces Shropshire at the moment.</p>
	<p pid="a.469.2/10">In thanking the Minister in advance for acceding to every request that we make today, I also invite her to visit the facilities that we are discussing. She would perhaps be whinged at a little bit, but she would also be praised a lot for being willing to go and see what we are discussing. She could be a heroine and if she takes that route, we will be the first to sing her praises.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-01-25a.471.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1567" speakername="Stephen O'Brien" colnum="471"  time="015:40:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060125/halltext/60125h03.htm#60125h03_spnew28">
	<p pid="a.471.0/1">First, let me add my congratulations to my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1696" name="Philip Dunne">the Member for Ludlow (Mr. Dunne)</phrase>, who secured this important debate. All four of my Shropshire hon. Friends, as well as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1871" name="David Wright">the hon. Member for Telford (David Wright)</phrase>&mdash;together, they represent all the constituencies in Shropshire&mdash;have championed and campaigned for their constituents and local health services without fear or favour. I should declare that I am a patron of CHANT, which was referred to earlier.</p>
	<p pid="a.471.0/2">As we heard in the outstandingly powerful speech made by my hon. Friend the Member for Ludlow, there are four trusts responsible for health care in Shropshire, under the umbrella of the Shropshire and Staffordshire strategic health authority: the Shrewsbury and Telford Hospital NHS Trust, covering the two hospitals; Shropshire County primary care trust; Telford and Wrekin PCT; and the Robert Jones and Agnes Hunt Orthopaedic and District Hospital NHS Trust, Oswestry's world-famous orthopaedic hospital.</p>
	<p pid="a.471.0/3">Shropshire's financial problems, which arose across those four trusts, consist of a &pound;36 million accumulated debt, which, by Government edict, must be paid off over the next three years. That will necessitate instalments of &pound;12 million per annum, and a current annual running loss of &pound;25 million. That will be &pound;18 million from the Shrewsbury and Telford Hospital NHS Trust&mdash;today announced as being one of the 18 that needs urgent intervention, alongside my local PCT in west Cheshire&mdash;and &pound;7 million from the Shropshire County PCT, which the Government requires to be in balance by April 2007. On those figures, the trust needs to find &pound;37 million a year after current spending.</p>
	<p pid="a.471.0/4">Finnamore Management Consultants, already rightly doubted in an interesting contribution by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1949" name="Richard Taylor">the hon. Member for Wyre Forest (Dr. Taylor)</phrase>, has put together a report on how to achieve those savings from a current total budget of &pound;400 million. Its findings would amount to a cut in Shropshire's health funding of an eye-watering 10 per cent. in each of the next three years. Whatever the Minister says, not one Member of this House&mdash;let alone one citizen of Shropshire, south Cheshire in my constituency or mid-Wales&mdash;will believe that a cut of that size will not lead directly to deep, harsh cuts in patient services.</p>
	<p pid="a.471.0/5">So why is it the Government's fault and liability that the beleaguered patients of Shropshire have to suffer that bill and lost patient and health services? As we heard, the chief executive of the Shrewsbury and Telford Hospital NHS Trust was sacked for incompetence, and was subsequently found to be a fraud. The financial director has gone, too, as he was complicit, and the Labour crony chairman has also chosen to resign. That, to start with, is pretty damning evidence when looking for where liability lies. That is all the more important as it is in that trust that the vast bulk of the deficits were allowed to balloon.</p>
	<p pid="a.471.0/6">The two PCTs are running at a deficit of &pound;2 million, the Robert Jones and Agnes Hunt Orthopaedic and District Hospital NHS Trust is running at a deficit of &pound;5 million, but the Shrewsbury and Telford Hospital NHS Trust is running at a deficit of &pound;29 million. The largest debt in Shropshire comes from the trust that was administered by a fraud. In substance, the position is not changed by the Government's new payment-by-results regime, which shifts &pound;15 million per annum of the acute trust's annual running costs to the PCTs.</p>
	<p pid="a.471.0/7">Who, it is fair to ask, designed the structure? Who set up the processes and the standards for the appointment of the key people at the top of the very organisation that incurred the debt, people who have now all gone? Who set the targets by which those people were judged and had to manage? The answer to all those questions is clear: we need look no further than the Department for Health, the Minister and her predecessors under this Government. In addition, in light of the confused expectations that the historical debt would be assumed by central Government, why should the people of Shropshire, and the dedicated front-line staff&mdash;doctors, nurses and many others, including some of the managers&mdash;have to pick up the tab of Government and Whitehall failings?</p>
	<p pid="a.471.0/8">The Government must own up to their serious failings in respect of the people of Shropshire, and they must recognise that the contingency fund is there as a Government self-insurance policy&mdash;albeit that it uses taxpayers' money, centrally&mdash;to fund its contingent liabilities. This is a contingency, as it would be in any walk of life. There has been a manifest failure of Government policy, and of the processes ensuring the provision of adequately managed patient services for the people of Shropshire, my constituents in south-west Cheshire, and people across the border in Wales, notwithstanding the incredible confusion that devolution throws up.</p>
	<p pid="a.471.0/9">There is a clear line of responsibility, but no; this Government seek instead to duck their liability, and to pressure the local trusts and force them to look in on themselves. Thus to save &pound;37 million per annum, Finnamore has suggested various cuts. One is to close or to threaten the community hospitals at Bishop's Castle, Ludlow, Bridgnorth and Whitchurch. Whitchurch serves hundreds if not thousands of my constituents in Marbury, Malpas, Tushingham, Cholmondeley and the whole southern district of Eddisbury.</p>
	<p pid="a.471.0/10">Will the Minister say whether she is aware of the enormous public outcry and the outrage at the idea of closing those hospitals? Using the very apt analogy of the hub and spoke that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1720" name="Lembit Öpik">the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire (Lembit &Ouml;pik)</phrase> just used, has the Minister noticed that the whole wheel comes off if one takes away the spokes?</p>
	<p pid="a.471.0/11">Given the petitions of more than 10,000 names being presented to the Secretary of State, crowded public meetings and huge marches&mdash;I pay tribute to my colleagues and others for their campaigning&mdash;this simply does not make political sense. Nor does it make financial sense. It saves only a notional and, as we have heard, largely illusory &pound;2.4 million a year out of the total amount required, despite an estimated net figure, but excluding the intended consequences, let alone the unintended ones that we can all predict and which were very ably outlined earlier in this important debate. That will put even more pressure on the already hard-pressed acute trust.</p>
	<p pid="a.471.0/12">The proposal certainly does not make medical sense. The long-term rehabilitation and mental health units lost will exacerbate, not reduce, the problem. As we know, because of the misdirection and the mismanagement engendered by this Government, their agencies, their quangos and other creatures, 80 of the 322 community hospitals in this country are under threat of closure so that trusts throughout England can meet their financial deficits. That is a direct hit on patient services, and is laid firmly at the Government's door.</p>
	<p pid="a.471.0/13">So far as Shropshire is concerned, if the Minister feels that she cannot, without the Chancellor's sanction, access the contingent fund to meet the Government's own liabilities&mdash;I have outlined the chain of causation&mdash;at the very least will she now stand up and undertake to extend the payback period to 10 years? In the best-case scenario, &pound;25 million of annual savings can be attained without closing these valuable community hospitals.</p>
	<p pid="a.471.0/14">Increasing efficiency to improve performance to the upper quartile level in the Robert Jones and Agnes Hunt trust and in the acute trust will yield savings of about &pound;5 million in the former and up to &pound;7.5 million in the latter. An additional &pound;2.5 million could be saved by improving efficiency in the operating theatres of the acute trust. Further, a reduction in over-prescribing, in the light of a survey of GPs in Shropshire who recognise the extent of this inefficiency, would lead to a saving of approximately &pound;10 million a year. I am very grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Ludlow for conducting that survey.</p>
	<p pid="a.471.0/15">There is the &pound;25 million. The Government could then write off the &pound;12 million in historic debt for which they are responsible, and the job would be done. Patient services and community hospitals would be saved, thanks to the support of all the Shropshire MPs of all parties. There just may be a chance of making good the ills of the Government's own making without inflicting real cuts on the front-line patient services for the people of Shropshire, all of whom have been so ably represented in the Chamber today in this crucial and urgent debate. We just have to hope that the Minister has both listened and learned.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-01-25a.477.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1707" speakername="John Leech" colnum="477"  time="016:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060125/halltext/60125h04.htm#60125h04_spnew0">
	<p pid="a.477.1/1">I thank Mr. Speaker for giving me the opportunity to raise the important issue of traffic congestion in my constituency. I also thank the Minister's office for contacting my office before the debate, so that the Minister could get a feel of what I wanted to say and respond to the issues that I shall raise. I accept that some of my points will be outside her area of responsibility, but I ask her to pass on my comments on issues beyond the subject of traffic.</p>
	<p pid="a.477.1/2">For the benefit of the Minister, it is worth my explaining briefly the geography of Manchester, Withington&mdash;I could not tell the Minister the geography of her constituency, and I doubt whether she could tell me the geography of mine. The River Mersey forms a boundary to the south of Withington. That means that commuter traffic coming through my constituency towards central Manchester is channelled along a number of heavily congested roads throughout the constituency. One of those is Princess road, some stretches of which are also known as Princess parkway. It runs from the M56 all the way into the city centre. I have never seen this proved, but I am told that it is the busiest road outside the M25.</p>
	<p pid="a.477.1/3">All the main routes through my constituency to Manchester are heavily congested with cars, which has resulted in significant displacement of traffic from those major routes on to the more minor roads, such as Parrs Wood road in Didsbury. That has had a major effect on the safety of those roads, including for pedestrians and schoolchildren, because the roads simply were not designed to take the level of traffic that they now do.</p>
	<p pid="a.477.1/4">The problem is not confined to north to south routes, from the constituency to the city centre; there is also a major problem with traffic flow across the constituency. Many people not only live in south Manchester but work there, and they travel from east to west, to places such as Salford Quays, Stockport or Cheadle. That has resulted in a major strain on traffic flow, especially from Didsbury to Chorlton along Wilmslow road and Barlow Moor road. That has created gridlock through the district centre of Chorlton.</p>
	<p pid="a.477.1/5">The congestion has had a knock-on effect on the reliability of bus services, as they struggle to stick to timetables. That has dented public confidence in bus services in the constituency, so people have stopped using buses. It has also had a worrying effect on Chorlton district centre. Shop owners complain about losing business as shoppers actively avoid going through the district centre because of the congestion. That has quickened the decline of local shops, which are being replaced by evening trade businesses, such as bars, restaurants and takeaways, because traffic congestion does not have the same impact at night, and they can make money.</p>
	<p pid="a.477.1/6">It would be easy for me to argue that poor public transport and lack of investment is responsible for too many cars being on our roads, and all the congestion. The situation is not as straightforward as that, however. Deregulation of buses has certainly had a negative effect by creating more congestion, as gaps in the bus network have to be filled by people using cars, but it is also true that deregulation has increased bus services in parts of the constituency&mdash;for instance, the Wilmslow road corridor, where people can get a bus every 10 seconds. That is an example of deregulation working. Unfortunately, the bus companies are not prepared to run decent bus services across the constituency, because it is far more cost-effective just to pile all their buses on to the routes that make them money. They expect to receive significant subsidies from the Greater Manchester passenger transport authority before running services east to west, and the PTA just does not have the funds available.</p>
	<p pid="a.477.1/7">I shall give a couple of examples of deregulation clearly not working. The No. 46/47 circular service that runs through my constituency and into the city centre was profitable during the day, but in the end the bus company decided to cut the evening part of the service because it was not making any money. Of course, the knock-on effect of that is that people using the bus service in the morning to get across the constituency cannot get the bus back, so they have to make alternative arrangements for both journeys, which makes the bus less profitable in the morning as well. That has had an impact on passenger numbers, and the knock-on effect is that more people use cars.</p>
	<p pid="a.477.1/8">The other example is the No. 86 bus service, which ran from one of the most deprived estates in the whole of my constituency, through Chorlton and into the city centre. The section of the service from the estate to the centre of Chorlton was not profitable, because congestion meant that it was not running to time, so fewer people used it. That meant that over time, the bus company just decided to reduce the level of service and run the vast majority of the services from the bus station, which meant that the few people who still wanted to use the bus from Arrowfield road&mdash;from the estate&mdash;lost confidence in the bus service. Rather than arriving every five or six minutes, the buses were supposed to arrive every 20 minutes; in fact, it was every half an hour, if people were lucky.</p>
	<p pid="a.477.1/9">Moving on from buses, I do not think that I could discuss congestion in my constituency without briefly mentioning the delays to phase 3 of Metrolink. In the past few years, lots of people have moved to Manchester, Withington because they genuinely believe that they are moving to an area where they will be close to a Metrolink station in the near future. Indeed, developers have been actively promoting property for sale on that basis. However, due to the recent uncertainty about funding and how long it is likely to be before we see Metrolink running through the constituency, one particular developer, as an alternative to promoting Metrolink as a reason to buy a property, is now offering a free car as part of the package when someone buys a flat in that development. Clearly, that will increase congestion.</p>
	<p pid="a.477.1/10">My final point on the causes of congestion is about overdevelopment in south Manchester. I accept that that is not within the Minister's area of responsibility, but my constituency has become a victim of its own success. People quite rightly want to live in south Manchester, because it is great place to live and work. As the Member of Parliament for the area, I do not think that you would expect me to say anything else, Mr. Gale, but it really is a great place to live. Unfortunately, because it has become so popular, every developer wants to build a block of flats on a postage stamp of land.</p>
	<p pid="a.477.1/11">Both the Government and the local council must bear some of the responsibility. For example, the council, in its wisdom, decided to sell a piece of land on Beech road, a heavily congested local road with serious parking problems. The council decided to sell off a car park and allow an additional block of flats to be built on a road that was already suffering from congestion and traffic problems. Similarly, the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister recently approved the council's decision to redevelop an old school playing field and build yet more houses and flats.</p>
	<p pid="a.477.1/12">The problem is not just about the council selling off land, and the situation is not just the council's fault. It is also about developers taking advantage of weak planning laws that do not really protect local communities. In the Parrs Wood area of my constituency, a new entertainment complex was built a few years ago. That new development was undertaken in an already congested area, without first devising any sort of plan to deal with the traffic implications. When the council finally brought forward a scheme, we were told by the traffic officers that they could not come up with a scheme that solved the problem, but that the one that they had come up with was about as near as they could get. So it was a half-baked measure that annoyed all the local residents and did not deal with the traffic problem. More recently, just across the road from that same development, two further blocks of flats have been approved. The council's traffic office has already said that it cannot deal with the congestion problem in that area, yet two further blocks of flats and houses have been approved there, and they will cause extra traffic.</p>
	<p pid="a.477.1/13">Those developments have been approved despite massive opposition locally. The planners argued that there was no justification for refusal, because the extra traffic would not significantly increase the amount of traffic already on the road. If traffic is at a standstill, however, any increase in traffic is unacceptable.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-01-25a.479.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1707" speakername="John Leech" colnum="479"  time="016:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060125/halltext/60125h04.htm#60125h04_spnew2">
	<p pid="a.479.1/1">I agree with my hon. Friend, and it would have been useful if that link road had been completed one or two months ago when I was spending time travelling to Cheadle during the recent by-election there. I am not sure whether my hon. Friend heard my remarks about a number of people who live in south Manchester and travel to Stockport and Cheadle and back again. The relief road would have a significant impact on the traffic that goes along the residential streets between Cheadle and Didsbury.</p>
	<p pid="a.479.1/2">I should like to offer some solutions to the problem. What is the solution? That is the million dollar question. The response to traffic congestion in my constituency has been the QBC&mdash;the quality bus corridor. In theory, it is a good idea: encouraging bus companies to improve services and local people to use them by improving bus reliability and prioritising buses along Wilmslow road and Barlow Moor road. Unfortunately, the QBC alterations have resulted in more congestion on minor roads, where cars have been forced on to alternative routes. At Chorlton Cross for instance, cars have been banned from turning right on to Barlow Moor road from Wilbraham road, to make it easier for buses to turn right. That has resulted in additional traffic on High lane, as cars use it as the alternative route.</p>
	<p pid="a.479.1/3">There has been no significant increase in bus services along the QBC route; in fact, later this week, the 46/47 Sunday service will be discontinued. The reality is that there is little incentive for bus companies to run services more frequently and to provide new routes, when those routes will never be as profitable as the north to south routes on the Wilmslow road corridor.</p>
	<p pid="a.479.1/4">People and passenger transport authorities throughout the country require and support a level of regulatory control, so that transport authorities can decide what bus services will be provided. The current system of subsidised services is inadequate for the provision of a comprehensive bus network. In order to get more people on to buses, we must consider how to make bus travel more attractive.</p>
	<p pid="a.479.1/5">I do not always agree with Brian Souter, the head of Stagecoach, but he rightly points out that we should consider bus park-and-ride schemes, which were very successful in my constituency during the Christmas period. However, outside that period there is not one single scheme. We must consider permanent park-and-ride schemes, so that people park outside Manchester and take the bus into the centre.</p>
	<p pid="a.479.1/6">The Government must also acknowledge that the best solution for south Manchester is Metrolink. Although the start-up costs can be high, time and again such a scheme has proved to be the most successful way of bringing about a significant modal shift away from the car. The fact that people move to be near to the Metrolink is testament to that, and the success of the Altrincham to Bury line proves it.</p>
	<p pid="a.479.1/7">Unfortunately, I have serious reservations about current Government policy, in that it will not deliver Metrolink through to Chorlton and out to Didsbury without a commitment to road-user pricing. I seek further assurance from the Minister that additional Government money would not be dependent on road-user pricing. Manchester cannot go down that route until a decent network is in place to begin with.</p>
	<p pid="a.479.1/8">Finally, tighter regulation of buses and the investment of more money in Metrolink would help the situation but not completely solve the problem. The Government must accept that unless steps are taken to deal with the problem of overdevelopment and its effect on congestion, the problem will remain. Councils need to be given more powers to tackle areas of congestion, and I propose that local authorities should be given the option to introduce congestion zones in their development plans. Where congestion zones are set up, a developer would have to demonstrate that a proposed development would not significantly increase traffic congestion, either through increased volume of traffic or as a result of additional traffic measures required to facilitate the development.</p>
	<p pid="a.479.1/9">I trust that the Minister will pass on my comments to the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister on that point, and I look forward to her response.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-01-25a.483.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1777" speakername="Karen Buck" colnum="483"  time="016:16:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060125/halltext/60125h04.htm#60125h04_spnew6">
	<p pid="a.483.0/1">I will comment briefly on Metrolink, but let me concentrate for a moment on buses. Compared with rail and light rail, buses are a flexible, low-cost option. They can contribute to tackling congestion, especially in conjunction with policies to restrain car use. We recognise that some conurbations such as Greater Manchester and others are experiencing difficulties with bus services. There are issues of bus quality; standards of reliability, frequency and cleanliness are not always met by some providers. I accept completely that we need to get that right.</p>
	<p pid="a.483.0/2">We have no plans to return to the regulatory regime of the 1980s. Current options available to local authorities include voluntary and statutory partnerships, and there are a number of examples of good partnership working across the country. However, if local authorities are prepared to propose a comprehensive system for managing traffic demand, such as road pricing, we are prepared to consider introducing further measures to control bus services.</p>
	<p pid="a.483.0/3">The current statutory framework for bus services gives local authorities a number of options to suit their local circumstances. One option is quality partnerships. Those cover both the provision of facilities by the local authority, such as bus priority measures, and improved standards of service by the bus operators. In a PTE area such as Manchester, the involvement of the city or borough authorities that manage the highways is crucial to the success of a quality partnership. Their participation in essential if traffic regulation orders are needed.</p>
	<p pid="a.483.0/4">The quality bus corridor, which both hon. Gentlemen mentioned, is the main thrust behind the Greater Manchester bus strategy, as improvements in bus journey times have been recognised. I understand that there is a commitment to address quality bus corridor enforcement in 2006. On the Chorlton and Didsbury bus corridor, there has been some local opposition to the scheme, which is part of the south Manchester scheme being rolled out across that part of the conurbation.</p>
	<p pid="a.483.0/5">In recognition of recent newspaper coverage and some of the residential concerns that were raised with local councillors, Manchester city council has undertaken a full review of the scheme by a team independent of those involved in the design. The report of that study has been presented to Councillor Neil Swannick, who is the executive member for highways and transportation. The scheme has addressed a wide range of transport issues including improving pedestrian facilities, defining parking and loading bays, reducing the impact of congestion and introducing the bus lane. Those using sustainable modes of transport will be better served as a result.</p>
	<p pid="a.483.0/6">Generally, non-statutory partnership agreements between operators and local authorities have proved successful in many areas, but there is room for improvement in bus services in other places. We are therefore discussing with bus operators and local authority representatives a range of options to make bus services more effective within the partnership framework.</p>
	<p pid="a.483.0/7">A more radical option is the quality contracts scheme, which can be approved only if it is the only practicable way of implementing bus strategy policies and is economic, efficient, effective and in the public interest. We recognise that those are exacting tests, but they are not impossible to meet. A guidance document was published in February last year for English local authorities. The range of measures, including legislation and other options being considered as part of a broader package of demand-met management measures, will give PTEs such as Greater Manchester a range of tools with which to ensure that their bus services in particular, as one strand of the public transport model, are developed effectively and complement other measures that may be necessary to deal with demand management.</p>
	<p pid="a.483.0/8">The Department and I recognise that buses are not the sole means of public transport to be promoted, and I echo the commitment of my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State to work with the Greater Manchester authority to ensure that light rail will continue to be a major part of the solution for Manchester, particularly for congestion. We recognise the achievements of Metrolink&mdash;which has played an important role in supporting Manchester's economic success, carrying more than 19 million passengers a year&mdash;and that it suffers from overcrowding. We have recently approved a scheme to renew and enhance the capacity of existing tram lines, and have committed &pound;520 million of public sector funds to Greater Manchester, subject to the development of a satisfactory plan for the areas covered by Metrolink phase 3. We will continue to work with Manchester on the proposals for tram extensions, which could be a major part of the solution for Manchester as part of the overall package of transport improvements, which includes other measures recognised by the Greater Manchester transport authorities, such as better buses and trains and better management of traffic levels.</p>
	<p pid="a.483.0/9">I hope that I have gone some way toward reassuring the hon. Member for Manchester, Withington that we recognise the seriousness of the issues that he has raised today, and that past, present and future investment, together with the innovative thinking that is going on at a national level, which we are encouraging local and passenger transport authorities to develop with the support of the innovation fund, give us a real opportunity to make what <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2016" name="Mark Hunter">the hon. Member for Cheadle (Mark Hunter)</phrase> rightly described as a seismic change.</p>
	<p pid="a.483.0/10">We need a change in thinking and investment. We need investment to be supported by choices that are sometimes difficult and involve brave political leadership to ensure that demand management plays its part alongside investment in additional public transport. We are working closely with a range of stakeholders nationally and regionally to address the problems that the hon. Member for Manchester, Withington outlined and will continue to do so.</p>

	<p pid="a.485.1/1">It is a real honour to secure an Adjournment debate on what I believe is a quality industry and one that is becoming increasingly so, especially in the area in which my constituency is located. I am also extremely pleased that my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1840" name="Dari Taylor">the Member for Stockton, South (Ms Taylor)</phrase> and my hon. and learned Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1775" name="Vera Baird">the Member for Redcar (Vera Baird)</phrase> have joined me to discuss the important process industries on Teesside. I intend to cut short my speech to allow them to make contributions if they so wish.</p>
	<p pid="a.485.1/2">I want to do two things today. First, I wish to showcase the growing significance of the process industries to the regeneration of the Tees valley and the wider north-east and United Kingdom economy. Secondly, I wish to raise with my right hon. Friend the Minister several matters that the process industries on Teesside fear may hinder their ability to succeed and grow, and provide further prosperity in my constituency and elsewhere.</p>
	<p pid="a.485.1/3">I outlined in a previous Adjournment debate how the north-east economy is still in the process of recovering from the seismic shocks of the decline of its heavy manufacturing base. A failure to innovate and an abandonment of the region and of manufacturing industry by central Government in the 1980s led to the rapid decline of much of what had made Teesside and the north-east prosperous since the Victorian era. It led to mass structural unemployment in the region. Between 1981 and 1997, some 110,000 jobs were lost in manufacturing&mdash;90,000 of them in the Tees valley. That has contributed to the fact that the Tees valley economy now lags significantly behind the UK economy. As a sub-region, we have to grow much faster to catch up with the rest of the country.</p>
	<p pid="a.485.1/4">Yet, amid such a depressing tale, there is much to be positive about. Despite the massive knocks that the area received in the 1980s and 1990s, we still have a resilient manufacturing industry, of which firms such as Corus are a leading part. What has struck me recently is how, in a quiet way, a modern manufacturing sector has emerged from the Tees valley that is leading the world. The process industries are by far the single biggest wealth-generating industrial sector in the north-east, and certainly in the Tees valley. The sector employs directly about 14,000 people in the Tees valley, with an estimated 140,000 indirect jobs in the sub-region that are reliant on the process industries. Some 60 per cent. of the contribution to the regional economy made by the north-east process industries comes from the Tees valley and, bearing in mind the importance of the sector to the regional economy, some 15 per cent. of the entire north-east gross domestic product is derived from process industries in the Tees valley.</p>
	<p pid="a.485.1/5">The area has a range of firms that specialise in chemicals, pharmaceuticals, biotechnology and renewable energy. Firms such as Huntsman Petrochemicals provide high-quality chemicals and polyurethanes. Hart Biologicals in my constituency, led by Alby Pattison, is at the cutting edge of clinical diagnostic tools for hospital pathology laboratories. Firms such as Petroplus manufacture petrochemicals and push the boundaries of the future application of biodiesel. Those firms are providing high-quality, well-paid jobs to the people of the Tees valley. In the process, they are producing high value-added goods that improve our quality of life and help to redress the environmental damage that has occurred over the past century, and which can be exported throughout the world, improving the wealth of this country.</p>
	<p pid="a.485.1/6">The nature of the industry means that innovation has to be a constant part of life. Research and development is a major part of process industries and I hope that the Government continue to ensure that an appropriate environment is provided for in that sector. Thankfully, I think that that is happening. The Centre for Process Innovation has been established in the Tees valley, with the support of the regional development agency, One NorthEast, as a major UK national resource that is designed to stimulate innovation within the chemistry process sector. The CPI employs 50 researchers and has close links with universities and businesses to ensure that the process industry has the best chance of succeeding. After only 18 months in operation, it has developed innovation projects that are worth &pound;36 million for the Tees valley.</p>
	<p pid="a.485.1/7">New processes that are being developed include the continuous oscillatory baffle reactor. I am sure that that is the first time that that phrase has been used in Parliament, so I am proud of having said it. I have no idea what it does, so &quot;baffle&quot; is an appropriate word, but I know that the process quickens chemical reactions and makes industries on Teesside more efficient, and therefore more able to retain our competitive advantage against the rest of the world.</p>
	<p pid="a.485.1/8">The area of innovation about which I am the most excited is the development of renewable energy. Long-established skills in the region from the chemicals and oil industries make the Tees valley the best possible area to develop cutting-edge technology. Teesside is leading the way in the use of hydrogen to help to produce environmentally friendly energy, either through fuel cells producing lighting or as a substitute for petrol. Biomass technology is also being developed. SembCorp Utilities is building a &pound;60 million power station on the River Tees, which will use surplus timber from forests and recycled wood to generate carbon-neutral electricity, and Biofuels Corporation, with One NorthEast funding, is building a new facility at Seal sands on the Tees estuary to produce alternative fuel from rape seed oil.</p>
	<p pid="a.485.1/9">I have no doubt that with appropriate Government support the Tees valley will become in the next few years the most developed area for green energy not just in the UK, but in the world. I passionately hope that that status will produce well paid green jobs for the Tees valley, bringing the same prosperity to my area that Aberdeen saw from oil in the 1970s and 1980s, or that Teesside itself saw from heavy manufacturing in Victorian times.</p>
	<p pid="a.485.1/10">Despite all that good news, the sector hid its light under a bushel somewhat until recently. There appeared to be reticence about promoting the good work being undertaken. Thank goodness, that is no longer the case. About 200 companies in the sector in the Tees valley have come together to form the north-east process industries cluster&mdash;NEPIC. Under the chairmanship of Bob Coxon and with Dr. Stan Higgins as chief executive, that group is promoting the sector and pursuing initiatives such as raising investment in overseas trade, productivity improvement, raising skill levels and closing the GDP gap between the north-east and the rest of the UK. Those activities are designed to ensure the sector's continuing development and worldwide status.</p>
	<p pid="a.485.1/11">I was lucky enough to attend the annual dinner of the north-east process industries cluster group last Friday in the constituency of my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister. Some 420 people from the process industries attended the event. There was a positive buzz and a great deal of confidence about the future of the industry on Teesside, and a recognition that what is being done is world class and will make a growing contribution to the continuing economic renaissance of the Tees valley.</p>
	<p pid="a.485.1/12">Despite that, there are concerns that may hinder the process industry's progress. In winding up, will my right hon. Friend the Minister respond to those concerns, to ensure that the sector has the maximum opportunity to grow? The key concern relates to energy pricing. To me, that seems ironic given that a key pillar of the future of the process industries is indigenous energy regeneration. Many companies have seen gas and electricity prices double in the past 12 months. I understand that one company in the process industry on Teesside has seen its energy costs increase by &pound;12 million, putting part of its business operations into loss and thereby questioning its continuing viability. The firm has some 500 employees in Hartlepool and is a vital concern to me and to the economy of my constituency.</p>
	<p pid="a.485.1/13">Energy costs have resulted in the closure of plants such as that owned by Terra Nitrogen in the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Stockton, South, which is next door to mine. That plant employed a large number of people from Hartlepool, who have written to me to express their concern. I am worried about the domino effect of Terra's closure. The firm supplied basic raw materials to a large number of other companies in the Tees valley and elsewhere. Those companies now rely on foreign supplies and tell me that if we experience a bad spell of weather, meaning that North sea tankers are unable to supply, a number of Teesside plants will shut down and might not reopen. The situation is unsustainable and detrimental to the prospects of development for the process industries on Teesside. Firms on Teesside hope to see a concerted effort by the Government to achieve forward price stability and equitable energy pricing with competitors in Europe. I urge my right hon. Friend to do what he can to ensure that companies in Teesside are competing on a level playing field with overseas firms.</p>
	<p pid="a.485.1/14">Another concern is on skills. The demographic profile of the process industry is not encouraging. Although the legacy of the old ICI plants at Billingham and Wilton provides an unprecedented degree of experience, it means that the average age of scientists and engineers is over 50. The industry has been unable to underpin its recent growth with an appropriate number of trainees.</p>
	<p pid="a.485.1/15">The news is not all bad. I recently had the pleasure of meeting Leanne Hart, a constituent of mine working for AMEC who is the chair of the north-east and Yorkshire young persons network. The aims of that network are to share good practice, promote skills in the industry and act as ambassadors for the sector. Despite her good work, and that of others, we still need to improve the attractiveness of modern apprenticeships. As a country, we also need to do more to help to steer young people contemplating university into science and engineering courses. Will my right hon. Friend respond to that point?</p>
	<p pid="a.485.1/16">Most crucially, to address the gap, I urge the establishment of a process industries national skills academy. Given that the Tees valley is the premier area for process industries in the UK, I ask that such an academy be based in the north-east, and of course I add that Hartlepool has a wide and attractive range of business premises where it could be located.</p>
	<p pid="a.485.1/17">My third and final point, which companies have raised with me, is the impact of European legislation, particularly the registration, evaluation and authorisation of chemicals, known as REACH. Firms are concerned that the cost of implementing REACH will far outweigh the benefits. It is having a particular impact on a leading company in my constituency, Oxford Chemicals, led by Dr. Richard Smith. I have been told that the UK authorities are particularly zealous in ensuring compliance with REACH, in contrast, perhaps, with some of our European neighbours. I should be grateful if the Minister explained how he and his Department are working with the European Union to ensure a level playing field for our companies.</p>
	<p pid="a.485.1/18">The process industries in the Tees valley are examples of how the UK is leading the global economy. Such products will become increasingly important in modern life, and the fact that Teesside is leading the way should produce enormous and sorely needed benefits to prosperity for our region. To fly to its maximum height, however, the sector requires Government assistance and facilitation, and I hope that my right hon. Friend will set out in his reply how that assistance will be provided.</p>

	<p pid="a.488.0/1">It is a great pleasure to follow my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1620" name="Iain Wright">the Member for Hartlepool (Mr. Wright)</phrase>, and I congratulate him on securing the debate, which is both timely and valued.</p>
	<p pid="a.488.0/2">I wish to talk for a few moments about the north-east process industries cluster, which is an important group for us in the north-east. It employs in excess of 300,000 people, and produces more than 25 per cent. of the region's gross domestic product, which in effect is more than &pound;8 billion of the United Kingdom's GDP. Those figures show just how important that group of industries is. As my hon. Friend stated, it is a crucial part of the regeneration of the Tees valley, most significantly in my constituency. Like him, I should like to hear how the Minister proposes to support the continued development of the process industries cluster in the north-east.</p>
	<p pid="a.488.0/3">Critically, the group not only employs well, it pays well. The Tees valley has the biggest petrochemical industry in the UK and the second biggest in Europe, and that is crucially valuable to us. Development and investment in that industry in the area demonstrate a growth in confidence, and the spiralling effect of that investment is seen across the whole of industry in the Tees valley.</p>
	<p pid="a.488.0/4">Teesport is an incredibly valuable port&mdash;the second biggest in the UK. It is in the constituency of my hon. and learned Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1775" name="Vera Baird">the Member for Redcar (Vera Baird)</phrase>, although its headquarters is in Middlesbrough. It is another very valuable piece of the whole kit of developing and delivering a new industrial structure for the north-east. I would greatly appreciate it if my right hon. Friend the Minister acknowledged that leaving Teesport out of the development of a national port strategy is profoundly wrong and very damaging for the north-east.</p>
	<p pid="a.488.0/5">In only three years, more than &pound;1 billion has been invested in the process industries cluster, and we have seen what that investment has achieved: the creation of 1,600 jobs. This is powerful and it needs to be appreciated. We need to acknowledge the risks that are being taken by the industrialists who deliver such things.</p>
	<p pid="a.488.0/6">I have so much more to say, but my hon. Friend the Member for Hartlepool has said it for us. There are concerns about energy and the age profile of our skilled engineers, which is over 50&mdash;I personally think that that is a golden age, but I understand that we must have a younger profile for industry development&mdash;and REACH is problematic, not because it is a regulatory document, but because in Britain we will put it together in terms of dots and commas and we are not confident that people in Europe will.</p>
	<p pid="a.488.0/7">We have a growing, vibrant, new tomorrow for the 21st century. We want that to be supported. I hope that the Minister, who is hearing the plea from all of us, will accept our statements. With a little support, we will move into the 21st century as we ended the 19th, and as we went through much of the 20th century&mdash;with a vibrant region.</p>

	<p pid="a.489.0/1">I am grateful to my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1620" name="Iain Wright">the Member for Hartlepool (Mr. Wright)</phrase> for allowing me to express my support for the north-east process industry. I congratulate him on securing this debate and thank him for his generosity in being prepared to share it.</p>
	<p pid="a.489.0/2">I attended the north-east process industries cluster&mdash;NEPIC&mdash;in London on <phrase class="date" code="2006-11-17">17 November</phrase>, to which both my colleagues referred, which was launched by the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry and the Secretary to the Treasury, my right hon. Friend the Government Chief Whip. That body is intended to support the whole process industry, a major base of which is the Teesside chemical industry, and a large part of which, although by no means all of it, is based at the Wilton International complex in Redcar. I was pleased when NEPIC decided that it was going to put its headquarters at Wilton International as well. I have to tell my hon. Friend the Member for Hartlepool that I am sure that we have one of those battle zones in Redcar, if he has one in Hartlepool, and I am sure that we are working it very hard.</p>
	<p pid="a.489.0/3">Setting up NEPIC was an excellent move, because it merged the Teesside chemical initiative, which had been the Teesside chemical representative group, with the pharmaceutical groups and other related groups from further north in the county, around Tyneside and Northumberland, thereby potentially generating good links between industries that obviously have a commonality and providing them with an opportunity to help each other. I hope that that is a precursor of better links, generally, between Teesside and Tyneside, which have not always given each other the mutual support that they should.</p>
	<p pid="a.489.0/4">I want to speak briefly about a key partner for NEPIC in its endeavour to bring us a golden future. A major instrument of its future success is Teesport, which was mentioned by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1840" name="Dari Taylor">the Member for Stockton, South (Ms Taylor)</phrase>, and which has recently been taken over by a consortium of investors called Endeavour Ports. It is the second largest port by volume and is&mdash;it goes without saying&mdash;in Redcar, where all good things are. Its new owners will support and continue the effort that has been commenced to establish and develop a deep sea container terminal at Teesport.</p>
	<p pid="a.489.0/5">NEPIC estimates that between &pound;8 billion and &pound;10 billion of investment should be pumped into the process industries in the north-east in the next 10 years. Teesport is crucial. It handles 65 per cent. of the chemical and pharmaceutical sectors' goods for export, which is more than &pound;5 billion of the total investment, and NEPIC fears that it could be threatened if it does not develop as we hope it will.</p>
	<p pid="a.489.0/6">One NorthEast and ourselves had campaigned for the Government to halt expansion at ports in the south&mdash;Felixstowe, Harwich and Shellhaven, on the Thames&mdash;and instead allow investment to flow into Teesside. The fear was that if Shellhaven, Felixstowe and Harwich all developed, or if most of them did, it would be difficult to persuade shipping lines to move to Teesport with their container cargo. Two of the three consents have now been granted; none the less Teesport, with its new ownership, has resolved to move as fast as it can to apply for a harbour revision order to develop the deep sea container port.</p>
	<p pid="a.489.0/7">Teesport is renewed in its confidence, because it has recently obtained an Asda import centre, through which a large proportion&mdash;90 per cent., I think&mdash;of all Asda's clothing line will be imported into the UK through Teesport. That indicates that it is practical to make shipping lines reroute to Teesport, because of the calibre of its facilities, the labour available and so on. Presumably, those shipping lines already appreciate that the climate-friendly elements of a shorter distribution network to the north-east, north-west and Scotland also stand them in good stead.</p>
	<p pid="a.489.0/8">The whole community backs the development of Teesport, and I understand that the conservation bodies are not likely to cause any difficulties. All the politicians back the development of Teesport, too.</p>
	<p pid="a.489.0/9">The way in which the process industry does business these days is changing. The industries are more and more specialised, and goods are shipped out not by tanker but by container&mdash;a large percentage of them through Teesport, so it is crucial that it should develop.</p>
	<p pid="a.489.0/10">The chief executive officer of north-east process industries cluster, Professor Higgins, has said:</p>
	<p pid="a.489.0/11" class="indent">&quot;Teesport, of any European port, is the best located for the expansion of Europe. If we are going to take goods to and from Poland, Lithuania, Russia, we would take it though the Baltic or take it across to Rotterdam and drive it across Europe. Which is the best located port for those areas? Teesport.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.489.0/12">I hope that Government appreciate the strategic advantage for the port and for the process industries. It is the view of One NorthEast that the successful development of Teesport as a deep sea container terminal is also of national significance.</p>
	<p pid="a.489.0/13">If it is feasible for him to do so, I should be pleased if my right hon. Friend would undertake to do his best to ensure that there are no obstacles in the way of the development so that our golden future in the Tees valley will not be held back.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-01-25a.491.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1482" speakername="Alun Michael" speakeroffice="The Minister for Industry and the Regions"  colnum="491"  time="016:50:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060125/halltext/60125h05.htm#60125h05_spmin0">
	<p pid="a.491.0/1">I will answer as fully as I can within the limited time available. I thank my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1620" name="Iain Wright">the Member for Hartlepool (Mr. Wright)</phrase> for inspiring the debate and being assiduous, as ever, in promoting the interests of his constituency. I am pleased that he endorsed the excellent work of the north-east process industries cluster, which I shall try to avoid referring to by its acronym. It is an unexpected pleasure to have the presence of the well-known parliamentary songbird my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1840" name="Dari Taylor">the Member for Stockton, South (Ms Taylor)</phrase> and my hon. and learned Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1775" name="Vera Baird">the Member for Redcar (Vera Baird)</phrase>. I shall try to cover briefly some of the most important points, but as many issues were mentioned I will also write to my hon. Friends and expand on some of those matters.</p>
	<p pid="a.491.0/2">I wholeheartedly agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Hartlepool about the important role that the process industry in Tees valley plays in our wider economy now and will play in the future. My hon. Friend's remarks are a testament to the fact that it is not a sunset industry; the sector itself is grasping the opportunities of increasing skills, of taking its place in the knowledge-based economy and of making genuine strides in commercialising new technologies and ways of working.</p>
	<p pid="a.491.0/3">My hon. Friend rightly said that the industry has responded to the need to operate in a cleaner environment and to avoid the damage that was done in the past. Times have changed; this country can be very proud indeed of our success in getting the REACH proposals agreed in December during the British presidency. The initiative started in the previous British presidency in the late 1990s and came to fulfilment during our latest presidency.</p>
	<p pid="a.491.0/4">The reason why we should be so proud of REACH is that it was amended from a very bureaucratic set of proposals by the Commission as a result of the UK-Hungarian suggestion of a one substance, one registration proposal. Initially, it had no other supporters, and the new member state worked very closely with us.</p>
	<p pid="a.491.0/5">I pay tribute to the Chemical Industries Association, especially Judith Hackett, who is about to move on from her role, for the way in which it engaged with environmental campaigners, animal rights organisations and a variety of industries from Ford to Marks and Spencer, the chemical industry itself and downstream users, in putting forward practical proposals. That is why I am slightly surprised by the reference to excessive administration. The proposals were agreed as recently as December, so the company in Hartlepool may have sounded a note of unjustified pessimism.</p>
	<p pid="a.491.0/6">I believe it was in this room that I introduced the regulations on paint, and Opposition Members&mdash;there were Opposition Members present on that occasion&mdash; said that they would put fresh burdens on British industry. They had to change their stance when scribbled notes from the industry representatives down at the end of the room pointed out that consistent regulations would be applied across Europe, and that the UK industry, which was already operating to high environmental and health protection standards, would benefit from similar burdens being placed on their competitors in other countries.</p>
	<p pid="a.491.0/7">I should point out that REACH will replace more than 40 pieces of legislation, and one regulation means better regulation; it will help to reduce the overall bureaucratic burden. As a result of our initiatives, much has been done to streamline REACH and make it more cost-effective. I will happily lay out some of the other benefits of the proposal for my hon. Friend.</p>
	<p pid="a.491.0/8">My hon. Friend also referred to the importance of skills development within the industry, and I agree with him on that. Service industries in particular have to operate on improving their processes and increasing skills. On Monday I went to see another process industry, a printing plant. I was really impressed by how specific manufacturers and producers in the industry are working to squeeze every last benefit from the improvement of skills, and how they are engaging the work force in how the processes are undertaken. That is why the employer-led sector skills council and the regional skills partnership are so important in starting to deliver; they cover so much of the work force.</p>
	<p pid="a.491.0/9">I agree with my hon. Friend about the importance of supporting young people in modern apprenticeships. One of the challenges for a region such as the north-east is encouraging young people to be ambitious about their skills and qualifications and, in many cases, about the entrepreneurship that they can bring to bear, either individually by setting up their own business, or as entrepreneurs within large industries such as the process industry. I would be happy to talk to my hon. Friend about that, because the issue of how we get that message across in the north-east is important to young people in the constituencies of my hon. Friends the Members for Hartlepool and for Stockton, South, and my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Redcar.</p>
	<p pid="a.491.0/10">My hon. Friend the Member for Hartlepool rightly referred to the impact of energy prices, and we certainly understand the tough conditions that high energy users are experiencing. He will be aware that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has, at the request of the Prime Minister, promoted an energy review that looks to the long term. We are carefully looking into the surprising prices spike, and the impression that perhaps not all supplies were as readily available in the UK as they should have been towards the end of last year.</p>
	<p pid="a.491.0/11">My hon. Friend will also be aware that steps taken by Government mean that supplies will be increased considerably in the coming year, what with the new terminals, and what is happening in Pembrokeshire. Also, a variety of other approaches that have been a long time in preparation are coming to fulfilment; that will help us to deal with the faster than expected decrease in availability of North sea gas, other pressures on the energy industry, and the knock-on effect on industry. So steps are being taken to help industry to compete.</p>
	<p pid="a.491.0/12">My hon. Friends have referred to the development in Teesport. I should point out that PD Teesport has sought a screening and scoping opinion from the Department for Transport, and the Department has responded. The next stage in the process will be a formal harbour revision order application to the Department. If one or more objection or more is received, an inquiry has to be set up. It would not be appropriate for the Government to speculate on the merits of the application before it is received, nor once it is under consideration. However, I assure my hon. Friends that careful consideration would be given, and the importance of the port and location of Teesport is fully recognised by the Government.</p>
	<p pid="a.491.0/13">The work of the cluster arises from the merger in 2005 of the pharmaceutical and speciality cluster and the Teesside chemical initiative. The new and inclusive organisation will co-ordinate intellectual business and financial support mechanisms for some of the major corporations in chemicals, pharmaceuticals and biotechnology in the region. That is of enormous significance. I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Hartlepool and his colleagues about the importance of that development, which builds on the sector's many decades of commitment to the region.</p>
	<p pid="a.491.0/14">My hon. Friend rightly said that the sector had weathered many booms and busts, and that some industries had survived and others had not. The process industry represents 25 per cent. of the whole economy of the north-east; that demonstrates its importance. So I understand why my hon. Friends are so keen to make sure that the Government understand and respond to its interests.</p>
	<p pid="a.491.0/15" class="indent">It being Five o'clock, the motion for the Adjournment of the sitting lapsed, without Question put.</p>
