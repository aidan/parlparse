</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-12-15b.177.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1495" speakername="Cheryl Gillan" colnum="177"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm091215/halltext/91215h0001.htm#09121532000444">
	<p pid="b.177.2/1">May I say what a pleasure it is to serve under your chairmanship, Mr. Atkinson? I am grateful to have the opportunity to raise concerns about health services in Buckinghamshire, particularly in Chesham and Amersham.</p>
	<p pid="b.177.2/2">When I applied for the debate, I did so not only in the interests of my constituents, but on behalf of my colleagues who are sitting here with me. I was the lead name for the debate, but I applied for it on behalf of my hon. Friends the Members for Aylesbury (Mr. Lidington) and for Wycombe (Mr. Goodman), and of my hon. and learned Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1394" name="Dominic Grieve">the Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Grieve)</phrase>. Unusually, I will also make some remarks on behalf of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40031" name="John Bercow">the right hon. Member for Buckingham (John Bercow)</phrase> who, as you know, Mr. Atkinson, presides over the House and is unable to participate in such debates. Nevertheless, he feels just as passionately as we do about health services in Buckinghamshire and, with your permission, Mr. Atkinson, I have some speaking notes that I intend to deploy on his behalf.</p>
	<p pid="b.177.2/3">I welcome the Minister and my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1603" name="Anne Milton">the Member for Guildford (Anne Milton)</phrase>, who speaks on health matters for the Conservatives, to the Chamber. I am delighted to see the Minister, because we did some sterling work together during the course of this Parliament on the Autism Act 2009. When that provision was just a raw Bill, the Government, in the shape of the Minister and his colleagues, chose to oppose it. However, with persuasion and after winning the vote on Second Reading, the Minister and his colleagues saw the light.</p>
	<p pid="b.177.2/4">We were able to exhibit-and I say this in a spirit of generosity to all the other parties-the House at its best and put an Act in place. I give notice to the Minister that in the interests of my constituents in Buckinghamshire I shall be holding his feet to the fire. I am looking forward to a wide and thorough consultation on the Autism Act, which will be part of our health care service. I hope that the Minister will bring the enlightenment that he eventually brought to the debate on the services provided to people with autism to this debate, which covers the wider health care services in Buckinghamshire.</p>
	<p pid="b.177.2/5">After more than a decade with Labour in power, it is fair to say that the NHS in Buckinghamshire is facing a crisis. We have called this debate to find out just what the Minister and the Government are going to do about that. There is no time for warm words; the stark reality is that the health service in Buckinghamshire is fast approaching breaking point.</p>
	<p pid="b.177.2/6">Buckinghamshire has one of the lowest-funded NHS systems in the country: it receives some 17 per cent. less per head than the UK average. Last year, we had the only primary care trust with a deficit of some &#163;7.5 million. Although we have relatively good health, we have only average care-those are not my words; they are the words of health care management professionals. Are we 17 per cent less in need or 17 per cent. healthier than other areas? I think not. Sadly, we have poor dental access and poor ambulance times, because of the size of the county. We also have a higher number of delayed hospital transfers and an ageing population. All our constituents are living longer, so the disparity between the formula that is adopted and the outcomes is starting to widen and become greater. I believe that my colleagues may allude to that matter in more detail.</p>
	<p pid="b.177.2/7">The financial situation is becoming dire. I believe that the Buckinghamshire Hospitals NHS Trust must find an efficiency saving of 3 per cent. annually, which is some &#163;11.5 million. In addition, the PCT is now paying the hospitals trust at 25 per cent. of the tariff for the rest of the year for over-performance against most in-patient and follow-up out-patient work, which adds another &#163;5.2 million of income loss and takes the total savings that have to be found to about &#163;17 million by the end of March.</p>
	<p pid="b.177.2/8">In fact, in Buckinghamshire, we are unable to fund the care records service, which amounts to some &#163;2.4 million, or Maternity Matters, which is about &#163;700,000. Our health service leaders have had to pull together a summit plan-in other words, an emergency plan. Given the hospitals trust's financial position and the PCT's structural deficit, more than &#163;20 million has to be taken out of the health service in Buckinghamshire between now and the end of the financial year.</p>
	<p pid="b.177.2/9">Remedial action has been taken to try to plug that gap. Attempts are being made to curb our urgent care demand, and our health service is aiming to make 100 fewer admissions a week and reduce the number of accident and emergency attendees by 30 per cent. I must tell the Minister that, after my last meeting with the hospitals trust, there is no indication that there have been any major shifts in that pattern at all, which means that the projected cost savings will not be made. We are also trying to reduce our GP referrals to hospital by 50 a day.</p>
	<p pid="b.177.2/10">Our GPs and other NHS staff are working like Trojans to see more patients, as well as offering community services and trying to reduce the elective and out-patient demand. They are trying to balance the books, but they are doing so against almost impossible odds. We are trying to move from one model of care to another far too rapidly, which is causing big problems. One could consider the scarcity of funds to be a positive challenge-indeed, many people who work in health service do, because they regard the glass as half full, not half empty. In the long term, we all want better care closer to home, and we want people to receive the right treatment at the right time. I believe that the administrators who head up our services are doing the very best that they can to deliver them. However, what we are experiencing on the ground is the alarming effect of a pace of change that is almost impossible to achieve. Buckinghamshire will be the first area virtually to tip over, not least because of the historical financial deficit.</p>
	<p pid="b.177.2/11">Clinics at Amersham hospital have been dramatically reduced, with many moving to Wycombe or Stoke Mandeville. That causes great difficulties for people who travel to get treatment. I can honestly say that some of the letters I have received are absolutely heart-breaking. Many of my elderly constituents find the journeys and the confusion of the changes almost impossible to deal with. Overall, more than 60 per cent. of the clinics can be maintained, but that means that there is a 40 per cent. reduction, which is an enormous drop by anyone's standards.</p>
	<p pid="b.177.2/12">The PCT has given notice to providers of primary counselling services that their services will end early next year, which, when combined with other cuts to Mind centres and the managed services, means most of the counselling services in Buckinghamshire will be removed in the very near future. Our ambulance services, which do a fantastic job, do not operate on a level playing field. The per capita allocation of NHS funds reduces payments to the so-called affluent areas, such as ours. However, the cost per capita of providing ambulance services is much higher than in urban areas, which puts even more pressure on the service in Buckinghamshire.</p>
	<p pid="b.177.2/13">With our services operating under such pressure, I am concerned about what will happen if we are hit by a flu epidemic and a harsh winter. Our senior managers have a mandatory duty to break even and deliver on budget, but they are not going to do so if it means jeopardising patient safety. There is a real possibility of a major problem if we are hit by a flu epidemic. I have been told by our senior personnel that the board of Buckinghamshire Hospitals NHS Trust takes seriously its responsibility for the stewardship of our finances, which ultimately are funded by the taxpayer, but that its commitment to patient safety and the quality of services is its top priority. That means, in my language, that our health care professionals-they cannot say this, but I can-will put people before their budgets and their careers, and that is true dedication. However, the years of unfair funding for Buckinghamshire are now coming home to roost. If there is a crisis this winter, what will the Minster do to help to deliver health services in Buckinghamshire, which are stretched to breaking point, to our constituents?</p>
	<p pid="b.177.2/14">I understand that we in Buckinghamshire are not alone in feeling the effects of the unfair funding and that similar effects are being felt in Hertfordshire, Berkshire, Hampshire and, indeed, Oxfordshire. Perhaps the Minister would confirm that many of those areas are approaching a financial crisis. I believe that the financial crisis is felt right across our area, and I am certainly not convinced that the advent of the South Central strategic health authority, which was formed on <phrase class="date" code="2006-07-01">1 July 2006</phrase>, has helped. The fact that that authority has had not one, but three chief executives in that time has hindered, rather than helped the situation-it brings a whole new meaning to the word &quot;continuity&quot;. However, I understand that that strategic health authority has reserve funds squirreled away, so perhaps the Minister would tell us the extent of those funds, which I understand could run to &#163;30 million-plus, and how we can access them to alleviate the problems faced by my constituents and others across the county.</p>
	<p pid="b.177.2/15">As I said at the beginning of my speech, I would like to make a few points on behalf of the right hon. Member for Buckingham, who has some specific concerns about his constituency. He has been contacted by several constituents concerned about the threat to mental health services and by people who are worried that the range of services might be reduced as a result of the planned review. He believes that the PCT might be planning to invest solely in cognitive behaviour therapy and wants reassurance that other forms of therapy will be recognised and receive investment.</p>
	<p pid="b.177.2/16">The right hon. Member for Buckingham is also concerned about Buckingham community hospital, where doctors and patients are worried about the new contract and are concerned that the reduction in the number of hours of care would be detrimental to the hospital. That has already caused the transfer to Milton Keynes of patients who would have been treated in Buckingham community hospital. I understand that there is much anger about the downgrading of the community hospital among his constituents, and fears among the staff, who feel that the new arrangements are worse. Under previous arrangements, GPs could continue to visit their patients, but that is no longer the case. It is essential that the need for budget cuts does not result in a second-class service for the residents of Buckingham and the surrounding area.</p>
	<p pid="b.177.2/17">Although unable to speak on the matter, the right hon. Member for Buckingham is no less concerned than my colleagues, who will speak in this debate, and me about the resources available for providing proper health care through the NHS to our constituents. I am sure that his comments would mirror some of my earlier remarks. I am particularly worried about the effect on NHS staff in Buckinghamshire. I have had talks, as have my colleagues, with the chief executive of the hospital trust and I know that it will try to reduce any redundancies to the absolute minimum. However, it has had to establish employee assistance and a redeployment bureau. Consultations with affected staff, although under way, mean that many of our dedicated personnel in the health service now fear for their jobs as we approach the Christmas season.</p>
	<p pid="b.177.2/18">I therefore ask the Minister not to put on the rose-tinted glasses of office when he responds, but to realise that with our existing structural budget deficit, the need for productivity improvement, the financial downturn and the fact that Buckinghamshire received 17 per cent. less funding than the national average, we have an ever-increasing problem that will not go away. To deliver in this financial year and just break even, the cost improvement programmes equate to stripping out about &#163;35 million in total. That would be asking a lot of any health service in any part of the county, but it is especially true in our area, where the demand is so high.</p>
	<p pid="b.177.2/19">What is particularly worrying is that the problem will be exacerbated in future. With a forecast increase of only 5.1 per cent. next year and little or no increase in the budgets thereafter, there will be reductions in funding in real terms, which will mean real cuts to our health service that cannot be concealed or dressed up by fancy words. They will come as a result of the actions that have been taken by the Government in power at the moment. Will the Minister tell me how he can help us in this financial year, how he will ensure that people in Buckinghamshire continue to receive a high-quality, safe and accessible health service and how it will be sustainable in future years? I am sure that he would not want his legacy in government to be the fact that people in Buckinghamshire do not get a decent national health service. I hope he can rise to the challenge and will not produce the usual official script.</p>

	<p pid="b.181.0/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1495" name="Cheryl Gillan">the Member for Chesham and Amersham (Mrs. Gillan)</phrase> on securing the debate. I should also declare an interest in two respects. Since I might refer to mental health services, I declare that I am an honorary vice-president of Buckinghamshire Mind. I should make it clear, moreover, that my family and I have been using local health services in the county throughout my time as a Member: all my four children were born at Stoke Mandeville hospital and, because of family illness, I have had occasion to visit the accident and emergency department at Wycombe general hospital, and both the accident and emergency and in-patient wards at Stoke Mandeville hospital within the past 10 days.</p>
	<p pid="b.181.0/2">My hon. Friend set out clearly in her speech the financial challenge the local NHS faces. Some of the problems we have faced over the years in persuading officials and Ministers to take those challenges seriously arise from the misleading impact of average statistics for the country, which show Buckinghamshire as being prosperous, healthy and therefore able to cope with significantly less than the average per capita funding for England. Of course, those averages sometimes conceal the fact that there are certainly pockets of poverty, both in Aylesbury and in High Wycombe, as I am sure my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1948" name="Paul Goodman">the Member for Wycombe (Mr. Goodman)</phrase> will say later. Certainly, anyone who visits Southcourt or Quarrendon in my constituency would not regard those estates as prosperous. There is a disparity in the county between the south, where the population is ageing rapidly, and the Aylesbury area, which is one of the fastest-growing parts of England and has a young population.</p>
	<p pid="b.181.0/3">It is wrong to assume that old people are passive these days. When I speak to GPs in my constituency, they say that elderly patients come in, describe their symptoms and then explain that they have looked their condition up on the internet and discovered that some new treatment is available. They then tell their doctor, in forthright terms, that they want that treatment and are unwilling to take no for an answer. They have high and increasing expectations that a previous generation of retired people did not have.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-12-15b.181.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1495" speakername="Cheryl Gillan" colnum="181"  time="009:46:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm091215/halltext/91215h0001.htm#09121532000446">
	<p pid="b.181.1/1">I had a case exactly like that in my surgery as recently as yesterday. A constituent had been told by his GP to look up what could be done for his condition, and he went back with what needed to be done. The GP would very much like to recommend the treatment but, of course, would be running against an ever-diminishing budget.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-12-15b.181.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1381" speakername="David Lidington" colnum="181"  time="009:46:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm091215/halltext/91215h0001.htm#09121532000447">
	<p pid="b.181.2/1">My hon. Friend is right, and all of us are finding such cases arising in our constituency work load. I do not know whether she recalls this, but I believe that it was the first of the strategic health authority's trinity of chief executives who questioned in a valedictory memorandum whether the current level of funding for Buckinghamshire was sufficient to maintain a core service at the level which local people are entitled to expect.</p>
	<p pid="b.181.2/2">My hon. Friend put it well: there is little argument today about how health services are evolving and ought to evolve in this country. I am certainly not going to stand here and say that there cannot ever be change, and I believe that most of my constituents want health services to be delivered to them at home or as close as possible to their home. Trends in medical science and the trend toward concentrating specialisms-the treatment of particular cancers or particular types of heart attack-in a limited number of hospitals where all the experts and the best equipment can be brought together are certain to continue and will provide better patient outcomes.</p>
	<p pid="b.181.2/3">The model for the future of a wide range of local, usually community-based services and in-patient stays in hospital reserved for serious conditions, for as short a time as possible, is one that I would endorse. However, my real fear about what is happening in Buckinghamshire is that although we are seeing that reconfiguration happen, it is driven not by clinical developments and priorities but by the urgency of making the books balance in a short period of time.</p>
	<p pid="b.181.2/4">The Buckinghamshire Hospitals NHS Trust and the Buckinghamshire primary care trust have agreed a financial plan that involves cutting the number of hospital admissions by 100 a week, and securing a 30 per cent. reduction in admissions to A and E. That all has to be achieved by the end of the current financial year, and we are already seeing the results. I had a letter from a constituent the other day in which she complained that she had received a letter offering her an appointment at Stoke Mandeville hospital for treatment for which she had been referred by her GP, but then she had a telephone call to say that the offer was being withdrawn because her case no longer fitted the new criteria that the PCT had imposed for financial reasons.</p>
	<p pid="b.181.2/5">I fear that community services, primary care and preventive services not only will not be developed in time to meet the demands of the new model of health care but are actually under acute strain at the moment. Let us look at what is happening with the PCT. I have been told by local GPs that the health visitor service has been cut, and moved from GP surgeries into a central office location. When I visited a GP surgery on one of my most deprived estates the other week, I was told by the nurses and other staff that it is sometimes difficult to get hold of a health visitor because health visitors often do not know from one day to the next where they will be based or which people they will be able to see. Comprehensive coverage by health visitors of the poorest areas of Aylesbury may still be an aspiration, but it is not happening in practice.</p>
	<p pid="b.181.2/6">The same is true for district nurses and the school nurse service, which is desperately stretched. The truth about primary care in our county is that anything that is not the subject of a specific Government target is liable to be squeezed and cut.</p>
	<p pid="b.181.2/7">There is little scope for GP innovation that would push up the standard of service. GPs tell me that they feel frustrated when they come up with a new idea but are then told by the PCT that unless it can afford to fund the innovation throughout the county, no practice is allowed to provide it. That undermines professional responsibility and stifles the possibility of some real improvement in the quality of health care locally.</p>
	<p pid="b.181.2/8">I have already referred to the pressure on Wycombe and Stoke Mandeville hospitals to cut admissions and attendances at A and E, but we have learned recently that there is to be a further regional review of hospital capacity, which will involve Berkshire and Buckinghamshire and possibly Oxfordshire as well-my understanding is that the John Radcliffe hospital is also under acute financial pressure. Local people will greet the prospect of a further hospital review with horror, and there will be fear that another round of hospital cuts is on its way.</p>
	<p pid="b.181.2/9">If we are to move to the new model of health care, it is clear that an effective ambulance service will be important. Paramedics need to be able to reach patients quickly and to stabilise their condition, and we need an effective ambulance service if more patients are to be transported significant distances to the specialist hospitals and units of the future. However, the South Central Ambulance Service NHS Trust is already struggling to meet its targets. Yesterday, I had a letter from the chairman of the trust, who said that services in rural areas of the south-central region in particular were under huge strain.</p>
	<p pid="b.181.2/10">The other element that is missing from the discussion about the new model of NHS care is the place of county council social services. As the Minister will know, Buckinghamshire county council is already a floor authority, and news has just come through that it will again receive the smallest grant increase of any shire county in England for the next financial year. The eligibility criteria for access to social care are being tightened year on year. My fear is that, inevitably, that will mean that more elderly and disabled people, and more people with a chronic illness who are unable to qualify for care that they might previously have received, will fall over or have accidents. They will be admitted to A and E, and possibly for an in-patient stay in hospital. Paradoxically, that would increase rather than reduce the financial pressures that some of the reductions and reconfigurations in service have been designed to achieve.</p>
	<p pid="b.181.2/11">In conclusion, I want to leave the Minister in no doubt that those are not just my views as a politician. The view of nearly every doctor and nurse in my constituency to whom I have spoken is that the local health service in our county is struggling, and that, yes, there needs to be a coherent look at the configuration and pattern of health care in Buckinghamshire, but that that needs to be linked to an examination of the funding system to ensure that people get the quality of service they are entitled to through payment of their taxes.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-12-15b.183.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1948" speakername="Paul Goodman" colnum="183"  time="009:58:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm091215/halltext/91215h0002.htm#09121532000448">
	<p pid="b.183.0/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1495" name="Cheryl Gillan">the Member for Chesham and Amersham (Mrs. Gillan)</phrase> on securing this debate. Despite her heavy commitments elsewhere, she has proved again this morning that she is a relentless and doughty champion of the health care and other interests of her constituents, as all of us in Buckinghamshire try to be. It is worth putting on the record once again that our colleague <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40031" name="John Bercow">the right hon. Member for Buckingham (John Bercow)</phrase> cannot be with us, but my hon. Friend spoke for him.</p>
	<p pid="b.183.0/2">I cannot rival my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1381" name="David Lidington">the Member for Aylesbury (Mr. Lidington)</phrase> in my use of the local NHS, although I have been through Wycombe hospital accident and emergency and in a ward there for a brief period, so I have had some personal experience of the NHS in Bucks, as well as the constituency experience that my hon. Friends have had as Members of Parliament. However, I do not want to start a Monty Python-type competition, where colleagues and others compare their experiences of woe, especially-on a more serious note-given the experiences of some of my constituents, which I have heard about in my surgery and outside it over the past eight years. Given that I am leaving the House at the election, I shall speak at least partly in a valedictory spirit.</p>
	<p pid="b.183.0/3">In my eight years as a Member of Parliament, undoubtedly the most important constituency issue has been health care: no other single issue compares to it in terms of the interest, concern and anxiety it arouses. In those eight years, the cuts and closures at Wycombe hospital-the loss of our children's ward, maternity ward and full A and E service-have created a huge ruction in Buckinghamshire. I want to make three simple points about that whole experience.</p>
	<p pid="b.183.0/4">First, when I arrived as a new candidate in 2000, I visited Wycombe hospital and spoke to a gentleman called Roy Darby, who had been the chief executive there-Wycombe and Stoke Mandeville had recently been merged into a trust-for at least 10 years and, I think, longer. The NHS has always been primarily a nationally orientated and directed service, but the structures were reasonably stable and people such as Roy Darby knew their way round the local NHS backwards and exhibited a particular sense of responsibility, ownership and knowledge of it.</p>
	<p pid="b.183.0/5">Since my being elected our regional health authority has been merged, as my hon. Friend the Member for Chesham and Amersham said. The three primary care groups that existed at the time of my election became three primary care trusts, some of which had deficits-as my hon. Friend the Member for Aylesbury is fond of saying, no one has ever found the balancing surpluses-and then became a single Bucks-wide primary care trust. The mental health trust has been merged with Oxfordshire and the ambulance trust has been merged. Wycombe hospital had just gone in with Stoke. We have experienced a kind of permanent revolution, as in Mao's China. Local people undoubtedly feel that their ownership of the service, which was never particularly strong, has been compromised in the past eight years, and that when cuts and closures have been put on the table, besides some of the improvements that have taken place, they have not had any say in what has happened.</p>
	<p pid="b.183.0/6">Secondly, on the cuts and closures, as I have said, good things have happened and are happening at Wycombe hospital. I have good relations with the management team there and with the PCT, as my colleagues do: we try to work together. However, in 2004, when this wave of cuts and closures was announced and rippled through large parts of the country-including in substantial areas of the south of England, where Government Members of Parliament appeared to be less well represented than Conservative and Liberal Democrat MPs-there was a feeling that managers had been sent in from outside to ram these changes through.</p>
	<p pid="b.183.0/7">Thirdly, the main substance of my hon. Friends' speeches is the problem with the funding formula. In a rational dispensation, spending would be related to need, meaning that spending would largely be related to age. As my hon. Friends have said, we have an ageing population in Buckinghamshire, particularly in south Buckinghamshire. In a rational dispensation, deprivation funding would be allocated from a separate budget. Under such a system it is unlikely that Buckinghamshire would receive 17 per cent. less per head than the national average, which is the case. I am sure that my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1603" name="Anne Milton">the Member for Guildford (Anne Milton)</phrase> will say more about this later.</p>
	<p pid="b.183.0/8">Essentially, given the pace and scale of change that my hon. Friends are describing, in Buckinghamshire we are like the Red Queen in &quot;Alice's Adventures in Wonderland&quot;, who had to run to stand still. Given the funding disadvantage, our NHS staff and managers have to climb a steep incline to get on top of their deficits and manage the restructuring at a time of great change, because there is an enormous knock-on effect from our having 17 per cent. less funding per head. For example, there is a clear effect on my poorer constituents in areas such as Castlefield and Micklefield. My hon. Friend the Member for Aylesbury mentioned the poorer areas in his constituency, such as Quarrendon. In effect, our poorer constituents, because they are not surrounded by others who are as poor as they are, are disadvantaged compared with poorer constituents elsewhere living alongside those who are as poor as they are. That has had a substantial effect on communities in my constituency containing people who may not speak English as a first language, some of whom have recently arrived and many of whom may not always have grasped how rapid the pace of change has been and what effect these changes were having on their local services.</p>

	<p pid="b.185.0/1">May I say how much my hon. Friend will be missed as his constituents' representative when he leaves the House? He has taken the headlines on many occasions, particularly in respect of health and health services, defending his constituents' rights to a decent service. Does he agree that this double hit on those people in our constituencies who are less wealthy and have less disposable income is exacerbated by poor public transport systems? Therefore, the changes that accompany this downturn in financial circumstances often mean moving out-patient clinics, even though people have established a pattern of travel and find it almost impossible to reorganise their travel arrangements to get to farther-flung clinics. They are disproportionately affected at a time when they are trying to be treated by the health service, and their poverty means that, in many instances, they are unable to travel to some of the changed services.</p>

	<p pid="b.185.1/1">I agree. I will return to that point in a moment. As my hon. Friend the Member for Aylesbury rightly said, one effect of change being implemented is that transport has to take the strain, and that applies whether the ambulance service is involved, or whether poorer people are travelling who may not have access to their own private transport.</p>
	<p pid="b.185.1/2">I have touched on the implications of the change for my poorer constituents. Obviously, in respect of the better-off ones, if they are elderly they are still entitled to such care. That group of people is more likely to need the NHS than others, as my hon. Friends have said.</p>
	<p pid="b.185.1/3">The funding shortage is having a paralysing effect on change in the local NHS. Wycombe hospital and Stoke, in the trust, want to achieve foundation status. We support foundation status, as the Government do, but the deficit, and the shuffling of deficits back and forth between the hospital trusts and the PCT, is a millstone round the neck of the foundation status application. Our health service is prevented from moving forward by the deficit. As my hon. Friend the Member for Aylesbury said, not only can it not move forward; we are now faced with the hospital review to which he referred. I am sure that my constituents and our local paper, the <i>Bucks Free Press</i><i>,</i> will look on that with a searching light.</p>
	<p pid="b.185.1/4">I will not labour the point that my hon. Friend the Member for Chesham and Amersham made about transport, but if, at the same time as going through the changes, doctors are being told to look for ways of not referring patients, the stress on patients who are referred will fall on the transport system. The Chamber will have noted what my hon. Friend said about the ambulance trust.</p>
	<p pid="b.185.1/5">All together, some good things have happened in the Buckinghamshire NHS Hospitals Trust, but the system is under great strain. With the approach of an election, in which I shall not be participating, many of my constituents will cast their minds back to 1997 and the claim of the then Leader of the Opposition, Tony Blair, that voters had 24 hours to save the NHS. They will look at their local NHS and acknowledge the many good things that have happened, but they will remember that in 1997 Wycombe had full A and E, a maternity unit and a children's unit. Although they will understand that change must happen, it cannot be forced through against a background of having, unfairly, 17 per cent. less funding than the national average.</p>

	<p pid="b.186.0/1">It is a pleasure to be able to participate in this debate. I hope to do so briefly, because much of what I want to say has been said by my hon. Friends. In particular, I thank my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1495" name="Cheryl Gillan">the Member for Chesham and Amersham (Mrs. Gillan)</phrase> for securing this debate and opening it.</p>
	<p pid="b.186.0/2">It might be helpful for the Minister if I try to step back a little from the immediacy of the funding issues that we have described, and go back to some basic principles. It will be widely acknowledged on both sides of the Chamber that NHS resources are not infinite. If my party has the opportunity of forming a Government, we will face exactly the same funding constraints, particularly in the current financial climate, that the Government must face. However, those constraints should not allow us to engage in propaganda exercises to pretend that something is when it is not. My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1948" name="Paul Goodman">the Member for Wycombe (Mr. Goodman)</phrase> rightly highlighted the extent to which the Government have met the promises that they made pre-1997, but it is impossible to reach that conclusion for Buckinghamshire as a whole and south Buckinghamshire in particular because of the extent to which services have been curbed or cut.</p>
	<p pid="b.186.0/3">A live issue is the extent to which an area should receive funding in relation to its need or indices of deprivation. The county, including my constituency, is prosperous by national standards, so one can understand that the Government might argue that the population's health care needs are likely to be proportionately less. That may be correct, and the indices of overall health in Buckinghamshire do not seem to be very bad, but the difficulty that arises with that approach is that as services are progressively phased out, those who may need them will be unable to access any service at all. That is the hallmark of the problem that I face in my constituency. It consists of some people who are very rich, and some who are on middling incomes and who can manage, but it also has pockets of extreme poverty which is every bit as bad in one or two places as in inner-city areas in London.</p>
	<p pid="b.186.0/4">One of my wards was, and still may be, ranked 13th in the indices of deprivation in the south-east, although that is not as bad as some of the wards in the constituencies of some of my hon. Friends here today. People there find that the services that they need and cannot access through the private sector are simply not available in the health service.</p>
	<p pid="b.186.0/5">This is an old theme, and the second or third time that we have had a similar debate about the problem of funding of health services in Buckinghamshire. Returning to that theme, I well remember that as one of the Government's first actions when they came to office in 1997-I give this to the Minister by way of illustration of the problem-they removed the tax breaks for people of pensionable age taking out private health insurance. I remember that vividly, because the consequence was to create the first winter crisis after I was elected to Parliament. Those people could no longer access private health care, particularly in my constituency, or beds in private hospitals when they had pneumonia in winter, so they started to fill the hospital at Wycombe. I remember the administrators saying that they believed that that was the cause of that sudden surge, thereby making it even harder for those who were more deprived to obtain access.</p>
	<p pid="b.186.0/6">How does the problem of chronic underfunding manifest itself? My hon. Friends have made some important points, and I do not want to repeat them, but I endorse what they said. I shall give the Minister some examples that may interest him in understanding what is going on. The first has been alluded to, but I am returning to it. It is the problem of the reverse turf war between social services and the health service. Generally in a turf war, people are told to get off someone else's patch, but throughout my time as a Member of Parliament since 1997 I have witnessed the struggle between social services and the health service in asking the other to come on to their patch and take over responsibility for the services that they should provide.</p>
	<p pid="b.186.0/7">We have discussed acute services, and I want to move away from that a little. A matter that fills my surgeries weekly is arguments about elderly people with modest circumstances in hospitals-where they will go next to be cared for, what the element of nursing care should be and who should take responsibility for it. Leaving aside the fact that I am perfectly aware that individuals may have a financial interest because of the extent to which they must pay from their pockets, that happens even when people will never be in a position to make a contribution to their care if they move into a care home. It is a source of endless correspondence, and all because the PCT and social services want to pass responsibility round and round because neither has the resources to meet the need.</p>
	<p pid="b.186.0/8">That is one example. The second is the PCT's approach to those who are, perhaps fortunately, a small minority but who, for one reason or another, need specialist provision that falls outside the competence of the Buckinghamshire Hospitals NHS Trust and Thames valley hospitals. I am sure that the Minister will acknowledge that what should be a reasonably rapid bureaucratic process, by which referral to a specialist London hospital that will provide what is sometimes life-saving care takes weeks, almost inevitably requires my involvement in writing letters to him, or to the head of the PCT or the regional trust trying to kick someone into acknowledging that specialist provision that can be accessed only at, for example, St. Thomas's hospital, should be provided.</p>
	<p pid="b.186.0/9">There is a constant, underlying theme of difficulty in moving the bureaucratic logjam. Although 99 times out of 100 we will probably end up getting what we asked for because it is the right thing to have-I say that to reassure the Minister-in the meantime, the patient and their family can legitimately claim that the wait and delay have had a significant impact on the health of the individual. I do not regard that as acceptable.</p>
	<p pid="b.186.0/10">Given the human condition, I know that we will never have a perfect service, and I do not expect one. However, the amount of time, effort and energy that is devoted to bureaucracy is worrying and must also cost money. In my role as an MP, I keep thinking about the amount of money that could be used in front-line services that is being squandered in shoring up the bureaucratic paper round. That process dilutes the amount of money that I and wealthy members of my constituency pay in tax, before the money can be translated into the service and used to the advantage of the person who needs it. Such bureaucracy adds to that process.</p>
	<p pid="b.186.0/11">Mental health provision has been mentioned. It is a subject of interest to me, and in the past I have been involved with Mind, when I was vice-chairman of a group in London. Mental health provision in the county is, frankly, poor. That is not the fault of the professionals who provide it, and if I were to be optimistic I would say that it is perhaps on a mildly improving graph. There was a period about two years ago when mental health provision had become so bad that I thought it had reached the abyss.</p>
	<p pid="b.186.0/12">My hon. Friends have highlighted the issue of counselling services, and I would like to pick up that subject to illustrate my point. Counselling services are accessed directly on referral by a GP. One of the features of the briefing that was helpfully provided by Buckinghamshire primary care trust, is that it wants to cut costs by lowering the number of admissions to accident and emergency and referrals to hospitals. We all know that mental health problems exist, and with the economic downturn and the various other financial pressures on families, I get the distinct impression that that trend will be rising.</p>
	<p pid="b.186.0/13">Counselling and referral systems operated in the county very cheaply. Buckinghamshire PCT gave a &#163;300,000 funding subsidy, which it is now withdrawing. Of that, &#163;90,000 is being withdrawn from Bucks Mind which, as the Minister will know, provides a largely voluntary service. On the face of it, that is not a large sum of money, although I accept that in the context of the PCT this is probably an essential cut to try to meet budgetary constraints and to save money. However, if that service cannot be provided because the money has been withdrawn, what will the consequences be on the need to access more specialist services through accident and emergency or elsewhere?</p>
	<p pid="b.186.0/14">This is a classic illustration of where by trying to make savings and cuts of this kind-particularly the virtual closure of a voluntary service that simply needs help with its overheads-we are likely to put greater pressure on the health service elsewhere. When the cut was proposed, it was suggested that the referral service for counselling to Buckinghamshire Mind was not a good system. However, Buckinghamshire PCT was clearly aware of Mind's effectiveness, as it had been happy to fund it without any difficulty for years in the past, arguing that it was extraordinarily good value for money. The fact that the PCT now believes that such funding will no longer be possible, illustrates that a series of warped priorities have been imposed on it due to the current problems that it faces.</p>
	<p pid="b.186.0/15">I will not go on at great length, but I will conclude with another illustration of my point. The ambulance service has been mentioned, and we learn that although the apparent needs of the area are not as great as elsewhere, the service has seen an inexorable rise in volume demand by more than 6 per cent. per annum in recent years. It is currently running at 8 per cent. up on last year, and has pointed out that that is not sustainable given that only 60 per cent. of patients go to hospital when an ambulance is called out, and only 10 per cent. need extended hospital treatment on admission. That strongly suggests that the ambulance service is being used as a bottom-line safety net for the provision of primary care services to the local community-indeed, I know that to be the case.</p>
	<p pid="b.186.0/16">All of us on this side of the Chamber are supportive of the Thames Valley air ambulance service, which is entirely voluntarily funded. One of its complaints is that it is being used for routine hospital transfers to save the ambulance trust cash. It resents that because it is a specialist emergency service that intervenes when somebody has to be transported rapidly from one place-often removed from a road-to a hospital. I hope that the Minister will forgive me this digressory tour to illustrate what is happening on the ground in our area.</p>
	<p pid="b.186.0/17">I do not expect the Minister to be a miracle worker. I know that his Government have wrecked the public finances and now have to pick up the pieces, and I fully appreciate that the area I represent will never receive the same amount of funding per head of population as a place such as Liverpool or another great city that has higher levels of deprivation. However, we cannot go on in this way. At some point, this will all go badly wrong for the Government. Illustrations of serious failures will be visited on the Minister, which will be entirely due to a failure to do any creative, sensible, medium-term planning for how to secure effective services in health care for our constituents locally. It requires doing something more than submitting the poor old primary care trust-which in my view does its best-to an endless cycle of crisis management.</p>

	<p pid="b.189.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1495" name="Cheryl Gillan">the hon. Member for Chesham and Amersham (Mrs. Gillan)</phrase> on securing this debate, and on getting a good turnout from her colleagues, who have all spoken passionately about the health needs of their county.</p>
	<p pid="b.189.0/2">The hon. Lady spoke about the impact of 12 years of Labour rule in Buckinghamshire. However, to introduce a note of discord, we must remember that when the Conservatives left office in 1997, we were spending a third less than the European average on health, and the consequences were there for all to see. The problems about access to health care continued for some time, and when I arrived in Parliament four years later, my first debate in this Chamber was on orthopaedic waiting times in Norfolk. At that time-I am sure that it was similar in Buckinghamshire-people sometimes waited for three years to get to hospital for a hip or knee joint operation. The situation was not good in those days, and there was a strong case for increasing investment in the health service. If that investment had not happened, I have no doubt that the position in Buckinghamshire would be even worse than it is today. None the less, the hon. Lady pointed to some important issues about how funding is allocated around the country.</p>
	<p pid="b.189.0/3">What the hon. Lady said about her experience and what her hon. Friends described reminded me of the situation in Norfolk-a rural county with quite an elderly population. The pressures and strains on the health service in such an environment are very real. The ambulance service not meeting its target for getting to emergency calls on time was one issue that the hon. Lady raised. Poor access to dental care was another example that she gave. The ever increasing number of emergency admissions to acute hospitals is causing enormous strain. Her hon. Friends also made the point that there was the sense of the whole system under intense strain, and that is a picture that I see in my county of Norfolk.</p>

	<p pid="b.190.0/1">I could have added that we also have problems with low rates of Chlamydia screening. We have problems supporting people quitting smoking. We have problems with proactive management of long-term conditions. I did not give the whole list, because I wanted to set the scene for the debate, but I do not want the hon. Gentleman to diminish the problems by trying to draw an arcane parallel with what happened 12 years ago. I am talking about today. The Government who came in 12 years ago also removed the tax breaks for private health care from my constituents, many of whom then felt that they could not afford it and fell back on the NHS.</p>

	<p pid="b.190.1/1">I do not in any way wish to diminish the problems. I am simply saying that I see many of the same problems in my county of Norfolk. I intended to go on to discuss mental health, which the hon. Lady and some of her hon. Friends also discussed. Mental health is at a particular disadvantage in the health service because it does not benefit from any centrally imposed target. Such targets have driven improved access in other areas of health care, but one consequence of targets is that areas that are not targeted lose out. In many cases, people in Buckinghamshire and elsewhere wait for months on end for access to cognitive behaviour therapy and other objectively approved therapies that can help people to recover, get them back to work and so on. Access is appalling.</p>
	<p pid="b.190.1/2">The hon. Lady, in her intervention, and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1394" name="Dominic Grieve">the hon. and learned Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Grieve)</phrase> lamented the loss of subsidy for private health care, which is something that causes me real concern. Do the Conservatives propose a reintroduction of that subsidy? If the hon. Lady and the hon. and learned Gentleman lamented its loss, the clear implication is that they want it back.</p>

	<p pid="b.191.0/1">What the hon. Gentleman has just said is a complete load of nonsense. I made the position clear. The reality in the area that I represent is that if everyone in the area solely made use of the national health service, the system would collapse. Because there are wealthy people, many of them do not do that. After 1997, when certain tax breaks for the elderly to get private health care were removed, more of them became dependent on the NHS. I used that example to illustrate how a bed use crisis developed over a winter in one of my local hospitals; on the evidence of the administrators and doctors, the crisis was entirely the result of that change. I simply used it to illustrate the consequences, in an area where services are already stretched, of introducing another element into the equation.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-12-15b.191.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1736" speakername="Norman Lamb" colnum="191"  time="010:27:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm091215/halltext/91215h0003.htm#09121532000456">
	<p pid="b.191.1/1">I am grateful for that clarification. The hon. Member for Chesham and Amersham said that the funding formula delivers 17 per cent. less for her area than the national average. There is concern in many parts of the country that the funding formula does not sufficiently recognise the cost of delivering health care in rural areas, particularly in areas with an elderly population. Even if an elderly population happens to be relatively well off, they still have health needs. It still costs money to provide for operations in acute hospitals and so on. However, the funding formula does not appear to recognise that sufficiently.</p>
	<p pid="b.191.1/2">All the problems that the hon. Lady described, fairly and accurately so far as health services in Buckinghamshire are concerned, are likely to become significantly worse unless we are smart about how we use the available resources in the health service. Whichever party wins the general election next year, the prospects for the health service look bleak, because even if we ring-fence, protect, or safeguard funding for the NHS, the reality is that throughout the developed world, we are seeing rises in health costs. That has happened over many decades, and that trend is likely to continue with an ageing population and with lifestyle conditions such as obesity, and others caused by alcohol abuse and so on.</p>
	<p pid="b.191.1/3">Another factor is the cost of new drugs coming on stream. A fortnight ago, I talked to a group of consultants in Norfolk who told me that two new drugs approved by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence had a cost impact on Norfolk PCT of about &#163;2.5 million. That is from a fixed budget, not a budget that is increased by that amount to fund it, so something else has to give. The impact of an ageing population, new drugs coming on stream and lifestyle conditions means that we have rising health costs at a time when health budgets are likely to be fixed or rising very slowly. That creates the potential for a perfect storm, and the risk is that the most vulnerable lose out in those circumstances. Some of the public health services to which the hon. Lady referred are often most at risk.</p>
	<p pid="b.191.1/4">When the health service was last under financial pressure, in 2005-06, the Select Committee on Health concluded that services such as mental health and public health programmes were cut, rather than services that might be able to take the strain a little better. There was no attempt to improve productivity at that time, or no success at improving productivity. Services such as mental health took the hit.</p>
	<p pid="b.191.1/5">There is a risk that when the financial pressure increases, crisis management takes over and there is a process of slash and burn. Instead of doing that, we must consider how we can redesign services to improve the efficient use of resources in the health service. One problem is that financial levers in the health service incentivise activity. We pay acute hospitals more and more for doing more activity. We do not pay to optimise health care and quality. We do not pay to incentivise primary care to keep people out of hospitals. The system of payment by results was criticised by Mark Britnell, the former director of commissioning in the Department of Health. Just before he left in the summer, he said at a conference in London that there was an urgent need to abolish or radically reform payment by results. That is the Government's own system, and it was the director of commissioning who made that case.</p>
	<p pid="b.191.1/6">The Government have introduced a concept called practice-based commissioning, which is designed to encourage primary care to do more and to take work that is currently undertaken in acute hospitals and do it closer to home, in the community. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1381" name="David Lidington">The hon. Member for Aylesbury (Mr. Lidington)</phrase> made a very good point. When GPs go to the PCT with proposals for services that they could provide under practice-based commissioning, all too often they are turned down. I understand the concern expressed by the hon. Member for Chesham and Amersham that sometimes we try to redesign services too fast, but when there are opportunities to develop community-based services around GP practices, those proposals are rejected by PCTs, which simply refuse to engage in the whole concept of practice-based commissioning. The person responsible for practice-based commissioning for the Department of Health has himself said that the concept appears to be failing and is almost dead in the water. That system to encourage GPs to do more, closer to home, appears to be failing. What should the way forward be, given the acute financial squeeze on public services such as health, which means that little new money is coming in and that costs are rising?

	<p pid="b.192.0/1">Order. I am sorry to interrupt the hon. Gentleman, but I would be grateful if he would keep an eye on the clock. He has been speaking for more than 10 minutes, and we need to hear the Minister.</p>

	<p pid="b.192.1/1">I am grateful for that reminder, Mr. Atkinson.</p>
	<p pid="b.192.1/2">Let me summarise. We need to decentralise power and accountability so that Buckinghamshire PCT is accountable to its local community. We need to integrate health and social care, focusing particularly on those with chronic conditions so that we keep them out of hospital and prevent crises from occurring. We need to break down the divide between primary and secondary care. Finally, we need to get NHS financial incentives working so that we can focus on the prevention of ill health and on health and well-being. We can then end the crazy process of simply incentivising more and more activity that does not optimise health in the community in Buckinghamshire or anywhere else.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-12-15b.193.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1603" speakername="Anne Milton" colnum="193"  time="010:40:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm091215/halltext/91215h0003.htm#09121532000459">
	<p pid="b.193.0/1">I, too, congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1495" name="Cheryl Gillan">the Member for Chesham and Amersham (Mrs. Gillan)</phrase> on securing the debate. I welcome the fact that she also spoke on behalf of the constituents of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40031" name="John Bercow">the right hon. Member for Buckingham (John Bercow)</phrase>, who presides over this place.</p>
	<p pid="b.193.0/2">My hon. Friend described PCT and local health care services that are in absolute crisis. She rightly highlighted the fact that the current reconfigurations are taking place much too quickly to enable standards of care and quality to be maintained. She highlighted the 40 per cent. cut at clinics in Amersham and the complete cut in counselling services.</p>
	<p pid="b.193.0/3">As my hon. Friend said, the right hon. Member for Buckingham is concerned about mental health services-&#163;35 million has been stripped out just so that they can break even. Our greatest concern is that it is precisely mental health services that are being cut back to deal with our financial deficit. As the Minister is well aware, mental illness costs this country &#163;77 billion. Sadly, after 12 years of this Government, they remain a Cinderella service and they are very vulnerable.</p>
	<p pid="b.193.0/4">My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1381" name="David Lidington">the Member for Aylesbury (Mr. Lidington)</phrase> spoke of the reduction in health visitors, school nurses and district nurses and of particular concern at the Wycombe and Stoke Mandeville hospitals. He also spoke of his extensive use of NHS care, which is perhaps why he looks so well this morning.</p>
	<p pid="b.193.0/5">My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1948" name="Paul Goodman">the Member for Wycombe (Mr. Goodman)</phrase> talked of his constituents' massive concerns about the significant changes at Wycombe hospital. He spoke at length about reconfigurations and the fact that the Government have continued the ghastly cycle of constant change.</p>
	<p pid="b.193.0/6">I sat on the Health Committee when it undertook an inquiry into reconfigurations, and there has been one reconfiguration every 18 months since the NHS started. At the time, the Committee highlighted the significant loss of focus that occurs following reconfigurations, as well as their absolutely paralysing effect, and that has never been truer than it is today. At the end of the day, reconfigurations deliver few cost savings; in fact, they are a cost in themselves.</p>
	<p pid="b.193.0/7">The funding formula is the crux of the debate, and my hon. Friend the Member for Aylesbury rightly pointed out that the supply of money is not infinite. However, demand probably is. When I first trained as a nurse, people would come into A and E wheeling their hernia in a wheelbarrow in front of them, but expectations today are such that they probably would not accept a 1-inch hernia. Expectations have rightly gone up, but the demand is a constant pressure on the NHS, which does not have an infinite supply of money.</p>
	<p pid="b.193.0/8">There is rightly concern about the dance that takes place between the NHS and social services, as my hon. Friend the Member for Aylesbury pointed out. At times such as this, everybody scurries around trying to dump the costs of care on somebody else. In my constituency, there is concern that the move to reconfigure services and look after people in their own homes will see the NHS dump costs on social services, which face similar budgetary constraints. The patient ends up being looked after in their own home and receiving worse care and services-less physiotherapy and less occupational therapy. Indeed, they are often unnoticed by services.</p>
	<p pid="b.193.0/9">On the funding formula, I must tell <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1736" name="Norman Lamb">the hon. Member for North Norfolk (Norman Lamb)</phrase> that the issue is not just what we spend, but how we spend it. Buckinghamshire receives 17 per cent. less funding than the average, but as my hon. Friend the Member for Chesham and Amersham rightly said, her constituents' needs are not 17 per cent. lower than the average. The cost of providing ambulance services and many other services in areas such as Buckinghamshire is also greater than the average. The Government White Paper &quot;Our health, our care, our say&quot; was quite explicit about the fact that changes in services should not be made in response to short-term budgetary constraints, but that is exactly what we are seeing.</p>
	<p pid="b.193.0/10">Healthy and wealthy areas often have older populations with a much greater need for health care services. As has rightly been said, it is simply not the case that wealthy areas have less need. Although such areas are relatively affluent, they are the big users of health care services. Wealthy areas also have significant, albeit small, areas of deprivation, and people should not live in such areas, which do not attract the significant funding that other areas do.</p>
	<p pid="b.193.0/11">When I sat on the Health Committee, we also did a report on budgetary deficits, and I point the Minister to the work of Professor Sheila Asantha, who looked at the impact of the Government's funding formula on wealthy areas. She pointed out that those living in wealthy areas get the worst health care services, because the funding formula is skewed towards areas of deprivation, which need money for public health improvement but do not necessarily have demand for health care services.</p>
	<p pid="b.193.0/12">The Government have never fully understood that issue. In this season of good will, I do not want to make too many party political points, but I hope that the Minister can respond and demonstrate that he has some understanding of the difference between money for public health improvements, which needs to go to deprived areas, and money for health care services.</p>
	<p pid="b.193.0/13">We need to separate the money for health care service delivery from the money for public health improvements, and that is the Conservative party's policy. As I am sure the Minister is aware, improving public health takes more than money in the health service. In many ways, it is not appropriate to deliver such measures via the health service-we also need social and economic change if we are to make a difference. That is exactly why we have seen health care inequalities rise despite the Government's best efforts. The Government have been ill informed.</p>
	<p pid="b.193.0/14">Targets have been mentioned, but not as much as they should have been. Again, as I said, the issue is not just the money we spend but how we spend it. I recently went to a conference attended by a lot of senior doctors and surgeons, although I will not identify it because of the comments that were made. However, there was quite a lot of talk about targets, and that is the same wherever I go. Those at the conference went on and on about targets distorting clinical priorities. Indeed, people in the audience started talking about the fact that they now have training days to work out how to play the system-it is called gaming.</p>
	<p pid="b.193.0/15">The problem with process-driven targets is that care that does not have a target simply does not happen. The Government have never fully understood the difference between a process-driven target and an outcome. To take as an example follow-up for long-term conditions, many people with diabetes and conditions such as epilepsy need follow-up in secondary care; however, they currently do not get it because of Government targets relating to first appointments. The process is driven entirely by centrally-driven Government priorities, not clinical needs.</p>
	<p pid="b.193.0/16">My hon. Friend the Member for Aylesbury mentioned paperwork, of which targets attract a huge amount. We have many people now employed in the health service solely to deal with that. There are outstanding questions, but I realise that time is short so I shall draw my comments to a close.</p>
	<p pid="b.193.0/17">Perhaps the Minister can explain what is happening to the &#163;30 million of reserves that the strategic health authority currently holds. What plans do the Government have to look again at the funding formula? Can the Minister state, hand on heart, that the reconfigurations in the past 12 years have produced better delivery of health care services? Does he understand how damaging that change has been, and how much it has cost?</p>

Their plea, essentially, when we get to the bones of it, is &quot;More money for Buckinghamshire NHS, please.&quot; That may be a bit of a shorthand version, but I think that is essentially it. They raised some specific issues that time will not allow me to cover, and I am sure that the NHS organisations in Buckinghamshire that will be following the debate will take forward some of the detailed points.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-12-15b.195.4" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1512" speakername="Phil Hope" colnum="195"  time="010:51:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm091215/halltext/91215h0003.htm#09121532000464">
	<p pid="b.195.4/1">The hon. Lady is of course in regular conversation with her NHS organisations and I am sure they would be delighted to write to her about the details that she and her hon. Friends have raised, which are of course a matter for local NHS organisations.</p>
	<p pid="b.195.4/2">We have had a decade of expansion and of a massive catch-up in health funding, which has yielded big improvements throughout the country, Buckinghamshire included. Opposition Members will know that in Buckinghamshire 99 per cent. of patients attending accident and emergency are now seen within four hours; 91 per cent. of patients now receive treatment requiring hospital admission within 18 weeks, with that figure rising to 97 per cent. for day cases; and more than 93 per cent. of suspected cancer patients are seen by a specialist within a fortnight of referral. As far as delivering outcomes in the past decade, those figures are a testament not only to the additional funding from the Government, but to the hard work of local NHS staff, whom I thank for their efforts. We are determined to bank that progress and to continue to improve standards in a very different financial climate.</p>
	<p pid="b.195.4/3">I think that every hon. Member who has spoken has raised the issue of the national funding formula and suggested that it penalises Buckinghamshire unfairly. The new funding formula that we are using was developed by the Advisory Committee on Resource Allocation, an independent panel of experts. It has been designed to meet the twin objectives of equal access for equal need, and reducing health inequalities-themes that hon. Members repeated throughout the debate. The funding formula recognises that the principal cause of variation in health care needs is the age structure of the population, so it factors in the number of older people and the expected number of births.</p>
	<p pid="b.195.4/4">It is widely acknowledged that poverty significantly increases people's chances of getting sick and needing health care, so the formula also increases funding if a primary care trust region has a high level of deprivation. In Buckinghamshire, the proportion of people over 60 is 22 per cent., the same as the England average. I agree that there are pockets of deprivation, which is something that local providers must take into account when providing services and allocating resources. Overall, however, although I would not describe Buckinghamshire as rich, as the hon. and learned Member for Beaconsfield did, it is, as other hon. Members said, one of the more affluent parts of the country. That means, according to the funding formula, that it receives a lower proportion of funding than somewhere with, say, 30 per cent. of its population aged over 60. The point is that it is the independent expert panel, the Advisory Committee on Resource Allocation, that believes that the formula is the best way of allocating funding. Whatever the arguments about the formula-and I believe I have made a powerful case for it-Buckinghamshire's funding will continue to grow. The NHS in Buckinghamshire will still get more than &#163;652 million this financial year and &#163;686 million in 2010-11-more than a 10.5 per cent. increase over the two years.</p>
	<p pid="b.195.4/5">The route to financial health for Buckinghamshire, as for all parts of the NHS, lies not in questioning the funding formula, although I have heard the points made by the Opposition, but in radical action to improve the quality and effectiveness of local services. The NHS has faced long-standing financial pressures locally; that point has been made and I recognise it. However, it has told me that it is working to address those issues. Both the hospital trust and the PCT are working to break even for 2009-10. They believe that they are on the front foot in re-engineering health services; they have formed a Healthy Buckinghamshire leaders group-a joint plan of action to deal with current financial problems; and their summit plan is already making a difference. The new Buckinghamshire-wide out-of-hours service is already up and running, not least in the constituency of the hon. Member for Chesham and Amersham, and there are plans for a new GP-led centre based in Wycombe hospital. The hospital trust tells me it expects a 15 per cent. drop in demand for out-patient services in the next few years as care is increasingly-and rightly-delivered by GPs and other community services, as the hon. Member for Aylesbury remarked.</p>
	<p pid="b.195.4/6">The way patients use NHS services means that demand drops for some out-patient services, and it is not a good idea to run half-empty clinics. That is why clinicians across the NHS in Buckinghamshire are exploring how to combine out-patient clinics to make the best use of available resources. A smarter NHS will mean more services coming out of hospitals and into the home or the community, although I recognise the points about concerns over rural ambulance services. I understand that the review is taking place in Buckinghamshire, and the final report will be presented to the South Central health overview and scrutiny committee in January 2010.</p>
	<p pid="b.195.4/7">A point was also made about psychological therapies. The PCT's professional executive committee, led by clinicians, agreed the recommendation to refocus psychological therapy resources, totalling more than &#163;4 million, on evidence-based therapies. As the Minister responsible for mental health I can tell <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1603" name="Anne Milton">the hon. Member for Guildford (Anne Milton)</phrase> that a 50 per cent. increase in funding for mental health services since 2001- a &#163;2 billion increase-is remarkable and puts this country's mental health services at the forefront of those in Europe.</p>
	<p pid="b.195.4/8">I have tried not to be too party political in this debate, but other hon. Members have made it so, and I therefore conclude by saying that when the Conservative party left office in 1997 the NHS was on its knees. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1736" name="Norman Lamb">The hon. Member for North Norfolk (Norman Lamb)</phrase> was right. In the past 12 years the Conservative party voted against every Budget, with record increases in NHS spending that brought benefits not least to Buckinghamshire. Finally, the Conservatives are approaching the general election pledged to abandon key criteria for waiting times, and to create an austerity Britain, with smaller Government. From what we have heard today it appears they intend to reintroduce tax breaks for private insurance schemes and abandon deprivation formula in the funding allocations.</p>

	<p pid="b.197.0/1">On a point of order, Mr. Atkinson. Is it in order that when the Minister himself thought there was little time for the debate he should reduce it to a political diatribe although he has not answered the question of what will happen to my constituents in the event of a flu epidemic, given their straitened circumstances?</p>

	<p pid="b.197.2/1">It was also a skilful attempt to use up time, as I describe the options at the next general election, which will be, for the people of Buckinghamshire, a fundamental choice between going back to the bad days when the Conservatives ran down the NHS, or looking forward to a period of further investment to support the health service in Buckinghamshire and across the country.</p>

	<p pid="b.198.1/1">This debate will focus on the excellent report produced by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1478" name="Tony Wright">the Member for Cannock Chase (Dr. Wright)</phrase>. Sadly, he cannot be here today because he is chairing a meeting of the Public Administration Committee; we would have benefited from his contribution.</p>
	<p pid="b.198.1/2">Credit for setting up the Select Committee on Reform of the House of Commons should go to the Prime Minister and the Leader of the House, and particularly so for appointing exactly the right person to chair it. My hon. Friend does a superb job in chairing the PAC, and he did so yet again when chairing the Committee on Reform of the House of Commons and reporting in such short order. It demonstrates what a clever and shrewd man he is.</p>
	<p pid="b.198.1/3">It is a measured report. It is well argued and well thought out. It is pragmatic. Without solving all the problems that confront us, it will undoubtedly take us firmly in the right direction. Reform of the House is badly needed.</p>

	<p pid="b.198.3/1">I shall come to that later, but of course the hon. Gentleman is right. Nevertheless, pending what happens to the report, the Government deserve some credit. We have been hoping for and arguing for such a report for the 26 years during which I have been a Member of the House. We have taken some steps forward, but as the hon. Gentleman said, now is the crucial moment. Will we see the report implemented-and will it implemented in the bold way that it should be?</p>

	<p pid="b.198.4/1">I accept all that the hon. Gentleman says. He brings an important matter before the House today. Does he not accept, however, that the report does not go far enough in that it does not tackle the abuse of MPs having second jobs? Being an MP in today's environment is a full-time job. One of the greatest abuses that has been perpetrated is MPs having two, three or four-some of them even nine or 10-remunerated additional employments. We cannot do the job, retaining public confidence in the House and its Members, if MPs are going to moonlight. It simply ain't on.</p>

	<p pid="b.198.5/1">The hon. Gentleman makes a valid point, but the report correctly focuses on the political reforms necessary in the House. Plenty of behavioural reforms are necessary; and this year's events, with the concentration on allowances and expenses, shows that the public are impatient with Members. Much needs to be put right, and I hope that it will be put right. However, the report is about political reform and what we need to do to strengthen Parliament, so that it can fulfil its central responsibility of scrutinising legislation and holding the Government to account. That is the heart of the matter.</p>
	<p pid="b.198.5/2">The hon. Gentleman is right about expenses and double jobs, but the debate is about our job here and how we do these things. What we are doing is a political matter. The report is excellent. It gives us a blueprint for a better and more effective Parliament.</p>

	<p pid="b.199.5/1">If the hon. Gentleman is making a case for the separation of powers between the Executive and the legislature, as happens under the American political system, he would find certain Members of the House-including some members of the Committee-most sympathetic. However, I believe that separating powers will bring more problems. We might achieve stronger scrutiny, but we would have less effective government because the Executive would not be rooted in the democratic process. Almost inevitably, they will be appointees. They might be clever, but they would not have roots in the public or in our democratic structures, which I believe has always been a strong characteristic of the House.</p>

	<p pid="b.199.7/1">I agree with all of that. I see no reason why the House needs more than 400 Members. We would probably do a better job at focusing our attention on our work if there were fewer of us. The report was about rebuilding the House, not about casting a new constitutional settlement, although we may well come to that in the fairly near future. I am sympathetic to what the hon. Gentleman says, but that is not what the Committee was about. We need to focus on how to improve and rebuild the House, which is badly in need of it.</p>

	<p pid="b.200.0/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend on securing this debate. Many newspapers, having seen the disillusion, distaste and disgust with MPs among the wider electorate, have suggested a substantial trimming in the number of Members. There may be something in that, but it can be done only in parallel with a substantial extension and improvement of services such as citizens advice and community law services, as they will be needed to pick up the casework. Four hundred Members simply could not handle the work load that we are experiencing now. We have to find some way to satisfactorily transfer that work.</p>

	<p pid="b.200.1/1">We are probably going rather wide of the subject. However, I have great sympathy with my hon. Friend's view. Indeed, one necessary aspect of that would not be the strengthening of citizens advice, desirable though that would be, but a strengthening of local government, which has lost much of its autonomy and powers. It is now an agent for central Government rather than an entity in itself.</p>
	<p pid="b.200.1/2">The report gives us a blueprint for a better, more effective Parliament. That would allow us to do what we are sent here to do. We are sent here to do two things. The first is to raise grievances in return for voting the Government Supply. The second is to hold the Government to account. Those have been the defining characteristics and responsibilities of the House for the past 800 years. They have not changed.</p>

	<p pid="b.200.2/1">I am sorry to labour the point, but are we not here also to represent political parties? Apart from some hon. Members-they are the exception rather than the rule-we were all elected to represent those political parties. We would not be here unless we stood on the political party ticket.</p>

	<p pid="b.200.3/1">That is self-evident. Those of us who think that we personally are being elected will find when we stand for re-election, in May or June or whenever it is, that it is our party that will be re-elected. Of course, the hon. Lady is absolutely right.</p>
	<p pid="b.200.3/2">We are sent here to be a check and a balance on Government, which is in the interests of both the public and the Government. If we do our job properly and rigorously, it makes for better government. Sadly, however, we are failing in our duty. Over the past 100 years, Parliament has been getting steadily weaker and more enfeebled, and government has been getting stronger and more almighty, and that is not in the interests of Parliament, good government or the House.</p>
	<p pid="b.200.3/3">Parliament, therefore, is not working. At the moment, the Government decide everything that happens in this place: when we come here, what we debate, what we can vote on and what substantive motions are put down on the Order Paper. We in this House are the creatures of Government. We come here when we are called, go away when we are told to, debate the subjects that the Government think are proper and vote when we are asked to do so. How we vote is a different matter. Parliament has lost the sense of its own identity. Its identity is distinct from that of Government; the Executive and the legislature have two totally different roles, and there is no longer a clear distinction between the two.</p>

	<p pid="b.201.0/1">Although I recognise such symptoms and believe them to be undesirable, does not part of the problem stem from the fact that Members of Parliament view their role fundamentally differently from the one of 20 or 30 years ago? Too many Members of Parliament see themselves as super-councillors, who take up issues that should be handled by citizens advice bureaux and local law centres, rather than as representatives who hold the Government to account, which is a particularly important role for Back Benchers in Government.</p>

	<p pid="b.201.1/1">Yes, but those roles are not alternatives. It is the fascination, complexity and difficulty of our job that we are, quite rightly, expected to do both. We have to be very involved with our communities, respond to them and learn from them. All of our e-mails and mail bags are a political education on a daily basis; we understand and learn what is happening in our country and what the effect is of Government legislation on our constituents. We have a very strong local root, and if we fail in that role, then holding the Government to account in some lofty way on a national forum will be ill-informed.</p>
	<p pid="b.201.1/2">My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1534" name="Natascha Engel">the Member for North-East Derbyshire (Natascha Engel)</phrase> raised an interesting point about party politics. It is a paradox and contradiction that as Back Bench Government MPs, we are here not only to be loyal to our party-we love our party and want it to do well-but to hold the Government to account. At times, that causes tension, which was seen most acutely during the vote on the Iraq war. Tension crops up almost every week in some form, and that makes this job demanding, interesting and very difficult to reform.</p>
	<p pid="b.201.1/3">I do not disregard or belittle the party political element; it is very important and it is why we are all here. However, we must step aside from that and hold the Government to account regardless of our party affiliations. If we allow our party affiliations to dominate how we scrutinise and hold the Government to account, we become the rubber stamps of Government, which is poor value for the electorate and bad for this House. Such matters are not easy; if they were we would not have the difficulty of this report. They are both important and paradoxical.</p>
	<p pid="b.201.1/4">The report is based on three good foundation stones. It states that the</p>
	<p pid="b.201.1/5" class="indent">&quot;Government should get its business, the House should get its scrutiny and the public should get listened to&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.201.1/6">I would amend that slightly. The Government should have the time to get their business through the House. Government have no God-given right to get any business they choose, but having had a mandate from the public, they must have sufficient time to put their business in front of the House, argue for it, and hope to convince the House that their business is good. So, the Government must have time; that is essential to efficient and practical government. The House should have the time and the facilities rigorously to scrutinise the programme, and the public must get the feeling that they are listened to and that their concerns are being reflected on the Floor of the House.</p>

	<p pid="b.201.2/1">Time is very precious, and the hon. Gentleman is right to say that the Government must be given time to get their programme through so that they can fulfil the manifesto on which they have been elected. None the less, does he not agree that there has been a huge waste of time at the behest of this Government, particularly in relation to so-called topical debates, which have simply become a vehicle for the Government to bring forward matters that are obliging to them on a political level, rather than to deliver things of real topicality? Does the hon. Gentleman not agree that that is a matter for the House rather than the Government if we are to continue with topical debates?</p>

	<p pid="b.202.0/1">One of the really impressive things about this report, which reflects well on the Chairman and the all-party members of the Committee, is that the Committee did not allow itself to get diverted by micro-matters such as that-important though they are. It kept to the high ground of what the principles were and the foundation stones that we need to put in place if we are to rebuild the House.</p>
	<p pid="b.202.0/2">The first such foundation stone is the control of business. As the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy said, if we are to implement this report, we must give the Government confidence that this is not some way of subverting them. They have a mandate; they have been elected and must have the time to put their programme through. By reassuring the Government that that is the case, the Committee is completely right, and that is essential if we are effectively to rebuild the House. I am talking here about the Government's control over their programme for which they have a mandate. I am not saying that the Government have the right to control the whole business of this House. When we look at what happens on the Floor of the House, we find that only half of the time is devoted to Government business. The rest of it is devoted to scrutiny, questions, and private Members', Back-Bench and Opposition business. It is about a 50:50 split between Government time-the time that they need to get their programme introduced and scrutinised-and our time. This is our House and it is absurd that we should be dependent on the Government for how we use that time. We are elected to this House; it is our House of Parliament. They are the Government and have a totally different responsibility. They have the responsibility to take executive action on behalf of this country and to introduce legislation and taxation. They need to get such things through, but they do not need to dominate and run the detailed day-to-day business of this House.</p>

	<p pid="b.202.1/1">Will my hon. Friend explain to me what he thinks the difference is between a proposal for a Back-Bench business committee and a proposal for a House business committee?

	<p pid="b.202.2/1">I hope that I have made it clear. The time that is properly the Government's is the time that they need to get through the programme on which they were elected and have a mandate for from the public. They have to introduce legislation and have it scrutinised and enacted. All other time is the House's business. If I have a criticism of this report it is that the distinction to which my hon. Friend refers is not made clear.</p>

	<p pid="b.202.3/1">Does the hon. Gentleman agree that sometimes these things are complex? I say that because Government-sponsored legislation is clearly the Government's business to get through and the report is very clear that the Government will be guaranteed the time to get that legislation through, but how that legislation is scrutinised by the House must be a matter for the House and it cannot be right for the Government to decide how much or how little time is available to the House to do that, within reason, what order it does it in and which parts of Bills are scrutinised. The Government should have their way; they can whip and people should vote on party lines. But the House should decide how it scrutinises Government legislation, otherwise it is not doing House business.</p>

	<p pid="b.203.0/1">I entirely agree with the hon. Gentleman; that point goes to the heart of this report. However, I do not think that these things are necessarily great sticking points. One can look at other countries and other legislatures and see that they find a way of negotiating between all parts of their Parliaments and their Governments.</p>

	<p pid="b.203.1/1">This point is not just a small sticking-point for me; it is a really big point for me. Who controls the time is a really big and important issue. I am a massive supporter of having a Back-Bench business committee that would look at how we can organise our House time better and how we can make better use of things such as topical debates and general debates; I have absolutely no problem with that idea. Where I have a problem and where I think that the report is quite dishonest is the idea that how much time we spend on different parts of Government legislation should be a decision that is made by Back Benchers and not the Executive. That is something that I have an issue with, because it is down to the Executive of the day to decide how much time we spend on different parts of Government legislation.</p>

	<p pid="b.203.2/1">I must say that I do not entirely agree with my hon. Friend. It is our job to scrutinise Government and therefore the time and the manner in which we scrutinise Government-either the scrutiny of Government Departments by Select Committees, or the scrutiny of Government legislation by Public Bill Committees-is our responsibility. It is not for the Government to tell us, &quot;You may only scrutinise our legislation in such and such a way&quot;. It is for the Government to have all the time they need to present that legislation, to defend it and to persuade us that it is admirable legislation that we need to enact, but it is not for the Government to say, &quot;You may not scrutinise us in such a way&quot;. I think that my hon. Friend and I will have to disagree on this point, much as I admire her.</p>
	<p pid="b.203.2/2">It is because scrutiny goes to the heart of our role as parliamentarians that control of scrutiny is absolutely essential, which brings me to the issue of the control of the Select Committees. It is absolute nonsense that the Select Committees of this House, which have been a brilliant invention over the last 35 years, should effectively be determined, either directly or indirectly, by the Government. It is like the Government choosing their own invigilators and scrutineers, and saying, &quot;We will be looked at very closely, but only on the terms and by the people who we approve&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.203.2/3">Select Committees are a matter for this House to determine; they are nothing to do with the Government at all. The Government have their own job to get on with legislation; the Government do not have the job of scrutinising themselves, which is effectively what Select Committees do. To my mind, it is amazing that the Select Committees function as well as they do and that is thanks to some very brave and very independent-minded Chairpeople, such as Gwyneth Dunwoody, the former Member of Parliament for Crewe and Nantwich, who is now deceased. She was such a brilliant Chairman of the Select Committee on Transport that, as a result, our transport policy in recent years has been hugely strengthened and improved by the rigour that she brought to that role. But the idea that she should have been manipulated by the Government-it would not have been in the Government's interest to have done that. It is actually in all our interests that the Select Committees should be chaired independently and that their members should reflect the views of the House and not the opinions or tastes of a Government.</p>

	<p pid="b.204.3/1">I absolutely take your point, Mr. Atkinson, and it is very kind of you to attribute the fact that I am taking rather longer than I had intended to my generosity in taking interventions. I feel that I am probably taking too long to introduce this debate anyway, because I know that in Westminster Hall today we have people who sat on the House of Commons Reform Committee and who have very important contributions to make to this debate. Therefore, I will try to bring my remarks to a close.</p>
	<p pid="b.204.3/2">If we are to fulfil our responsibilities as a Parliament, we need to get control not only of the business of the House and not only of the membership and chairmanship of the Select Committees, which this report identifies so clearly as an issue, but of the Standing Orders of this House, which the report identifies rather less clearly as an issue. The Standing Orders determine the future of this House and at the moment they can only be amended effectively by grace of the Government. They are our Standing Orders, not the Government's Standing Orders; they are the Standing Orders of this House and we ought to control them.</p>
	<p pid="b.204.3/3">There are things in the report that one could imagine, in an ideal world, being slightly stronger and places where it could go wider, as hon. Members have already mentioned, but the fact of the matter is that I think that the report is a superb beginning and a superb indicator of where we ought to be going. What we now need to do is to take this debate on to the Floor of the House and have it on a substantive motion, which many Members in Westminster Hall today have been pressing the Government for. There is an indication that we may get that substantive debate by the end of January. I hope that we will get it by that time. It would be very foolish of the Government, having done the difficult job of setting up this Committee, appointing the right people to sit on it and to report on this issue and getting, to their own credit, an excellent report, if we were not allowed to debate the report and take the issue forward as quickly as possible. To leave such a debate to the next Parliament would be a terrible mistake. Furthermore, if we are right in thinking that a third, or perhaps even more, of the Members of the next Parliament will be new MPs, those new MPs will not know how this place works as well as some of us perhaps do, having experienced the virtues and vices of the present system. We need to move fairly fast in the next few months and I hope that we will do so.</p>
	<p pid="b.204.3/4">It is up to us to bestir ourselves and to identify what is peculiar about Parliament and our identity that is different from that of Government. If we do that, we will be laying a foundation for what this report calls itself, which is &quot;Rebuilding the House&quot;.</p>

	<p pid="b.205.1/1">Order. Before I call <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1503" name="Mark Field">the hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster (Mr. Field)</phrase> to speak, I want to say that there quite a few Members-I think that there are five or six-who are trying to catch my eye and that the wind-ups should start shortly after 12 o'clock. So, if hon. Members can do a bit of quick mental arithmetic, we will get everybody in.</p>

	<p pid="b.205.2/1">I welcome the fact that we are having this debate today and I thank <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1841" name="Mark Fisher">the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central (Mark Fisher)</phrase> for introducing it. Regrettably, I must say that I do not entirely agree with the thrust of what he said. I am afraid that the report to which he has referred was far too timid; it needed to be a good deal more robust. I accept that there was an element of compromise about it and one certainly hopes that at least what has been proposed in the report will go through as a starting-point to what I think will be a radical reform.</p>
	<p pid="b.205.2/2">I say that because I think that there is little doubt that the allowances scandal, to which the hon. Gentleman referred, will cause what I suspect will be the largest shake-up in parliamentary practice since the Great Reform Act of 1832, and not before time. It is perhaps not entirely coincidental that the momentous upheaval in 1832 came as a result of a crisis of confidence in many other institutions. At that time, it was the established Church of England and the monarchy-after the scandals that had surrounded George IV and George III before him-that were in crisis. Of course, today's crisis in confidence in Parliament arrives hot on the heels of an unprecedented economic firestorm in the past two years, whereby the catastrophe that has befallen financial institutions has shaken public confidence in the capitalist system, and with the inquiry that is currently being conducted into our going to war in Iraq there is again a sense that the Executive have been allowed to get away with blue murder.</p>
	<p pid="b.205.2/3">However, I feel that the reforming steps that we have taken so far will not necessarily be sufficient. In the next Parliament, I suspect that we will see a huge turnover of MPs, even without the turnover that my own party hopes will happen as far as the general election result is concerned. However, there is a concern that we will be filling this House with a lot of inexperienced men and women who will regard themselves as being little more than cheerleaders for their party leaders. The worst possible outcome, in my view, would be the reinforcement of a parliamentary class made up of people with little or no experience outside the political sphere.</p>
	<p pid="b.205.2/4">It is also possible that expenses woes will encourage many of Edmund Burke's &quot;good men&quot;, and women, simply to give up on the idea of democracy. I do not lament the scandal's unveiling, but I mourn the hopeless way that politicians dealt with a time bomb that had been waiting to go off for years, as many of us recognised. It did not have to be that way. We must grasp the rare opportunity in the aftermath of the scandal to implement overdue but lasting reforms.</p>
	<p pid="b.205.2/5">I reiterate some of what the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central said. First, we must pare back the control exercised by the Executive. In my view, successive Governments and Opposition leaderships deserve much of the blame for the parliamentary expenses fiasco that has blown up so spectacularly over the past six months. We have witnessed repeated grandstanding by party leaders who refused to implement independent salary reviews but turned a blind eye to the cynical-and, at its extreme, fraudulent-manipulation of the second home allowance, whose annual uplift was never reduced, reversed or even capped, and which became a salary substitute. The 24/7 media world in which politics operates militates in favour of any close-knit team around party leadership being on message, but Executive patronage must now be curtailed.</p>
	<p pid="b.205.2/6">I agree with much of what was said about Select Committees. They need to exercise real power. In my view, the appointment of all Select Committee members, not just Chairmen, should be by a secret ballot of all MPs. As was rightly pointed out, chairmanships have too often been handed out by the Executive to former Ministers or senior Back Benchers on the basis of their compliance and willingness not to rock the boat. The hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central referred to the late Gwyneth Dunwoody and to Ian Gibson. Unfortunately, they are the exceptions that prove the rule about our Select Committee system. One of the biggest oxymorons in British politics is a phrase that one often hears in the media: &quot;the influential Select Committee&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.205.2/7">Select Committees should be much smaller. I am grateful that the report goes in that direction. The number mooted was 11, but in my view, Select Committees should number between five and eight members, who should all be fully committed to acquiring or developing genuine expertise in the field. The current situation involves a ludicrous charade in which ill-prepared MPs, on the rare occasions when they attend, parrot planted questions cobbled together by a Committee Clerk rather than even pretending to hold witnesses or Ministers genuinely to account.</p>
	<p pid="b.205.2/8">We should also have a much smaller House of Commons, although I risk talking myself out of a constituency. Curiously, the only Members who tend to propose reductions in the size of the Commons are those on the cusp of retirement. I see a few such individuals here. <i>[</i><i>Interruption.</i><i>]</i> I hasten to add that in their case it is voluntary retirement rather than involuntary. The size of Parliament should be reduced substantially. My party's policy is a 10 per cent. reduction, but I think that that should be a first step. Ideally, a fixed-size Parliament of 450 to 500 Members should be our medium-term goal. The primary priority of all MPs, therefore, should be holding the Executive to account rather than acting as local ombudsmen on constituency issues more appropriately dealt with by local authorities, law centres and citizens advice bureaux, to name but three publicly funded bodies properly designed to deal with parochial concerns.</p>
	<p pid="b.205.2/9">I would like the process of separating the legislature from the Executive to begin. That final element of my wish list is probably a step too far even for my more reform-minded colleagues, for now at least. If Parliament is to have any future relevance beyond making up the numerical armies required by Governments to pass their legislation, we should regard law-making as an end in itself rather than an essential stepping stone towards holding ministerial office. My preference-it will not happen at this election, but perhaps at some future election-is to have two votes on election day, so people can vote for the Prime Minister and for their local Member of Parliament. It might well result in a split slate, but I do not think that that would be an unhealthy state of affairs.</p>
	<p pid="b.205.2/10">There is one important caveat, which I mentioned in my intervention, that must be addressed before we begin a headlong rush to empower individual parliamentarians. Many MPs-perhaps even most of us-do not regard any of the foregoing, and still less the constitutional duty of holding the Executive to account, as their main role. Increasingly, the House of Commons consists of a cadre of super-councillors who keep much of their attention and their burgeoning work load in a constituency-focused comfort zone. We are all proud of the work that we do in our constituencies, and it is important to have a finger on the pulse, but if we are to ensure reform and put power back into the hands of Parliament, this generation of MPs and the next must be properly equipped to play their key role in the transformative Parliament that democratic renewal in this country so desperately needs.</p>

	<p pid="b.207.0/1">It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Mr. Atkinson. I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1841" name="Mark Fisher">the Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central (Mark Fisher)</phrase> on securing this debate. It takes place not just as a result of the report &quot;Rebuilding the House&quot;, by the Select Committee on which I served, but against the backdrop of the MPs' expenses scandal, which is not going away. Part of the reason is that there is a much wider democratic deficit. I had hoped that the report would address it, but it has failed absolutely to do so, which is why I submitted a minority report. I am grateful for this opportunity to explain briefly why I did so.</p>
	<p pid="b.207.0/2">One main reason why I thought that the report missed the mark slightly is that we never defined at any point what we meant by reform. Unless we have a clear idea of what it is we mean by reform or modernisation-there is lots of talk about modernisation as well-it is perfectly possible that I could be discussing something completely different from any other Member of the House. Also, we must define our purpose. What do we want our Parliament to do, and therefore, what do we see our role to be as Members of this House?</p>
	<p pid="b.207.0/3">None of those questions was really addressed. Although the report is important-it considers Select Committees, the question of who scrutinises business and how best to do so-those are details. Unless the context is much wider and we consider exactly what we do and why we do it, we could end up making things worse rather than better. One key element of the report that many Members have spoken about today-it has also been discussed in the Committee and elsewhere-is wresting control away from the Executive. We may all agree that the Executive has too much control, but how we wrest it away from them and who we give it to is a key issue not addressed in the report.</p>
	<p pid="b.207.0/4">The proposal for a House business Committee-not a Back-Bench business Committee, which I support-to determine who controls Government time in the House would give such decisions to a group of seven sensible Back Benchers elected by secret ballot of the whole House, but it could make the situation worse. We did not go into detail about how we would do so and exactly what the outcomes would be, but they could be dangerous.</p>
	<p pid="b.207.0/5">I will be brief, because I intervened on my hon. Friend many times. I think that we all agree that Select Committees are good. They are the one thing that enhances the reputation of the House. Again, I urge caution. What are we proposing, and why are we proposing it? What are we trying to improve? Gwyneth Dunwoody and Lord Anderson, formerly MP for Swansea, East- I was not a Member of the House at the time, but I remember watching from outside-became members and Chairs of their Select Committees, so even though the system was imperfect, it worked.</p>
	<p pid="b.207.0/6">I am worried that by saying, &quot;We don't think it works well enough; let's do something completely different, like having an election by secret ballot of the whole House,&quot; we might make things worse. We have not thought through the consequences. The only time when we hold a secret ballot of the whole House is to elect the new Speaker, and many Opposition Members felt that, like it or not, somebody whom they found unpalatable was foisted on them by a Government majority. Given that this is a party political institution and that we tend to revert to type, what guarantee is there that we would not do so when electing Select Committee Chairmen?</p>

	<p pid="b.208.0/1">I partly agree with my hon. Friend. However, it is not fair that certain Members, who have been democratically elected, are blocked from ever joining a Select Committee because they are independently minded.</p>

	<p pid="b.209.0/1">I do not know the details of individuals who have been blocked. I was elected in 2005, which was quite late in the 12 years of Labour Government.</p>
	<p pid="b.209.0/2">The current issue with Select Committees is filling the spaces because there is no mad clamour to serve on them. There are four or five big, sexy Select Committees that everyone wants to be on, including the Home Affairs Committee, the Foreign Affairs Committee and the Treasury Committee. Members will not put their names down for any number of other Select Committees, and cannot be persuaded to do so for love nor money.</p>
	<p pid="b.209.0/3">If Select Committee members are elected by the House by secret ballot, how can we ensure that there is an adequate gender balance, the right amount of age and experience, and a regional mix? The Select Committee on Reform of the House of Commons considered that in detail and it is not possible. Through the gain of making Select Committees more democratic, something else would be taken away. We must caution against making the situation, which we all agree is not perfect, an awful lot worse because we might not be able to go back to the system that we think works okay. Nothing is perfect.</p>
	<p pid="b.209.0/4">Finally, I will make a point that I made time and again on the Reform of the House of Commons Committee. It is six months before a general election. As other hon. Members have said, there will be an unprecedented number of new MPs and they will have fresh ideas on what to do. They will have fought an election against the backdrop of the MPs' expenses scandal and will have to have an idea of how Parliament can be reformed. If we go too far down the line of House business committees deciding who controls what bits of time, we risk tying the hands of the future generation, which is not fair. I would welcome the opportunity to debate this in greater detail on the Floor of the House, but I am grateful for the opportunity to make a few brief points today.</p>

	<p pid="b.209.1/1">The confidence that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1534" name="Natascha Engel">the hon. Member for North-East Derbyshire (Natascha Engel)</phrase> has in the Whips and the usual channels is touching. When she has been here for a few more years, perhaps she will catch the embittered cynicism of some of us who have been here for a long time. I will be brief because other hon. Members want to speak.</p>
	<p pid="b.209.1/2">I challenge hon. Members to consider one point. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1841" name="Mark Fisher">The hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central (Mark Fisher)</phrase> said that there should be a balance between Government time, Back-Bench scrutiny and representing the wishes of the general public. If there is to be effective scrutiny, we often require the Executive to share information with us. If they do not do so, we are incapable of making judgments.</p>
	<p pid="b.209.1/3">I wonder how many hon. Members who voted for the war on Iraq would have done so if they had known what we all know now. The House was entirely dependent on the information given to it by the Executive. <i>[</i><i>Interruption.</i><i>]</i> Well, some of us voted against it. I voted against it as I believed that it was against international law because it did not have UN backing. That was a simple position to take. Many colleagues from all parts of the House felt compelled to support the Government because they genuinely believed that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction that he could deploy within 45 minutes and so forth. Unless we work out ways to ensure that the Executive are honest and straightforward with the House, it will always be difficult to scrutinise them because we will be hobbled.</p>
	<p pid="b.209.1/4">I will give a simple example. When the issue is whether the nation should go to war, I see no justification for the Attorney-General's advice to the Government not being shared with the House. Either it is legal to go to war or it is not. One of the most shameful aspects of the Iraq saga, which I am sure the Chilcot inquiry will highlight, is the way in which Lord Goldsmith was effectively bludgeoned into producing advice that satisfied the Prime Minister. Independent legal advisers to the Government should be allowed to be independent. It appears that when Lord Goldsmith put in writing an opinion to Government that was hostile and said that the war was not lawful, he was punished by being excluded from Cabinet meetings until he produced an opinion that satisfied the Prime Minister. Almost the day before British troops were deployed, he said that it was lawful. As Sir Jeremy Greenstock, our permanent representative to the UN at the time, was obliged to say to the Chilcot inquiry, this was not a legitimate war, but it was legal. That is not a distinction that lawyers really understand.</p>

	<p pid="b.210.0/1">If we had an independent Parliament, it could have reconvened in that long summer. As it happened, some of us created our own parliament, which forced the Government to allow Parliament to be recalled. Secondly, an independent Parliament could have commissioned its own legal advice, which the Clerks have informed me was not possible. We could then have taken a view on whether the proposed war was legal.</p>

	<p pid="b.210.1/1">The hon. Gentleman, who has been persistent on this issue-quite sensibly, he has tabled items on the Order Paper and campaigned elsewhere-makes some extremely good points. The Iraq conflict demonstrated that the House cannot entirely trust the Executive, who often have their own imperatives, desires and objectives. If a Government command a large majority in the House, irrespective of which party they represent, there is always a temptation to use the majority to get their business through.</p>
	<p pid="b.210.1/2">[Mr. Jim Hood <i>in the Chair</i>]</p>
	<p pid="b.210.1/3">I conclude with a quotation from Ken Macdonald, who was the Director of Public Prosecutions for five years from 2003 to 2008. It is a damning indictment not just of Tony Blair, but of Parliament as an institution:</p>
	<p pid="b.210.1/4" class="indent">&quot;The degree of deceit involved in our decision to go to war on Iraq becomes steadily clearer. This was a foreign policy disgrace of epic proportions and playing footsie on Sunday morning television does nothing to repair the damage. It is now very difficult to avoid the conclusion that Tony Blair engaged in an alarming subterfuge with his partner George Bush and went on to mislead and cajole the British people into a deadly war they had made perfectly clear they didn't want, and on a basis that it's increasingly hard to believe even he found truly credible.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.210.1/5">We have to accept that that subterfuge and deceit was perpetrated on Parliament and that we did not have the effective means, tools or mechanisms to discover what was truly happening. We did not even have the basic legal advice that was given to the Government as providing legitimacy for the war.</p>
	<p pid="b.210.1/6">From my 26 years in the House, what happened with Iraq causes me the greatest concern, because as an institution we were sucked into something that many of us will regret for the rest of our lives. Any reforms of the institution must ensure that such a thing never happens again.</p>

	<p pid="b.211.0/1">It is a pleasure to follow <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1382" name="Tony Baldry">the hon. Member for Banbury (Tony Baldry)</phrase>. I can give him some comfort. I have just done a quick count around the Chamber and a clear majority of Members did not vote for the Iraq war. Let us glory in our purity for a few moments. I speak as a member of the Select Committee on Reform of the House of Commons. It was a pleasure to serve on that Committee and work with colleagues on it.</p>
	<p pid="b.211.0/2">I shall respond to some of the issues raised and then make a couple of points. I say to my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1841" name="Mark Fisher">the Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central (Mark Fisher)</phrase> that he should beware of giving too much praise either to the Prime Minister or the Leader of the House, because thus far the reaction to and reception of our report has been lukewarm. The Prime Minister is on the record as saying that he fully supports some of the recommendations, and the Leader of the House has yet to give us time for either a debate or a decision-a substantive vote-on the report. So the pressure needs to be put on not just my Front Benchers but Conservative Front Benchers-I say that to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1503" name="Mark Field">the hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster (Mr. Field)</phrase>. As someone who has organised many events in this place, I assure him that dark forces are gathering and manoeuvrings are taking place.</p>
	<p pid="b.211.0/3">Opposition Front Benchers' enthusiasm for reform is wilting as the day of the general election gets closer, because all Governments like to control everything and feel that they have to be control freaks. It is part of our job to challenge that, whoever forms the next Government. I want to challenge the notion that we can somehow do our job better with fewer MPs. I ask hon. Members to reflect on the arguments they have made. What they are saying is that too often we are super-councillors, we are doing too much casework, we should be doing more scrutiny, and we should therefore have bigger constituencies and do less casework. That does not necessarily add up, because there may be some transitional problems. People might want to think their arguments on that through.</p>
	<p pid="b.211.0/4">I say to my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1534" name="Natascha Engel">the Member for North-East Derbyshire (Natascha Engel)</phrase>, for whom I have huge affection, that I utterly reject her minority report. I thought it was a cop-out and that it merely talked about transferring the decision-making process to another Parliament. That report did not address the clear terms of reference that were set up for our Committee to a very tight time scale, which the Committee addressed. We did not have time to dance on the head of a pin concerning what we mean by reform or anything else.</p>
	<p pid="b.211.0/5">With due respect, I say to my hon. Friend that she should beware of being sucked into the arguments that were given to us in the evidence from my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1557" name="Hilary Armstrong">the Member for North-West Durham (Hilary Armstrong)</phrase>, the former Chief Whip. She gave us a staggering thesis that basically went along the lines of, &quot;It's all in the manifesto and it's the Government's job to get that through, so what are you doing here?&quot; I am not entirely sure that we are paid &#163;64,000 a year merely to nod through what is in a manifesto without any element of parliamentary scrutiny. We need to be careful about going down that road.</p>

Member for Castle Point (Bob Spink)</phrase>, who is sadly not in this Chamber now, I absolutely support getting rid of MPs' second jobs and moonlighting-in fact, I proposed a private Member's Bill on that issue back in 2007. If we contrast the top 50 outside earners in this place with their voting records, it is clear that the public lose out in that regard.</p>
	<p pid="b.211.0/7">On the recommendations of the reform Committee itself, we considered three issues. We passed over the matter of the election of the Deputy Speaker, but I very much support the principle of that, particularly the election of the Chairman of Ways and Means, who may have a key role to play in a future business Committee. That matter has been passed to the Select Committee on Procedure and, again, its recommendations need to be implemented sooner rather than later.</p>
	<p pid="b.211.0/8">We also considered the election of Select Committee Chairs. In 2001, a fiasco occurred within the parliamentary Labour party because of the Executive's attempts to determine who their scrutineers were and to decide that Donald Anderson and Gwyneth Dunwoody were too good at their jobs and would therefore be excluded from the list of people put forward for the Select Committee. The parliamentary Labour party for once was not a poodle, and it rose up. As a result, we brought our internal democracy into that process, and the elected Back-Bench Members in the PLP had a say in the names put forward. We are relatively content with our internal system and I commend it to other parties.</p>
	<p pid="b.211.0/9">We grappled with the notion of electing every single place on a Select Committee, which would be very difficult to do. I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for North-East Derbyshire: in the context of a new Parliament, how are we going to weigh up the credentials of one newly elected MP against another? I am not sure that I would want to say who the 11th member of a Select Committee should be from a particular party. That is a matter for the parties themselves.</p>
	<p pid="b.211.0/10">If we agree the balance-the public decide that as a result of the number of MPs from different parties who are sent here-it is for the parties themselves to come forward with a sensible, coherent and transparent system. However, it is for the House to decide who the Chairs of those Select Committees should be. Let us be honest: the Select Committee Chairs are not going to be newly elected Members of the House; they will be people with some experience who have a contribution to make. It is healthy for us to have that internal debate, but there is no doubt that the type of people who will triumph in those elections will be those who have shown independence of spirit and who really are formidable scrutineers. It is those people whom we need to chair our Select Committees.</p>
	<p pid="b.211.0/11">The case for the House to have control over its own business is overwhelming, particularly regarding non-governmental time. I would like us to go further. The farce of private Members' Bills is currently an exercise in using up time. We march the non-governmental organisations and lobby groups up to the top of the hill, and an inordinate amount of time, paper and rain forest is wasted in debating matters that will never get through, because a Government Whip can stand up on a Friday morning and shout, &quot;Object.&quot; For goodness' sake, we have to be better than that. We have to have something better than a system of institutionalised filibustering, which is effectively how a lot of our time and energy is wasted. I would like us to go further in terms of the House controlling its own business.</p>
	<p pid="b.211.0/12">A small part of the report that I had some influence on concerns how the public can be better engaged in what goes on in this place. Currently, early-day motions are no more than political graffiti. We sign too many of them, there are too many of them and they are on too many subjects. I would like early-day motions to be limited and a system introduced-we allude to this in the report-whereby if an EDM gathers support from across the House in sufficient numbers, a debate can take place on the Floor of the House.</p>

Select Committee reports are debated on the day of publication, and there are three-minute constituency statements through which Members of Parliament can make a statement on a matter of import. Topical debates are decided not by the Government but by the House as a whole. I see this process as just the start. I want the report to be implemented now and a process set up, so that reform can continue on into the next Parliament and into the Parliament after that.</p>

	<p pid="b.213.4/1">In the brief time available, I want strongly to support the recommendations from the Reform of the House of Commons Committee. My objection is that the Committee was not allowed to go far enough, so I shall build on those foundations.</p>
	<p pid="b.213.4/2">First, it is essential not only that the Chair and members of Select Committees are kept free of the influence of the party managers, but-even more importantly-that the main recommendations of major reports by Select Committees in the course of a year are debated and voted on on the Floor of the House. I would like the Liaison Committee to be given the power to select some of those reports, so that there can be a vote on the Floor of the House on a substantive motion that reflects its recommendations.</p>
	<p pid="b.213.4/3">Secondly, I support the call made for Members to elect their own business Committee. There is no question but that, over time, the Executive have encroached increasingly on the rights of Members of the House, until they can do little more than rubber stamp what the Executive want without any prior consultation with the legislature. Thirdly, it has traditionally been the practice for members of the public to petition Parliament. That has largely fallen into desuetude, because there is certainly no guarantee that such petitions receive proper consideration or, indeed, any consideration at all. I therefore support the idea of a public petitions Committee, which would hand every petition either to a Select Committee for consideration, to the relevant Minister for action, or to the proposed business Committee for consideration for debate on the Floor of the House. To improve the public's sense of engagement, it would be a good idea if a petitions Committee rotated its meetings around the country, as, indeed, is already the case with the Public Petitions Committee in the Scottish Parliament.</p>
	<p pid="b.213.4/4">Again, as happens in some other countries, there is a strong case for allowing petitions that have attracted the signatures of a significant proportion of the electorate- 5 per cent. or whatever threshold we choose-automatically to have the right to be debated on the Floor of the House and be voted on. That does not, of course, preclude the tabling of amendments or the House reaching whatever decision it may make.</p>
	<p pid="b.213.4/5">I would have liked the Committee to have been given the right to go further. In particular, I think that Parliament should have the right to adopt its own commissions of inquiry when it considers that to be appropriate and necessary and, indeed, that it should have the right, when a Prime Minister proposes a committee of inquiry, to ratify that decision before the committee begins work. Similarly, I believe that Cabinet Ministers should be subject to ratification by the appropriate Select Committee of the House. That might seem a revolutionary proposal, but it is exactly what happens in congressional confirmation hearings in the United States.</p>
	<p pid="b.213.4/6">Finally, as other Members have pointedly asked, when do the Government propose a debate and vote on the Committee's proposals? Will the terms of that debate encapsulate the draft resolution proposed by the Committee, incorporating all its proposals, and will there be a vote signifying the House's decision to go ahead with the reforms straight away before the election? It would be helpful if the Minister could give clear and definite answers to those questions.</p>

	<p pid="b.214.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1841" name="Mark Fisher">the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central (Mark Fisher)</phrase> on securing the debate and on his comments, and other Members on their comments as well.</p>
	<p pid="b.214.0/2">The report, &quot;Rebuilding the House&quot;, opens with a quote from Sir Robert Worcester:</p>
	<p pid="b.214.0/3" class="indent">&quot;The public are sullen, some even mutinous.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.214.0/4">You can say that again. There has been no such disquiet in recent times about the state of our politics and our Parliament. Although the expenses scandals are part of that, let us not confuse what is symptomatic with what is causative. The problem is that people do not know what Members of Parliament are for, and if they do know what they are for, they know that we are not doing the job in the way they would want it done. That means that we must reform our political processes to make them more effective and relevant. It is instructive that those newspapers that were most vocal on the inadequacies of Parliament were unable to devote a single column inch to the Committee's report when it was published. They do not want to see Parliament made more effective, but I am happy that some Members do.</p>
	<p pid="b.214.0/5">I believe that there is a much wider agenda on democratic renewal, which other Members have touched on today. It would not be appropriate in this debate to discuss all the things I believe we should be looking at, but they include fixed-term Parliaments, the way in which we are elected to the House, the funding of political parties, which I spent six months discussing with colleagues and which has resulted in very little, and reform of the House of Lords, which I spent another six months discussing with other parties and which also resulted in very little. That agenda would include proper devolution and subsidiarity so that we move power to local government in this country and from the European level to the national level.</p>
	<p pid="b.214.0/6">Today, however, we are concentrating on Executive control of our legislature. We ought to recognise-those who do not should look at other Parliaments around the world-that this country is almost unique in having a Parliament dominated by the Executive. It is within our power to address that issue, if only colleagues from all parties in the House recognised the need to do so. It is within our power to address it, but we only have the opportunity to do so if the Executive allow it. That is the conundrum at the heart of the matter: we can change the balance of power between the Executive and the legislature only if the Executive let us do so, and we need to look at that.</p>
	<p pid="b.214.0/7">I do not believe that the Committee's report answers all the questions. It is a good report, but the Committee was constrained by its terms of reference and the time frame within which it was required to report, so there are issues with which its report does not deal. However, it does deal with much of what is going wrong. For instance, it questions what happens to Bills on Report. It is a catastrophe for the House that large and important Bills, often dealing with matters literally of life and death, pass unscrutinised to another place so that it can do the job that we in the elected House should be doing. That is an outrage.</p>
	<p pid="b.214.0/8">Even when Bills are brought before us that we are told will set a paradigm for the way in which such matters will be treated in future, that is not the case. When the Equality Bill was recently introduced in Parliament, the Leader of the House told us that it would be an example of the way to do it. Well, it was an example of the way we do do it, because half of it was not scrutinised on Report and was passed to the other House for it to do the job we should be doing.</p>
	<p pid="b.214.0/9">Access to the agenda of the House is a key area, and not just for the public. I absolutely agree with hon. Members who have said that the public should have a way of influencing what we discuss, but Back Benchers, Opposition parties and Members who have a genuine interest in bringing a matter forward, must have better access to the agenda. It is in that regard that the proposed business Committee becomes so important, but it is the one area on which I have doubts about the Select Committee's recommendations, because I would prefer a single business Committee. There should be a business Committee-I have no doubt whatever about that-because that is transparently what works in other legislatures, yet we leave it to the Executive to decide what we debate, which I find extraordinary.</p>

	<p pid="b.216.3/1">My personal view is that it would be a Committee for all business of the House. I believe that we scrutinise expenditure extraordinarily badly. On the days on which we are supposed to deal with estimates, the one thing we do not discuss is the estimates. It is extraordinary that we devote a minimal amount of time, with minute participation, to eye-wateringly large amounts of taxpayers' money. That is what we are there to scrutinise on those days, but we do such a poor job of it. That problem is not fully addressed in the Committee's report. It does deal with control of Select Committees, which is an important issue, but, in the great scheme of things, not the most important issue. However, it is certainly something on which we should make progress.</p>
	<p pid="b.216.3/2">Private Members' business is important, as it is about re-establishing respect for the role of the individual Member in the House and for the idea that we are here as legislators and we have things to say on behalf of our constituents. It is for Parliament to determine whether what we have to say is relevant in the wider statute book, rather than for a single member of the Government-a Whip-to shout &quot;Object&quot; and ruin many months of detailed work.</p>
	<p pid="b.216.3/3">The report has produced a draft resolution for the consideration of the House, so the question is this: why on earth are the Government not simply putting that draft resolution before the House? They said that that was a matter of urgency, but they have dillied and dallied for weeks. They have written to me and to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1475" name="Shailesh Vara">the hon. Member for North-West Cambridgeshire (Mr. Vara)</phrase>, the shadow Leader of the House, whom I am pleased to see in the Chamber, and asked what we think about the matter. It is not for me alone to think about those issues, but for the House to think about them. I believe that that resolution should be put before the House and that we should have a debate on it, because there is still detailed work to be done on making changes to Standing Orders if the House agrees to the draft resolution, as I hope it will. The most important issue before the House is how we make Parliament work effectively. It is a matter of urgency, of massive import and cannot be delayed.</p>
	<p pid="b.216.3/4">There was a Roman senator-I believe it was Cato the Censor-who used to finish every debate with &quot;Carthago delenda est&quot;: Carthage must be destroyed. If I had the same discipline, I would end every speech with &quot;<phrase class="standing-order" code="14">Standing Order No. 14</phrase> delenda est&quot;. We must remove that Standing Order to give back control of this House to its Members, not the people who serve as Ministers, who should not have that responsibility.</p>

	<p pid="b.217.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1841" name="Mark Fisher">the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central (Mark Fisher)</phrase> on securing this debate and on his contribution. I would like to put on the record the valuable work that he has done prior to this debate. He was the founder of, and then an assiduous contributor to the cross-party efforts of, Parliament First, which for some time has been advocating reform of how we do our business. Among its publications was a report in April 2003, &quot;Parliament's Last Chance&quot;. While the title may have seemed a little apocalyptic at the time, perhaps with hindsight the sentiments were not so wrong.</p>
	<p pid="b.217.0/2">May I also congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1478" name="Tony Wright">the hon. Member for Cannock Chase (Dr. Wright)</phrase> and all the other members of the Reform of the House of Commons Committee on their efforts in producing their report, especially given the relatively short time they had to do it?</p>
	<p pid="b.217.0/3">In the wake of revelations concerning Members' allowances and expenses, Parliament's reputation has reached a low ebb. Therefore, any proposals for reform must be considered in the light of enhancing public confidence in Parliament and its Members. The revelations shattered many people's faith in our political system, but it is fair to say that the cracks in our institution had been growing for many years.</p>
	<p pid="b.217.0/4">Before touching on the report's specific recommendations, it is worth highlighting the Government's record to date. I am happy to give credit where it is due. On the constitutional front, the Scottish Parliament and Welsh Assembly have received widespread support, and there is some expectation that the Northern Ireland Assembly will help to deliver a lasting peace settlement. The Freedom of Information Act 2000 has helped to make Parliament and the Executive more open and accountable, while some of the working practices of the Commons have been brought up to 21st-century standards, certainly in terms of being in tune with modern family life. Those changes are welcome, and if we were in government we would keep them.</p>
	<p pid="b.217.0/5">However, welcome though those changes are, and leaving devolution aside, the changes introduced since 1997 have not substantially changed the relationship between Parliament and the Executive. In fact, they have tilted it in favour of the Executive. For example, we have the use of the automatic guillotine, control by the Whips of nominations to Select Committees, unacceptable delays in obtaining timely and proper replies from Ministers when Members ask oral and written questions, and regular briefings to the media on statements before a word has been uttered in the House-for example, today's announcement by the Defence Secretary.</p>

	<p pid="b.217.2/1">I am afraid I will not. As I have very limited time, I must press on.</p>
	<p pid="b.217.2/2">The Defence Secretary briefed the &quot;Today&quot; programme prior to a statement. The Freedom of Information Act has helped, but there is still much more that needs to be done before we can truly say that we are connecting with the public.</p>
	<p pid="b.217.2/3">A week after the Prime Minister's coronation in July 2007, he spoke of entrusting</p>
	<p pid="b.217.2/4" class="indent">&quot;more power to Parliament and the British people.&quot;-[<phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2007-07-03.815"><i>Official Report</i>, 3 July 2007; Vol. 462, c. 815</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="b.217.2/5">He also spoke of reducing the power of the Executive and of increasing their accountability. Those fine words were of course welcomed by all, but as has happened so often, the Government simply failed to follow through. Even the reforms we are discussing today are not from a Government initiative. Instead, they stem from a letter written by the hon. Member for Cannock Chase to the Prime Minister in which he suggested setting up the Reform of the House of Commons Committee.</p>
	<p pid="b.217.2/6">The absence of any genuine desire for reform is also illustrated by the shambles that is the Modernisation Committee, which has not met for 18 months. As well as being chaired by a Minister, one of its last actions was to force through proposals for Regional Select Committees. That was done despite the objections of the Opposition parties; they were forced through on the casting vote of the Leader of the House.</p>
	<p pid="b.217.2/7">In contrast with the Government's dithering and procrastination, my party has shown real leadership. We have been calling for reform of the Commons for some time. In February 2006, my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1932" name="David Cameron">the Member for Witney (Mr. Cameron)</phrase>, the Leader of the Opposition, established the Conservative party's democracy taskforce under the chairmanship of my right hon. and learned Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1794" name="Kenneth Clarke">the Member for Rushcliffe (Mr. Clarke)</phrase>. Also serving on that committee were my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1613" name="George Young">the Member for North-West Hampshire (Sir George Young)</phrase> and my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1498" name="Andrew Tyrie">the Member for Chichester (Mr. Tyrie)</phrase>. The taskforce's report called for radical changes to how Parliament operates, and I am pleased that many of its proposals have been adopted by the Wright Committee.</p>
	<p pid="b.217.2/8">For example, in May my right hon. Friend the Leader of the Opposition made a speech in which he stressed the need for Select Committee Members and Chairmen to be elected. Select Committees are an important part of parliamentary scrutiny, but the undue influence of party Whips on membership is a matter of concern. The last time reform in this area was seriously pressed was in 2003 by the late Robin Cook, who was then Leader of the House. He was outmanoeuvred by his own party Whips and voted down in the House on a recommendation of the Modernisation Committee, of which he was Chairman.</p>
	<p pid="b.217.2/9">Put simply, Select Committee chairmanships should not be offered as rewards for party loyalty. The situation encountered in 2001, when Government Whips attempted to remove two Select Committee Chairmen who were seen as &quot;difficult&quot; to their own party, should not be allowed to happen again. We should have Select Committee Chairmen and members who enjoy the support and confidence of the House. They should be the best people for the job. At times, that may be inconvenient for the Opposition and the Government, but it is the way forward.</p>
	<p pid="b.217.2/10">We agree that Deputy Speakers should be elected, and we look forward to considering the Procedure Committee's recommendations in the not too distant future.</p>
	<p pid="b.217.2/11">The proposals regarding petitions are especially welcome and long overdue. Again, they follow proposals previously made by my right hon. Friend the Leader of the Opposition. Other more radical comments regarding the triggering of debate or legislation after a certain number of signatures have been received are also welcome. The Committee is right to caution against the effect that such changes may have on the operation of the House, but, if implemented correctly, they would help in the process of reconnecting the Commons with the public.</p>
	<p pid="b.217.2/12">However, we would go further. We have specifically said that we would introduce citizens' initiatives: if a petition to Parliament secures 100,000 signatures, there should be a formal debate, and if members of the public are backed by a petition of 1 million electors, they should be able to table a Bill to be presented and voted on in Parliament.</p>
	<p pid="b.217.2/13">We have also called for the House to have more control over its own business. Of course, the Government have the right to pursue their legislative agenda according to what has been set out in their manifesto, but that does not mean they should control the whole timetable. It is important to allow MPs proper time to debate. One of the Government's most retrograde parliamentary innovations has been the use of programme motions for every Bill. They have stifled debate and resulted in numerous instances where new clauses and amendments tabled to Bills have simply not been debated; for example, that happened with the recent Equality Bill.</p>
	<p pid="b.217.2/14">The way in which proposals will be implemented is almost as important as the changes themselves. It is clear that some can be introduced immediately, such as changes to how petitions are presented. However, as the report says, any changes would have to be implemented in stages. That is sensible, and we need to ensure that the implementation of any new Standing Orders does not inhibit the ability of a new Parliament to hit the ground running.</p>
	<p pid="b.217.2/15">But we should go much further. The Wright Committee was constrained by its terms of reference. Members will of course be aware that much time was wasted at the outset, not least because of changes to the original motion, but that should not stop the process of ensuring that Parliament is reformed further to serve the public better. For example, we would like to see the abolition of wasteful Regional Select Committees, a reduction in the size of the Commons and equalisation of constituency sizes, a vast improvement in the scrutiny of European Union legislation, a cut in the overall cost of politics and a determined effort to resolve the West Lothian question so that only English MPs can vote on wholly English matters. Those and other measures are necessary if we are really to reform Parliament and make its processes and procedures fit for the 21st century.</p>
	<p pid="b.217.2/16">To conclude, my party has been leading on this matter for some time. We welcome the majority of the proposals in the report, but we must ensure that changes and their implementation are made in an appropriate and achievable way. This is not the end of the line but only a station stop along the track of necessary reform and modernisation. In last week's business questions, several Members spoke of having a full day's debate on the report. I very much hope that this short debate will not constitute a whole day's debate or, indeed, a contribution to it. Moreover, will the Deputy Leader of the House confirm that every effort will be made to ensure that no ministerial statements and the like interfere on the day? Will she also clarify a particular point from last week's business questions, when the Leader of the House spoke of responding to the debate? Will she confirm that there will be a statement, either written or oral, followed by a proper debate?</p>
	<p pid="b.217.2/17">The Government have asked the Opposition parties for their views on the report. Will the Deputy Leader of the House take my contribution today as our response to the Wright report? We look forward to hearing from the Minister about what the Government's view is on the report.</p>

	<p pid="b.220.0/1">It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Mr. Hood, and that of Mr. Atkinson earlier in the debate. I, too, congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1841" name="Mark Fisher">the Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central (Mark Fisher)</phrase> on securing this debate and on opening it so well. It is an important issue for the House to discuss: we can see that from the number of contributions. I counted about 17 hon. Members at certain points in the debate, although slightly fewer are present now.</p>
	<p pid="b.220.0/2">As this debate has developed in the House, I have been grateful for the chance to listen to the views of all hon. Members who have contributed to it, including today the hon. Members for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy (Mr. Llwyd)-always difficult to pronounce-and for Castle Point (Bob Spink), my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1850" name="David Drew">the Member for Stroud (Mr. Drew)</phrase>, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1922" name="Andrew Murrison">the hon. Member for Westbury (Dr. Murrison)</phrase>, my hon. Friends the Members for North-West Leicestershire (David Taylor) and for North-East Derbyshire (Natascha Engel), the hon. Members for Cities of London and Westminster (Mr. Field), for Isle of Wight (Mr. Turner), for Oxford, West and Abingdon (Dr. Harris) and for Banbury (Tony Baldry), my hon. Friends the Members for Nottingham, North (Mr. Allen) and for Reading, West (Martin Salter), my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1753" name="Michael Meacher">the Member for Oldham, West and Royton (Mr. Meacher)</phrase>, and the Opposition Front Bench spokesmen, the hon. Members for Somerton and Frome (Mr. Heath) and for North-West Cambridgeshire (Mr. Vara).</p>
	<p pid="b.220.0/3">As many hon. and right hon. Members have said, reform of the House is a broad, important subject, but it is not new: it is a continual process and we should regard it as such. There should be change as procedures become outdated or new systems develop. I support a number of the reforms that have been advanced by both the Modernisation Committee and the Procedure Committee since 1997. Indeed, it was recently 10 years since Westminster Hall started to be used as the parallel Chamber, and it is useful, as we have seen today, in allowing debates that are open to all hon. Members. The Modernisation Committee recommended establishing this room as a second debating Chamber. That change was not met with support throughout the whole House. It is interesting to note that our current Speaker was a key opponent of that reform. But I think that we can agree, particularly today, that this change has been a successful innovation.</p>
	<p pid="b.220.0/4">Other reforms brought about by the Modernisation Committee have been important too, including changes to the sitting hours of the House and deferred Divisions. We do not always want to find ourselves-particularly those hon. Members with children-voting at 11.20 pm or 11.40 pm, as we did last night: that is not family-friendly. Another reform is the introduction of core tasks for Select Committees. More recently we have had topical questions and topical debates, which hon. Members have mentioned. As with the use of Westminster Hall for wider debates, topical questions and debates will be reviewed in terms of how they are working. I think most hon. Members would agree that the topical questions innovation is working.</p>
	<p pid="b.220.0/5">Recently, we debated the House of Commons annual report, although that debate was not as well attended as this one, and discussed the importance of public engagement and involvement. There were not many contributions on that matter today, but it is a vital part of what we need to develop in our reform agenda.</p>
	<p pid="b.220.0/6">Another change stemming from the Modernisation Committee was the report that set up the Regional Select and Regional Grand Committees. I defend the Regional Select Committees and particularly the Regional Grand Committees that met throughout the summer. I read the reports of those Committees, in which some useful debates were held, particularly on factors such as the economic downturn.</p>

	<p pid="b.221.3/1">There have been some important changes and reforms. It is important, as we look forward, not to lose sight of the fact that there have been some good reforms that have helped matters.</p>
	<p pid="b.221.3/2">The systems of pre-legislative and post-legislative scrutiny give a more systematic approach to scrutinising Bills. I understand that there are issues regarding the scheduling of Report stage and so on, which hon. Members have raised, but we have got better at our task of scrutiny: the current Bribery Bill is one example of that. Post-legislative scrutiny memorandums have also helped.</p>
	<p pid="b.221.3/3">The Equality Bill, which was mentioned by the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome, was complicated legislation that replaced eight former pieces of discrimination legislation. Although perhaps not all the processes helped, some of them, including interleaving the easy-read guide, helped hon. Members and the public to work on the Bill. Those things are important.</p>
	<p pid="b.221.3/4">Most of the changes I have mentioned have been welcomed, although some more than others. Last night we were here from 10.20 pm to 11.20 pm, setting up the London Regional Select Committee. That took a little while, but those innovations are important.</p>
	<p pid="b.221.3/5">As hon. Members know, events this year related to the crisis surrounding hon. Members' use of allowances have created a pressure for reform of the system, but more generally too, and that is mentioned in the Committee's report. On <phrase class="date" code="2009-06-10">10 June</phrase>, as hon. Members have mentioned, the Prime Minister said that he was happy to support the proposal from my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1478" name="Tony Wright">the Member for Cannock Chase (Dr. Wright)</phrase> to chair that special commission, as we called it then, to advise on the processes that the Committee took forward.</p>
	<p pid="b.221.3/6">The Committee reported three weeks ago. It recognises that its report contains conclusions and recommendations that are directed not at the Government, but at the House, Ministers and Back Benchers alike. The Committee said that it expects a Government reply on some points, and that it would be due around the end of January. The Committee also said that it expects a debate. The Leader of the House has said that the Government intend to make time for a debate on the important matters we have debated today, and she reaffirmed that at business questions last week. I cannot add more detail to that, but I expect her to announce a date in the usual way. I take on board the point made by the hon. Member for North-West Cambridgeshire about ministerial statements being made on the day. The Leader of the House said she would try to make sure that that did not happen.</p>
	<p pid="b.221.3/7">Returning to the report, as my hon. Friend the Member for Reading, West said, the appointment of Deputy Speakers was considered by the Procedure Committee, and we will respond on that debate too at the same time as discussing the other matters I have mentioned.</p>
	<p pid="b.221.3/8">The report of the Reform Committee touches, importantly, on areas in which further work is needed, such as the Liaison Committee's re-examining the current role of Select Committees. We have heard a great deal in this debate about the role of Select Committees. The task of looking again at them may tie into the concerns expressed by my hon. Friend the Member for North-East Derbyshire. There has been strong support voiced in a number of contributions about changing the way the House appoints the members and Chairs of Select Committees, but an important difference was expressed by my hon. Friend, who said that, although we accept that Select Committees work well, we need to consider what we are proposing. As she said, secret ballots of the whole House may not work. The Government could, with a majority, foist their choice of Select Committee Chairs on the House. That needs thinking about. My hon. Friend also asked how such ballots would get a gender and geographical balance and a mix of levels of experience. That deserves detailed consideration. As we have mentioned previously, there will probably be a large number of brand new MPs in the 2010 intake. We need to consider how a ballot would work with a large number of new people.</p>

	Government Science Priorities
</minor-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-12-15b.224.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1885" speakername="Vincent Cable" colnum="224"  time="012:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm091215/halltext/91215h0008.htm#09121532000530">
	<p pid="b.224.1/1">It is a privilege to have the opportunity to introduce this short debate on science funding. The matter has come to light in the past week with the announcement that the Government will try to trim &#163;600 million from their budget for higher education and science. I am sure that they will be deluged with proposals from other Members of Parliament to discuss how that will affect their constituencies. I have already seen some strong statements on the bigger picture from the Royal Society, the Royal Society of Chemistry, and other bodies. We have only half an hour, so I shall not deal with that big picture; I want to deal with one specific and narrow aspect, which is how the Government's funding proposals affect one institution-the National Physical Laboratory in my constituency.</p>
	<p pid="b.224.1/2">I shall develop significance of the laboratory in the wider science community. It has approximately 350 of the country's leading scientists-predominantly physicists and mathematicians-and it is the cornerstone of the Government's activity in national measurement. It faces a short-term proposal to remove 10 per cent. of its budget, which Prospect, the trade union representing most of the professional scientists, estimates could involve about 40 professional scientists having to go from core programmes. That may be premature, because we do not yet know how many people will be involved, but the cut in financial and human terms will be substantial, both in an extremely important institution for British science, and for Teddington in my constituency.</p>
	<p pid="b.224.1/3">First, I shall explain a little of the background to show why the matter is important and why it merits special attention. Measurement science is not dramatic or headline-grabbing, but it is at the heart of scientific work. This country has four significant laboratories specialising in different sorts of measurement work, and three happen to be on the same campus in my constituency. They are the National Physical Laboratory, the laboratory of the Government Chemist, which is now part of a privatised unit specialising in chemistry research, and the National Weights and Measures Laboratory. In terms of resources, the National Physical Laboratory accounts for approximately 80 per cent. of national measurement activity. That is crucial, because any applied science, whether for scientific research or industrial purposes, must have a measurement base, whether that involves distance, time, heat or the measurements required by new sciences such as nanotechnology and bioscience. The concept of Greenwich mean time, for example, is actually Teddington mean time, because the laboratory containing the atomic clocks that determine the basic standard of time is there. Measurement is at the core of applied science which, along with engineering, would not exist without a measurement base, and that is what the laboratory provides. It develops and improves measurement techniques, and derives new systems of measurement for new problems, one of which is carbon. Carbon trading must be based on a common denominator of measurement.</p>
	<p pid="b.224.1/4">Secondly, although the National Physical Laboratory is a national institution, it is part of a global network of institutions, and a leading international institution in the measurement of science, or metrology. There are comparable institutions in the United States, including the National Institute for Standards and Technologies, and Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt in Germany, but the National Physical Laboratory is recognised as being the leading institution, or certainly among the leading handful of globally important institutions. Those institutions collaborate but also compete, and the laboratories will say that at the very time at which we are embarking on a process of cuts, NIST and PTB should have a massive infusion of resources, because their Governments recognise that if their applied science effort is to improve and expand they must have a strong base for measurement science.</p>
	<p pid="b.224.1/5">Thirdly, we can all argue for more money to be spent on science. As someone who started his adult life with scientific training at university, I believe in science. However, as the Minister will say, there is infinite demand, and resources are limited, so there must be a return for society. The National Physical Laboratory's work and our national effort on measurement generally is striking in its benefit-to-cost ratio. A departmental report from the National Measurement Office, published by the then Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills says that every</p>
	<p pid="b.224.1/6" class="indent">&quot;additional &#163;6 million spent by Government on measurement technology would deliver up to &#163;410 million of economic impact annually.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.224.1/7">Most commercial organisations would die to have such a return with every pound producing &#163;60 of return for society. That is an extraordinary benefit. Grossing up the figures and applying them to the laboratory as a whole, as the laboratory's director did in his presentation to the House of Lords Science and Technology Committee, shows that about &#163;75 million a year, of which &#163;50 million comes from the Government generates &#163;2 billion a year of economic value. That is an extraordinary multiplier.</p>
	<p pid="b.224.1/8">At the heart of the controversy is the fact that, despite that extraordinary benefit, which the Government themselves have estimated-it is not a self-serving estimate by the people involved-it has been proposed that instead of adding &#163;6 million to generate that benefit, &#163;6 million will be taken away. Two conclusions may be drawn. Perhaps there is something wrong with the Government's measurement, and perhaps the benefits are not real and something is wrong with the calculation. That is possible-I do not know how they arrived at their numbers-but if they are right, an extraordinarily damaging decision is being contemplated. One of those propositions must be true, and I hope that the Minister will address it when he responds.</p>
	<p pid="b.224.1/9">That is the context, but I want to take the argument on by stressing that I want a positive outcome. I am not here to make debating points, to lecture the Government, or to apportion blame. That is not the spirit of this debate, and I want to make several specific points. First, I accept that Government spending must be cut, almost certainly in the Minister's Department. I am not for one minute suggesting that that can be avoided-and I have been outspoken in my capacity as a party spokesman in saying that we must be realistic in facing up to the need for cuts-but the issue is how it is to be done. What is particularly worrying is how the process is being managed. It is worth quoting Brian Bowsher, director of the National Physical Laboratory, who said in his evidence to the House of Lords that</p>
	<p pid="b.224.1/10" class="indent">&quot;our links with our immediate...BIS colleagues I think are very positive in terms of how we structure the programme. What I am concerned about though is that by the time it gets to them it is difficult to see the evidence base for the reductions and it tends to be, 'We will take ten per cent off everyone'.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.224.1/11">That &quot;10 per cent. off everyone&quot; approach by the Department towards the cuts is seriously worrying.</p>
	<p pid="b.224.1/12">Let me reinforce what I said earlier. I fully accept that there must be discipline in public spending, and that there will almost certainly be cuts. However, that must be done rationally and as far as I can establish, at the moment we have a &quot;10 per cent. off everything&quot; approach, which is not efficient, either economically or administratively.</p>

	<p pid="b.226.0/1">Some of my constituents work at the National Physical Laboratory, and there are a number of important scientific establishments in my constituency, which is why I am interested in the points raised by the hon. Gentleman. Does he agree that the science budget has not been well handled for a number of years? We faced a crisis last year with compulsory redundancies because of the way in which the Science and Technology Facilities Council handled its negotiations with what was the Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills, and is now the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills.</p>

	<p pid="b.226.1/1">I accept what the hon. Gentleman says-there is probably a systemic problem. The Department might have been good at administering expansion, but it is not good at administering contraction. There does not appear to be a rational, systematic way of making choices, which goes to the heart of what I want to say.</p>
	<p pid="b.226.1/2">I accept that we are dealing with a financially austere environment, but the issue is about how it is managed. I am not suggesting that my constituency-or the institutions in it-be spared from economies made across the country. It would be easy to say, &quot;Not in my backyard; deal with the problem somewhere else.&quot; I recognise that there are 160 Government science laboratories, and they must all be treated fairly and be subject to the same systematic form of assessment.</p>
	<p pid="b.226.1/3">I have not come here to attack the Government for their handling of science. Over the past decade, a lot of investment has gone into science. There have been good Science Ministers, such as Lord Sainsbury and Lord Drayson, who are very committed to science and are knowledgeable about the subject. I know that the Prime Minister takes a personal interest in boosting science, as does the Secretary of State. However, having built up a reputation for being pro-science, there is a serious danger of the Government blowing that reputation if this more difficult phase is badly handled.</p>
	<p pid="b.226.1/4">I am not here to attack the Department either. The director of the National Physical Laboratory has gone out of his way to point out that its relationship with the Department has generally been good and productive. I can attest to that, as some years ago there was a difficult process of managing the private finance initiative project that rebuilt the laboratory. It was handled sensitively and came to a successful conclusion. It is more worrying that in a very difficult environment, the process is not being carefully managed, and we have across-the-board cuts without any attempt to prioritise and establish costs and benefits.</p>
	<p pid="b.226.1/5">I would like the Minister to provide some reassurance that a proper process is being established to look at how a more difficult resource environment can be managed. At some point, a process must be established that asks what things are in the science budget that cannot be dealt with by the private sector-if the private sector will do them, there is no need for the Government to do them. However, almost by definition, measurement science for the most part cannot be dealt with by the private sector. If we go back to mediaeval times, long before Governments accepted the need to provide roads, let alone schools and hospitals, a basic function of government was to provide a common or standard system of weights and measures. Providing that basic public good is basic government, and it cannot simply be shifted on to the private sector.</p>
	<p pid="b.226.1/6">The things that survive and are given priority will presumably be those that produce the highest returns to society. I have quoted figures from the Minister's Department which suggest that this area is very productive, and surely that should be the rational basis on which decisions are made. When establishing priorities, it is clear that some activities must be focused on the things that will matter in the future-the whole carbon economy problem is obviously at the centre of the Government's priorities. I worry that as a result of the cuts, the critical mass needed in British measurement for dealing with the carbon economy might not be there.</p>
	<p pid="b.226.1/7">My question to the Minister is this: has the Department got a method? Has it got a system of risk assessment? There is no need to rush into these cuts. The Government agree with my party that although we will have to economise substantially on public spending, we should not rush to do so during a recession-that would be the worst thing to do. It would be better to act in a measured way and establish a proper system for assessing risk and costs and benefits. I am pressing the Government to indicate how they will do that.</p>
	<p pid="b.226.1/8">At the same time as announcing cuts, the Government have announced increases in spending in something called a strategic investment fund. I think that &#163;200 million has been allocated to that, and I am sure that it is a desirable thing to do. However, who decided which money goes into the expanding field and which money is taken out of other scientific institutions? Is there a basis for calculating such things? I notice that technology for video games is included in the list of activities funded by the strategic investment fund. I do not want to be snobbish; I am sure that video games could usefully benefit from improved technology as much as anything else. However, who has decided that &#163;3.5 million invested in video game technology is more valuable than &#163;3.5 million invested in measurement science? There must be a system for doing such things systematically.</p>
	<p pid="b.226.1/9">To conclude, and to give the Minister a proper opportunity to reply, I have not come here to launch a tirade against the principle of cuts, or to lecture the Government on their poor performance in science, because in general they have been very pro-science. I want to make two simple points. First, I want an assurance from the Minister that a proper, rigorous, deliberate process will be set in train to decide how the cuts in the Department will be made, and that they will not be made on a scattergun basis or on the basis of &quot;10 per cent. off everything&quot;. We need a proper, rigorous process for evaluating this.</p>
	<p pid="b.226.1/10">On a more personal level, I hope that it will be possible to pursue these issues in more detail with the Minister for Science and Innovation. Perhaps, as the icing on the cake, we could persuade the Secretary of State to come to the laboratories in Teddington, which is just down the road from Westminster. He would be extremely welcome, and I am sure that he would learn a great deal.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-12-15b.228.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1882" speakername="David Lammy" speakeroffice="The Minister for Higher Education and Intellectual Property"  colnum="228"  time="012:47:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm091215/halltext/91215h0008.htm#09121532000533">
	<p pid="b.228.0/1">Let me begin by congratulating <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1885" name="Vincent Cable">the hon. Member for Twickenham (Dr. Cable)</phrase> on securing the debate, and thanking him for the manner in which he made his contribution. He is known to the general public as his party's Treasury spokesman, and once again he has demonstrated his sound grasp of finance issues. He also has a long-standing interest and background in science, and today he has been able to combine the two and we are grateful for that. In spite of the difficulties experienced at the National Physical Laboratory, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will allow me to present the context in which we are having this debate-the position of science in wider society, and what the Government have been attempting to do.</p>
	<p pid="b.228.0/2">The Government inherited a UK science base in chronic decline, thanks to a sustained period of underfunding. Not only was there a shortfall in recurrent public funding of science, but the science facilities in our universities and research institutions were, in some cases, literally crumbling and falling behind those of many of our competitors. We still had great scientists, but many of the best found that they could fulfil their potential to make new discoveries only by joining the brain drain of scientists leaving our shores and going to other countries. In addition, the next generation of British scientists coming up through our schools was being short-changed, because the numbers of specialist science teachers were falling dramatically across the country.</p>
	<p pid="b.228.0/3">There was a widespread feeling that the problem was too big to tackle; indeed, there was an effective campaign at the time called Save British Science. However, we came to office and we tackled the problem. The Government have invested in science and research, and that investment has risen year on year. It has risen dramatically, and by next year will be double in real terms what it was in 1997. Equally importantly, the science and research budget remains ring-fenced-protected-to ensure that the money voted by Parliament for science and research is allocated to support science and research.</p>
	<p pid="b.228.0/4">We also inherited a massive capital investment backlog for science research facilities. We therefore created an unprecedented science and research investment fund, which provided &#163;2 billion to help universities to make good the capital shortfall that they had experienced and to create science facilities of a quality worthy of our scientists. We went further and created a new higher education innovation fund-currently worth &#163;130 million a year-to encourage universities to ensure that the benefits of new discoveries spread beyond the scientific community into the wider community and society. That was because of the continued suggestion in British national life that we invented things, but the commercialisation and extension of that science was something that we were not able to do as effectively. To improve specialist science teaching in schools, we introduced incentives for teacher training. As a result, there are more science graduates in the system than ever before in our history.</p>
	<p pid="b.228.0/5">That is why British science is strong today. It is the most productive in the G8, and ranks second only to that of the United States in international league tables. The National Physical Laboratory is a key component of that strength. Indeed, it has been an integral part of our science infrastructure ever since 1901. The work that it does in establishing, maintaining and refining national measurement standards may sound a bit academic and dry, but it underpins many of the scientific developments that we take for granted around us. Without incredibly accurate and consistent systems of measurement, the internet would not exist; nor would satellite navigation, microsurgery and advanced radiology, and many of the new green technologies on which a sustainable future will increasingly depend. That is why the National Physical Laboratory receives support from my Department on so large a scale.</p>
	<p pid="b.228.0/6">To gain a clearer understanding of the issues, earlier today I discussed the case with the laboratory's parent organisation, the National Measurement Office. I have also heard from my right hon. and noble Friend the Minister for Science and Innovation, who is willing to meet the hon. Member for Twickenham if that would be helpful. He is keen to discuss the programme or timetable for decisions pertaining to the fiscal strength of the National Physical Laboratory.</p>
	<p pid="b.228.0/7">Since 1995, the laboratory has been a Government-owned, contractor-operated institute. That means that it is owned by the taxpayer but operated under contract by a private company-in this case, a subsidiary of Serco. The contract runs until 2014, and guarantees the laboratory an index-linked annual minimum income from my Department. That currently stands at &#163;41.5 million, but the actual funding that the laboratory receives this year will be &#163;47.4 million-some 72 per cent. of its total income.</p>
	<p pid="b.228.0/8">In his Front-Bench role, the hon. Member for Twickenham has acknowledged more than once the need for publicly funded bodies to make efficiencies in these difficult times. The National Physical Laboratory is not immune from that need, but the core funding that it receives next year from the Department will fall by a relatively small amount to &#163;45 million. I remind the hon. Gentleman that that is not its sole income. Its status allows it to garner funds from other sources. I assure him in particular that the current problems that the laboratory faces are not, as his website claims, the result of</p>
	<p pid="b.228.0/9" class="indent">&quot;a junior civil servant putting a red line through key bits of science research&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.228.0/10">Next year's grants from my Department should not affect the laboratory's sustainability, nor the jobs for the hon. Gentleman's constituents that it supports, because the amount will be substantially more than the contractual minimum that I have mentioned and on which the laboratory's planning assumptions have been based. I am bound to add that the current economic climate would make many bodies envious of the funding that the laboratory has received. It is important to go back to the contractual basis and the funding that Serco said that it needed to run the laboratory, and to recognise that the Government have gone further and will still go further next year, notwithstanding the efficiencies that we have had to make. The Government's continuing commitment to the laboratory's work has, I hope, been demonstrated by, among other things, significant investment in its facilities, with a new laboratory building just completed.</p>
	<p pid="b.228.0/11">Moreover, the laboratory's core funding does not include nearly &#163;1 million that it will receive over the next three years from my Department's public sector research exploitation fund to help it to strengthen its capacity to commercialise the work that it does. That in turn should help it to diversify its sources of income for future years. I should also mention the research councils. The laboratory cannot receive funds directly from them, but it may benefit from them by working in partnership with bodies-notably universities-that can receive research council grants. Indeed, it is doing so. Two current projects are especially worthy of note. One is the LIDAR-light detection and ranging-sensing technology system for aircraft that the laboratory is developing with the universities of Cambridge and Manchester. The other is the post-doctoral research partnership in measurement technologies that the laboratory has formed with the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council.</p>
	<p pid="b.228.0/12">None of that is to say that the laboratory's management are not dealing with serious problems, which cut to the heart of the issues that the hon. Gentleman has rightly brought to the House. Assumptions have been made that are not quite bearing fruit. I am not sure that they are entirely in relation to Government grant because, as I said, we are meeting our minimum standards, but there have been costs, particularly in respect of energy, that were not predicted but have gone up substantially, and costs in respect of pensions, which perhaps are more predictable but nevertheless are making the business plan particularly difficult at this time. Those issues cut to the heart of the laboratory's current problems.</p>
	<p pid="b.228.0/13">The Department is very keen to work with the hon. Gentleman and the laboratory to find a way to deal with the matter. There may have to be some reorganisation, but we are clear that we remain keen to ensure that we preserve the infrastructure and ensure that fundamental capabilities in key areas such as health, energy-</p>

	Bone Marrow Register
</minor-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-12-15b.231.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1894" speakername="Chris Ruane" colnum="231"  time="013:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm091215/halltext/91215h0009.htm#09121532000535">
	<p pid="b.231.1/1">In the past two years, two people I personally know have been struck down with leukaemia, as was another person I admired from afar-the late campaigning journalist, Adrian Sudbury, who worked with the Anthony Nolan Trust to do more than anyone else to raise awareness of bone marrow issues.</p>
	<p pid="b.231.1/2">Of the two people I know personally, one is a young lad called Max Tami, who is only 11 years old-he was nine years old when he was struck down with leukaemia. He is the son of my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1372" name="Mark Tami">the Member for Alyn and Deeside (Mark Tami)</phrase>, who is a friend and colleague. The other person is a constituent and friend of mine, Mike Peters, who used to be the lead singer with the 1980s Welsh band The Alarm. Since the band split up, Mike has pursued a very successful solo career. Both those individuals have tried to raise awareness of leukaemia and of the importance of donating stem cells and bone marrow to help cancer sufferers. Max recently had a starring role on &quot;Children in Need&quot;, where he nearly outshone Terry Wogan, asking people to come forward to be donors.</p>
	<p pid="b.231.1/3">Two years ago, Mike Peters was stricken with cancer for the second time in his life. Mike is a whirlwind of energy and has promoted awareness of the importance of donating. He has done that with his band at the top of the Empire State building, as well as from the foothills of Everest and the foothills of Kilimanjaro. He co-founded his own charity, the Love Hope Strength Foundation, with fellow cancer sufferer, American citizen James Chippendale. The two have hosted more than 80 donor drives at music events across the US. Their foundation was sponsored by DKMS and Visa and has become the first resident charity at the famed Red Rocks amphitheatre in Colorado. Donors at those events offer a saliva DNA swab, which allows the health authorities to identify life-saving matches. James Chippendale's own life was saved by that method.</p>
	<p pid="b.231.1/4">In one year, the Love Hope Strength Foundation has brought awareness of the need for donors to more than 1 million people, and registered 4,500 bone marrow donors. To put that in perspective, the total number of donors registered in Northern Ireland is 9,000, so in one year the two individuals behind the foundation registered the equivalent of almost half that country's donors-a fantastic result.</p>
	<p pid="b.231.1/5">That success was possible because the American and German systems allow the identification of donors from DNA mouth swabs. In the UK, NHS bone marrow identification is done through the blood donor pool. A DNA swab is far less invasive than extracting a hypodermic needle full of blood from a donor's arm. Mike Peters is prepared to do similar work in the UK if he is allowed to. He is prepared to use the contacts he has made over 32 years in the music business to raise this important issue.</p>
	<p pid="b.231.1/6">Mike rang me excitedly at the weekend to say that he had just learned that the Anthony Nolan Trust was doing a pilot project on DNA mouth swabs. I had to tell him that I already knew because I was at the trust's event in the House of Commons last week. I was presented with one of the mouth swab packs and I want to present the Minister with one after the debate, because they are a big step forward in increasing the number of people on the bone marrow register.</p>
	<p pid="b.231.1/7">I want to raise a number of issues with the Minister, which I shall do by reviewing the parliamentary questions that I have placed before her over the past two or three weeks. Each of those questions raises additional questions, so I want to give a flavour of the remaining unanswered questions.</p>
	<p pid="b.231.1/8">In answer to one of my questions, the Minister stated that</p>
	<p pid="b.231.1/9" class="indent">&quot;the British Bone Marrow Register strategy for maintaining the registry at 300,000 donors is readily attainable without any change to current donor selection guidelines.&quot;-[<phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2009-12-01.650"><i>Official Report</i>, 1 December 2009; Vol. 501, c. 650W</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="b.231.1/10">Why is the NHS bone marrow register kept at 300,000 if two patients a day are unsuccessful in finding a suitable bone marrow match?</p>
	<p pid="b.231.1/11">In answer to parliamentary question 304105, in which I asked what proportion of UK patients received their stem cell or bone marrow donation from UK or foreign donors, I was told that the information was not collected. How do we know whether we have sufficient UK stem cell and bone marrow donors if the Department does not collect figures on the provenance of the donor tissue? The country of origin of stem cell and bone marrow donations is also not collected. Are some countries being relied on more heavily than others to provide donor material? Is Britain a net exporter or a net importer of such material?</p>
	<p pid="b.231.1/12">When the Department collects figures, disparities appear. I tabled parliamentary question 300913 to ask for a breakdown of the numbers and percentages of bone marrow donors for the regions of England and for Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. The English regions-the northern region includes my area of north Wales-seem to recruit 30 per cent. of the existing pool of blood donors on the bone marrow register. In Northern Ireland, the figure is only 3 per cent., and in Scotland, it is only 4.5 per cent. The figures for Wales are not held. The answers to my parliamentary questions confirm that no meeting has taken place between the Secretary of State and the devolved Administrations to discuss correcting that imbalance. Why is there a disparity between the number of donors in Northern Ireland and Scotland and in the English and north Wales regions? Why are the Welsh figures not collected? I know that the hon. Lady is an English Minister, but there is interdependence between the UK's four constituent parts. Why has no meeting taken place between all the health administrations to address the issue?</p>
	<p pid="b.231.1/13">I tabled parliamentary questions 304184 and 304100 on the collection of umbilical cord blood. I asked for the total amounts of umbilical cord blood that were processed and stored in the NHS cord bank in each of the past 10 years and for the number of units that were actually used to save patients' lives. In 1997, there were 862 units; in 2009, there are 1,712. In 1999, three units were used in operations to save people's lives; in 2009, 43 units were used. Why has the annual number of donors only doubled in 10 years? The Anthony Nolan Trust says that 50,000 umbilical cord units are needed? Why have we not reached that target after 12 years?</p>
	<p pid="b.231.1/14">In parliamentary question 304106, I asked for the number of cord blood units that the NHS cord bank has issued for transplant into patients since 1998. The number rose from a low of three per annum in 1998 to 44 in 2007, and the figure has now stabilised at around that level-I think it was 47 and 43 in the past two years. Why are the numbers so low when the need is so high? What is happening to the unused cord blood from newborn babies? Is it simply being thrown away while lives are lost for want of a proper match?</p>
	<p pid="b.231.1/15">In parliamentary questions 304099 and 304103, I asked for the budgets for the marketing activities intended to attract blood donors, because bone marrow donors are taken from the blood donor pool. I am pleased that the amount has gone up from &#163;10.5 million to &#163;14.5 million over the past eight years-an increase of nearly 50 per cent. However, the number of donors has decreased from 1.8 million, or 3.7 per cent. of the population, to 1.4 million, or 2.7 per cent. of the population, over the past eight years. Will the Minister check the effectiveness of the campaigns? Will she consider separating the advertising campaigns for blood and bone marrow? Will she also consider greater joint working with charities, with volunteer bodies such as the Anthony Nolan Trust and Adrian Sudbury's Register and Be a Lifesaver project and with civic-minded individuals such as Mike Peters. There is a pool of talent that is not being fully utilised.</p>
	<p pid="b.231.1/16">Last week I attended a parliamentary function held in the Terrace marquee by the Anthony Nolan Trust, to highlight its work. I thank the trust for its pioneering work in the past 35 years. It is the largest and probably best regarded bone marrow register in the world, and it was the first in the world. It is successful because it focuses on one issue and one goal. It has limited itself to the goal of providing bone marrow donors for transplants in the UK and abroad. The trust informed me that two UK patients every day are denied the chance of a life-saving transplant because of the lack of suitable adult matches or cord bank blood.</p>
	<p pid="b.231.1/17">The Anthony Nolan Trust has not rested on its laurels. It currently has more than 400,000 people on its register-compared with 300,000 on the national health service register. The trust has taken 35 years to reach that figure and its vision is to recruit 1 million registered donors by 2014. To achieve that, it will need the help of the Minister and the Department.</p>
	<p pid="b.231.1/18">The register is not just about numbers. It is also vital to have a greater number of young male donors and black and ethnic minority people, to increase the life chances of such people should they be threatened by leukaemia. One of the key issues that Mike Peters has raised, which I have raised in questions, is the need for saliva tests to identify donors. That need is being addressed by the Anthony Nolan Trust, which has piloted saliva testing. I hope that the Minister will convince her Department that what is good enough for the Anthony Nolan Trust register is good enough for the national health service. I hope that my friend Mike Peters will become involved in that charity's bone marrow register events across the UK.</p>
	<p pid="b.231.1/19">The Anthony Nolan Trust already works closely with the Department and with the devolved Health Departments in the United Kingdom. In Scotland it works with the Scottish National Blood Transfusion Service to encourage blood donors to join the Anthony Nolan register. As I mentioned, the registration rate in Scotland is only 4.5 per cent., as opposed to 33 per cent. in England, so there is much work to be done. The trust is also trying to persuade the Scottish service to allow direct recruitment of people on to the bone marrow register without their previously going on the blood register. The Anthony Nolan Trust seeks even closer co-operation with the English NHS. It has the aspiration of a single, highly effective register, managed by the trust. I urge the Minister to consider the proposal carefully.</p>
	<p pid="b.231.1/20">To supplement the adult register, the Anthony Nolan Trust has established a purpose-built cord blood bank, which was opened by the previous Secretary of State in September 2008. In the past four years, the trust has imported 268 cord blood units for UK patients-more than have been provided by the NHS cord blood bank in 13 years. That gives a measure of its effectiveness. Last year alone it imported 90 cords for UK patients. That is costly, and would be unnecessary if an effective UK programme existed. The UK is currently underperforming in the harvesting of cord blood, as my parliamentary questions illustrated. The current world leaders are Spain and Canada. The UK collects only a tiny amount-I think it is something like 0.13 per cent. The rest of that elixir is simply thrown away, although most mothers, if asked, would willingly let that blood-their baby's blood-be used to save life. The Anthony Nolan Trust has a plan to collect 15,000 clinical samples by 2012 from a network of 10 collection centres across the UK. That will cost &#163;15.2 million, and I believe that the Department approached the trust and asked it formally to apply for the funding. The submission was made in June 2009, but since that date there has been little progress. I do not think that the trust has heard from the Department. That excellent project makes sense in many ways: it meets the desires of mothers make positive use of the umbilical cord; it gives a community focus; it saves the lives of thousands of patients; and it will create a world-leading resource in the UK and build a resource for the future. In addition to its life-giving properties for leukaemia sufferers, a cord bank could offer help to those suffering from diabetes, Parkinson's disease, heart disease and many other conditions.</p>
	<p pid="b.231.1/21">As well as its work on increasing the number of bone marrow and cord blood donors, the Anthony Nolan Trust does excellent work to educate young people about how easy it is to donate bone marrow, blood and organs. It has fully supported the Adrian Sudbury Campaign to raise awareness among 17 and 18-year-olds. The awareness raising campaign, which was supported by the Department of Health, was a huge success and will be extended to cover England and Wales.</p>
	<p pid="b.231.1/22">At a cancer campaigning day two weeks ago held at Church House, my friend and constituent Mike Peters asked whether the Secretary of State would meet him and me to discuss bone marrow issues. The Secretary of State agreed. Will the Minister please set up a meeting with the Secretary of State, herself, Mike Peters and the Anthony Nolan Trust to take forward the issues I have raised in debate: increasing the size of the adult bone marrow register and the possibility of the merger of the English or UK registers; taking forward the Anthony Nolan Trust proposal to establish a &#163;15.2 million centre in the UK for a cord blood donation programme; and greater use of education and awareness schemes like those operated by the Adrian Sudbury initiative and the programmes that Mike Peters has implemented with young people at American rock festivals?</p>
	<p pid="b.231.1/23">We have a golden opportunity to make the UK the world centre for bone marrow and stem cell registers. We have the disparate parts; there are fantastic voluntary organisations and individuals, sometimes working in ignorance of each other. I look to the Minister to establish funding and co-ordination to achieve those noble goals.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-12-15b.235.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1686" speakername="Gillian Merron" speakeroffice="The Minister of State, Department of Health"  colnum="235"  time="013:17:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm091215/halltext/91215h0010.htm#09121532000536">
	<p pid="b.235.0/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1894" name="Chris Ruane">the Member for Vale of Clwyd (Chris Ruane)</phrase> on securing this important debate, and on his campaigning on a crucial issue. I have listened closely and I am happy to respond to points that he raised, but I would like first to give some helpful context. I shall of course write to my hon. Friend on any matters that I do not get a chance to discuss. As always, I should be happy to arrange a meeting with him.</p>
	<p pid="b.235.0/2">The context is the debate about stem cells, of which bone marrow is one source. Donation of bone marrow and other stem cell sources in the UK is managed by NHS Blood and Transplant. The NHS works closely with important partners such as the Anthony Nolan Trust. There are three bone marrow registries in the UK, which are monitored by clinical experts at NHSBT. Combined, they are the third largest registry in the world, and consist of the British Bone Marrow Registry, which is operated by the National Blood Service and includes services for Scotland and Northern Ireland; the Welsh Bone Marrow Donor Registry; and the Anthony Nolan Trust bone marrow registry, which holds the records of 400,000 donors.</p>
	<p pid="b.235.0/3">Blood donation is of course an integral part of the work to identify bone marrow donors. The UK has an international reputation for work in that area. It is worth saying, in response to some of the points that my hon. Friend raised, that the registers form part of a network, via the organisation Bone Marrow Donors Worldwide. It provides search access to more than 13 million donors and cord blood units worldwide. The registers in the UK do not stand alone, but are part of a wider picture. The Government have a very proud record of working closely with charities, volunteer bodies and individuals, including on targeted campaigning and collection programmes. In October, we helped to fund an international event on the benefits of cord blood for transplant patients. On the same day the event took place, I opened the NHS cord blood bank's newest collection site at St. George's hospital, in Tooting. For me, the opening was testimony to the value of the Government's investment in research into life-threatening conditions.</p>
	<p pid="b.235.0/4">As with all NHSBT's cord blood collection sites, St. George's was chosen because it serves families of a diverse multicultural mix. I was struck by how such a simple procedure could provide such a valuable resource. As my hon. Friend acknowledged, it adds an essential contribution to the work of supplying the NHS with stem cells for transplant. It saves lives, and it makes an important difference to families affected by blood disorders such as leukaemia. That is why, like my hon. Friend, I am determined to facilitate and promote discussion and debate on the way forward for the harvesting and use of stem cells for transplant.</p>
	<p pid="b.235.0/5">I pay tribute to everyone who works to improve awareness and education, including those named by my hon. Friend. I also pay tribute to organisations such as the Anthony Nolan Trust and NHSBT. I look forward to seeing the greater results of closer working together in the future.</p>
	<p pid="b.235.0/6">Donors for the British and Welsh registries are identified through the national blood donor programme, operated by NHSBT. The Anthony Nolan Trust also campaigns to promote donor registration. Indeed, I registered as a donor more than 20 years ago. All campaigns share the goal of raising awareness of the importance of donation and what it can mean for the lives of others.</p>
	<p pid="b.235.0/7">I agree with my hon. Friend that it is vital that the message is heard by the young. They are indeed the donors of tomorrow. To help with that, the NHS has developed initiatives such as the &quot;Give and Let Live&quot; education campaign, designed to raise awareness among 14 to 16-year-olds. The campaign has been made available to 6,000 schools in the UK. &quot;Register and be a Lifesaver&quot;, an initiative backed by the Anthony Nolan Trust, is campaigning for better education among young people. The Department of Health helped to fund a pilot programme, which was run by NHSBT.</p>
	<p pid="b.235.0/8">Those campaigns came about following the death from leukaemia of Jeanette Crizzle and Adrian Sudbury. Both cases were tragic examples of how difficult it can be to provide treatment to all who need it. In Adrian's case, it was the rareness of the condition that proved an insurmountable hurdle. For Jeanette, the challenge was the richness of her genetic heritage.</p>
	<p pid="b.235.0/9">That brings me to the question of matched donors and ethnic minorities. When treating acute blood disorders, it is important that the stem cell units come from a matched donor, usually a brother or sister. Unfortunately, only 25 to 35 per cent. of patients have a matched sibling. That means having to rely on unrelated donors. Finding a donor who is genetically matched, healthy and willing to donate is a mixture of hard work, professional dedication and chance. It is a mammoth task.</p>
	<p pid="b.235.0/10">The task becomes even harder when the patient's genetic background is complex. Currently, most of the 13 million donors worldwide come from a Caucasian background. Patients from that group have a 90 per cent. chance of finding a matched unrelated donor. However, for patients from ethnic minorities or with a mixed genetic inheritance, the chance of finding a match is only 30 to 40 per cent. That is why I was so proud to open the new centre in Tooting, as it is making a direct contribution to dealing with the problem.</p>
	<p pid="b.235.0/11">On the question of other sources of stem cells such as cord blood, the Government have taken and are continuing to take strategic and targeted action to tackle the challenge. As I said earlier, it is important to remember that bone marrow is not the only source of stem cells for transplant. Umbilical cord blood is an excellent source of stem cells, and has some clinical advantages over bone marrow.</p>
	<p pid="b.235.0/12">The NHS cord blood bank is the fourth biggest in the world, with about 14,000 stored umbilical cord blood units. The Government are investing nearly &#163;10 million in order to increase the size of the bank to 20,000 stored units by 2013. The cord blood bank aims to redress the imbalance on bone marrow registries by focusing collection at hospitals with catchment areas that are more ethnically diverse.</p>
	<p pid="b.235.0/13">My hon. Friend asked about cord blood being discarded. I shall put that into context. In the UK, about 50 per cent. of the samples collected are discarded, but that is due to such things as contamination, infection or low cell counts. It compares favourably with the discarding rate in Spain, for instance, which is about 70 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="b.235.0/14">The NHS cord blood bank has one of the best records of harvesting and banking cord blood in the world, and its inventory of unique tissue types is second to none. So far, about 280 units of cord blood have been issued, mostly for export. The number increases year on year, because medical advances mean that cord blood can be used to treat a wider range of patients. Just as cord blood collected in the UK can be used to find matches for patients overseas, so we are able to draw on international cord blood banks to find matches for patients here.</p>
	<p pid="b.235.0/15">I know that my hon. Friend understands the need to look to the future-a time when cord blood may become even more important. A review commissioned by the Department of Health last year recommended further consideration of the collection and use of cord blood, and a joined-up approach to service provision. I assure my hon. Friend that since then discussions have been held with a range of partners on the collection, storage, commissioning and use of stem cells for transplant.</p>
	<p pid="b.235.0/16">I know that my hon. Friend is interested in the question of swabs versus blood tests. I look forward to receiving the pack that he has promised me. I welcome the pilot that the Anthony Nolan Trust is running. I confirm that the NHS identifies donors through the blood donor programme. Using buccal or saliva swabs would, in the view of clinicians, add another unnecessary layer of testing, without an overall cost or clinical benefit. Blood samples are more efficient and give us more genetic material to work with.</p>
	<p pid="b.235.0/17">The cost of the tissue typing is the same whether the DNA used is extracted from swabs or from blood. Although the quantity of DNA isolated from swabs is sufficient for the initial tissue testing, it does not give enough DNA to perform additional tests, such as confirmatory or high-resolution typing, which are normally requested by the transplant centres and are required prior to transplant. Additionally, transplant centres sometimes request DNA samples for repeated confirmatory tests. I remain interested in the Anthony Nolan Trust pilot.</p>
	<p pid="b.235.0/18">My hon. Friend suggested that the UK was underperforming in some way. That is not a description that I recognise. We are the fourth largest in the world for cord banks; we have the second highest number of human leukocyte antigen unique samples stored; we have the second biggest registered cord blood bank after New York; and we have an excellent reputation in science. However, we can always do more, and we will continue to do so.</p>
	<p pid="b.235.0/19">My hon. Friend also mentioned age limits. I confirm that the NHS recruits donors between the ages of 18 and 49. Donors remain on the registry until the age of 60. The other registries in the UK have lower age limits. Given the number of questions raised as a result of today's debate, I have asked officials to open discussions about bringing age limits in the UK into line with those of the NHS. The decision, of course, will be a matter for the registries themselves.</p>
	<p pid="b.235.0/20">I thank my hon. Friend for his contribution and for his immense interest in what I believe is an important matter. I join him in wanting to ensure that the UK remains at the forefront of this work, and that we are able to meet our obligations in matching stem cell donations to patients in need of a transplant.</p>

	Fire Safety (Rented Accommodation)
</minor-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-12-15b.239.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1879" speakername="Adrian Sanders" colnum="239"  time="013:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm091215/halltext/91215h0010.htm#09121532000537">
	<p pid="b.239.1/1">I wish to declare an interest, as the part-owner of two properties that are currently rented out.</p>
	<p pid="b.239.1/2">Let me start by praising the measures that have improved fire safety in residential properties over the past 20 years. More than 80 per cent. of homes now have smoke alarms compared with 9 per cent. in 1987, and fire deaths halved from 1988 to 2008. Many fire authorities have carried out sterling work in increasing public awareness of not only the need to have working smoke alarms but a range of other fire safety measures.</p>
	<p pid="b.239.1/3">I pay tribute to the Devon and Somerset fire and rescue service, which has worked hard on a range of prevention measures. Following a serious fire in my constituency, the authority installed more than 1,200 new smoke alarms in just two months. Building regulations currently dictate that new-build extensions and alterations should be equipped with hard-wired smoke and fire alarms. Furniture regulations also play their part in reducing the number of avoidable domestic fires, or lessening their impact, and Government have wisely invested in an effective publicity scheme. All those measures have had the impact of reducing fire deaths and increasing the number of working smoke alarms across the country.</p>
	<p pid="b.239.1/4">Figures clearly show that as awareness about fire safety increases, deaths and injuries decrease, yet casualties and preventable fires continue. We have seen a number of tragic fire deaths in recent months, quite often involving rented properties. The figures speak for themselves. In 2007, there were 331 deaths from fire. Of those, 222-or two thirds-occurred in places in which there was no working smoke alarm. In 137 cases, there was no detection system at all. Is it not possible to argue that a working smoke alarm could have saved one of those 222 lives or helped to prevent one of the 9,066 non-fatal casualties from that year?</p>
	<p pid="b.239.1/5">There are gaps in the regulations governing fire prevention. Outside houses in multiple occupation, it is only guidance or good practice that governs the provision of smoke and fire detection. The majority of landlords in the private and social sectors ensure that smoke alarms are available, which not only provides safety and reassurance for tenants, but is in the interests of landlords. However, a minority of rented homes do not have smoke alarms and they may well house some of the most vulnerable members of society. There is something of a correlation between the propensity to fire and the lack of fire safety devices. The Association of British Insurers highlighted that in 2001, 81 per cent. of homes had smoke alarms, but fewer than 60 per cent. of homes suffering fires had alarms.</p>
	<p pid="b.239.1/6">Promoting voluntary good practice among landlords has been very positive. The number of landlords becoming accredited is increasing and that reassures tenants not only that their property is relatively safer, but that their landlord appreciates their duty of care to them. Sadly, the majority of private-sector landlords do not join landlord associations in which best practice can be shared and standards raised. The good landlords pay a heavy price in reputation for the actions of the bad.</p>
	<p pid="b.239.1/7">Social housing providers also need to ensure that they are working to best practice. When a recent house fire in my constituency highlighted the issue of fire safety, it was found that around a quarter of the properties of Riviera housing trust had no smoke alarm. Much to its credit, the association has now pledged to ensure that all properties have working smoke alarms by March 2010. Nevertheless, Government guidelines are clearly lacking if a housing association can provide a service to vulnerable people without needing to ensure safety from fire.</p>
	<p pid="b.239.1/8">The key word here is &quot;guidelines&quot;. The Housing Health and Safety Rating System highlights 29 factors that may be taken into consideration by local authorities when assessing risks to all residential properties. If fire is seen as a category 1 hazard, enforcement action can be taken. Other guidance documents over recent years have stressed the importance of smoke alarms, but local authorities are free to do as little as they wish.</p>
	<p pid="b.239.1/9">A number of cases have highlighted the need for better regulation. At a recent inquest into a fatal fire in Yarcombe near Honiton in Devon, the coroner resolved to contact Ministers from the Department for Communities and Local Government to urge them to review whether smoke detection could be mandatory in rented domestic dwellings.</p>
	<p pid="b.239.1/10">Earlier this year there were fire deaths in two incidents in Northumberland; at Ashington and Bedlington.</p>

	<p pid="b.240.0/1">Will the hon. Gentleman join me in congratulating 16-year-old Shannon Yates from Rhyl who, on Sunday night, risked life and limb to break into a neighbour's property to rescue a man who had succumbed to smoke? Does he also agree that the types of residence that are most vulnerable to fire are houses of multiple occupation, and still more needs to be done to ensure that landlords install smoke alarms?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-12-15b.240.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1879" speakername="Adrian Sanders" colnum="240"  time="013:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm091215/halltext/91215h0010.htm#09121532000540">
	<p pid="b.240.2/1">I am more than happy to congratulate the young lady on her spirited civil action. The hon. Gentleman is right when he says that houses of multiple occupation have been identified as most at risk, which is why they already come under statutory legislation. My point today is that we need to extend that legislation to all housing.</p>
	<p pid="b.240.2/2">In September, an elderly woman died in a fire in Porlock, Somerset. Again the fire authority found no smoke alarms. Indeed, fire officers have told me that they have never attended a fatal fire where working smoke alarms have been present. The number of cases reported in the local press of smoke alarms saving families from death and/or injury is significant. There should be a straightforward solution to the problem.</p>
	<p pid="b.240.2/3">In 2004, the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister Select Committee, of which I was then a member, produced its report on the fire service with the following recommendation:</p>
	<p pid="b.240.2/4" class="indent">&quot;We believe that functioning smoke alarms save lives and reduce injuries. The Committee congratulates those Fire Services which operate initiatives to fit free smoke alarms for the vulnerable. We welcome the requirement for alarms to be hard-wired in alterations, extensions and new buildings. We recommend this requirement be extended to include all existing tenanted properties, housing of multiple occupation and housing for vulnerable members of society. If the design of such buildings makes installation of hard-wired alarms impossible, we recommend use of alarms fitted with 10 year batteries.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.240.2/5">As those recommendations were not adopted, I feel that it is time to review the matter. Moreover, I should like to stress one further point in the recommendation and that is the hard-wired nature of smoke alarms. Many landlords in both private and social sectors rely on battery-powered alarms to serve as safety devices. Although they are good and far better than having no detection devices at all, they throw up some problems. They are not always as accurate as mains connected systems, and over-sensitive alarms can easily be turned off by disgruntled tenants having to hear an alarm every time they toast a piece of bread. Furthermore, such alarms require regular testing, and with vulnerable tenants that is not always something that can be devolved to personal responsibility.</p>
	<p pid="b.240.2/6">A more serious issue is that of failure to trigger. Figures show that since 1997 the failure rate of mains-linked smoke alarms has been between 9 and 13 per cent. That compares rather starkly to the failure rates of 37 to 44 per cent. for battery-operated smoke alarms. The majority of the latter cases are due to flat or absent batteries. That is not to say that smoke alarms are the only solution; we need to explore issues such as more regular inspections of electrical systems in rented properties and more awareness of how to prevent fires starting in the first place. However, where saving lives and preventing injury from fire is the issue, it seems indisputable that smoke alarms have a significant beneficial effect. Making smoke detectors compulsory in all rented properties has broad support. I have already mentioned the ODPM Select Committee report. Early-day motion 263, which endorses mandatory detectors, has cross-party support.</p>
	<p pid="b.240.2/7">I must also register my thanks to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1575" name="Chris Grayling">the hon. Member for Epsom and Ewell (Chris Grayling)</phrase> for pledging his support to the cause in my local newspaper. Sir Jeremy Beecham, the then chair of the Local Government Association, also spoke in favour of compulsory smoke detectors in 2003. Landlords have a duty of care to ensure that gas systems are kept in good order-they even need an energy performance certificate-so why do we not ensure that all landlords provide adequate protection from fire? For the majority of landlords, such a requirement would not make any difference as they already fulfil all the guidelines. However, for tens of thousands of existing tenants and future tenants, it could provide considerable reassurance and, more importantly, save dozens of lives every year.</p>
	<p pid="b.240.2/8">It is good progress that new dwellings are guaranteed a good standard of fire detection and warning, but it is fundamentally important that that protection is extended to those people who live in older properties and that guidelines should be turned into a necessity.</p>
	<p pid="b.240.2/9">Research carried out earlier this year for the Australian Fire and Emergency Authorities Council showed that just less than a third of countries across the developed and developing worlds have legislation in place to make smoke alarms mandatory. So it is not an unusual or draconian law to consider introducing. As the deputy chief fire officer of the Devon and Somerset fire and rescue service has said on this issue:</p>
	<p pid="b.240.2/10" class="indent">&quot;Some of our most vulnerable people are affected by this gap in the law.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.240.2/11">We know that fire death rates are higher for the over-80s than for any other group.</p>
	<p pid="b.240.2/12">Legislation must be part of a solution to the problem of fire casualties. The financial incentive of cheaper insurance for more responsible behaviour, coupled with good education, can only go so far. Therefore I urge the Minister to find a swift solution to this problem. The figures that I have set out today show that the absence of a smoke alarm is at least a factor in more than 200 deaths and in thousands of injuries every year. We have legislated to make landlords ensure that gas appliances and flues are safe, so why can we not legislate to ensure that tenants have a good chance to survive any fire in their property?</p>
	<p pid="b.240.2/13">There are a few realistic measures that we can consider taking. For example, will the Minister consider amending section 2 of the Housing Act 2004 to make the absence of appropriate fire detectors and alarms as well as the presence of defective fire detectors and alarms separate category 1 prescribed fire hazards? Will he look at other delegated legislation to ensure that the responsible person-in other words, the landlord-equips dwellings with appropriate fire detectors and alarms? Will he look at including questions in the home information pack's property information questionnaire that relate to the presence and standard of fire detectors and alarms?</p>
	<p pid="b.240.2/14">Fire authorities across the country have done their part by raising awareness, giving advice and fitting alarms. Now it is the Government's turn to act and I urge the Minister to do what he can to help prevent future tragedies.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-12-15b.242.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1542" speakername="Shahid Malik" speakeroffice="The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government"  colnum="242"  time="013:42:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm091215/halltext/91215h0011.htm#09121532000541">
	<p pid="b.242.0/1">Mr. Hood, I want to commence by saying what a pleasure it is to engage in this debate under your stewardship.</p>
	<p pid="b.242.0/2">I also want to congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1879" name="Adrian Sanders">the hon. Member for Torbay (Mr. Sanders)</phrase> on securing this debate. He has an obvious passion and commitment for this cause and for his constituency. That passion does not surprise me, because some 15 years ago he had equal passion on issues relating to the third sector and helping the poorest in society. I had the privilege of working with him then.</p>
	<p pid="b.242.0/3">In England, we have a strong record on fire prevention, a record that we can be justifiably proud of. Any deaths or injuries in house fires are regrettable, but the latest statistics show that fire deaths in the home in England are at their lowest since 1980 and, as the hon. Gentleman pointed out, 40 per cent. lower than in 1997.</p>
	<p pid="b.242.0/4">Our key strategy to drive down preventable fire deaths across all housing sectors has been proactive community fire safety activities-education, information and publicity-as has been highlighted. Most fires in the home are preventable. Community fire safety is about providing basic fire safety information to householders, to help them to alter their behaviour and think more about how fire safety could affect them and their families. In particular, it is about reminding people of the importance of having working smoke alarms installed in their homes and testing them regularly.</p>
	<p pid="b.242.0/5">The installation of properly maintained smoke alarms in every household has been the centrepiece of our efforts to reduce fire deaths in the home, as they provide the vital early warning of fire and consequently help people to escape. The Government have conducted high-profile national television campaigns that promote the use and maintenance of smoke alarms, which have proved very successful. We have recently launched a new national advertising campaign, &quot;Don't Drown in Toxic Smoke&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.242.0/6">We have targeted advice and guidance at more than 1 million social homes, by advertising in social housing newsletters through a partnership with the &quot;Wise up to Fire&quot; campaign. That work, conducted in collaboration with editors of tenants' newsletters, involved a fire safety advertorial that provided top fire safety tips, including highlighting the importance of having a working smoke alarm installed, and guidance on the responsibilities of social housing landlords.</p>
	<p pid="b.242.0/7">Since 2004, the Government have invested &#163;25 million in grants to fire and rescue authorities to enable them to purchase smoke alarms to install in domestic dwellings. I want to join the hon. Gentleman in paying tribute to his local fire and rescue service-the Devon and Somerset fire and rescue service-for the work that it has done, which he described in his speech.</p>
	<p pid="b.242.0/8">That initiative resulted in nearly 2 million home fire risk checks being carried out in England, with more than 2.4 million smoke alarms being installed, saving an estimated 53 lives per year. I know that the hon. Gentleman recognises the importance of that initiative and indeed applauds the initiative.</p>
	<p pid="b.242.0/9">The increase in ownership of smoke alarms as a result of such campaigns and other actions is a major success story. As I think the hon. Gentleman himself mentioned, in 1987 only 9 per cent. of dwellings were fitted with smoke alarms. By 2007, that had risen to 85 per cent., an almost tenfold increase. Indeed, the English house condition survey suggested that in the social rented sector more than 88 per cent. of homes had smoke alarms by 2007. The social sector also leads the way in fitting hard-wired and mains-powered smoke alarms, with nearly 40 per cent. of dwellings in that sector having such alarms compared with less than 16 per cent. of dwellings in the private sector. The hon. Gentleman powerfully articulated the increased efficiency and effectiveness of mains-powered smoke alarms.</p>
	<p pid="b.242.0/10">There is absolutely no room whatsoever for complacency about health and safety matters in our homes, which obviously includes fire safety matters. In the first instance, each of us must take responsibility for the safety of our own households. So, fire safety in individual domestic properties is generally a matter for the occupier of the premises.</p>
	<p pid="b.242.0/11">Any new measures that we introduce through regulations must, of course, be proportionate and justified in terms of the lives that they save and the injuries that they prevent. For instance, it has been a requirement in building regulations since 1992 that new dwellings should be fitted with mains-powered smoke alarms. That requirement applies to the erection of new buildings, extensions and to certain alterations and changes of use.</p>
	<p pid="b.242.0/12">Legislation also exists to govern fire safety in certain types of existing residential accommodation. As the hon. Gentleman indicated in response to an intervention, blocks of flats and houses in multiple occupation are covered by that legislation. The Housing Act 2004 introduced the housing health and safety rating system, which is the principal tool for assessing fire safety risk and for regulating standards in all types and tenures of residential accommodation, in both individual dwellings and housing blocks.</p>
	<p pid="b.242.0/13">Creating legislation to insist that all local authority and social housing landlords install smoke alarms is by no means straightforward. I do not think for a second that the hon. Gentleman was suggesting that creating such legislation would be straightforward; I think that his argument was that it is necessary. There are complex issues involving maintenance and liability. Also, of course, many residential buildings contain premises for other uses, such as commercial and retail, which complicates the picture further.</p>
	<p pid="b.242.0/14">The HHSRS reflects our preference for proportionate and risk-based regulation supported by the encouragement of best practice rather than blanket requirements across the piece. That is also reflected in the advice issued in 2001 to which the hon. Gentleman referred, which emphasised the value of installing smoke alarms in social housing and clarified the legal implications for local authorities.</p>
	<p pid="b.242.0/15">All good landlords will wish to ensure the health and safety of their tenants and the safety of their property, which is their asset. In the vast majority of cases, local authorities and housing associations, as responsible landlords, have taken the opportunity to install smoke alarms. Although the decent homes standard does not require that smoke alarms be installed, an assessment of fire risk is necessary to meet the statutory minimum standard for housing under the housing health and safety rating system. A fire assessment under the HHSRS considers the likelihood of a fire starting, the chances of its detection, its speed of spreading and the ease and means of escape.</p>
	<p pid="b.242.0/16">The decent homes programme does not and could not cover all aspects of a building, but we will keep the matter under review as we maintain the standard in future. That does not prevent landlords from installing smoke alarms when undertaking other works, as local authorities and housing associations are encouraged to do, and the evidence suggests that many social landlords are doing so.</p>
	<p pid="b.242.0/17">Of course, attention to fire safety is not confined to individual dwellings. Under the Regulatory Reform (Fire Safety) Order 2005, landlords, as &quot;responsible persons&quot;, have a duty to risk-assess fire safety in the common parts of buildings, take adequate precautions and manage any remaining risk. Although the order applies only to the common parts of premises, in many residential premises the responsible person will in practice need to take account of fire safety measures in place in the individual dwellings. Fire and rescue authorities have a legal duty under the order to enforce its provisions in the common areas of residential accommodation such as blocks of flats and houses in multiple occupation. Local authorities have inspection and enforcement responsibilities under the Housing Act 2004.</p>
	<p pid="b.242.0/18">In recognition of the complexities, we have worked closely with the Local Authorities Co-ordinators of Regulatory Services, the Chartered Institute of Environmental Health and the Chief Fire Officers Association to develop guidance to ensure that the risk of fire in multi-occupied buildings is actively and appropriately managed. That work continues.</p>
	<p pid="b.242.0/19">In our response to the consultation on reform of council housing finance, we proposed, in the context of local authority self-financing after 2011, the inclusion of ongoing maintenance of lifts and common parts in addition to the decent homes standard.</p>

	<p pid="b.245.0/1">I am grateful for the Minister's kind words at the start of his speech. I remember our time working together with much pleasure. Will he consider the fact that we require landlords to conduct a gas check when a tenancy begins? Why the reluctance to add a working fire alarm at the same time? They cannot do anything after that-it is then the tenant's responsibility-but the landlord could have that responsibility at the start of the tenancy.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-12-15b.245.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1542" speakername="Shahid Malik" colnum="245"  time="013:42:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm091215/halltext/91215h0011.htm#09121532000543">
	<p pid="b.245.1/1">That is a valid point worth considering. I will take it away, consider it and write to the hon. Gentleman. From a common-sense perspective, it seems like an appropriate opportunity to carry out a check for fire alarms if one is taking place for other potentially hazardous elements within the household.</p>
	<p pid="b.245.1/2">The framework includes six standards for social housing providers, one of which is the home standard covering quality of accommodation and repairs and maintenance. The Tenant Services Authority's proposed quality standard means the decent homes standard or higher, and it is proposed that providers should give their tenants the opportunity to agree a local standard reflecting their concerns and priorities. If fire safety matters are a concern for tenants, the framework would enable tenants to shape their local standard to reflect that.</p>
	<p pid="b.245.1/3">The hon. Gentleman has pressed for provision of smoke alarms to be made a statutory requirement on all landlords. As I have emphasised, the Government share his concern to ensure full take-up of smoke alarms in every dwelling. That is why we have focused so heavily on it in campaigns aimed at householders, tenants and landlords alike. I have already stated that the number of smoke alarms taken up has increased tenfold. There has been a step change in getting smoke alarms into dwellings; the latest campaign seeks to ensure another step change in terms of people checking them once a week. Our view is that checking is woefully inadequate at the moment, hence the campaign. Hopefully, it will have the same impact as previous campaigns.</p>
	<p pid="b.245.1/4">I assure the House that we will continue to encourage social landlords to provide smoke alarms-particularly hard-wired systems, for the reasons that the hon. Gentleman highlighted-when carrying out other works to their stock. We think that, rather than introducing another regulatory requirement, remains the right way forward, notwithstanding the point that I made earlier. As I indicated, we will keep the matter under review, not least as we maintain the decent homes standard in future.</p>
	<p pid="b.245.1/5">It is still worth noting that householders can take some responsibility for their own safety, including fire safety, and the vast majority do. For as little as &#163;8, anyone can buy and install a smoke alarm for their home to help protect themselves and their family from the dangers of fire. Anyone unable to do so themselves can contact their local fire and rescue service and ask it to undertake a home fire risk check. Depending on the person's circumstances, the fire and rescue service will consider supplying and fitting a smoke alarm free of charge.</p>
	<p pid="b.245.1/6">We remain committed to reducing deaths from fire so that tragedies such as the ones that we heard about today will not be repeated. All the hon. Gentleman's requests and suggestions are undoubtedly sensible and reasonable, but he will understand that introducing new requirements in legislation sometimes has unintended consequences. If we can do things without going down a legislative route, that would be the preferred option. As he highlighted in his intervention, we have opportunities to increase fire safety in the home without being too onerous or complex about it, and I will consider some of them. I thank him again for raising an issue that is incredibly important not just to his constituents but to people throughout the country.</p>
