<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-03-15a.425.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1704" speakername="Graham Stringer" colnum="425"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060315/halltext/60315h01.htm#60315h01_spnew0">
	<p pid="a.425.3/1">Before I get on to bus deregulation, I want to say I am sorry that my hon. Friend the Minister is retiring from the job. I wish her well in what she does in future. In the surprisingly long time&mdash;22 years&mdash;that I have been dealing with Transport Ministers, I have come across some, from both main parties, who were less than competent, and I am pleased to say that my hon. Friend is not like that. She has done a good job. Although I suspect that we shall not see eye to eye in this morning's debate, I am sorry to see her go and wish her well.</p>
	<p pid="a.425.3/2">The purpose of the debate is to explore why, in the part of the public transport system provided by buses, which account for 84 or 85 per cent. of journeys in the system, there is effectively an apartheid regime between London and the rest of the country. I should like to use our time to see whether there is any justification for maintaining one system in London, which works, produces good public transport and benefits passengers, and another system in the rest of the country that has the opposite impact.</p>
	<p pid="a.425.3/3">We have already convinced the vast majority of Members of Parliament outside London that their constituents would benefit from a regulated system. Last autumn, Communicate Research did a survey of all MPs and found that 84 per cent. of Labour MPs and a majority of Members of Parliament were in favour of extending to the rest of the country the regulated system found in London. The only thing to surprise me about that was that only 84 per cent. of Labour MPs responded in that way. I have never found one who did not want regulation in the passenger transport and shire areas of the country.</p>
	<p pid="a.425.3/4">The background is that, in London, bus use is increasing, and in every region in England it is in decline. The most dramatic decline is in south Yorkshire where, since deregulation, bus use has dropped by 62 per cent., which is extraordinary. It is not a matter of an even spread of usage&mdash;the people who use buses are among the poorest in the country. Nine out of 10 people who use buses are in the bottom income bracket, and 60 per cent. of bus users have no access to cars. Therefore, if something goes wrong with the bus system, we are allowing the mechanisms that increase social exclusion to continue to operate.</p>
	<p pid="a.425.3/5">I cannot talk about the regulated system in London as being more effective and producing better public transport without talking about the increasing funding gap. I shall mention it only once. Over the past seven years, in the north-west, although similar statistics will be found in every region, capital expenditure&mdash;not the revenue for buses&mdash;has risen from &pound;157 million to &pound;295 million, whereas in London it has risen from &pound;226 million to &pound;667 million. That is another background unfairness.</p>
	<p pid="a.425.3/6">Before I try to analyse the possible reasons for what has happened, I should like to give some statistics. I suspect that I could spend the whole hour and a half available to us giving out appalling statistics about transport usage, but I want to use the headline figures showing the changes that have happened, and to ask why they have been allowed and how we can stop the process going further.</p>
	<p pid="a.425.3/7">Fares in the English passenger transport executive areas have gone up 86 per cent. since deregulation. In London, they have gone up 36 per cent. Over the past five years, fares in the PTE areas have gone up 9 per cent. In London, they have gone down 4 per cent. Patronage since deregulation across all the PTE areas has gone down by about half. In London, it has gone up by just over half. In the past five years, patronage in the PTE areas has gone down 8 per cent. whereas it has gone up more than a third in London.</p>
	<p pid="a.425.3/8">We need to understand why there has been such a dramatic difference between London and the rest of the country. I do not believe that it is justifiable, but we should consider ministerial responses to the figures and some statements from officials. The Government have three responses to the shocking figures that I have mentioned. One is that we are not going back to pre-1985 days and re-regulation. That is a complete red herring. I have never heard anyone say, in the debate on this matter that has been going on as long as there has been deregulation, that they want buses brought back into public ownership and a return to the exact regulation that existed before 1985. What most of us want is a system similar to London's, or preferably a better one, because when a system is adopted it can be improved.</p>
	<p pid="a.425.3/9">Secondly, the Secretary of State for Transport regularly points out success stories. His favourites seem to be York, Oxford, Brighton and Cambridge. He asks why, if those towns or small cities can improve patronage on their buses, big areas such as Birmingham, Manchester, Liverpool and Newcastle cannot. There is one obvious reason. His examples are much smaller areas, dominated in nearly every case by one operator, with one centre, so that traffic restraint can work&mdash;people do not have much of a choice in those areas.</p>
	<p pid="a.425.3/10">That situation can be compared with what happens in a polycentric urban conurbation such as Manchester. The city of Manchester has the highest percentage bus usage of any of the metropolitan areas, but Bury, which my constituency borders, has one of the lowest in the country. It is necessary to take account of different circumstances when attempting to make like-with-like comparisons. The west midlands and Greater Manchester clearly have much more in common with the London conurbation than with York or Cambridge, which are much smaller.</p>
	<p pid="a.425.3/11">Do the people in those towns like what is happening? I suspect not. A letter to the York <i>Evening Press</i> from Chris Nelson, complaining bitterly about price increases that he had to pay in York, asked</p>
	<p pid="a.425.3/12" class="indent">&quot;are these higher fares just because First is the only bus operator in York, and people such as the elderly, single parents, or others on low incomes have no other choice of transport?</p>
	<p pid="a.425.3/13" class="indent">Park and Ride fares in York are simply extortionate&mdash;no other way of putting it. You have to pay the equivalent of a day ticket just for a return fare.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.425.3/14">He goes on to say that the system in York does not work. It is, therefore, neither wonderful nor comparable, and it is not a good reason for saying that the same could happen in Greater Manchester.</p>
	<p pid="a.425.3/15">The third ministerial reason is that London is different, and it is&mdash;it is about two and a half times larger than Greater Manchester or the west midlands. In terms of buses, however, it was no different before regulation, and the real change is that there is now a regulated system in London and a deregulated system outside. Before deregulation, 48 per cent. of all public transport journeys were in the PTE areas and about 27 per cent. were in London. That situation has reversed, with nearly half of bus journeys in London and only 27 per cent. in the PTE areas. That is a dramatic switch round. Comparable areas, which had similar penetrations of bus usage, are now completely different. One reason for that is the regulated system, and the other is that there is three times more subsidy per passenger in London than in the rest of the country. Those, then, are the ministerial reasons.</p>
	<p pid="a.425.3/16">I advise hon. Members who want to understand some of the thinking of the Department for Transport to get hold of a transcript of the Public Accounts Committee's proceedings on <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-23">23 January</phrase>. At that sitting, the Committee gently kebabed the permanent secretary at the Department. He is a good civil servant, and I make no criticism of him. Indeed, he is a man of integrity and intelligence, but he was trying to defend what is more or less indefensible. He did not quite plead the fifth amendment, but in many cases he pleaded ignorance of what is happening to transport in our major urban conurbations. Let me go through some of the reasons that he gave.</p>
	<p pid="a.425.3/17">First, the permanent secretary said that local authorities in PTE and passenger transport authority areas would begin to have a service similar to that in London if they would only restrain car use, but that is not really the case. Greater Manchester is spending about &pound;50 million on quality bus corridors, and other urban conurbations are doing the same. However, because the system is deregulated, the bus companies are moving on to the radial routes to make bigger profits, and the network is contracting. Although passenger usage on the radial routes might increase, therefore, there will be a worse service for some of the poorest people in the country</p>
	<p pid="a.425.3/18">Incidentally, the Government are tough in assessing the benefits of investment in public transport systems such as Metrolink, but no real assessment is done of the usefulness of investment in quality bus corridors, or of whether such corridors improve public transport&mdash;the idea that they will bring about improvements is an article of faith in the deregulated, privatised system. In the light of the facts, however, that is not a belief that I share. One justification that Mr. Rowlands, the permanent secretary, uses is that quality bus corridors will help to get rid of congestion, and that is what has happened in London. However, the Department's answers to parliamentary questions show that two thirds of bus delays are caused not by congestion, but by the unreliability of private buses&mdash;they simply do not turn up.</p>
	<p pid="a.425.3/19">The permanent secretary also says that, although there might be concentrations of bus usage, there are almost guaranteed to be three bids for subsidised routes. However, that is completely wrong. Many of the subsidised routes that PTEs put out to tender are simply not bid for. In Greater Manchester and the other PTE areas, there is only one bidder for many routes. The cost of such tenders has gone up by about 20 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="a.425.3/20">Arriva, which is no different from the four other major bus companies that dominate the industry, makes no secret of what it is doing. In answer to questions at the Public Accounts Committee, the permanent secretary said that those bus companies were &quot;economically rational&quot; and &quot;passenger maximising&quot;, but they are not. They are certainly profit maximising, but that is not the same thing. If they can concentrate their services along routes from which others have been cleared by means of bus priority measures, they will make their profits there and remove their buses from other areas. Although the permanent secretary seemed to be wilfully ignorant of that, Arriva's half-year report stated:</p>
	<p pid="a.425.3/21" class="indent">&quot;Outside London our approach, to what is currently a mature market, is to focus on a twin-track strategy of targeting investment to deliver growth and eliminating low margin and loss-making routes.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.425.3/22">That means that companies will remove routes on which they make a certain amount of money. The 53 route in Manchester, which was there for 80 years and always had good patronage, has just gone. Instead, companies will run routes up and down the main radial routes, which is bad for public transport.</p>
	<p pid="a.425.3/23">Whichever way we look at the Department's analysis&mdash;that there will be more bids, that there is competition and that quality bus corridors will be the solution&mdash;it does not fit with the facts. Should not the permanent secretary understand that, in a market in which the private sector is exploiting the people I represent, bus companies make 50 per cent. of their profits on only 25 per cent. of their business? That should, at least, be cause for concern. The Department said that it did not understand that and that it was not aware of those figures, and I would be happy to give officials the references for all the sources of information in my speech at the end of the debate if the Department is willing to listen.</p>
	<p pid="a.425.3/24">On the subject of listening, I have tabled parliamentary questions to ask how many times the Department meets individual bus companies and officials and members of PTAs and PTEs. I have been told that meetings happen regularly, but I am rather interested in how often they take place, because there is evidence that Government policy is biased towards the private bus industry and against public officials from PTEs. I therefore ask the Minister whether officials will meet PTE members and whether detailed figures will be given out.</p>
	<p pid="a.425.3/25">We have reached an extraordinary situation. I have been in favour of buses all my political life because the people I have represented as a councillor and a Member of Parliament have needed them. However, the system that now operates in metropolitan areas means that being in favour of buses is not the same as being in favour of public transport&mdash;they can be quite different things. Bus priority measures can be introduced, but the public transport system will get worse. That is quite a shocking state of affairs.</p>
	<p pid="a.425.3/26">At the same time, the private companies are demanding more public money. Some &pound;2 billion is going into the bus industry and the companies' profits are going up, but the service outside London is getting worse. Brian Souter of Stagecoach attacks all the PTEs because passenger numbers are going down, but, at the same time, he has his begging bowl out. Like most private sector bus company operators, he says, &quot;You're not doing anything, so please build us park-and-ride schemes with your own money.&quot; If the private-sector bus industry were really creative and innovative, it would find those resources itself, instead of making returns on capital in the PTE of more than 50 per cent.&mdash;another fact of which Mr. Rowlands was not aware.</p>
	<p pid="a.425.3/27">A number of other hon. Members want to speak, so I will finish by asking how we can justify a situation in which the travelling public in areas such as Greater Manchester and south Yorkshire have to face four fare increases a year. In London, they face one increase a year&mdash;or one fare adjustment, because sometimes the fares in London go down. How can it be good for public transport when in the past four years there have been 9,000 service changes in Greater Manchester? I assume that the figures are similar in other areas. Most people who want to increase bus patronage recognise that reliability and stability in the network are important factors. People need to know where the buses are going, but 9,000 service changes is instability of an extraordinary kind, which leads people to invest in cars and not go on buses.</p>
	<p pid="a.425.3/28">How can we justify not doing anything about a system in which punctuality in virtually all PTE areas is 76 per cent. and reliability is only 92 per cent.? Those shocking figures are mostly down to the companies, not conditions on the road. How can we justify investing &pound;2 billion but not looking at how we target the operators' grant money? We just pay it out, but do not try to use the tiny levers that are left to get a public transport system. The money is paid out without any controls at all. How can we justify having underfunded, under-resourced traffic commissioners, while companies such as FirstGroup have failed and have had to have hearings and investigations into their failures? The system means that traffic commissioners have to take services off, which is not good for the travelling public, even if they were poor services. When services are taken off in the north of England, FirstGroup registers a subsidiary and carries on as before, with its unreliable, unsatisfactory services.</p>
	<p pid="a.425.3/29">I do not see how any of that is justifiable. Our public transport system is going in the wrong direction. Most of the evidence is that our urban areas compete effectively internationally if they have good public transport systems. The situation is a brake on what they are doing, and I am worried that we are going in the wrong direction.</p>
	<p pid="a.425.3/30">Last year, at the request and subsidy of Services Employees International Union, a north American trade union, I went to the States to see how FirstGroup and other bus companies operated, and I was quite shocked. The safety record of the bus companies in this country is not good&mdash;I think that 15 per cent. of buses that are stopped by the commissioners have to be taken off the road immediately for being unsafe&mdash;but what is happening in the United States is worse. I do not want us to go down that route. I have tabled questions and asked for guarantees that, if we go to a yellow bus service, we will not follow the route that FirstGroup has taken in the United States.</p>
	<p pid="a.425.3/31">I know that the Minister has a brief and is in the last days of being a Minister in the Department, but I ask her to accept that the situation is not justified. None of us wants to return to the 1984 system, which was not as responsive as it should have been, but we do want value for the &pound;2 billion that is invested. We want local control, so that we can say to our constituents, &quot;This is a public transport system that will get you to work on time.&quot; Constituents of mine have lost their jobs or not got to hospital for important appointments because FirstGroup did not turn up, at the same time as its profits are increasing. That is simply unacceptable. I hope that the Minister will be as positive as she can be in response to those points.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-03-15a.447.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1956" speakername="Anne Begg" colnum="447"  time="011:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060315/halltext/60315h02.htm#60315h02_spnew0">
	<p pid="a.447.1/1">I am delighted to be here this morning, Mr. Jones. On Second Reading of the Disability Discrimination Bill on <phrase class="date" code="2005-03-23">23 March 2005</phrase>, I said that the Government would at some time in the future have to consider passing legislation making it illegal to discriminate on the grounds of genetics. Although I congratulate them on outlawing most areas of discrimination faced by disabled people, there is still a large hole in the process of ensuring that disabled people have their full civil rights. We must make sure that they do not suffer disproportionately from genetic discrimination in their employment opportunities or in access to services such as insurance.</p>
	<p pid="a.447.1/2">I see the issue as one of equality and civil rights. Unfortunately, not everyone does, and I was reminded of that when preparing for this debate. When we were fighting for full civil rights for disabled people, it was difficult to get a relevant Minister to answer because the issue was invariably seen as one of health. One of the first problems the disabled movement had in fighting for civil rights was to get disability away from the Department of Health so that we could begin to challenge the medical model of disability and make the Government realise that it was our civil rights we were fighting for, not just access to health treatment and social care.</p>
	<p pid="a.447.1/3">When I was granted this debate, I suppose it should not really have come as a surprise that my request was passed to the Department of Health, despite the fact that the Table Office suggested that I should add &quot;in employment&quot; to the title, so that it would be clear that it concerned genetic testing and discrimination in employment, not just genetics, which obviously is a health issue. I had hoped that a Minister from the Department for Work and Pensions would be asked to reply, or the Minister from the Department of Trade and Industry who is responsible for workers' rights. I am glad that, not I, but the system in this place persuaded the relevant Minister to respond today. I suspect that the Under-Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1813" name="Meg Munn">the Member for Sheffield, Heeley (Meg Munn)</phrase> has drawn the short straw, but I am glad to see her. Her responsibilities include equality, and I believe that this is an equality issue.</p>
	<p pid="a.447.1/4">The subject of genetic discrimination first came to my attention when I realised that those with diagnosed genetic conditions were receiving unfair treatment when applying for insurance. The insurance companies assumed that someone who had a genetic condition would automatically have a shorter life and should, therefore, pay higher premiums for any kind of life cover. That was also true for getting travel insurance, and several people contacted me, concerned either that it was impossible to get travel insurance for someone with a disability or that the premiums were so high that travel was almost impossible.</p>
	<p pid="a.447.1/5">The assumptions often made by insurance companies regarding people with genetic conditions are that their lives will be shorter and that the quality of their lives will be less. That may be true of some conditions. For instance, if someone has been tested for Huntington's disease, there will be a direct correlation between their having the defective gene and the development of the disease later in life. However, it is impossible to predict when that might be or the severity with which the disease will initially hit, so there is a question of time scales. The situation with regard to the Huntington's gene is not necessarily the case for all genetic conditions. Indeed, a genetic disposition for a particular condition such as cancer or heart disease does not necessarily mean that an individual will develop the condition. A predisposition is purely that: a predisposition, not necessarily a matter of fact.</p>
	<p pid="a.447.1/6">I know that insurance companies work on risk factors when they are working out the premiums payable, whether for life insurance or travel insurance, so they have to build in those risk factors and have access to all relevant information when making their decisions. I was very pleased when the Association of British Insurers announced in 2001 that it was to adopt a five-year moratorium on the use of genetic test results by insurers. At that time, I was about to apply for an Adjournment debate on the subject, but when the moratorium came along I decided to see how it worked, so I did not. If the moratorium did not work, I always intended to call for legislation to outlaw the practice of genetic discrimination.</p>
	<p pid="a.447.1/7">I was particularly pleased to learn that from yesterday&mdash;I did not know this when I applied for the debate&mdash;a concordat has been agreed between the insurance industry and the Government, providing that insurers' use of genetic information should be transparent, fair and subject to independent oversight, and that the voluntary moratorium on insurers' use of predictive genetic tests should be extended until <phrase class="date" code="2011-11-01">1 November 2011</phrase>. It has also been agreed that the concordat will be reviewed in 2008.</p>
	<p pid="a.447.1/8">I know that not everyone is happy with everything the insurance industry has done because there are exemptions, such as Huntington's disease, but at least the system is much fairer. I certainly do not have any anecdotal evidence that people with genetic conditions feel they have been unfairly treated by the insurance industry. I believe that a model exists in that the insurance industry has shown the way. It is possible to ensure that those with genetic conditions are not treated unfairly and that there are clear guidelines, particularly for the use of predictive genetic tests.</p>
	<p pid="a.447.1/9">The basis of my argument is that I would like a similar understanding to be reached with employers in the United Kingdom so that they do not demand the disclosure of genetic tests by their employees or, indeed, force employees or applicants for jobs to take the tests at all. If it is not possible to reach such an understanding and it becomes clear that genetic discrimination is taking place in the UK, I would look to the Government to legislate to outlaw that practice.</p>
	<p pid="a.447.1/10">At this point, I should explain what is meant by predictive genetic tests and why it is important that people should be able to take such tests without the fear that it may lead to their being discriminated against. There are two main types of genetic tests. The first test a person's genetic make-up in order to identify, for example, where there may be faults in genes, or whether there are genes that would lead to a particular disease. The second type test for genetic damage that occurs during a person's lifetime.</p>
	<p pid="a.447.1/11">I speak as a supporter of genetic testing. I was born with a genetic condition and know the good that such tests can do. They play important roles in diagnosis and in treatment. For some, they may diagnose something for which there are presently no symptoms, but where it is useful to know that the genetic condition exists, as it may help determine lifestyle choices or help in early detection so that remedial treatment can prevent the symptoms from occurring. It is an important health issue.</p>
	<p pid="a.447.1/12">It is for precisely those reasons that I want to ensure that people who may have genetic conditions feel safe in having a test, secure in the knowledge that the information gained will not be used by anyone to discriminate against them in future. Only with such assurances will people feel at ease in taking a test that may be very important to their future health. Evidence from elsewhere in the world, particularly the United States, which seems the worst example of a country in which people are forced to disclose information gained through genetic tests&mdash;suggests that without assurances that the information will not be used against them, people shy away from having the tests done at all. That has important consequences for their future health plans. I ask the Government to ensure that security measures are in place so that people can take genetic tests in the sure knowledge that the tests will be used for good of the individual and not to discriminate against them.</p>
	<p pid="a.447.1/13">In years to come, genetic testing will become more sophisticated, and I want to ensure that such tests are a force for good, that they lead to better diagnoses and treatment and that they are not something to be feared. Of course, someone who has symptoms and a disability as a result of a genetic disease is likely to be covered by existing disability discrimination legislation. Someone who is asymptomatic is not covered, and nor is someone who might be affected by a condition later in life. Nor, indeed, is someone who has undergone a predictive genetic test, because it predicts only a propensity, and not that they will get the disease.</p>
	<p pid="a.447.1/14">Many people fear predictive genetic tests. For someone who has a family history of breast cancer, it may be right to have a predictive test, but if there are no guidelines and no security against the test's being used to discriminate against the individual, they may not undertake it.</p>
	<p pid="a.447.1/15">Predictive genetic tests are still crude, and their development has a long way to go, but even today, they are used to predict someone's propensity for developing a particular condition&mdash;perhaps cancer or heart disease. Although such tests may predict a propensity or susceptibility towards a condition, they predict neither that the person will definitely develop that condition, nor any time scales if they should. Therefore, if predictive genetic tests were used by insurance companies or employers to determine that an individual should be treated less favourably than someone else, that would be discrimination, and such practice should be outlawed. The use of those types of tests is causing most concern among organisations such as the Trades Union Congress and GeneWatch.</p>
	<p pid="a.447.1/16">At a time when the Government are trying to encourage more disabled people into the work force, or to keep those who have developed a disability while in a job, it would be perverse if employers were able to use genetic tests as a recruitment tool to screen out people who were thought to be a greater risk.</p>
	<p pid="a.447.1/17">The Human Genetics Commission has found no evidence that employers in the UK are systematically using genetic test results to recruit people, or using such tests as part of workplace health programmes&mdash;yet. However, the HGC has outlined the following general principles:</p>
	<p pid="a.447.1/18" class="indent">&quot;that everyone is entitled to privacy and should not have to discuss information about personal genetic characteristics; that private genetic information should not be obtained or held without a person's consent; that private personal genetic information should be treated as confidential and not communicated to others without a person's consent; and that no one should be unfairly discriminated against on the basis of his or her genetic characteristics.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.447.1/19">A number of countries, such as Austria, Denmark, France, the Netherlands and Norway, have some form of legislation that prohibits or limits employers' rights to ask for genetic information. Before it becomes a serious problem, it may be time for the UK Government to look to follow suit.</p>
	<p pid="a.447.1/20">It is clear that genetic testing will increase. I want to ensure that those tests are used for good reasons and not to discriminate against an individual. We must ensure that they are used positively, whether it is to help in diagnosis and cure, to help people make more rational life choices, or to help employers ensure that they provide a safe working environment. They should not be used to help employers find an easy way to save money by not employing certain types of people because they may be a higher risk to the employer later in life or incur extra expenses for the employer.</p>
	<p pid="a.447.1/21">It is time for the Government to consider the issue seriously to encourage employers to follow the lead given by the insurance companies and consider a moratorium on the use of the tests. Ultimately, however, there will probably come a time when the Government have to legislate to outlaw genetic discrimination in the UK.</p>

	<p pid="a.460.3/1">I look forward to hearing more detail in the Minister's reply and learning what he thinks the money has bought this country that would not have been provided in the marketplace.</p>
	<p pid="a.460.3/2">I have heard it said from a very senior BT executive that BT would like to &quot;move on&quot; from discussing broadband access in Wales to discussing what is called next generation technology. I am afraid that BT needs to be pulled back to the discussion about broadband access because, as I hope the evidence that I have provided in the last 10 minutes and the speeches that we shall hear in the remainder of this debate will show, the lack of broadband availability in a lot of rural areas is causing severe problems for businesses, households and charities.</p>

	<p pid="a.460.4/1">I would ask colleagues throughout the Chamber to be careful about one thing. Having spent four years as Minister for Rural Affairs, I know that talking down rural affairs does not help, although I do not think that that is the hon. Gentleman's intention. There are problems in some locations in some rural areas. That is not to say that there problems in all rural areas. If the impression is given that there are problems in all rural areas, the danger is that the rural economy will get talked down. Broadband is accessible and is being used effectively by many businesses, in many rural areas throughout the country. The focus of today's debate is the small but important number of gaps in the infrastructure.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-03-15a.466.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1715" speakername="Mark Lancaster" colnum="466"  time="015:20:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060315/halltext/60315h03.htm#60315h03_spnew20">
	<p pid="a.466.0/1">I, too, congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1948" name="Paul Goodman">the Member for Wycombe (Mr. Goodman)</phrase> on securing this valuable debate. I apologise for missing part of his opening speech.</p>
	<p pid="a.466.0/2">I was fascinated by the question asked by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1444" name="Roger Williams">the hon. Member for Brecon and Radnorshire (Mr. Williams)</phrase>, which was, &quot;How do we define broadband?&quot; It is a key question, to which I shall return shortly. I realise that when people think of Milton Keynes they think of a city, but I am sure that many hon. Members realise that it is both a city and a rural community. As Milton Keynes expanded sideways, it isolated a large rural tip of what was Buckinghamshire and is now part of the unitary authority of Milton Keynes.</p>
	<p pid="a.466.0/3">In the short time available, I want to do three things. First, I want to explain the unique problems that Milton Keynes faces in accessing broadband. Secondly, I want to look at the options and why they seem to be failing to deliver the solution. Finally, I want to consider what is required to deliver broadband throughout Milton Keynes.</p>
	<p pid="a.466.0/4">High-speed internet access and digital TV are two vital aspects of the information age and are directly linked. People who have access to such services will be better informed, better entertained and better employed. People who are left behind by the information age will be left behind, to an increasing extent, in modern life. Broadband is not just about game playing and video downloading; it is vital for the economic growth of Milton Keynes.</p>
	<p pid="a.466.0/5">Some residents and businesses in Milton Keynes still cannot get broadband at all. Some can get only an entry-level speed of 512 kilobits per second. It is particularly important for Milton Keynes to have an adequate data communications facility, because of the impact that it has on jobs. Both those who work in offices and professionals who work from home in the city and the rural community depend on data speeds that do not seem quaint and primitive to the rest of the country and the rest of the world.</p>
	<p pid="a.466.0/6">In Milton Keynes, we have a TV cable network that was the envy of the UK when it was built in the '60s and '70s. TV signals received on a big aerial were wired into every new home in the new city and in the rural community, together with some pioneering community TV channels. Although the original local channels were sadly short lived, I am delighted that the situation looks to be resolved when the much-wanted and much-needed MKTV is launched later this year.</p>
	<p pid="a.466.0/7">The original technology was modern for it time, but not future-proofed. The original cabling is old and incapable of providing internet. BT's telephone lines, the most popular way of accessing the internet, are now either too long or too narrow to support the technology. That problem is made worse by their routing around the grid squares in the city.</p>
	<p pid="a.466.0/8">A new digital TV distribution network, providing digital TV to every home that receives TV on a communal analogue cable, would also be able to carry high-speed broadband. A digital network does not care what the content is. One member of the household could be watching a documentary on BBC 9, while another could be surfing the web. Another could be buying a video from a streaming video provider to watch over the weekend, or making a video-conference webcast to another head office in another country. Those are all data that can educate, inform, entertain and help Milton Keynes's residents in both the city and the rural community.</p>
	<p pid="a.466.0/9">When the area was first developed, in recognition of the fact that houses did not need aerials and that aerials are pretty unsightly if they are not necessary, areas of the then rural community were developed with covenants and restrictions so that most homes are not allowed to put an aerial on the roof. The special problem for Milton Keynes is that if home owners are not allowed to put up their own aerials and the TV cabling throughout the city cannot transmit digital TV, local people will have a problem if and when analogue TV stops being transmitted. If the Government are committed to the digital information age being made available to all citizens, not just those with the finances to buy their own solution, that problem could be used to everybody's advantage.</p>
	<p pid="a.466.0/10">That is the problem that we face in Milton Keynes. It is appalling for a dynamic, prosperous, high-tech rural and city community. I want now to turn to some of the proposals and explain why, regrettably, there is concern that they may not provide the solution. To its credit, BT has done a good job of getting entry-level broadband to many parts of the unitary authority that two years ago could not get it, although some areas cannot get any broadband. However, most areas cannot get the speed that most people are clamouring for.</p>
	<p pid="a.466.0/11">BT is focusing on its 21st century network&mdash;21CN&mdash;programme, which replaces the old telephone wire infrastructure with fibre-optic technology. Understandably, BT does not want to invest any more in the old telephone cabling, but 21CN is a long-term programme that will not be rolled out in Milton Keynes until at least 2010. That is where the link to digital TV returns.</p>
	<p pid="a.466.0/12">If a digital community TV service were to be wired to every home in the city, it would resolve the problems that BT is struggling with, replacing the '60s technology with modern technology. That is much the same for the rural community, which will of course soon become city in Milton Keynes. We have the grid-road cabling ducts and, largely, the right technology in the exchanges. The link into each home seems to be solvable. However, what is missing, from BT's point of view, is any public money to rewire the main trunking networks across the unitary authority.</p>
	<p pid="a.466.0/13">Perhaps the residents should look to other providers. One of the frustrations locally is the plethora of advertisements from other companies offering broadband to residents. Seeing a potential solution, residents ring, only to be disappointed. In that process, called local loop unbundling, a third party company takes over a phone line from BT. In practice, they use the same telephone wires that BT used, so we are still stuck with no or slow broadband.</p>
	<p pid="a.466.0/14">Milton Keynes council has no direct responsibility to provide facilities for broadband, but it has been proactive in trying to find a wireless solution. I commend the council for that. However, the problem is that that technology, WiMAX, is still unproven. It is still being evaluated by the internet service providers. Although it is widely believed that wireless technology would be suited to the rural areas of Milton Keynes, it might not prove to be a Milton Keynes-wide solution and might not be appropriate for servicing large numbers of residents in higher-density areas.</p>
	<p pid="a.466.0/15">Before I look to the future, I want to mention Ofcom's involvement. There have been efforts to interest Ofcom in Milton Keynes's problems. However, the telecommunications regulator's remit for internet access is unimpressive. It simply has to ensure that all UK residents can get dial-up access at a speed of 28.8 kilobits per second&mdash;20 times slower than the slowest broadband. It seems incredible in 2006 that BT is not obliged to provide anything faster.</p>
	<p pid="a.466.0/16">I want to consider what might work in future. There is a strong belief that Milton Keynes's problems with broadband and digital TV can be resolved together. We need a credible, proven and sustainable alternative to BT in the form of a decent cable infrastructure. That would introduce real competition for the first time, spurring BT to raise its game. Such an infrastructure would require investment funding. The technology is nothing horrendous, merely an upgraded cable in an underground duct system that allows for technology changes. If it is replaceable, that will ensure that it is future-proof. If we make the ducts big enough, they can contain digital cable this year, optical fibre for the next 10 years and a future cable system beyond that.</p>
	<p pid="a.466.0/17">I have campaigned long and hard for &quot;I before E&quot;, or infrastructure before expansion, for Milton Keynes. Access to high-speed broadband is absolutely essential for a young, prosperous growing community that is the focus of the Government's sustainable communities project. I ask the Government to reconsider the specific issues faced by the community of Milton Keynes.</p>

	<p pid="a.470.0/1">The Minister is right that many farmers have been enterprising and have diversified, but I am sure that he would agree that there is a problem if farmers are too far from a telephone exchange to be able to access broadband. Satellite is one option, but it tends to be more expensive to run than working via a terrestrial line. Also, as we have heard, some functions are simply not possible via satellite.</p>
	<p pid="a.470.0/2">The Government, the Scottish Executive and the Welsh Assembly have, to their credit, invested large amounts of money, and I pay tribute to them for that. The money has mostly been given to BT and has meant that the vast majority of people in the country and the vast majority of businesses are able to access broadband. However, some businesses and people have missed out. As was pointed out, the success for the vast majority of people in the country does mean problems for the small number of people in remote areas who cannot access broadband.</p>
	<p pid="a.470.0/3">According to the official statistics, 99.6 to 99.7 per cent. of households could access broadband using some form of terrestrial technology available on the mass market. However, that leaves some 200,000 people behind and, as we have heard&mdash;I think that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1768" name="Stephen Crabb">the hon. Member for Preseli Pembrokeshire (Mr. Crabb)</phrase> was the first to raise this&mdash;the anecdotal evidence is that far more people than that cannot access broadband. Hon. Members have raised another important question: what exactly is the official definition of broadband? As I said, the anecdotal evidence is that more than 200,000 people have problems when trying to access broadband.</p>
	<p pid="a.470.0/4">I did some research. In November 2003, a representative of the regulator, which at that time was Oftel, appeared before the Trade and Industry Committee. At that time, Oftel defined broadband as</p>
	<p pid="a.470.0/5" class="indent">&quot;an always-on service with a minimum downstream capacity in excess of 128 kbit/s&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.470.0/6">Committee members expressed concern, as I am sure hon. Members will today, that 128 kilobits per second was far too low a transfer rate for a sensible definition of broadband. Research on the Ofcom website did not turn up a revision of the 128 definition. I shall therefore ask the Minister a question that other hon. Members have asked. Can he advise us what definition his Department uses to define broadband when it publishes its statistics showing that 99.7 per cent. of households can access broadband?</p>
	<p pid="a.470.0/7">People who cannot access broadband because they live too far away from a telephone exchange, whether there are 200,000 such people or more, should not be excluded from the modern digital age. Clearly, the market alone will not provide them with access. Without Government, Scottish Executive and Welsh Assembly intervention, there would not be as many enabled telephone exchanges as there are today. I think that, in Scotland, only one telephone exchange has still to be enabled. Despite that, at least 200,000 people do not have access. As I said, the market alone will not provide, so Government intervention is required.</p>
	<p pid="a.470.0/8">Previous generations brought roads, public transport, electricity and telephones to remote rural areas. Broadband, because of the education and employment opportunities that it brings, is not a luxury but an essential tool for the 21st century. I therefore look forward to the Minister's reply. I hope that he will say that the Government will sit down with the telecoms industry&mdash;obviously, that is mainly BT, but there are other telecom providers&mdash;and the regulator to try to come up with a solution that will make broadband available to all in Britain, no matter where they live.</p>

	<p pid="a.476.1/1">I have said that I will respond to any point, and to supplementary points from individuals, but I want to cover as many of the questions as I can.</p>
	<p pid="a.476.1/2">A question was asked about the breakdown of the 99 per cent. figure. I understand that the BT claim refers to UK households connected to enabled exchanges. A question was raised about public money going to BT. Where that has happened, it has happened as a result of competitive tendering to upgrade facilities that BT considered not to be economically viable. It is also important to acknowledge that many factors, such as home wiring, can affect performance of digital subscriber lines, which provide DSL broadband access.</p>
	<p pid="a.476.1/3">In relation to the questions asked by the hon. Member for Wycombe in his introduction, the problem is that there is no detailed analysis of the 0.2 per cent. figure to which we both referred, except in the region-by-region analysis of what is thought to be the nature of the problem. The matter only comes to light when a request for a DSL is attempted, and it is discovered that the line is one of the few that has a problem.</p>
	<p pid="a.476.1/4">On the commitment of the DTI, we are leading the broadband debate. We are pursuing solutions with operators and we greatly welcome the sort of interest expressed by hon. Members today. Once we get past the national and regional issues, the matter often amounts drilling down to discover where the specific problems are&mdash;they may be in an individual line or a very small locality&mdash;and finding solutions to them.</p>
	<p pid="a.476.1/5">Regional development agencies and devolved Administrations have supported a variety of projects such as Fibrespeed in Wales, Cybermoor, Digital Region and Actnow in Cornwall, to which I referred earlier. Actnow was a particular success story that received objective 1 funding and experienced another of the consequences of success, when villages just outside the defined area for the pilot project got very aerated about the fact that they were not involved and campaigned to be included. In the end, a much bigger area was enabled without additional expenditure and there was a considerable extension of take-up, which is one of the reasons why BT realised there was a bigger market than had been anticipated in some of the low-population rural areas.</p>
	<p pid="a.476.1/6">RDA, devolved Administration and local government intervention requires careful consideration of the impact in relation to market failure. We should not invest money if the market is able to supply the service, but on the other hand, it is appropriate to invest where there are clear market failures. Indeed, organisations such as the Scottish Parliament and Welsh Assembly have identified such places as appropriate ones in which to intervene.</p>
	<p pid="a.476.1/7"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1960" name="Alan Reid">The hon. Member for Argyll and Bute (Mr. Reid)</phrase> asked about the figures given by the Countryside Alliance. I am afraid that it is beyond my remit to answer for the Countryside Alliance, an organisation which, as we know from its public opinion surveys, is arithmetically challenged in the extreme. As far as I am aware, there are no figures that provide the answer to the question, so I have no clue where the Countryside&mdash;</p>
