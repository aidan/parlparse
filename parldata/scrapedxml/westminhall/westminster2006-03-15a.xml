<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-03-15a.425.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1704" speakername="Graham Stringer" colnum="425"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060315/halltext/60315h01.htm#60315h01_spnew0">
	<p pid="a.425.3/1">Before I get on to bus deregulation, I want to say I am sorry that my hon. Friend the Minister is retiring from the job. I wish her well in what she does in future. In the surprisingly long time&mdash;22 years&mdash;that I have been dealing with Transport Ministers, I have come across some, from both main parties, who were less than competent, and I am pleased to say that my hon. Friend is not like that. She has done a good job. Although I suspect that we shall not see eye to eye in this morning's debate, I am sorry to see her go and wish her well.</p>
	<p pid="a.425.3/2">The purpose of the debate is to explore why, in the part of the public transport system provided by buses, which account for 84 or 85 per cent. of journeys in the system, there is effectively an apartheid regime between London and the rest of the country. I should like to use our time to see whether there is any justification for maintaining one system in London, which works, produces good public transport and benefits passengers, and another system in the rest of the country that has the opposite impact.</p>
	<p pid="a.425.3/3">We have already convinced the vast majority of Members of Parliament outside London that their constituents would benefit from a regulated system. Last autumn, Communicate Research did a survey of all MPs and found that 84 per cent. of Labour MPs and a majority of Members of Parliament were in favour of extending to the rest of the country the regulated system found in London. The only thing to surprise me about that was that only 84 per cent. of Labour MPs responded in that way. I have never found one who did not want regulation in the passenger transport and shire areas of the country.</p>
	<p pid="a.425.3/4">The background is that, in London, bus use is increasing, and in every region in England it is in decline. The most dramatic decline is in south Yorkshire where, since deregulation, bus use has dropped by 62 per cent., which is extraordinary. It is not a matter of an even spread of usage&mdash;the people who use buses are among the poorest in the country. Nine out of 10 people who use buses are in the bottom income bracket, and 60 per cent. of bus users have no access to cars. Therefore, if something goes wrong with the bus system, we are allowing the mechanisms that increase social exclusion to continue to operate.</p>
	<p pid="a.425.3/5">I cannot talk about the regulated system in London as being more effective and producing better public transport without talking about the increasing funding gap. I shall mention it only once. Over the past seven years, in the north-west, although similar statistics will be found in every region, capital expenditure&mdash;not the revenue for buses&mdash;has risen from &pound;157 million to &pound;295 million, whereas in London it has risen from &pound;226 million to &pound;667 million. That is another background unfairness.</p>
	<p pid="a.425.3/6">Before I try to analyse the possible reasons for what has happened, I should like to give some statistics. I suspect that I could spend the whole hour and a half available to us giving out appalling statistics about transport usage, but I want to use the headline figures showing the changes that have happened, and to ask why they have been allowed and how we can stop the process going further.</p>
	<p pid="a.425.3/7">Fares in the English passenger transport executive areas have gone up 86 per cent. since deregulation. In London, they have gone up 36 per cent. Over the past five years, fares in the PTE areas have gone up 9 per cent. In London, they have gone down 4 per cent. Patronage since deregulation across all the PTE areas has gone down by about half. In London, it has gone up by just over half. In the past five years, patronage in the PTE areas has gone down 8 per cent. whereas it has gone up more than a third in London.</p>
	<p pid="a.425.3/8">We need to understand why there has been such a dramatic difference between London and the rest of the country. I do not believe that it is justifiable, but we should consider ministerial responses to the figures and some statements from officials. The Government have three responses to the shocking figures that I have mentioned. One is that we are not going back to pre-1985 days and re-regulation. That is a complete red herring. I have never heard anyone say, in the debate on this matter that has been going on as long as there has been deregulation, that they want buses brought back into public ownership and a return to the exact regulation that existed before 1985. What most of us want is a system similar to London's, or preferably a better one, because when a system is adopted it can be improved.</p>
	<p pid="a.425.3/9">Secondly, the Secretary of State for Transport regularly points out success stories. His favourites seem to be York, Oxford, Brighton and Cambridge. He asks why, if those towns or small cities can improve patronage on their buses, big areas such as Birmingham, Manchester, Liverpool and Newcastle cannot. There is one obvious reason. His examples are much smaller areas, dominated in nearly every case by one operator, with one centre, so that traffic restraint can work&mdash;people do not have much of a choice in those areas.</p>
	<p pid="a.425.3/10">That situation can be compared with what happens in a polycentric urban conurbation such as Manchester. The city of Manchester has the highest percentage bus usage of any of the metropolitan areas, but Bury, which my constituency borders, has one of the lowest in the country. It is necessary to take account of different circumstances when attempting to make like-with-like comparisons. The west midlands and Greater Manchester clearly have much more in common with the London conurbation than with York or Cambridge, which are much smaller.</p>
	<p pid="a.425.3/11">Do the people in those towns like what is happening? I suspect not. A letter to the York <i>Evening Press</i> from Chris Nelson, complaining bitterly about price increases that he had to pay in York, asked</p>
	<p pid="a.425.3/12" class="indent">&quot;are these higher fares just because First is the only bus operator in York, and people such as the elderly, single parents, or others on low incomes have no other choice of transport?</p>
	<p pid="a.425.3/13" class="indent">Park and Ride fares in York are simply extortionate&mdash;no other way of putting it. You have to pay the equivalent of a day ticket just for a return fare.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.425.3/14">He goes on to say that the system in York does not work. It is, therefore, neither wonderful nor comparable, and it is not a good reason for saying that the same could happen in Greater Manchester.</p>
	<p pid="a.425.3/15">The third ministerial reason is that London is different, and it is&mdash;it is about two and a half times larger than Greater Manchester or the west midlands. In terms of buses, however, it was no different before regulation, and the real change is that there is now a regulated system in London and a deregulated system outside. Before deregulation, 48 per cent. of all public transport journeys were in the PTE areas and about 27 per cent. were in London. That situation has reversed, with nearly half of bus journeys in London and only 27 per cent. in the PTE areas. That is a dramatic switch round. Comparable areas, which had similar penetrations of bus usage, are now completely different. One reason for that is the regulated system, and the other is that there is three times more subsidy per passenger in London than in the rest of the country. Those, then, are the ministerial reasons.</p>
	<p pid="a.425.3/16">I advise hon. Members who want to understand some of the thinking of the Department for Transport to get hold of a transcript of the Public Accounts Committee's proceedings on <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-23">23 January</phrase>. At that sitting, the Committee gently kebabed the permanent secretary at the Department. He is a good civil servant, and I make no criticism of him. Indeed, he is a man of integrity and intelligence, but he was trying to defend what is more or less indefensible. He did not quite plead the fifth amendment, but in many cases he pleaded ignorance of what is happening to transport in our major urban conurbations. Let me go through some of the reasons that he gave.</p>
	<p pid="a.425.3/17">First, the permanent secretary said that local authorities in PTE and passenger transport authority areas would begin to have a service similar to that in London if they would only restrain car use, but that is not really the case. Greater Manchester is spending about &pound;50 million on quality bus corridors, and other urban conurbations are doing the same. However, because the system is deregulated, the bus companies are moving on to the radial routes to make bigger profits, and the network is contracting. Although passenger usage on the radial routes might increase, therefore, there will be a worse service for some of the poorest people in the country</p>
	<p pid="a.425.3/18">Incidentally, the Government are tough in assessing the benefits of investment in public transport systems such as Metrolink, but no real assessment is done of the usefulness of investment in quality bus corridors, or of whether such corridors improve public transport&mdash;the idea that they will bring about improvements is an article of faith in the deregulated, privatised system. In the light of the facts, however, that is not a belief that I share. One justification that Mr. Rowlands, the permanent secretary, uses is that quality bus corridors will help to get rid of congestion, and that is what has happened in London. However, the Department's answers to parliamentary questions show that two thirds of bus delays are caused not by congestion, but by the unreliability of private buses&mdash;they simply do not turn up.</p>
	<p pid="a.425.3/19">The permanent secretary also says that, although there might be concentrations of bus usage, there are almost guaranteed to be three bids for subsidised routes. However, that is completely wrong. Many of the subsidised routes that PTEs put out to tender are simply not bid for. In Greater Manchester and the other PTE areas, there is only one bidder for many routes. The cost of such tenders has gone up by about 20 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="a.425.3/20">Arriva, which is no different from the four other major bus companies that dominate the industry, makes no secret of what it is doing. In answer to questions at the Public Accounts Committee, the permanent secretary said that those bus companies were &quot;economically rational&quot; and &quot;passenger maximising&quot;, but they are not. They are certainly profit maximising, but that is not the same thing. If they can concentrate their services along routes from which others have been cleared by means of bus priority measures, they will make their profits there and remove their buses from other areas. Although the permanent secretary seemed to be wilfully ignorant of that, Arriva's half-year report stated:</p>
	<p pid="a.425.3/21" class="indent">&quot;Outside London our approach, to what is currently a mature market, is to focus on a twin-track strategy of targeting investment to deliver growth and eliminating low margin and loss-making routes.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.425.3/22">That means that companies will remove routes on which they make a certain amount of money. The 53 route in Manchester, which was there for 80 years and always had good patronage, has just gone. Instead, companies will run routes up and down the main radial routes, which is bad for public transport.</p>
	<p pid="a.425.3/23">Whichever way we look at the Department's analysis&mdash;that there will be more bids, that there is competition and that quality bus corridors will be the solution&mdash;it does not fit with the facts. Should not the permanent secretary understand that, in a market in which the private sector is exploiting the people I represent, bus companies make 50 per cent. of their profits on only 25 per cent. of their business? That should, at least, be cause for concern. The Department said that it did not understand that and that it was not aware of those figures, and I would be happy to give officials the references for all the sources of information in my speech at the end of the debate if the Department is willing to listen.</p>
	<p pid="a.425.3/24">On the subject of listening, I have tabled parliamentary questions to ask how many times the Department meets individual bus companies and officials and members of PTAs and PTEs. I have been told that meetings happen regularly, but I am rather interested in how often they take place, because there is evidence that Government policy is biased towards the private bus industry and against public officials from PTEs. I therefore ask the Minister whether officials will meet PTE members and whether detailed figures will be given out.</p>
	<p pid="a.425.3/25">We have reached an extraordinary situation. I have been in favour of buses all my political life because the people I have represented as a councillor and a Member of Parliament have needed them. However, the system that now operates in metropolitan areas means that being in favour of buses is not the same as being in favour of public transport&mdash;they can be quite different things. Bus priority measures can be introduced, but the public transport system will get worse. That is quite a shocking state of affairs.</p>
	<p pid="a.425.3/26">At the same time, the private companies are demanding more public money. Some &pound;2 billion is going into the bus industry and the companies' profits are going up, but the service outside London is getting worse. Brian Souter of Stagecoach attacks all the PTEs because passenger numbers are going down, but, at the same time, he has his begging bowl out. Like most private sector bus company operators, he says, &quot;You're not doing anything, so please build us park-and-ride schemes with your own money.&quot; If the private-sector bus industry were really creative and innovative, it would find those resources itself, instead of making returns on capital in the PTE of more than 50 per cent.&mdash;another fact of which Mr. Rowlands was not aware.</p>
	<p pid="a.425.3/27">A number of other hon. Members want to speak, so I will finish by asking how we can justify a situation in which the travelling public in areas such as Greater Manchester and south Yorkshire have to face four fare increases a year. In London, they face one increase a year&mdash;or one fare adjustment, because sometimes the fares in London go down. How can it be good for public transport when in the past four years there have been 9,000 service changes in Greater Manchester? I assume that the figures are similar in other areas. Most people who want to increase bus patronage recognise that reliability and stability in the network are important factors. People need to know where the buses are going, but 9,000 service changes is instability of an extraordinary kind, which leads people to invest in cars and not go on buses.</p>
	<p pid="a.425.3/28">How can we justify not doing anything about a system in which punctuality in virtually all PTE areas is 76 per cent. and reliability is only 92 per cent.? Those shocking figures are mostly down to the companies, not conditions on the road. How can we justify investing &pound;2 billion but not looking at how we target the operators' grant money? We just pay it out, but do not try to use the tiny levers that are left to get a public transport system. The money is paid out without any controls at all. How can we justify having underfunded, under-resourced traffic commissioners, while companies such as FirstGroup have failed and have had to have hearings and investigations into their failures? The system means that traffic commissioners have to take services off, which is not good for the travelling public, even if they were poor services. When services are taken off in the north of England, FirstGroup registers a subsidiary and carries on as before, with its unreliable, unsatisfactory services.</p>
	<p pid="a.425.3/29">I do not see how any of that is justifiable. Our public transport system is going in the wrong direction. Most of the evidence is that our urban areas compete effectively internationally if they have good public transport systems. The situation is a brake on what they are doing, and I am worried that we are going in the wrong direction.</p>
	<p pid="a.425.3/30">Last year, at the request and subsidy of Services Employees International Union, a north American trade union, I went to the States to see how FirstGroup and other bus companies operated, and I was quite shocked. The safety record of the bus companies in this country is not good&mdash;I think that 15 per cent. of buses that are stopped by the commissioners have to be taken off the road immediately for being unsafe&mdash;but what is happening in the United States is worse. I do not want us to go down that route. I have tabled questions and asked for guarantees that, if we go to a yellow bus service, we will not follow the route that FirstGroup has taken in the United States.</p>
	<p pid="a.425.3/31">I know that the Minister has a brief and is in the last days of being a Minister in the Department, but I ask her to accept that the situation is not justified. None of us wants to return to the 1984 system, which was not as responsive as it should have been, but we do want value for the &pound;2 billion that is invested. We want local control, so that we can say to our constituents, &quot;This is a public transport system that will get you to work on time.&quot; Constituents of mine have lost their jobs or not got to hospital for important appointments because FirstGroup did not turn up, at the same time as its profits are increasing. That is simply unacceptable. I hope that the Minister will be as positive as she can be in response to those points.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-03-15a.447.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1956" speakername="Anne Begg" colnum="447"  time="011:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060315/halltext/60315h02.htm#60315h02_spnew0">
	<p pid="a.447.1/1">I am delighted to be here this morning, Mr. Jones. On Second Reading of the Disability Discrimination Bill on <phrase class="date" code="2005-03-23">23 March 2005</phrase>, I said that the Government would at some time in the future have to consider passing legislation making it illegal to discriminate on the grounds of genetics. Although I congratulate them on outlawing most areas of discrimination faced by disabled people, there is still a large hole in the process of ensuring that disabled people have their full civil rights. We must make sure that they do not suffer disproportionately from genetic discrimination in their employment opportunities or in access to services such as insurance.</p>
	<p pid="a.447.1/2">I see the issue as one of equality and civil rights. Unfortunately, not everyone does, and I was reminded of that when preparing for this debate. When we were fighting for full civil rights for disabled people, it was difficult to get a relevant Minister to answer because the issue was invariably seen as one of health. One of the first problems the disabled movement had in fighting for civil rights was to get disability away from the Department of Health so that we could begin to challenge the medical model of disability and make the Government realise that it was our civil rights we were fighting for, not just access to health treatment and social care.</p>
	<p pid="a.447.1/3">When I was granted this debate, I suppose it should not really have come as a surprise that my request was passed to the Department of Health, despite the fact that the Table Office suggested that I should add &quot;in employment&quot; to the title, so that it would be clear that it concerned genetic testing and discrimination in employment, not just genetics, which obviously is a health issue. I had hoped that a Minister from the Department for Work and Pensions would be asked to reply, or the Minister from the Department of Trade and Industry who is responsible for workers' rights. I am glad that, not I, but the system in this place persuaded the relevant Minister to respond today. I suspect that the Under-Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1813" name="Meg Munn">my hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield, Heeley (Meg Munn)</phrase> has drawn the short straw, but I am glad to see her. Her responsibilities include equality, and I believe that this is an equality issue.</p>
	<p pid="a.447.1/4">The subject of genetic discrimination first came to my attention when I realised that those with diagnosed genetic conditions were receiving unfair treatment when applying for insurance. The insurance companies assumed that someone who had a genetic condition would automatically have a shorter life and should, therefore, pay higher premiums for any kind of life cover. That was also true for getting travel insurance, and several people contacted me, concerned either that it was impossible to get travel insurance for someone with a disability or that the premiums were so high that travel was almost impossible.</p>
	<p pid="a.447.1/5">The assumptions often made by insurance companies regarding people with genetic conditions are that their lives will be shorter and that the quality of their lives will be less. That may be true of some conditions. For instance, if someone has been tested for Huntington's disease, there will be a direct correlation between their having the defective gene and the development of the disease later in life. However, it is impossible to predict when that might be or the severity with which the disease will initially hit, so there is a question of time scales. The situation with regard to the Huntington's gene is not necessarily the case for all genetic conditions. Indeed, a genetic disposition for a particular condition such as cancer or heart disease does not necessarily mean that an individual will develop the condition. A predisposition is purely that: a predisposition, not necessarily a matter of fact.</p>
	<p pid="a.447.1/6">I know that insurance companies work on risk factors when they are working out the premiums payable, whether for life insurance or travel insurance, so they have to build in those risk factors and have access to all relevant information when making their decisions. I was very pleased when the Association of British Insurers announced in 2001 that it was to adopt a five-year moratorium on the use of genetic test results by insurers. At that time, I was about to apply for an Adjournment debate on the subject, but when the moratorium came along I decided to see how it worked, so I did not. If the moratorium did not work, I always intended to call for legislation to outlaw the practice of genetic discrimination.</p>
	<p pid="a.447.1/7">I was particularly pleased to learn that from yesterday&mdash;I did not know this when I applied for the debate&mdash;a concordat has been agreed between the insurance industry and the Government, providing that insurers' use of genetic information should be transparent, fair and subject to independent oversight, and that the voluntary moratorium on insurers' use of predictive genetic tests should be extended until <phrase class="date" code="">1 November 2011</phrase>. It has also been agreed that the concordat will be reviewed in 2008.</p>
	<p pid="a.447.1/8">I know that not everyone is happy with everything the insurance industry has done because there are exemptions, such as Huntington's disease, but at least the system is much fairer. I certainly do not have any anecdotal evidence that people with genetic conditions feel they have been unfairly treated by the insurance industry. I believe that a model exists in that the insurance industry has shown the way. It is possible to ensure that those with genetic conditions are not treated unfairly and that there are clear guidelines, particularly for the use of predictive genetic tests.</p>
	<p pid="a.447.1/9">The basis of my argument is that I would like a similar understanding to be reached with employers in the United Kingdom so that they do not demand the disclosure of genetic tests by their employees or, indeed, force employees or applicants for jobs to take the tests at all. If it is not possible to reach such an understanding and it becomes clear that genetic discrimination is taking place in the UK, I would look to the Government to legislate to outlaw that practice.</p>
	<p pid="a.447.1/10">At this point, I should explain what is meant by predictive genetic tests and why it is important that people should be able to take such tests without the fear that it may lead to their being discriminated against. There are two main types of genetic tests. The first test a person's genetic make-up in order to identify, for example, where there may be faults in genes, or whether there are genes that would lead to a particular disease. The second type test for genetic damage that occurs during a person's lifetime.</p>
	<p pid="a.447.1/11">I speak as a supporter of genetic testing. I was born with a genetic condition and know the good that such tests can do. They play important roles in diagnosis and in treatment. For some, they may diagnose something for which there are presently no symptoms, but where it is useful to know that the genetic condition exists, as it may help determine lifestyle choices or help in early detection so that remedial treatment can prevent the symptoms from occurring. It is an important health issue.</p>
	<p pid="a.447.1/12">It is for precisely those reasons that I want to ensure that people who may have genetic conditions feel safe in having a test, secure in the knowledge that the information gained will not be used by anyone to discriminate against them in future. Only with such assurances will people feel at ease in taking a test that may be very important to their future health. Evidence from elsewhere in the world, particularly the United States, which seems the worst example of a country in which people are forced to disclose information gained through genetic tests&mdash;suggests that without assurances that the information will not be used against them, people shy away from having the tests done at all. That has important consequences for their future health plans. I ask the Government to ensure that security measures are in place so that people can take genetic tests in the sure knowledge that the tests will be used for good of the individual and not to discriminate against them.</p>
	<p pid="a.447.1/13">In years to come, genetic testing will become more sophisticated, and I want to ensure that such tests are a force for good, that they lead to better diagnoses and treatment and that they are not something to be feared. Of course, someone who has symptoms and a disability as a result of a genetic disease is likely to be covered by existing disability discrimination legislation. Someone who is asymptomatic is not covered, and nor is someone who might be affected by a condition later in life. Nor, indeed, is someone who has undergone a predictive genetic test, because it predicts only a propensity, and not that they will get the disease.</p>
	<p pid="a.447.1/14">Many people fear predictive genetic tests. For someone who has a family history of breast cancer, it may be right to have a predictive test, but if there are no guidelines and no security against the test's being used to discriminate against the individual, they may not undertake it.</p>
	<p pid="a.447.1/15">Predictive genetic tests are still crude, and their development has a long way to go, but even today, they are used to predict someone's propensity for developing a particular condition&mdash;perhaps cancer or heart disease. Although such tests may predict a propensity or susceptibility towards a condition, they predict neither that the person will definitely develop that condition, nor any time scales if they should. Therefore, if predictive genetic tests were used by insurance companies or employers to determine that an individual should be treated less favourably than someone else, that would be discrimination, and such practice should be outlawed. The use of those types of tests is causing most concern among organisations such as the Trades Union Congress and GeneWatch.</p>
	<p pid="a.447.1/16">At a time when the Government are trying to encourage more disabled people into the work force, or to keep those who have developed a disability while in a job, it would be perverse if employers were able to use genetic tests as a recruitment tool to screen out people who were thought to be a greater risk.</p>
	<p pid="a.447.1/17">The Human Genetics Commission has found no evidence that employers in the UK are systematically using genetic test results to recruit people, or using such tests as part of workplace health programmes&mdash;yet. However, the HGC has outlined the following general principles:</p>
	<p pid="a.447.1/18" class="indent">&quot;that everyone is entitled to privacy and should not have to discuss information about personal genetic characteristics; that private genetic information should not be obtained or held without a person's consent; that private personal genetic information should be treated as confidential and not communicated to others without a person's consent; and that no one should be unfairly discriminated against on the basis of his or her genetic characteristics.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.447.1/19">A number of countries, such as Austria, Denmark, France, the Netherlands and Norway, have some form of legislation that prohibits or limits employers' rights to ask for genetic information. Before it becomes a serious problem, it may be time for the UK Government to look to follow suit.</p>
	<p pid="a.447.1/20">It is clear that genetic testing will increase. I want to ensure that those tests are used for good reasons and not to discriminate against an individual. We must ensure that they are used positively, whether it is to help in diagnosis and cure, to help people make more rational life choices, or to help employers ensure that they provide a safe working environment. They should not be used to help employers find an easy way to save money by not employing certain types of people because they may be a higher risk to the employer later in life or incur extra expenses for the employer.</p>
	<p pid="a.447.1/21">It is time for the Government to consider the issue seriously to encourage employers to follow the lead given by the insurance companies and consider a moratorium on the use of the tests. Ultimately, however, there will probably come a time when the Government have to legislate to outlaw genetic discrimination in the UK.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-03-15a.450.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1813" speakername="Meg Munn" speakeroffice="The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Trade and Industry"  colnum="450"  time="011:15:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060315/halltext/60315h02.htm#60315h02_spmin0">
	<p pid="a.450.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1956" name="Anne Begg">my hon. Friend the Member for Aberdeen, South (Miss Begg)</phrase> on securing the debate, and I pay tribute to the great deal of work that she has done on many occasions to raise disability and genetics issues. I am also grateful to her for the opportunity to debate this issue and to lay out the steps that the Government are taking.</p>
	<p pid="a.450.0/2">My hon. Friend suggested that I had drawn the short straw, but I am happy to address the issue, because, as she said, my responsibilities cover women and equality. As I have said on many occasions, particularly during the passage of the Equality Bill, which is the legislation that will set up the new commission for equality and human rights, equality affects everybody and should be a concern of everybody. I am delighted that my hon. Friend has raised an issue that is not often referred to but about which we should nevertheless be concerned.</p>
	<p pid="a.450.0/3">In the 2003 White Paper on genetics, we said that the Government &quot;wholeheartedly endorses&quot; the Human Genetics Commission's view that no one should be unfairly discriminated against on the basis of their genetic characteristics. The White Paper reminds us that universal health care, funded from taxation, which is the basis of the national health service, protects people against discrimination on the basis of genetic information. As genetic testing becomes more widely available, we are concerned to ensure that people should not and will not have to fear losing cover for health care.</p>
	<p pid="a.450.0/4">All people with a genetic condition will be protected by the Disability Discrimination Act 2005, once their condition results in their becoming a disabled person within the meaning of that Act. My hon. Friend referred to that issue. However, we must not be complacent about the risk to people who, as a result of genetic testing, are shown to have an increased risk or, in limited cases, the certainty of developing a particular condition later in life.</p>
	<p pid="a.450.0/5">The Government have done much to promote equality and tackle discrimination&mdash;a great deal more than any previous Government in our country. We have offered many people protection under the law for the first time, we are taking action to streamline and modernise the framework of discrimination law, and we are considering areas, such as the one under discussion, in which there are calls for specific new legal protection.</p>
	<p pid="a.450.0/6">The Government have outlawed discrimination in the workplace on the grounds of sexual orientation and religion and belief, and we plan to do so later this year for age. In 2004, we significantly extended protection for disabled people against disability discrimination in recruitment and employment.</p>
	<p pid="a.450.0/7">The Government have also brought in a groundbreaking duty on public authorities to promote race equality, eliminate racial discrimination and promote good relations between different racial groups. The legislation was introduced in 2002. As I am sure my hon. Friend knows, it is being followed by similar duties for disability and gender, which are due to come into force in December 2006 and April 2007 respectively. We legislated to provide legal recognition for same-sex partnerships for the first time through the Civil Partnership Act 2004.</p>
	<p pid="a.450.0/8">The Equality Act 2006 has made significant steps, and it received Royal Assent on <phrase class="date" code="2006-02-16">16 February</phrase>. It has three main purposes. First, it establishes the commission for equality and human rights, whose general duties, set out in statute, include encouraging the development of a society in which people's ability to achieve their potential is not limited by prejudice or discrimination. Secondly, it makes discrimination on the grounds of religion or belief unlawful in the provision of goods, facilities and services, and in the exercise of public functions. Thirdly, it creates a duty on public authorities to promote equality of opportunity between men and women, and to prohibit sex discrimination in the exercise of public functions. It also includes a power to make secondary legislation outlawing discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation in the provision of goods, facilities and services. We are currently consulting on the detail of those measures. However, although there are many provisions relating to many areas of discrimination, we recognise that there is still more to do if we are to ensure that everyone's skills and talents can be fully realised and that people are not discriminated against for any reason, such as in the ways that my hon. Friend has described.</p>
	<p pid="a.450.0/9">The Government are currently undertaking a discrimination law review that is working to develop a clearer and more streamlined framework of equality law. It will lead to a single equality Act later in this Parliament; that is a manifesto commitment. As part of the review, we are, of course, considering the calls made by various people from various organisations to extend discrimination law into new areas, including genetic predisposition. Genetic tests are becoming available that show that a person has an increased risk or a likelihood&mdash;or, in some cases, certainty&mdash;of developing a particular medical condition later in life. As my hon. Friend said, the concern is that the results of such tests might be used by employers to screen out applicants for jobs or promotion, or that insurance companies might screen out applicants for health cover or life insurance, or increase their premiums unreasonably.</p>
	<p pid="a.450.0/10">I understand the concerns, but the technology is at an early stage, and it is important that nothing is done except on the basis of careful consideration of all the options. Discrimination law is one possibility, but there are clearly others, including legislation about the use of genetic tests, or statutory guidance. I intend to publish a Green Paper this summer, which will set out initial proposals and options for clarifying and streamlining discrimination law, and which will seek the views of all interested parties. We are committed to taking on board the views of all interested people, and we do not want to predict or pre-empt the findings of that consultation. I invite my hon. Friend and all who are concerned about this issue&mdash;I know that other Members involved in all-party groups have discussed it at length&mdash;to respond.</p>
	<p pid="a.450.0/11">The work of the discrimination law review will run alongside the independent equalities review, which the Government established to investigate the causes of persistent discrimination and inequality in British society. The findings of the equalities review, which is due to report to the Prime Minister later in the year, will inform the work of the discrimination law review and the subsequent single equality Bill&mdash;and, indeed, the work of the new commission for equality and human rights. Let me reassure my hon. Friend that any proposals for reform to equality legislation will take full account both of the need to tackle inequality effectively and of the need to follow better regulation principles to minimise the burden on business and public services.</p>
	<p pid="a.450.0/12">I will now address the specific concerns that my hon. Friend raised. First, on employment, the Government are not aware of there being any evidence at present of large-scale use of genetic testing by employers. However, we are committed to monitoring developments in genetic testing and have asked the Human Genetics Commission to assess the prevalence of genetic testing in the workplace and to report back later this spring. Given the weather, I am not sure whether we are quite into spring yet, or how soon it will come, but we will get that report in the near future. The HGC is well placed to undertake the work as it has an excellent understanding of the issues, is well respected and&mdash;importantly&mdash;will provide independent advice. In addition, the Information Commissioner's statutory employment code sets out that employers should inform the HGC of any proposals to use genetic testing for employment purposes. The Government have included questions on genetic testing in the 2005 British social attitudes survey to assess public opinion on the issue. The results will be available later this year.</p>
	<p pid="a.450.0/13">The Government wish to ensure that once genetic testing has advanced to the stage where the use of test results by employers becomes a realistic proposition there are appropriate safeguards to prevent such information from being unfairly used. The Data Protection Act 1998 does not prevent the use of genetic testing, but as this is sensitive information about individuals' health, it is subject to restrictive rules. This demonstrates our commitment to monitoring the use of genetic testing in employment, with a view to ensuring that we will ensure safeguards are in place once genetic testing has reached an advanced stage. My hon. Friend referred to evidence that it is used much more widely in the United States, and she was concerned about whether it would become more of an issue in our country. We will have to keep a close eye on that. However, in the United States much health insurance and much provision of health services are linked to employment, which is one reason why I believe the issue is much greater there than it is likely to be in our country.</p>
	<p pid="a.450.0/14">On insurance, as my hon. Friend said, we have a ban until November 2011 on the use by insurers of results from predictive genetic tests, unless a test has been approved by the Government's Genetics and Insurance Committee and relates to a policy over the substantial financial limits of &pound;500,000 for life insurance, &pound;300,000 for critical illness insurance, or &pound;30,000 a year for income protection insurance. The insurance industry recently made it clear that it will not ask for approval to use the results from predictive genetic tests in determining insurance premiums before 2008. The Association of British Insurers wrote to the Department of Health on <phrase class="date" code="2006-02-15">15 February 2006</phrase> to say that insurers will not apply to use any predictive genetic test result in determining insurance premiums before 2008. The only test that they may currently use&mdash;they can do so until 2011&mdash;is for Huntington's disease for life insurance policies of more than &pound;500,000. The current agreement with the insurance industry is flexible enough to respond to fast-moving technological and clinical developments in genetic testing. The Government have made it clear that any failure in respect of the agreement will lead to reconsideration of the need for statutory control. The Government stand by the commitment in the 2003 White Paper on genetics that any failure of the agreement will lead to reconsideration of the need for statutory control. If there is evidence of non-compliance with the moratorium by the insurance industry, the Government are prepared to enforce it through legislation. However, there is no such evidence at present.</p>
	<p pid="a.450.0/15">In conclusion, I repeat that the Government are committed to a society in which no one is unfairly discriminated against on the basis of his or her genetic characteristics. The discrimination law review will look into calls for specific legal protections to be introduced in the area of genetic predisposition and other new areas. I cannot predict the outcome of the review, but I look forward to there being a full and productive examination of the issues.</p>

	<p pid="a.454.1/1">It is a pleasure to see you in the Chair, Mr. Jones. It is also a pleasure, for which I am grateful, to have the opportunity to introduce this debate on broadband in rural areas.</p>
	<p pid="a.454.1/2">On <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-08">8 March</phrase> last year the Minister with us today&mdash;then the Minister for Rural Affairs&mdash;and the Minister for Energy and E-Commerce wrote a letter to all parish and town councils, headed &quot;Partnership in rolling out broadband to rural communities&quot;. The letter said, rightly, that broadband can reduce dependence on big population centres and increase investment, employment opportunities and choice without undermining the character of rural Britain.</p>
	<p pid="a.454.1/3" class="indent">&quot;Broadband Britain is becoming a reality&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.454.1/4">it said, and it urged parish and town councils to communicate the benefits of broadband to the communities that they serve.</p>
	<p pid="a.454.1/5">The letter was greeted with raised eyebrows by a group of constituents who live in the Hambleden valley area, most of which is within my constituency. I shall not waste words describing the area, other than to say that it is rural and beautiful, and that despite its prosperity it contains pockets of exclusion and isolation. Like other rural areas it is, of course, going through a process of change.</p>
	<p pid="a.454.1/6">The group was aware that almost 300 households and almost 60 businesses in the area cannot get broadband, so the Ministers' letter would in that sense have been rather wasted. Hambleden Valley Ltd was formed by the group in 2003 to obtain broadband services for the whole area. The company was intended as a procurement vehicle and was set up to meet the South East England Development Agency's requirements for broadband service procurement. Its website address, which is of course available both to those who have broadband and those who unfortunately do not, is <a href="http://www.hambledenvalley.net">www.hambledenvalley.net</a>.</p>
	<p pid="a.454.1/7">Hambleden Valley Ltd. wrote to SEEDA to ask for assistance in February last year. By August, no response had been forthcoming. Today, there has been no formal response, apart from a phone conversation, which I am told did not address longer-term issues and limitations associated with using anything other than landlines. In October, the group came to see me to discuss the difficulties that some of my constituents were having in getting access to broadband. It soon became evident to me that the local difficulty had a national dimension.</p>
	<p pid="a.454.1/8">I was told, and British Telecom has confirmed, that 0.2 per cent. of all telephone lines in the country cannot get broadband, but that may not be a definitive figure. Hambleden Valley Ltd referred me to a study in Kent, which the Minister may have seen, and which was carried out by Kent county council. The figure that it produced for such lines was not 0.2 per cent. In fact 2.4 per cent. of businesses and 2.2 per cent. of households in the county could not get broadband, so the figure in rural areas is likely to be higher.</p>
	<p pid="a.454.1/9">I should explain to those hon. Members who have difficulty in following the technical details&mdash;I must confess that I am one of them&mdash;that areas that cannot get broadband coverage are sometimes referred to as &quot;not spots&quot;, as opposed, I presume, to &quot;hot spots&quot;. I was intrigued by this matter, so I asked the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry in a written question whether he would list each constituency that contains a proportion of the relevant 0.2 per cent. of lines. The answer was that the information was not available in the form requested. I decided to drop the request for constituency information and ask the Secretary of State in another written question where the lines were located. The answer was that the information was not available in the form requested.</p>
	<p pid="a.454.1/10">At that point I gave up trying to second-guess the form in which the information might be available and decided instead to do a little investigation on a non-party political basis. I duly discovered that approximately 15 parliamentary colleagues reported their constituents to be in the same situation as mine. Since not all parliamentary colleagues from across the House will necessarily respond to inquiries from me, it must be assumed that the definitive figure is higher.</p>
	<p pid="a.454.1/11">I had clearly stumbled across a national problem, which is why I balloted for this debate, which I am grateful to have obtained. In the time remaining to me I want to discuss possible solutions to the problem, to describe what appear to be present obstacles to those solutions, and to ask the Minister a few questions, which I hope he will be able to deal with.</p>

	<p pid="a.458.0/1">I am grateful for the opportunity to contribute to this important debate. I start by congratulating <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1948" name="Paul Goodman">my hon. Friend the Member for Wycombe (Mr. Goodman)</phrase> on securing time to discuss the matter. He outlined the problems in his usual incisive and succinct way.</p>
	<p pid="a.458.0/2">In the 10 short months in which I have been a Member, I have received numerous e-mails, phone calls and letters from constituents who have had disappointing and frustrating experiences when trying to access broadband internet in Pembrokeshire. In those 10 months, I have built up a considerable file of cases, which I have been working on with BT. Some concern families or elderly couples. Several small businesses have contacted me, saying that they rely on e-mail and web access to be viable in such a remote, peripheral part of the United Kingdom.</p>
	<p pid="a.458.0/3">For example, on <phrase class="date" code="2006-02-14">14 February</phrase> I received a rather sad e-mail from a local business man, entitled &quot;Pulling out of Wales&quot;. One reason that he cited for quitting the Principality was the fact that his wife's start-up venture&mdash;an advanced post-production centre for TV and films&mdash;was simply not viable at their home location, because they have been told that they simply cannot get broadband.</p>
	<p pid="a.458.0/4">I shall not go into too much detail about the cases that I am working on, but a typical scenario is that someone interested in accessing broadband, logs on to BT's website, or that of another internet service provider, and taps in their postcode. They are informed that their local exchange is enabled, and that they can receive broadband. They place an order for the broadband kit, but an engineer comes round later to test the line and tells the customer that they cannot receive broadband after all. It is left to the customer to try to claim a refund on the order and, understandably, they are left feeling rather unhappy. That experience, in which the customer is initially under the impression that they can receive broadband and places an order on that understanding, is leaving a bitter taste in the mouths of many of my constituents.</p>
	<p pid="a.458.0/5">Another local business man wrote me a letter, which I received last May. He said that a large part of his business is net-based. He says:</p>
	<p pid="a.458.0/6" class="indent">&quot;Broadband is integral to the success of my business&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.458.0/7">He goes on to outline his difficulties in trying to access broadband with a particular internet service provider. He says:</p>
	<p pid="a.458.0/8" class="indent">&quot;If they could not supply broadband then they should have told me so when I first applied and given me their reasons . . . Instead all I get is a fog of misinformation&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.458.0/9">Despite all the attention devoted to local exchange enabling, my constituents have not appreciated that, at the end of the day, it is not a question of whether the local exchange is enabled; it is the quality of the line from the exchange to the household that counts, and that line quality is not good enough.</p>
	<p pid="a.458.0/10">I am told that in Pembrokeshire some problems with broadband availability are due to the amount of aluminium wiring used. Apparently, it is not suitable for carrying digital information in the way that copper wiring is. Another reason that I have been given is the distance between a house and the local exchange. However, we have had a scenario where some villagers in a small village can get broadband but their immediate neighbours cannot, so even that reason has been questioned by some of my constituents. In not one of the cases with which I have dealt in the past year has local exchange enabling been the central issue.</p>
	<p pid="a.458.0/11">One major cause of frustration and disappointment is that my constituents have heard the public relations line from BT about 99.8 per cent. of households being able to receive broadband, which they believe is now nearly universally available. However, the number of e-mails and letters that I have received in Pembrokeshire alone suggests that nothing like 99.8 per cent. of households can get broadband.</p>
	<p pid="a.458.0/12">I suspect that the figure of 99.8 per cent. is a rather imprecise estimate based on averaging an estimated number of enabled exchanges across the total UK population. Getting a more definite figure has proved problematic. I have asked BT for an estimate of the number of households in my county or my constituency that cannot access broadband owing to technical constraints, but it has not been able to provide such a figure:</p>
	<p pid="a.458.0/13" class="indent">&quot;at present BT cannot accurately estimate the actual number of homes where it is not feasible to provide broadband access.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.458.0/14">If BT cannot accurately estimate the number of homes that can access broadband, where on earth does the figure of 99.8 per cent. come from? BT states only that the &quot;vast majority&quot; of households in Pembrokeshire can access broadband.</p>
	<p pid="a.458.0/15">A local telecoms engineer informed me that he believes that only around 40 per cent. of an exchange area in Pembrokeshire can receive good quality broadband, which includes any speeds down to about 256 kilobits&mdash;a very low figure indeed. I have also heard another engineer comment that BT's figure of 99 per cent. should probably be nearer 65 per cent. nationwide. Some clarification is required, and BT needs to be more careful about some of its public relations.</p>
	<p pid="a.458.0/16">Judging from the interest in this afternoon's debate, I suspect that Pembrokeshire is not an isolated example. There are issues to do with broadband access in rural areas throughout the country.</p>

	<p pid="a.460.3/1">I look forward to hearing more detail in the Minister's reply and learning what he thinks the money has bought this country that would not have been provided in the marketplace.</p>
	<p pid="a.460.3/2">I have heard it said from a very senior BT executive that BT would like to &quot;move on&quot; from discussing broadband access in Wales to discussing what is called next generation technology. I am afraid that BT needs to be pulled back to the discussion about broadband access because, as I hope the evidence that I have provided in the last 10 minutes and the speeches that we shall hear in the remainder of this debate will show, the lack of broadband availability in a lot of rural areas is causing severe problems for businesses, households and charities.</p>

	<p pid="a.460.4/1">I would ask colleagues throughout the Chamber to be careful about one thing. Having spent four years as Minister for Rural Affairs, I know that talking down rural affairs does not help, although I do not think that that is the hon. Gentleman's intention. There are problems in some locations in some rural areas. That is not to say that there problems in all rural areas. If the impression is given that there are problems in all rural areas, the danger is that the rural economy will get talked down. Broadband is accessible and is being used effectively by many businesses, in many rural areas throughout the country. The focus of today's debate is the small but important number of gaps in the infrastructure.</p>

	<p pid="a.461.5/1">I, too, congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1948" name="Paul Goodman">my hon. Friend the Member for Wycombe (Mr. Goodman)</phrase> on securing this debate. Like others who wish to speak, I represent a rural area where broadband access is a problem, but we are not here to run down such areas&mdash;far from it.</p>
	<p pid="a.461.5/2">Like <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1768" name="Stephen Crabb">my hon. Friend the Member for Preseli Pembrokeshire (Mr. Crabb)</phrase>, I have struggled to reconcile the claim of virtually universal coverage of access to broadband with the experience of many of my constituents. Like him, I have a raft of correspondence&mdash;he will be relieved to hear that I shall not detain the Chamber with it&mdash;with people who have difficulty gaining access to broadband. I am here to argue their cause.</p>
	<p pid="a.461.5/3">That cause is not only my constituents' but the Government's, as the Minister has been at pains to tell us and as he will, I am sure, tell us again when he winds up. The Government's priority is to provide universal access to broadband, which is a noble and entirely honourable aspiration. As the Minister wrote to me in a letter on <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-24">24 January</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="a.461.5/4" class="indent">&quot;Stimulating broadband availability across the whole of the UK is a Government priority. We want to see all communities, irrespective of location, having access to an affordable broadband service from a competitive market.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.461.5/5">I should like to dwell on some of the issues raised by that aspiration.</p>
	<p pid="a.461.5/6">The significance of broadband in Shropshire is enormous. Last year Shropshire was declared to have the highest proportion of home-working of anywhere in the country. Because of even more remote access to the services than one might normally find in a constituency such as Wycombe, my constituents have great distances to travel and few job opportunities. As my hon. Friend the Member for Wycombe said, internet access is the one thing that provides the farming community with an opportunity for diversification, and a large proportion of the working age population, plus many who are beyond working age but have not had such opportunities before, with a way in to work. It is of great significance.</p>
	<p pid="a.461.5/7">Shropshire county council has recognised that, and I commend the work that it has done through Switch on Shropshire, an initiative that has been running for three years in conjunction with Advantage West Midlands to deliver broadband to communities. They have done well. I do not often congratulate my regional development agency in the House, but it has done a good job. Indeed it was highlighted by my hon. Friend the Member for Wycombe as being particularly successful in that regard. It has achieved that with relatively modest resources&mdash;some &pound;4.9 million has been allocated to broadband, about half of which has been spent. A number of initiatives are being taken to bring broadband to communities that currently lack it.</p>
	<p pid="a.461.5/8">Let me address some challenges of delivering broadband in my constituency. Some are technological, which means that I may stray into areas that are a little beyond my pay grade or competence. It seems that a significant problem arises from the use by BT of digital access carrier systems as the delivery mechanism for telephony. It is clear that DACS cannot be shared with broadband access. Therefore, there is a requirement on BT to replace such systems with a hard wire or wireless system that will allow high-speed broadband delivery. Most of my constituents' problems occur when they apply for broadband modems. They are signed up by their internet service providers or by BT Retail, which takes their money and installs modems but then discovers that BT Wholesale is not able to deliver the service because they are on DACS. The cost of replacing the DACS technology is a commercial decision, not one that the ISP is able to force BT to implement. BT has made that very clear. On <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-13">13 January</phrase> it told me that</p>
	<p pid="a.461.5/9" class="indent">&quot;whereas BT has a universal service obligation to provide telephony service, the provision of broadband is based on a commercial model.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.461.5/10">There is nothing wrong with that, provided that the commercial model can deliver access to broadband. There is an inherent conflict if it is uncommercial for BT to deliver to a remote individual household because of the cost that would be involved in replacing the line. How does the Minister intend to square the circle of dealing with BT's commercial priorities and the Government's priority to deliver universal access?</p>
	<p pid="a.461.5/11">The impact of lack of broadband is clear. I should like to use as an example one of my constituents who might be known to racing enthusiasts in the Chamber. He is the racehorse trainer, Henry Daly, who happens to be one of the largest employers on the outskirts of Ludlow, one of the main towns in my constituency. He employs some 65 people and, despite living within three or four miles of a relatively large exchange, does not have access to broadband and has been trying to get it for the past two years.</p>
	<p pid="a.461.5/12">All entries and declarations for races are available on the internet, which means that Mr Daly is unable to compete with trainers up and down the country to secure nominations for his horses, because he gets access to that information after everybody else. As a result, his horses do not always get high enough up the list to be able to be entered in the races for which they are best suited. That is a small example, but I think that will strike a chord with those who have an interest in racing. There is a clear competitiveness issue for people who are trying to do business in the countryside. There are also issues for people who wish to undertake adult learning from home. Schools have been connected, but we also need domestic connections.</p>
	<p pid="a.461.5/13">Finally, I should like to touch on some of the solutions being proposed, particularly by Advantage West Midlands, and to urge the Minister to find one that he favours. There is something called Rabit&mdash;the remote area broadband inclusion trial. I am not sure whether it is peculiar to Advantage West Midlands or a national solution. For businesses only, the regional development agency is funding grants to provide satellite delivery&mdash;up to the 512 kilobyte service&mdash;to qualifying businesses. For faster speeds, the grant has to be matched. In most cases, that means that a small business will have to find &pound;1,000 to secure the speed necessary for a proper, interactive service.</p>
	<p pid="a.461.5/14">I urge the Minister to tell us when he will extend a scheme such as Rabit to cover domestic premises, given the priority that he has given to enabling the entire country to have access to the service.</p>

	<p pid="a.466.0/1">I, too, congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1948" name="Paul Goodman">my hon. Friend the Member for Wycombe (Mr. Goodman)</phrase> on securing this valuable debate. I apologise for missing part of his opening speech.</p>
	<p pid="a.466.0/2">I was fascinated by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1444" name="Roger Williams">the question asked by the hon. Member for Brecon and Radnorshire (Mr. Williams)</phrase>, which was, &quot;How do we define broadband?&quot; It is a key question, to which I shall return shortly. I realise that when people think of Milton Keynes they think of a city, but I am sure that many hon. Members realise that it is both a city and a rural community. As Milton Keynes expanded sideways, it isolated a large rural tip of what was Buckinghamshire and is now part of the unitary authority of Milton Keynes.</p>
	<p pid="a.466.0/3">In the short time available, I want to do three things. First, I want to explain the unique problems that Milton Keynes faces in accessing broadband. Secondly, I want to look at the options and why they seem to be failing to deliver the solution. Finally, I want to consider what is required to deliver broadband throughout Milton Keynes.</p>
	<p pid="a.466.0/4">High-speed internet access and digital TV are two vital aspects of the information age and are directly linked. People who have access to such services will be better informed, better entertained and better employed. People who are left behind by the information age will be left behind, to an increasing extent, in modern life. Broadband is not just about game playing and video downloading; it is vital for the economic growth of Milton Keynes.</p>
	<p pid="a.466.0/5">Some residents and businesses in Milton Keynes still cannot get broadband at all. Some can get only an entry-level speed of 512 kilobits per second. It is particularly important for Milton Keynes to have an adequate data communications facility, because of the impact that it has on jobs. Both those who work in offices and professionals who work from home in the city and the rural community depend on data speeds that do not seem quaint and primitive to the rest of the country and the rest of the world.</p>
	<p pid="a.466.0/6">In Milton Keynes, we have a TV cable network that was the envy of the UK when it was built in the '60s and '70s. TV signals received on a big aerial were wired into every new home in the new city and in the rural community, together with some pioneering community TV channels. Although the original local channels were sadly short lived, I am delighted that the situation looks to be resolved when the much-wanted and much-needed MKTV is launched later this year.</p>
	<p pid="a.466.0/7">The original technology was modern for it time, but not future-proofed. The original cabling is old and incapable of providing internet. BT's telephone lines, the most popular way of accessing the internet, are now either too long or too narrow to support the technology. That problem is made worse by their routing around the grid squares in the city.</p>
	<p pid="a.466.0/8">A new digital TV distribution network, providing digital TV to every home that receives TV on a communal analogue cable, would also be able to carry high-speed broadband. A digital network does not care what the content is. One member of the household could be watching a documentary on BBC 9, while another could be surfing the web. Another could be buying a video from a streaming video provider to watch over the weekend, or making a video-conference webcast to another head office in another country. Those are all data that can educate, inform, entertain and help Milton Keynes's residents in both the city and the rural community.</p>
	<p pid="a.466.0/9">When the area was first developed, in recognition of the fact that houses did not need aerials and that aerials are pretty unsightly if they are not necessary, areas of the then rural community were developed with covenants and restrictions so that most homes are not allowed to put an aerial on the roof. The special problem for Milton Keynes is that if home owners are not allowed to put up their own aerials and the TV cabling throughout the city cannot transmit digital TV, local people will have a problem if and when analogue TV stops being transmitted. If the Government are committed to the digital information age being made available to all citizens, not just those with the finances to buy their own solution, that problem could be used to everybody's advantage.</p>
	<p pid="a.466.0/10">That is the problem that we face in Milton Keynes. It is appalling for a dynamic, prosperous, high-tech rural and city community. I want now to turn to some of the proposals and explain why, regrettably, there is concern that they may not provide the solution. To its credit, BT has done a good job of getting entry-level broadband to many parts of the unitary authority that two years ago could not get it, although some areas cannot get any broadband. However, most areas cannot get the speed that most people are clamouring for.</p>
	<p pid="a.466.0/11">BT is focusing on its 21st century network&mdash;21CN&mdash;programme, which replaces the old telephone wire infrastructure with fibre-optic technology. Understandably, BT does not want to invest any more in the old telephone cabling, but 21CN is a long-term programme that will not be rolled out in Milton Keynes until at least 2010. That is where the link to digital TV returns.</p>
	<p pid="a.466.0/12">If a digital community TV service were to be wired to every home in the city, it would resolve the problems that BT is struggling with, replacing the '60s technology with modern technology. That is much the same for the rural community, which will of course soon become city in Milton Keynes. We have the grid-road cabling ducts and, largely, the right technology in the exchanges. The link into each home seems to be solvable. However, what is missing, from BT's point of view, is any public money to rewire the main trunking networks across the unitary authority.</p>
	<p pid="a.466.0/13">Perhaps the residents should look to other providers. One of the frustrations locally is the plethora of advertisements from other companies offering broadband to residents. Seeing a potential solution, residents ring, only to be disappointed. In that process, called local loop unbundling, a third party company takes over a phone line from BT. In practice, they use the same telephone wires that BT used, so we are still stuck with no or slow broadband.</p>
	<p pid="a.466.0/14">Milton Keynes council has no direct responsibility to provide facilities for broadband, but it has been proactive in trying to find a wireless solution. I commend the council for that. However, the problem is that that technology, WiMAX, is still unproven. It is still being evaluated by the internet service providers. Although it is widely believed that wireless technology would be suited to the rural areas of Milton Keynes, it might not prove to be a Milton Keynes-wide solution and might not be appropriate for servicing large numbers of residents in higher-density areas.</p>
	<p pid="a.466.0/15">Before I look to the future, I want to mention Ofcom's involvement. There have been efforts to interest Ofcom in Milton Keynes's problems. However, the telecommunications regulator's remit for internet access is unimpressive. It simply has to ensure that all UK residents can get dial-up access at a speed of 28.8 kilobits per second&mdash;20 times slower than the slowest broadband. It seems incredible in 2006 that BT is not obliged to provide anything faster.</p>
	<p pid="a.466.0/16">I want to consider what might work in future. There is a strong belief that Milton Keynes's problems with broadband and digital TV can be resolved together. We need a credible, proven and sustainable alternative to BT in the form of a decent cable infrastructure. That would introduce real competition for the first time, spurring BT to raise its game. Such an infrastructure would require investment funding. The technology is nothing horrendous, merely an upgraded cable in an underground duct system that allows for technology changes. If it is replaceable, that will ensure that it is future-proof. If we make the ducts big enough, they can contain digital cable this year, optical fibre for the next 10 years and a future cable system beyond that.</p>
	<p pid="a.466.0/17">I have campaigned long and hard for &quot;I before E&quot;, or infrastructure before expansion, for Milton Keynes. Access to high-speed broadband is absolutely essential for a young, prosperous growing community that is the focus of the Government's sustainable communities project. I ask the Government to reconsider the specific issues faced by the community of Milton Keynes.</p>

	<p pid="a.470.0/1">The Minister is right that many farmers have been enterprising and have diversified, but I am sure that he would agree that there is a problem if farmers are too far from a telephone exchange to be able to access broadband. Satellite is one option, but it tends to be more expensive to run than working via a terrestrial line. Also, as we have heard, some functions are simply not possible via satellite.</p>
	<p pid="a.470.0/2">The Government, the Scottish Executive and the Welsh Assembly have, to their credit, invested large amounts of money, and I pay tribute to them for that. The money has mostly been given to BT and has meant that the vast majority of people in the country and the vast majority of businesses are able to access broadband. However, some businesses and people have missed out. As was pointed out, the success for the vast majority of people in the country does mean problems for the small number of people in remote areas who cannot access broadband.</p>
	<p pid="a.470.0/3">According to the official statistics, 99.6 to 99.7 per cent. of households could access broadband using some form of terrestrial technology available on the mass market. However, that leaves some 200,000 people behind and, as we have heard&mdash;I think that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1768" name="Stephen Crabb">the hon. Member for Preseli Pembrokeshire (Mr. Crabb)</phrase> was the first to raise this&mdash;the anecdotal evidence is that far more people than that cannot access broadband. Hon. Members have raised another important question: what exactly is the official definition of broadband? As I said, the anecdotal evidence is that more than 200,000 people have problems when trying to access broadband.</p>
	<p pid="a.470.0/4">I did some research. In November 2003, a representative of the regulator, which at that time was Oftel, appeared before the Trade and Industry Committee. At that time, Oftel defined broadband as</p>
	<p pid="a.470.0/5" class="indent">&quot;an always-on service with a minimum downstream capacity in excess of 128 kbit/s&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.470.0/6">Committee members expressed concern, as I am sure hon. Members will today, that 128 kilobits per second was far too low a transfer rate for a sensible definition of broadband. Research on the Ofcom website did not turn up a revision of the 128 definition. I shall therefore ask the Minister a question that other hon. Members have asked. Can he advise us what definition his Department uses to define broadband when it publishes its statistics showing that 99.7 per cent. of households can access broadband?</p>
	<p pid="a.470.0/7">People who cannot access broadband because they live too far away from a telephone exchange, whether there are 200,000 such people or more, should not be excluded from the modern digital age. Clearly, the market alone will not provide them with access. Without Government, Scottish Executive and Welsh Assembly intervention, there would not be as many enabled telephone exchanges as there are today. I think that, in Scotland, only one telephone exchange has still to be enabled. Despite that, at least 200,000 people do not have access. As I said, the market alone will not provide, so Government intervention is required.</p>
	<p pid="a.470.0/8">Previous generations brought roads, public transport, electricity and telephones to remote rural areas. Broadband, because of the education and employment opportunities that it brings, is not a luxury but an essential tool for the 21st century. I therefore look forward to the Minister's reply. I hope that he will say that the Government will sit down with the telecoms industry&mdash;obviously, that is mainly BT, but there are other telecom providers&mdash;and the regulator to try to come up with a solution that will make broadband available to all in Britain, no matter where they live.</p>

	<p pid="a.471.0/1">I, too, congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1948" name="Paul Goodman">my hon. Friend the Member for Wycombe (Mr. Goodman)</phrase> on securing the debate and on the extremely thoughtful and thorough way in which he introduced it. We would all agree that it has been wide ranging. We have dealt with issues facing some of the most rural parts of these islands and have discussed how similar issues affect even the outskirts of some of our major new cities, such as Milton Keynes. We have even touched on broadband access in Mozambique, so we have covered global matters in a rural affairs debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.471.0/2">More importantly, the debate has been well informed. I hope that the Minister will accept that my hon. Friends' comments do not in any way seek to undermine the villages or rural communities in their constituencies. Rather, those comments arise from a passion to ensure that those communities are well represented. I believe that my hon. Friends won their seats&mdash;gained them, in many cases&mdash;because they had shown themselves to be doughty champions of those rural communities, standing up for and promoting them when they were doing good things, but not shying away from issues when they saw things that needed to be improved.</p>
	<p pid="a.471.0/3">The 2006 UK broadband report, covering April to September 2005, stated that broadband is available to 99.7 per cent. of the UK, covering both residential and business users. That percentage means that one and a half constituencies in this country are not covered at all, which puts the issue in context. Listening to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1768" name="Stephen Crabb">my hon. Friend the Member for Preseli Pembrokeshire (Mr. Crabb)</phrase>, I wondered whether his was the one. Overall, however, we recognise how much has been done, although a quite significant element remains to be covered.</p>
	<p pid="a.471.0/4">The increase in coverage is largely a result of BT's commitment to increasing coverage to 99.6 per cent. of households by the summer of 2005. We all pay tribute to BT for achieving as much as it has. The comments in the debate should be seen in that context: we all recognise how much has been achieved, but attention needs to be given to what remains to be done.</p>
	<p pid="a.471.0/5">Partnerships involving local government, the Northern Ireland Assembly, the Scottish Parliament and the Welsh Assembly dealing with British Telecom to enable all exchanges have resulted in improved coverage in sparsely populated areas, and that has been achieved quicker than might have been expected. BT reports that that leaves just 80,000 telephone lines in remote areas without broadband access.</p>
	<p pid="a.471.0/6">As my hon. Friend the Member for Wycombe said, broadband services are provided by one of three means: satellite or wireless; cable operators using the cable television network; and BT over its telephone lines. As he also said, however, there are concerns about whether satellite-based broadband services will be able to support new uses of the internet, specifically teleconferencing, telephony and video games. Perhaps the Minister can confirm the situation in that regard and the long-term picture.</p>
	<p pid="a.471.0/7">As my hon. Friend also said, cable operators in such a profit-conscious sector of the industry are unlikely to expand their coverage to 100 per cent. of rural areas owing to the lack of return available to them. It is therefore left to BT to complete the 100 per cent. coverage of UK communities, as it has committed to doing. We should recognise that the British record in rolling out broadband is certainly a good one, as the Minister reminded us. It compares extremely well with other nations, and Britain has one of the most developed broadband services anywhere in the world, probably including Mozambique, although it may lag behind some in terms of cost and speed. We have also heard that the very success of the British record puts those without broadband access at a distinct disadvantage. During the quarter ending in September 2005, broadband connections totalled 8.9 million, which marked a 12 per cent. increase in new subscriptions over the previous quarter and a 25 per cent. increase since the end of March 2005.</p>
	<p pid="a.471.0/8">We all recognise that information communication technology has a vital part to play as part of the Lisbon strategy in making Europe the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world. However, for that to happen, we must ensure that rural communities are not left out.</p>
	<p pid="a.471.0/9">British Telecom states that in my county of East Sussex 99.8 per cent. of households now have access to broadband. Through a public-private partnership, East Sussex county council has promoted the advantages of broadband and achieved 28.1 per cent. take-up in September. It is forecast to achieve 30 per cent. by December, which is ahead of the 28 per cent target for the end of this year. I hope that the Minister will accept that it is no wonder that that Conservative-controlled county council has received national awards for its highly successful programme, especially when the broadband take-up just 18 months ago was a mere 5 per cent. Just as we have been willing to accept what the Government have done, I hope that he will be willing to recognise what a Conservative county council has achieved. However, highly commendable as the figures are, they show that a small minority in my constituency, as in those of other hon. Members, continues to be left out.</p>
	<p pid="a.471.0/10">Serious concerns have rightly been raised about rural communities that do not have access to good internet services. It is harder for rural communities that lack good internet access to attract and retain jobs. The report following the symposium on remote and rural communications was published in June 2005. The symposium found that because of their location remote and rural areas had a high demand for communications services. It also found that there was a strong perception of the digital divide between urban and rural areas. It questioned how quick the trickle-down effect of the benefits of service innovation would be to rural areas. There was concern that more remote communities would always be in catch-up mode with their urban counterparts.</p>
	<p pid="a.471.0/11">The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs looked at broadband in rural areas, and its 2005 report, &quot;ICT in England's Rural Economies&quot; concluded that the</p>
	<p pid="a.471.0/12" class="indent">&quot;lack of availability had been the key barrier to adoption for broadband in rural areas&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.471.0/13">Among businesses with internet access, 60 per cent. use broadband in urban areas, whereas only 41 per cent. do so in rural areas. There is a significant disparity in usage. The report found that rural businesses are playing catch-up now that broadband is more widely available and that the perception of broadband availability appears to be lagging behind the reality in rural areas.</p>
	<p pid="a.471.0/14">However, it is clear that broadband connectivity speeds are lower in rural areas, with businesses being more likely to use basic broadband services. Of urban business broadband users, 63 per cent. have connectivity rates faster than 512 kilobits per second, whereas that is the case for only 37 per cent. of rural businesses. When the Minister replies, I should be grateful if he would relate that to compliance with the Disability Discrimination Act 1995, which clearly requires people to be given greater access to all services. Last weekend, I viewed the work being done by a company in my constituency. Internet Architects have been doing fantastic work for the National Trust, enabling it to comply with the legislation by providing virtual tours of some of its properties. However, if people do not have access to broadband, they cannot download virtual tours. Perhaps the Minister will explain what has happened about compliance under the disability discrimination laws.</p>
	<p pid="a.471.0/15">There is clearly a different picture in different parts of the country. Northern Ireland was the first region in Europe to have 100 per cent. broadband coverage. The Northern Ireland experience resulted in tangible results on the economy and on jobs, including teleworking, and there were particular benefits for female and part-time workers and for carers.</p>
	<p pid="a.471.0/16">Scotland has achieved similar success. As we have heard, the Scottish Executive undertook an open procurement exercise, which aimed to deliver affordable broadband access to every Scottish community by the end of 2005. Only one small area is outstanding. The strategy saw the Scottish population's access to affordable broadband rise from 43 per cent. at the launch to more than 93 per cent. in February 2005. We should recognise that that covers some of the most remote parts of the United Kingdom.</p>
	<p pid="a.471.0/17">If Scotland and Northern Ireland have achieved 100 per cent. coverage, the coverage in England must be lower than the 99.7 per cent. achieved throughout the country as a whole. We heard about progress in Wales from <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1444" name="Roger Williams">the hon. Member for Brecon and Radnorshire (Mr. Williams)</phrase> and from <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1506" name="David Jones">my hon. Friend the Member for Clwyd, West (Mr. Jones)</phrase>. We heard about the progress, but my hon. Friend the Member for Preseli Pembrokeshire stated clearly that significant improvements are needed.</p>
	<p pid="a.471.0/18">I have sympathy with <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1696" name="Philip Dunne">the comments made by my hon. Friends the Members for Preseli Pembrokeshire and for Ludlow (Mr. Dunne)</phrase> that it is not good enough to apply for broadband with all the headache and heartache that goes with that only to be told later that it will not be possible. People want certainty and to know that when they start on the process, they will be told what the situation really is. We should all try to ensure that people have greater certainty of what is available to them.</p>
	<p pid="a.471.0/19">Currently, 69 per cent. of UK firms use broadband and 30 per cent. of micro-businesses trade online. Approximately 73 per cent. of businesses provide information about products and services online. That will increase significantly when the Company Law Reform Bill comes into effect.</p>
	<p pid="a.471.0/20">My hon. Friend the Member for Wycombe, who opened the debate, identified the key issues. What analysis has the Minister made of where those rural communities without broadband access are concentrated, and what is his Department doing to assist broadband provision in rural areas? What role does he see for the key players&mdash;regional development authorities, Openreach, Ofcom and the Department of Trade and Industry&mdash;in addressing the issues, and what can he do to bring them together to move that forward?</p>
	<p pid="a.471.0/21">The Minister will be well aware that our rural communities are going through a period of transition. Old businesses, such as pubs, shops and garages, are closing, but exciting and dynamic new businesses are opening up, including voluntary organisations. That successful transition depends on having access to the most advanced technology available. If those businesses are to compete and operate effectively, they need broadband access quickly. I hope that the Minister will explain how that can happen.</p>
	<p pid="a.471.0/22">My hon. Friend the Member for Ludlow quoted from a letter from the Minister on <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-24">24 January</phrase> which said:</p>
	<p pid="a.471.0/23" class="indent">&quot;Stimulating broadband availability across the whole of the UK is a Government priority. We want to see all communities, irrespective of location, having access to an affordable broadband service from a competitive market.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.471.0/24">I hope that the Minister can tell us now how he plans to achieve that goal.</p>

	<p pid="a.476.1/1">I have said that I will respond to any point, and to supplementary points from individuals, but I want to cover as many of the questions as I can.</p>
	<p pid="a.476.1/2">A question was asked about the breakdown of the 99 per cent. figure. I understand that the BT claim refers to UK households connected to enabled exchanges. A question was raised about public money going to BT. Where that has happened, it has happened as a result of competitive tendering to upgrade facilities that BT considered not to be economically viable. It is also important to acknowledge that many factors, such as home wiring, can affect performance of digital subscriber lines, which provide DSL broadband access.</p>
	<p pid="a.476.1/3">In relation to the questions asked by the hon. Member for Wycombe in his introduction, the problem is that there is no detailed analysis of the 0.2 per cent. figure to which we both referred, except in the region-by-region analysis of what is thought to be the nature of the problem. The matter only comes to light when a request for a DSL is attempted, and it is discovered that the line is one of the few that has a problem.</p>
	<p pid="a.476.1/4">On the commitment of the DTI, we are leading the broadband debate. We are pursuing solutions with operators and we greatly welcome the sort of interest expressed by hon. Members today. Once we get past the national and regional issues, the matter often amounts drilling down to discover where the specific problems are&mdash;they may be in an individual line or a very small locality&mdash;and finding solutions to them.</p>
	<p pid="a.476.1/5">Regional development agencies and devolved Administrations have supported a variety of projects such as Fibrespeed in Wales, Cybermoor, Digital Region and Actnow in Cornwall, to which I referred earlier. Actnow was a particular success story that received objective 1 funding and experienced another of the consequences of success, when villages just outside the defined area for the pilot project got very aerated about the fact that they were not involved and campaigned to be included. In the end, a much bigger area was enabled without additional expenditure and there was a considerable extension of take-up, which is one of the reasons why BT realised there was a bigger market than had been anticipated in some of the low-population rural areas.</p>
	<p pid="a.476.1/6">RDA, devolved Administration and local government intervention requires careful consideration of the impact in relation to market failure. We should not invest money if the market is able to supply the service, but on the other hand, it is appropriate to invest where there are clear market failures. Indeed, organisations such as the Scottish Parliament and Welsh Assembly have identified such places as appropriate ones in which to intervene.</p>
	<p pid="a.476.1/7"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1960" name="Alan Reid">The hon. Member for Argyll and Bute (Mr. Reid)</phrase> asked about the figures given by the Countryside Alliance. I am afraid that it is beyond my remit to answer for the Countryside Alliance, an organisation which, as we know from its public opinion surveys, is arithmetically challenged in the extreme. As far as I am aware, there are no figures that provide the answer to the question, so I have no clue where the Countryside&mdash;</p>

	<p pid="a.478.1/1">When I applied for this debate on the acute water scarcity that we in Kent face, I said to myself, &quot;I guarantee from the moment this debate is granted, the heavens are going to open,&quot; which they promptly did. I am glad that the debate has achieved at least one thing, a short period of rainfall in Kent, but I should like to make it clear to the House and to the Minister that the limited amount of rain in the past few days will make no material difference to the serious water supply situation that we face in our county.</p>
	<p pid="a.478.1/2">The water supply situation in Britain varies enormously from region to region. As we know, the region that is facing much the most serious situation is the south-east, following two exceptionally dry winters. Last month's Environment Agency publication, &quot;Drought prospects 2006&quot;, stated:</p>
	<p pid="a.478.1/3" class="indent">&quot;Across south east England, rainfall over the last 16 months has been much lower than for the same period in 1974&ndash;76, and in some places it is the lowest since 1921. Continued dry weather through the spring and into the summer would give us one of the most serious droughts of the last hundred years.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.478.1/4">Last month, the Environment Agency called on all water companies in the south-east to introduce hosepipe bans. The agency's chief executive, Barbara Young, gave a dire and serious warning on <phrase class="date" code="2006-02-24">24 February</phrase>. She said:</p>
	<p pid="a.478.1/5" class="indent">&quot;If water companies delay introducing hosepipe bans now, extreme steps to manage water supplies over the summer may be needed, such as standpipes and rota cuts.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.478.1/6">This week, the largest water supply company in the south-east and indeed in Britain, Thames Water, with 8 million customers, announced an indefinite ban on hosepipes and sprinklers from <phrase class="date" code="">3 April</phrase>. It is the first such ban that the company has had to announce for 15 years, indicating the severity of the situation in its area.</p>
	<p pid="a.478.1/7">If the water supply situation is bad in the south-east in general, it is worst of all in Kent and some areas of Sussex. They are in the worst position in the worst affected region. The briefing note that Southern Water supplied to me for this debate illustrates the position in Kent and at the Bewl reservoir, which is very close to my constituency. The briefing says:</p>
	<p pid="a.478.1/8" class="indent">&quot;Bewl Water, the largest reservoir in the South East, which provides water to Southern Water, Mid Kent and indirectly to South East Water is only 53 per cent. full (this is the lowest level it has ever been this time of the year), normally, we would expect it to be 97 per cent. full at this time of year.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.478.1/9">The largest reservoir in Kent and in the south-east is effectively only half full&mdash;unprecedentedly low.</p>
	<p pid="a.478.1/10">The aquifer position is no better. Southern Water's briefing says:</p>
	<p pid="a.478.1/11" class="indent">&quot;Groundwater levels in the major aquifers in the South East of England, which support approximately 70 per cent. of public water abstraction are all below average. Some are approaching historic minimum levels.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.478.1/12">In addition, the position in the eastern part of the county has been well reported. Folkestone and Dover Water Services has had to become the first water company in Britain to apply for and receive &quot;water scarcity status&quot; under the Water Industry Act 1999. The Government have granted it, enabling Folkestone and Dover Water Services to become the first company to introduce to its area compulsory water metering. It clearly demonstrates the severity of the situation that we face in the south-east and, particularly, in Kent.</p>
	<p pid="a.478.1/13">I should like to raise several issues with the Minister. First, we have had two exceptionally dry winters in succession. During the winter months, the crucial restoration and replenishment of water supply to reservoirs and aquifers is due. There is an important question to pose to the Government and the water companies, to which it is crucial to obtain the right answer&mdash;as can best be foreseen. We have effectively experienced a semi-drought in Kent and parts of the south-east during the past 18 months. Is it freak, one-off climate change, or is it evidence of a long-term and more permanent move to more arid conditions in the south-east and Kent as a result of climate change?</p>
	<p pid="a.478.1/14">Day by day, as the evidence is constantly and rightly put before us, we all see that the predictions about the rate of climate change have if anything been understatements. The rate at which, for example, the Greenland ice cap is melting exceeds almost everybody's previous predictions.</p>
	<p pid="a.478.1/15">It is demonstrable that, with Kent's existing water resources, we are already at the tipping point of standpipes and rota cuts. That is after just two winters of semi-drought. If that is the position after just two winters, we are wholly inadequately prepared for something that will continue for a much longer period. Its potentially extraordinarily serious consequences may not be too far around the corner for people living in Kent and elsewhere in the south-east.</p>
	<p pid="a.478.1/16">From the scientific and meteorological advice that the Minister receives, what is the best judgment about the climate change that Kent has experienced during the past 18 months? Is it a one-off situation that is likely to reverse, or is it evidence of a much more permanent climate situation in the south-east and Kent? There will be serious consequences if it is the latter.</p>
	<p pid="a.478.1/17">The second issue that I want to raise with the Minister is about the relationship between water supply in Kent and the Government's plans for development, particularly residential development, in the county. The Government want to carry out a major expansion of population in the south-east. It is a controversial decision that a number of us contest strongly. The position as of today is that, at the Government's instigation, the South East England regional assembly has approved in principle 578,000 new homes in Kent, Surrey, Sussex, Berkshire, Hampshire, Oxfordshire and the Thames gateway by 2026. Many questions are being asked in Kent and elsewhere about whether the water supply is adequate to support that huge population influx.</p>
	<p pid="a.478.1/18">The Minister made a water-focused visit to Essex recently&mdash;on <phrase class="date" code="2006-02-09">9 February</phrase>, I think. He visited a new house in Heybridge, which apparently had water-saving fittings. He said that the Government's plans for hundreds of thousands of new properties would still go ahead. Therefore, I must ask him the following question: if with the existing population in Kent and elsewhere in the south-east we are already on the tipping edge of having standpipes and rota cuts, how on earth will the south-east be able to cope with 500,000 more houses&mdash;the figure is of course substantially higher if one adds up the extra adults and children? How are we going to cope in water terms with the huge development expansion that the Government propose? I see no sense at all in concentrating such a huge additional residential development in the driest part of our country, when the water position is already very serious.</p>
	<p pid="a.478.1/19">The next issue I wish to raise is regional disparities in the United Kingdom. I understand that moving large quantities of water about is an expensive and difficult business; it is much more problematic than moving around electricity and even gas. However, there are great regional disparities in respect of water. What are the Government's policies for gradually removing those disparities, for establishing what would effectively be some sort of national water grid, and for putting in place the infrastructure to enable water to be moved about more freely between different regions? That would create greater equality of treatment and fairness for water customers in the different regions of Britain.</p>
	<p pid="a.478.1/20">I turn now to capacity and, so far as Kent is concerned, to the issue of reservoirs in particular. We need additional capacity in Kent, or additional capacity that is accessible from Kent. For this debate, I went through the ever-growing files in my office on water supply, and I came across a leaflet that was produced 15 years ago&mdash;in December 1991. It is entitled, &quot;Water for the future in Kent; development plans&quot;. It was a summary leaflet for public consumption produced by the consulting engineers to three of the leading water companies in Kent. They were looking into the future of water supply in Kent on behalf of Mid Kent Water, Southern Water and what was then called the Folkestone and District Water Company and is now called Folkestone and Dover Water Services.</p>
	<p pid="a.478.1/21">In the section referring to the then proposed major new reservoir development at Broad Oak, that 15-year-old leaflet stated:</p>
	<p pid="a.478.1/22" class="indent">&quot;The promotion of Broad Oak water will be continued. No other major resource has been identified which will meet the remaining water supply needs in the companies' areas economically for the next 30 years.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.478.1/23">It continued, extraordinarily prophetically:</p>
	<p pid="a.478.1/24" class="indent">&quot;Water supply from Broad Oak water will be needed between 2000 and 2005&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.478.1/25">That was bang on the nail. The reality is that no progress whatever has been made in bringing into being Broad Oak water&mdash;or, indeed, in establishing other major additional reservoir capacity in Kent. What is the Government's position on establishing further reservoir capacity in Kent, on Broad Oak, and on the plans that I believe exist for increasing the capacity of Bewl, which is one of the largest reservoirs we have?</p>
	<p pid="a.478.1/26">My next topic is desalination. You might be as amazed as I am, Mr. Jones, that I have to raise that matter. It is extraordinary to me that in our country, which over the years has produced more jokes about rainfall than any other country, we should now be having to talk about desalination plants in the UK. I know from the briefing I had from South East Water that it is now running a trial desalination plant on the Sussex coast. What is the Government's position on going down the desalination route? Is that now thought to be necessary to ensure that we have adequate water supplies? It is costly, but there is huge potential capacity in desalinating the sea to produce fresh water.</p>
	<p pid="a.478.1/27">On compulsory metering, Folkestone and Dover Water Services now has water scarcity status, which enables it to introduce compulsory water metering. Does the Minister think that all the water companies in Kent and elsewhere in the south-east should be going down that route? Is he positively soliciting applications from the water companies to his Department? Are the Government in favour now of introducing compulsory water metering in the south-east generally? What steps do they propose to take to ensure that those on low incomes&mdash;pensioners and low-income families&mdash;are able to get assistance with the installation of water meters if they are made compulsory as a result of their water company being given water scarcity status?</p>
	<p pid="a.478.1/28">We all know that one of the most effective ways of increasing water capacity is by stopping the water leaking into the ground and disappearing for good, but a substantial amount of leakage still takes place. However, there is always a cost-benefit equation in respect of leaks; some leaks are so small that the cost of stemming them is too great for it to make sense to spend the money to do so. How well&mdash;or otherwise&mdash;does the Minister think the water companies in Kent are doing in terms of leaks? Inevitably, when one asks the water companies about their leaks programmes and whether they are doing all they can to stop leaks, they all reply, &quot;Well, we're busting our guts to deal with leaks.&quot; That is of course the company position, and one would expect the company's representatives to repeat it, but does the Minister think that the Kent water companies are doing all they reasonably can to deal with leaks? If not, it would be helpful if he were to identify which of the companies are not doing sufficiently well and could do more.</p>
	<p pid="a.478.1/29">I also have a few comments to make on changing lifestyles. We all have a responsibility to try to conserve water. I was struck by one amazing statistic from South East Water: if all 19 million customers in south-east England turned off the tap when they brushed their teeth, we would save 380 million litres of water every day. I found that statistic staggering; I trust that South East Water has it right. It illustrates how, with a relatively small change of lifestyle, we could make the water available go much further. I should like to know what support and publicity the Government are prepared to put behind making the lifestyle changes necessary to make water go further.</p>
	<p pid="a.478.1/30">In conclusion, we face a serious situation in Kent. It would be totally unacceptable if later this year we turned on the taps in Kent and found that nothing was coming out, if people were made to go to standpipes to collect water for their homes and if mains water were switched off by rota for several hours. My constituents and many others would think the Government extraordinarily incompetent in allowing such a situation to arise, and I would have every sympathy with that view.</p>
