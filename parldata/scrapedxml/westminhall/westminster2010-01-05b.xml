	<p pid="b.1.1/1" class="italic">Motion made, and Question proposed, That the sitting be now adjourned.-(Mr. Frank Roy.)</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2010-01-05b.1.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1749" speakername="Bill Olner" colnum="1"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm100105/halltext/100105h0001.htm#1001053000483">
	<p pid="b.1.2/1">Members will be aware that our colleague, David Taylor, died suddenly over the Christmas period. David was not only a member of the Chairmen's Panel who chaired Westminster Hall, but an assiduous contributor to debates in this Chamber, so before we begin the first debate, I ask you all to stand for a moment of silence in his memory.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2010-01-05b.1.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1697" speakername="Kelvin Hopkins" colnum="1"  time="009:31:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm100105/halltext/100105h0001.htm#1001053000484">
	<p pid="b.1.3/1">I would like to add my own comments on the tragic death of David Taylor. He was not only a great member of our party, but a great socialist and a personal friend, whom I shall miss greatly.</p>
	<p pid="b.1.3/2">Leaving that sadness to one side, may I say how much I enjoy serving under your chairmanship again, Mr. Olner, and wish you and everyone else a happy new year? It will obviously be an interesting year politically, and it is a novel experience to make the first speech of the new year in this Chamber.</p>
	<p pid="b.1.3/3">I welcome the opportunity to initiate the debate and would like to make several important points that I believe need to be highlighted and acted upon. What I will say is intended to reflect and support the campaign mounted by the TUC and Unison on the issue-hon. Members might be aware that I am a joint co-ordinator of the Unison parliamentary group. I acknowledge that since I requested the debate, my hon. Friend the Minister has accepted in full the recommendations made by Sir Roger Singleton. However, it is necessary to note that the scope of the Singleton report was specific. The review covered only those who volunteer with children, but of course the current definition of frequency applies to both children and vulnerable adults, whom, as I am sure that the Minister will agree, should be equally protected.</p>
	<p pid="b.1.3/4">I must place it on record that the trade unions and other professional bodies involved in protecting vulnerable adults and children strongly endorse the principle of public protection. The terrible events at Soham and other cases in recent years have demonstrated that case to be unquestionable. However, several issues raised by the creation of the Independent Safeguarding Authority and its impact on working people need careful consideration.</p>
	<p pid="b.1.3/5">The Minister will be fully aware, as we all are, that the public debate has understandably been dominated by high-profile media coverage-perhaps rather populist in tone-of the impact of the ISA scheme on voluntary groups such as scouts and local football clubs. Although those groups play a valuable-or even essential role-and are vital to society and local communities, much less coverage has been given to the impact of the scheme on the caring professions and public services, and the many thousands who entered their vocations in those professions and services to protect and assist the vulnerable and children, especially. It is that specific dimension of the debate that I wish to address today.</p>
	<p pid="b.1.3/6">I am sure that hon. Members agree that the public will be best protected by a system that is risk-based and proportionate, and that addressing such issues intelligently will have a positive impact. I wish to highlight substantive concerns relating to ISA that trade unions and other professional bodies have raised.</p>
	<p pid="b.1.3/7">Several concerns have been brought to my attention by the TUC coalition, which has been working to develop a constructive response to the ISA scheme. I understand that a productive meeting took place with my hon. Friend the Minister early in November, which was attended by, among others, Dave Prentis, the general secretary of Unison. Three key issues were raised at the meeting, the first of which was the cost of registration and the impact that it might have on low-paid or part-time staff, particularly women.</p>
	<p pid="b.1.3/8">The second concern was about the duplication of registration for a number of individuals who are already on a professional register, such as nurses, midwives, doctors, social workers and teachers, all of whom are required to maintain a professional registration as a condition of their employment.</p>
	<p pid="b.1.3/9">The final issue raised was the lack of an appeals process under the current legislation. Although individuals can appeal to the Care Standards Tribunal, as things stand that can be done only on a point of law or fact. The tribunal is not allowed to hear evidence on appropriateness, which can be challenged only by judicial review.</p>
	<p pid="b.1.3/10">I shall address each of those points in turn. To appoint someone to a post that allows them to work with or have access to vulnerable adults or children, an employer, organisation or individual must first ensure that they meet the knowledge requirements and possess the skills for the post. People are also subject to a criminal record check for all relevant employment posts. Unison and the TUC are calling for the costs of registration to be borne by the employer as part of its recruitment costs. The Home Office has indicated that that is, in any case, a one-off cost, as monitoring will then be ongoing for all employees. That being the case, it is reasonable and appropriate that employers fund the associated registration costs. If an employer is securing the services of an individual, surely ensuring their safety and suitability to be in that working environment should be included within its recruitment costs.</p>
	<p pid="b.1.3/11">All the trade union organisations have expressed concern about registration fees' impact on individuals. In particular, Unison has questioned why a school meals cook or catering assistant working a few shifts a week should pay the same registration fee as a head teacher. That is surely unfair and inequitable by any standards. It is too early to assess the future impact on services, but we could, for example, face the spectacle of an individual having to pay to register so that they may serve school children their meals, but not facing such requirements in a local supermarket canteen. In those circumstances, an individual might choose to work in a supermarket and not apply to work in schools, to the detriment of the school meals service and contrary to the individual's initial preferences.</p>
	<p pid="b.1.3/12">Robust arguments have been put to me by the TUC coalition and Unison about the impact on those who are already on a professional register yet will have to register with both ISA and their professional regulator. With the current proposals, under the definition of &quot;harm&quot;, the professional regulators could spend more time referring cases to ISA than investigating them and taking professional decisions on whether a person should remain on the register. I understand that several regulators have expressed similar concerns about the impact that the ISA process will have on their fitness-to-practise processes.</p>
	<p pid="b.1.3/13">To illustrate that point, I shall refer to a relevant case, which has been provided to me by Unison, of a nurse working in a mental health trust who, in restraining a service user, used a control and restraint technique that caused bruising. The service user complained and stated that the use of the technique breached their human rights and caused them harm. They also made a written complaint to the regulator, the Nursing and Midwifery Council. Having investigated and referred the case to a fitness-to-practise hearing, the panel concluded that although the use of control was appropriate, the nurse did not use the correct technique as their training was not current. The panel therefore decided to issue the nurse with a one-year caution and recommended updating their control and restraint training.</p>
	<p pid="b.1.3/14">As the examples and definition of harm issued by ISA are so broad, however, that case would now also have to be referred to the authority. ISA would then consider all the information and might write to the person indicating its intention to place them on the banned list. The nurse would then have eight weeks to submit a statement to put forward their case. Their only opportunity to challenge appropriateness at that stage would be via judicial review. However, if the allegation was more serious, a judicial review at that stage would prevent ISA from concluding its decision, thus placing the individual concerned on the banned list.</p>
	<p pid="b.1.3/15">In seeking to find a viable solution to the potential dilemma, Unison and the TUC have suggested a slight change to the appeal process that would enable the Care Standards Tribunal to hear all the evidence, including that relating to appropriateness. That would not cause delay to the ISA decision-making process, but ensure that any person whose livelihood would be taken away from them had the opportunity to seek redress and challenge and examine all the evidence. Indeed, Unison and the TUC have also suggested that any person who was on a professional register should have their case heard and concluded by the relevant professional regulator first. Each of the regulators would jointly agree with ISA a protocol for referring relevant cases. That would avoid the current duplication, enable the case to be heard and all the material facts to be considered and taken into account, and allow decisions to be made and conclusions reached more quickly and efficiently.</p>
	<p pid="b.1.3/16">The Royal College of Nursing, in particular, has added its own emphasis to the need for a right to a fair hearing for individuals. Currently, appeals and hearings can be only paper-based and, as I said earlier, made only on a point of fact or law. The RCN believes that that breaches the European convention on human rights. It also emphasises the unnecessary duplication of registration that I referred to earlier, and is concerned that there is a lack of clarity surrounding how ISA will work alongside professional regulators such as the Nursing and Midwifery Council. The RCN believes that that could lead to conflicting decisions being made by the two bodies.</p>
	<p pid="b.1.3/17">As I said at the beginning of my speech, the TUC coalition and all its constituent organisations support the principle of public protection. However, several requirements proposed by the legislation might have a negative impact if regulators become weighed down with a 20-page referral form and are unable to meet their statutory obligation of public protection. The public can best be protected by a risk-based and proportionate system, and addressing these issues will have a positive impact and measurably improve statutory requirements and the safeguarding system, which, in other respects, are both necessary and appropriate. I look forward to hearing the comments of other hon. Members and what I hope will be a positive response from my hon. Friend the Minister.</p>

	<p pid="b.4.0/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1697" name="Kelvin Hopkins">the Member for Luton, North (Kelvin Hopkins)</phrase> on securing this important debate-although I am sure he was not hoping that it would be the first debate of the day, at 9.30 on our first day back. It is an important debate, and there has already been a great deal of discussion about the scheme.</p>
	<p pid="b.4.0/2">Inevitably, after the Soham murders, everyone supports the principle of safe and effective public protection and welcomes the steps being taken by the Government to improve safeguarding and to protect children and vulnerable adults. That support is still very strong, but as people have had the opportunity to look at the details of the vetting and barring scheme, concerns have inevitably come to the fore, particularly among those people who work with such issues every day.</p>
	<p pid="b.4.0/3">I am pleased that the Government have already acted to make the scheme less burdensome and more proportionate. For instance, it makes absolute sense to exempt children's authors, sportspeople and, in my constituency, ceramic artists who go into schools to work with children and inspire them; they should not be subject to burdensome regulations under the scheme. I am pleased that 16 to 18-year-olds who help out in schools or sports organisations will also be exempt. That makes absolute sense, because we do not want to do anything that would deny those young people the great opportunity of sharing their skills with younger pupils or other people. Good sense has also prevailed in respect of parents making private arrangements to care for each other's children. It was crazy to have a situation in which a police officer was told that looking after another police officer's children was somehow breaking the rules. Clearly, that makes no sense at all, and such people will not be affected in the future.</p>
	<p pid="b.4.0/4">However, there is a group of parents-the 40,000 parents who home educate their children-who are up in arms about the extra checks that they will face in the future under the Badman report. That issue does not come directly within the scope of this debate, but it is part of what is, perhaps, the over-protection of children, and part of the difficult process of striking the right balance in keeping children safe without being unduly burdensome, bureaucratic or invasive. Many of those parents, who are doing a fantastic job educating their children at home, feel that the hand of the law on their shoulder suggesting that perhaps their own children are at risk is not acceptable, and I agree with them. We have to get the balance right.</p>
	<p pid="b.4.0/5">Volunteers and the voluntary sector play an important and increasing role in our communities, so I am delighted that volunteers will not have to pay the ISA registration fee. I am a volunteer myself, with a fantastic charity called Rudyard Sailability. We work with disabled children and adults, and I am delighted that that charity will not have the extra burden of having to pay the fee. However, I remember that the process of having my Criminal Records Bureau check done was very bureaucratic. It put a great burden on the gentleman who dealt with that on behalf of the charity, and I would be worried if this check created such burdens for voluntary sector organisations, whether they be disabled sailing charities such as mine, sports clubs or churches.</p>
	<p pid="b.4.0/6">I hope that the ISA process will not overburden such organisations. They would much rather spend their energies dealing with their client groups and giving them the good time that they want to give them, rather than filling in forms. It is important that we get this right and do not alienate volunteers. They will not have to pay the charge, but obviously they give their time freely, and if that time is taken up with form-filling, it will not be as attractive an option as working with vulnerable client groups.</p>
	<p pid="b.4.0/7">I, too, am a member of the public sector union Unison. I should like to discuss some of the issues that my hon. Friend the Member for Luton, North addressed. I believe that many MPs have come across cases of people who could not fully take up employment because their CRB check had not been done. That is worrying, particularly for someone in their first job. They want to start off well, but they are prevented from taking up their post because the CRB check has not come through, perhaps for a purely bureaucratic reason-the papers might have been lost. It has nothing to do with the individual applicant, but if the CRB check takes a long time to come through, it begins to reflect on the applicant. I do not want the same thing to happen with the ISA checks.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2010-01-05b.5.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1697" speakername="Kelvin Hopkins" colnum="5"  time="009:41:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm100105/halltext/100105h0001.htm#1001053000486">
	<p pid="b.5.0/1">My hon. Friend talks about delays in CRB checks, and I am sure that other hon. Members have come across that problem in other circumstances. I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister will find ways of ensuring that CRB checks are undertaken quickly, and that explanations are given if there are delays.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2010-01-05b.5.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1834" speakername="Charlotte Atkins" colnum="5"  time="009:41:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm100105/halltext/100105h0001.htm#1001053000487">
	<p pid="b.5.1/1">My hon. Friend is absolutely right. Although the CRB check is a totally independent process, people get worried if there is a delay, and it appears to reflect on the individual. Clearly, it does not, but people who are starting a new job want to make a good impression, so it is important that the process is properly carried out. I do not expect the Minister to tell me at this point how long she expects the ISA checks to take, but it is vital that they are done quickly; otherwise, we will create a huge bureaucratic merry-go-round, which we do not want.</p>
	<p pid="b.5.1/2">Many individuals are already subject to professional registration, and it seems over the top for people who have had to go through that process also to have to go through the ISA scheme. I understand that the new ISA scheme will duplicate the existing regulation of public protection for almost 4 million workers-a huge proportion of the estimated 11 million who will be covered under that scheme. Surely, this does not make any sense.</p>
	<p pid="b.5.1/3">I turn now to the cost of registration to the individual. Individuals in paid employment will effectively be subsidising the voluntary sector. I am in favour of that, but I am worried because the fee in England and Wales will be &#163;64, which in anyone's book is a substantial sum-it will be &#163;58 in Northern Ireland-that is hugely higher than the original estimate of just &#163;20. That is a huge burden for a low-paid part-time cook, for instance. The school cooks in my local schools do a fantastic job. I do not want to see their skills diluted in any way.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2010-01-05b.6.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1697" speakername="Kelvin Hopkins" colnum="6"  time="009:41:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm100105/halltext/100105h0001.htm#1001053000488">
	<p pid="b.6.0/1">I thank my hon. Friend for emphasising this important point about costs, which will have a differential effect on people from different social classes. In a constituency such as mine with a number of people on low incomes, the cost will act as a disincentive to volunteering, whereas it will mean little in a more affluent town where &#163;64 is pocket money and pocket change. My hon. Friend has emphasised this point correctly.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2010-01-05b.6.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1834" speakername="Charlotte Atkins" colnum="6"  time="009:41:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm100105/halltext/100105h0001.htm#1001053000489">
	<p pid="b.6.1/1">There are school cooks in my area, in Leek and Biddulph, who have worked for the service for decades, have served youngsters and their parents too and are a valued institution. Those school cooks have really taken through the healthy foods initiative in schools and encouraged youngsters to try different foods, and they have had to struggle with menus that have been difficult to sell to young people. They are the people who encourage children to eat healthily. They do not just cook and serve the food; they engage with the children. I do not want any of those excellent ladies-and some gentlemen-who are doing a marvellous job, to find that the &#163;64 is too much for them to bear. Why should they have to bear that cost? It makes no sense. They are public servants who are doing a fantastic job.</p>
	<p pid="b.6.1/2">As my hon. Friend said, it might be loose change for a chief executive or a senior head teacher-</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2010-01-05b.6.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1697" speakername="Kelvin Hopkins" colnum="6"  time="009:41:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm100105/halltext/100105h0001.htm#1001053000490">
	<p pid="b.6.2/1">I thank my hon. Friend for giving way yet again and I apologise for intervening so frequently. A long report on the radio yesterday mentioned the impact of healthy meals on children's performance at schools and the massive contribution made by school cooks and catering workers to that. The more we can encourage children to eat healthy school meals, the better they will perform and the better they will be as citizens in the future.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2010-01-05b.6.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1834" speakername="Charlotte Atkins" colnum="6"  time="009:41:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm100105/halltext/100105h0001.htm#1001053000491">
	<p pid="b.6.3/1">I, too, heard that report, which denied the myth that the healthy school food initiative had been a failure and demonstrated that school catering teams had done a fantastic job throughout the country introducing healthy food. We do not want to see that work put at risk.</p>
	<p pid="b.6.3/2">The registration cost makes no sense. Trading standards' fees for a small local delicatessen are different from those for a major company such as Tesco. We obviously should have a graduated fee system that would ensure that there was a proportionate response, because we want it to be proportionate and we do not want to lose public sector workers to the private sector and thereby lose their expertise and skills. It is vital that we ensure that we maintain those people within the schools.</p>
	<p pid="b.6.3/3">All those risks could be avoided if the employer was required to pay the registration fee. That would be the best way forward, because the one-off fee could be incorporated in the recruitment costs of those excellent staff, rather than introducing any of the negative implications or unforeseen effects of the fee on low-paid staff. That is important.</p>
	<p pid="b.6.3/4">Given that we have time to look at some of the details of the ISA, I hope that those issues are taken seriously by the Minister and thoroughly considered, because although the scheme is important it is also important that we get it absolutely right and that it works effectively. I hope that the Minister will respond positively to some of those points.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2010-01-05b.7.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1519" speakername="Laura Moffatt" colnum="7"  time="009:55:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm100105/halltext/100105h0002.htm#1001053000492">
	<p pid="b.7.0/1">I support my parliamentary colleagues in their attempt to get clarity on the implementation of the Independent Safeguarding Authority. None of us is here to do it down or to create difficulties where we do not think that there are any, and most of us are supportive. A group of organisations has come together on this matter, and I am glad to say that Unison is taking a lead in that. I say that as a lifetime working member of Unison who was part of the creation of the Confederation of Health Service Employees and moved into Unison in the nursing profession. These proposals and changes are sensible and proportionate. As a listening Minister, my hon. Friend will be keen to hear those concerns, although I know that she has had a series of meetings with those with particular issues to discuss.</p>
	<p pid="b.7.0/2">The last thing that we need is for people to be deterred from going into the caring professions, which are not well paid for millions of people, particularly women. It is important that we ensure that those professions are welcoming, and we are keen to ensure that new people come into the caring professions to revive them and do extremely difficult jobs. People do not do it for the money: it is difficult. I have worked alongside all sorts of carers for 25 years and it is obvious that people are coming into the profession because they want to and because they know that they can make a difference.</p>
	<p pid="b.7.0/3">It would be easy to say, &quot;Well, people are getting upset about the new overarching authority, because if you've something in your background, you'd be afraid to disclose that.&quot; That is untrue. The reality is that, overwhelmingly, the people working in the caring professions with vulnerable young people, children and babies are straight as a die and honest. The last thing that we want to do is to put them off and turn them out into another profession. It is important that, whatever we do with the implementation of the authority, it is proportionate and understandable.</p>

	<p pid="b.7.1/1">I want to ask the hon. Lady about the important point that she has raised. She says that those who go into the caring professions have nothing to worry about if they have a clean bill of health in respect of their backgrounds. However, there is a worrying increase in the number of people who are given cautions for sexual offences-it has been increasing year on year-and many may not understand that, by accepting a caution, they could be ruling themselves out of all those jobs in future.

	<p pid="b.8.0/1">I am grateful to the hon. Lady for raising that issue. All of us as Members of Parliament have had issues brought to us by our constituents. However, one major issue is not the offence but disclosure and ensuring that people understand at the time that, if they accept a caution, it may affect their future. Education and information for people at that stage are crucial to the whole process. I agree that the new way of dealing with offences and the changes have implications for people, but although it is proportionate-a major offence should not be dealt with in that way-they need information, so that they know about the effect that that will have on them.</p>
	<p pid="b.8.0/2">There are many people whom we believe will be ideal for the profession, and the last thing that we should do is set up a host of hurdles for those who are willing, particularly younger people who are looking at the caring professions. The economic climate has changed, and a lot of younger people are now looking to the public sector for their future vocation. For many people, it is a vocation to be a midwife or a nurse or to work in a school. Therefore, there will be increased demand, but let me reiterate that many of those people will be relatively low paid. There appears to be no mechanism to take account of that-it might be a head teacher who applies, as was mentioned earlier, or a dinner lady-and we need to give that issue some attention.</p>
	<p pid="b.8.0/3">My hon. Friends have said, quite rightly, that ensuring that the employer pays the initial fee for joining the register would take away many of those obstacles. It would make people feel that, if they entered a profession, the commitment from the employer would be there. Having checked with local trusts in my constituency, I accept that many employers will be prepared to do that, but there is no mandatory fixture for them to say that they will pay. I believe that good employers would pay that fee, but that might not happen in some organisations. We need everybody to be certain that the issue will be dealt with in that way.</p>
	<p pid="b.8.0/4">My hon. Friends raised the issue of volunteering. We are greatly relieved that volunteers will not only be dealt with proportionately through the changes already made, but that they will not have to foot the bill for any of the work that they do. Many of us know of local organisations where people dedicate their time and energy to making lives better for our constituents. Nevertheless, we should consider one issue: it is good that volunteers will not be asked to pay, but that is based on the principle that 11 million people in work will contribute in some way, either through the employer or personally, to allow the system to function properly. Once again, is it fair to allow the dinner lady to subsidise volunteering? Pleased as we are that volunteers will not pay, is it right and proportionate that those on lower incomes will contribute?</p>
	<p pid="b.8.0/5">Those are just some of the issues. I completely support the principle and the notion behind the authority, as does the impressive coalition of good, sound organisations that have come together to consider the matters in detail and provide a sense of proportionality about what is needed to protect our professions. None of us wants the authority to fail or to be ineffective-it flows from the Bichard inquiry, which was set up after the Soham murders. If we could have prevented those murders by having a more effective register, we would have wanted to do so. Therefore, it is in a spirit of support and of wanting the authority to function that we appeal to the Minister this morning to look at these matters in detail and to respond as positively as she can.</p>

	<p pid="b.9.0/1">I start by wishing you, Mr. Olner, and all those present a very happy new year. On behalf of my party, I also wish to put on record our sadness at the news of the loss of David Taylor, and our appreciation of the work that he did, not only on the Chairman's Panel, but through the passionate way in which he made his case on the Floor of the House. He was a Member for whom there was genuinely a great deal of respect and admiration across parties, and he will be greatly missed, not only by Labour Members, but by hon. Members on the other side of the House.</p>
	<p pid="b.9.0/2">I also congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1697" name="Kelvin Hopkins">the hon. Member for Luton, North (Kelvin Hopkins)</phrase> on securing the debate, which, as he mentioned, is the first of this important political year. We are debating an extremely important topic, and I commend him for setting out his case with extraordinary brevity and in such a straightforward way. He did not take up a huge amount of time, which has allowed a number of hon. Members to contribute, and permits us to touch on not only some of the points that he raised, but some of the other issues arising from last year's Singleton review. This is probably our first parliamentary opportunity to debate that review and the important amendments that have been made to the previous proposals for the Independent Safeguarding Authority.</p>
	<p pid="b.9.0/3">A number of hon. Members referred to the background of the establishment of the Independent Safeguarding Authority and to some of the concerns that led to it being set up. We want to place on record our recognition of the importance of this issue, and our concerns about the deficiencies of the previous regime that led to this body being set up, with all its associated costs and controversies. Previously, a lot of the information that was available about some individuals regarding whom there were safeguarding concerns was not consolidated in a way that allowed children to be properly protected. An undesirably political element to the protection regime has been swept away as part of the reforms-we think that that demise is sensible.</p>
	<p pid="b.9.0/4">The measures implemented by the Government should be proportionate and realistic, and they should not place unreasonable costs on individuals or particular bodies. Over the past few months, there have been considerable concerns not only in the education world, but in all those areas where the protection of children and vulnerable adults is an issue, about whether the legislation and regulations were out of control, and whether they were imposing unreasonable costs and duties that could be counter-productive and might drive many law-abiding citizens away from being involved in the support of children and vulnerable adults, particularly in a voluntary capacity.</p>
	<p pid="b.9.0/5">There were genuine concerns that the measures being introduced would have unintended consequences. Outside the education world, we got to a situation in which even the police were being required to register their own staff members, who were obviously already going through other vetting procedures. At a time when budgets were beginning to be tight, there were concerns that the police would need to make large financial provision to put a high proportion of their own staff through this new procedure at &#163;64 a head. I was astonished when I heard the costs that were going to fall on the Avon and Somerset constabulary in my area as a consequence of those vetting and barring procedures. We are therefore pleased that the Government have looked again at some of those matters as a consequence of the Singleton review, and that some of the deficiencies to which hon. Members have referred have been dealt with. However, we still have some concerns about the proposals of Sir Roger Singleton's committee, which I will return to in a moment.</p>
	<p pid="b.9.0/6">The hon. Members for Luton, North, for Staffordshire, Moorlands (Charlotte Atkins) and for Crawley (Laura Moffatt) made extremely important points, some of which involved issues that have been of public concern and reported in the media. Other issues have remained under the surface, and while they are of concern to particular employees and employer groups, they have not become part of the wider public debate. All those matters are important and I would like to touch on them today.</p>
	<p pid="b.9.0/7">I understand that the hon. Member for Luton, North is concerned about three issues: first, who should pay these costs and, in the case of low-paid employees, whether that cost should be picked up by the employer; and, secondly, whether the available appeals processes are sufficiently robust, and how rapidly they will take effect. Importantly-I think that this was also raised by the hon. Members for Staffordshire, Moorlands and for Crawley-the third issue is whether the principles in the Singleton report relating to police exemptions should be extended to other professional groups. I hope that the Government will consider that seriously, because if credible vetting procedures are in place for professional groups, we should not try to replicate them. We were particularly concerned about the situation relating to the police. Some of the other professional groups were not raised with us, so today's debate is an interesting opportunity to discuss some of those issues.</p>

	<p pid="b.10.0/1">I thank the hon. Gentleman for his very helpful comments. We are concerned about the wider question of duplication with other professional bodies not just in relation to the police, but in all cases in which professional bodies and regulators do checks beforehand.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2010-01-05b.10.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1951" speakername="David Laws" colnum="10"  time="010:04:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm100105/halltext/100105h0002.htm#1001053000497">
	<p pid="b.10.1/1">I am grateful for that clarification. I hope that the Minister will respond to the hon. Gentleman's important point.</p>
	<p pid="b.10.1/2">Let me go through some of these areas and several of the other issues that are still outstanding in relation to the legislation and regulations under discussion. When the matter was first debated in the House, both Opposition parties expressed a great deal of concern about many of the loose ends, the limited time to deal with a very detailed subject and the potential unintended consequences. We have seen from the Singleton review the justification for those concerns and the need for us to look again at the regulations to see whether they could be implemented more sensibly. We are not convinced that all the proposals that will be in place by next year are quite right yet, although we accept that the Singleton report and the Government's acceptance of it represent a significant move forward.</p>
	<p pid="b.10.1/3">Let me first raise one important concern about the Singleton recommendations. I think that the hon. Member for Luton, North, quite deliberately, did not seek to touch on it, but it is, for us, an important residual point that comes out of the recommendations, which were published in December. It relates to recommendation 3, on &quot;Frequent and intensive contact&quot;, and the associated recommendation 4 on &quot;Visits to different settings&quot;. In some ways, both recommendations seek to take into account the concerns expressed about whether the regulations would be excessively burdensome. In recommendation 3, Sir Roger seeks to redefine the frequent and intensive contact tests so that they would essentially come into place if people were going into schools and coming into contact with vulnerable individuals once a week or more regularly. The intensive contact test is defined in terms of four contacts a month.</p>
	<p pid="b.10.1/4">Our concern is not that that is not a small move in the right direction, but that it does not really deal with the question of what individuals are doing when they are in the particular settings and whether they are really likely to pose a risk. In other words, we think that it is framed too much in terms of frequency of contact and does not consider in sufficient detail what the contact constitutes. Many people would regard it as obvious that when an individual comes into contact with children or vulnerable adults in an environment in which they are the only adult present, or when they are in a particularly vulnerable setting-perhaps involving an overnight stay, or sports or some such activity-there are reasons for ensuring that the safeguards in place are very secure. However, many other people who go into educational establishments or who come into contact with vulnerable children and adults might be doing so with a much lower risk characteristic, particularly when those individuals are coming into schools or other settings where there is another adult who might already be the approved and vetted adult present.</p>
	<p pid="b.10.1/5">Many of us can think of occasions on which individuals come from outside school settings to talk to children, sometimes quite regularly, but those contacts take place wholly with one of the existing members of the teaching staff in place. That seems not to be properly taken into account in the recommendations and in the Government's plans, so we have a situation that is framed too much around frequency and not enough around the actual risk inherent in any particular situation.</p>
	<p pid="b.10.1/6">That concern was raised by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1389" name="Maria Miller">the hon. Member for Basingstoke (Mrs. Miller)</phrase> when this matter was first debated.</p>
	<p pid="b.10.1/7" class="indent">&quot;As a school governor myself, I have seen instances in which outside organisations have come into the school without ever being left in sole charge of the children with whom they come into contact.&quot;-[<i>Official Report, Standing Committee B, </i><phrase class="date" code="2006-07-11">11 July 2006</phrase>; c. 77.]</p>
	<p pid="b.10.1/8">She said that there would be activities that did not need to be monitored, but that equally there would be circumstances, such as those outlined on that day, in which there would be concerns. I should like to know whether the Government have given, or will give, more consideration to whether the nature of the contact and the risks inherent in that should be considered more seriously and whether, therefore, more flexibility could be built into the procedures, but obviously not in relation to contacts that would be particularly high risk.</p>
	<p pid="b.10.1/9">I should also like clarification of the linked proposal-recommendation 4, which relates to visits to different settings. My understanding of that is that Sir Roger has concluded that if an individual comes into contact with a vulnerable adult or a child on a regular basis, there is cause for concern that some sort of abusive relationship might develop in unusual circumstances and that therefore protection is needed. However, Sir Roger seems to have decided that if an individual comes into contact with a range of young people or vulnerable adults, but not the same young people or vulnerable adults, the potential for an abusive relationship to develop would be much lower and therefore the toleration of contact with those different individuals should be much higher.</p>
	<p pid="b.10.1/10">I can understand the argument that if an individual comes into contact frequently with vulnerable adults or with the same children, there is the potential for a relationship to develop that could be abused, but I can also see an apparent irrationality. My understanding is that if, for example, an individual was coming into a secondary school from the outside but was having contact with children in different classes, they would essentially have an exemption from some of the other proposals in relation to frequency and intensity of contact. It seems bizarre that those individuals might be able to come into contact with individuals in a potentially exposed setting quite frequently, but provided that it was with different individuals, they would be exempt from the frequent and intensive contact proposals. I wonder whether that is sensible, particularly given that those individuals, even if they are coming into contact with different classes or individuals formally in the classroom, might still be able to meet up with children or vulnerable adults whom they had met in another formal setting as they worked their way around the institution.</p>
	<p pid="b.10.1/11">I therefore have yet to be persuaded that recommendations 3 and 4 deal sensibly and pragmatically with this particularly crucial issue. I think that, in some senses, recommendation 4 leaves some scope for abuse and child protection concerns, but recommendation 3 does not go nearly far enough in allowing exemptions for the large number of adults who come into contact with young people and vulnerable adults but do so in a setting where the risks are extraordinarily low and, in particular, where another adult who has been vetted is already in the setting. I invite the Minister to comment on that and let us know whether the Government will look at the matter again.</p>
	<p pid="b.10.1/12">I should like to pick up the point that the hon. Member for Luton, North made about other professional groups and whether the exemptions that have now been extended to the police, following the Singleton report and the Home Secretary's response to it, could be extended to other groups on the basis of the checks that already have to take place. Even after Sir Roger's proposals, the new regulations will still relate to between 9 million and 9.5 million people, and possibly many more over time. If it is possible to work within the framework of the current checks, rather than introducing new bureaucracy, I hope that we can pursue that.</p>
	<p pid="b.10.1/13">Will the Minister comment on a number of other issues that have been left hanging in the air as a consequence of the Secretary of State's statement at the end of last year? First, Sir Roger recommended further work on three of the proposals at the end of his report. Under what time scale can we expect the Government to complete that work and bring recommendations to the House? Is it likely to be before the spring or will it be well into the future? Secondly, when will there be a new impact assessment of the proposals as amended by Singleton? Will it include an assessment of their benefits in terms of reducing the potential for abuse?</p>
	<p pid="b.10.1/14">I want to pick up a point made by the hon. Member for Luton, North. I have concerns about whether the appeals process can be strengthened and about the time taken to process checks. As the hon. Gentleman mentioned, there is a lot of evidence to show that the processing is taking far too long. If people believe that processing will take a long time, organisations, employees and volunteers may be deterred from entering into arrangements, which could have a damaging impact.</p>
	<p pid="b.10.1/15">Finally, we heard about the cost of processing. In some cases, particularly those of a more voluntary nature, the expectation is that the individual, sadly, will have to bear the cost. However, a legitimate point can be made, particularly in the case of low-paid individuals, about whether the employer should pick up the cost. Although &#163;64 might seem a relatively small amount for somebody on a high income, it is a lot for somebody on a low income, particularly if they have been out of employment for a long time. People who go back into employment often face transport and other costs, which can be quite large and which can act as a genuine disincentive to taking up work. I therefore have some sympathy with the points made by the hon. Member for Luton, North and his hon. Friends, and I hope that the Government will respond positively.</p>

	<p pid="b.13.0/1">It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship in the first debate of the new year, Mr. Olner. I echo the sentiments that you expressed about the sad loss of David Taylor. I am sure that all our thoughts are with his wife and family at this sad time.</p>
	<p pid="b.13.0/2">On a lighter note, I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1697" name="Kelvin Hopkins">the hon. Member for Luton, North (Kelvin Hopkins)</phrase> on securing the debate and on setting out so clearly some of the real concerns that remain about the Independent Safeguarding Authority. It is important that we do that, because the organisation was conceived to help some of the most vulnerable people in our communities-those with whom we perhaps deal most as constituency Members of Parliament-and to ensure that they are appropriately protected. As we have heard from several hon. Members, various organisations, including trade unions, have concerns about the impact of the legislation on their workers and particularly on the lowest-paid.</p>
	<p pid="b.13.0/3">The Government's approach to the new vetting system, which has evolved over more than four years, and the creation of the ISA reflect some of the more troubling issues-<i>[</i><i>Interruption.</i><i>]</i></p>

	<p pid="b.13.2/1">Among the most troubling issues that our communities face is the implication that we can eliminate risk from the lives of children or vulnerable adults, with the result that we break down the trust that exists in our communities. Although those are much broader issues, and there probably is not enough time to debate them today, we should ensure in all our deliberations that we do not try to create a feeling that society is devoid of risk. We should ensure that employers and voluntary organisations take responsibility for such issues in how they operate.</p>
	<p pid="b.13.2/2">It is unsurprising that there has been widespread concern about the role and remit of the ISA, given that the organisation's scope has evolved so much under secondary legislation over the past four years. That is perhaps another reason why the Government should have included in the original legislation more of the detail of how the new vetting procedure would work. Many feel that we have moved away from the original intentions outlined in Sir Michael Bichard's report; indeed, there are indications that he himself feels that.</p>
	<p pid="b.13.2/3">The Secretary of State's most recent guidance on the Singleton review simply serves to underline the fact that the new ISA legislation lacks a clear statement of the principles guiding the vetting process, so perhaps the Minister can take the opportunity afforded by the debate to clarify the issue. As we have heard from today's contributions, there is a real lack of clarity even about who has to be vetted. There is no coherent rationale, and the catch-all approach that formed our starting point seems to have evolved into a catch-all with significant caveats, which have been inserted by the Secretary of State in an attempt to prevent the whole organisation from being derailed. We need a much clearer articulation of the principles guiding the ISA, as well as a recognition that no system can guarantee the safety of children and vulnerable adults and that police checks are simply a record of the past, not a substitute for every organisation taking ultimate responsibility for those who work in them.</p>
	<p pid="b.13.2/4">The most important part of the debate is the Minister's response, so I will outline only briefly some of the other issues that she may want to talk about. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1951" name="David Laws">The hon. Member for Yeovil (Mr. Laws)</phrase> rightly said that the Singleton report covered a number of concerns, but there is still a lack of clarity about exactly who must be monitored and vetted. Given that the principles must be implemented by employers, employees and voluntary organisations, the most important point is surely that we have a simple set of rules that everybody can understand, rather than the complexity that we have now.</p>
	<p pid="b.13.2/5">Although we originally expected a Minister from the Department for Children, Schools and Families to respond, the Minister is from the Home Office, so she might like to give us a quick update on how the police are getting on with their new database. Is it as up-to-date as it needs to be? Is it working in the way that she hoped it would? Are there are any concerns or reviews that we should be aware of? Those issues are outside my departmental responsibilities, so I would appreciate an update.</p>
	<p pid="b.13.2/6">Another issue that the Minister could usefully mention is the clear ineptitude that has been demonstrated in communications on the new way of vetting. There have been several misconceptions about who should be vetted, some of which hon. Members have echoed today. The original legislation was never intended to touch on private understandings, but they are widely thought to be covered. Indeed, in his letter to Roger Singleton on <phrase class="date" code="2010-12-14">14 December</phrase>, the Secretary of State says:</p>
	<p pid="b.13.2/7" class="indent">&quot;I strongly agree with you that we need to intensify our communications efforts in order to dispel myths and ensure that there is a wide understanding of how the scheme will apply.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.13.2/8">Is that an admission that the Government have failed properly to communicate the details of the scheme? What has been learned from those mistakes? How exactly will the Minister communicate with employers and employees about how the ISA will work? We discussed those issues extensively in Committee, and I feel rather disappointed that the Government took no heed of what the Opposition said.</p>
	<p pid="b.13.2/9">Another issue was raised directly with me in a round-table seminar with a wide range of experts that I hosted just before the Christmas break-the uncertainty about whether children's attendance with organisations as, say, part of their year 10 work experience would trigger a monitoring requirement for the organisation's employees, since a week's placement could satisfy the intensity test. If so, has the Minister taken into account the numbers who would be vetted? That is a matter that particularly concerns schools and organisations that are trying to set up such placements. A parallel issue is internships. We welcome the clarification to the effect that vetting would not be required of 16, 17 or 18-year-olds working with children or vulnerable adults as part of their school or college training. However, many university students may have short or long-term work experience placements. Why would they not be exempt too? Surely that would be an important part of their academic studies.</p>
	<p pid="b.13.2/10">It is unclear why overseas visitors looking after their own children have a three-month exemption from registering. They will come into contact with children from this country on a frequent or intensive basis-say at a scouts' jamboree camp. Perhaps the Minister will explain the choice of the three-month period, which seems somewhat arbitrary, and why there is a shorter period before having to register-I think it is about 28 days-for parents in the UK who come into contact with children from overseas through exchange visits.</p>
	<p pid="b.13.2/11">The portability of the new system is to be welcomed and I think that many of my constituents see it as an asset of the scheme, but will the Minister clarify whether employers will still be required to seek an enhanced disclosure for people in certain jobs once they are ISA-registered? The ministerial response to the Singleton review seems to be to advise employers that all the information needed to check the suitability of a candidate will be held by the ISA and that thus an enhanced disclosure will not be needed. There is a lack of understanding and clarity about that among voluntary organisations, and it would be a good thing if the Minister were to clarify it today.</p>
	<p pid="b.13.2/12">Concerns were expressed in the round-table seminar that I mentioned about the decision-making powers of ISA caseworkers. They have the opportunity to change someone's life: it is fundamental. Will the Minister explain the training that they will receive, the prerequisite qualifications and experience for the job, the management structure of the ISA and to whom caseworkers will be accountable? Perhaps she will also clarify the type of information that caseworkers will observe, and the information that they will be able to pass on to employers. Concerns have been raised with me that information about third parties living in the house of a potential employee or volunteer might be passed to voluntary organisations, which might put the individual receiving it in an extremely difficult position. What safeguards are there to ensure that caseworkers do not misuse the information given to them?</p>
	<p pid="b.13.2/13">An important group of people affected by the measures is ex-offenders. The St. Giles Trust has raised concerns about how the scheme could prevent them from re-entering the labour market. Sir Roger Singleton noted:</p>
	<p pid="b.13.2/14" class="indent">&quot;The process of ISA registration is viewed by many as a potential and significant disincentive to ex-offenders who may wish to engage in this work&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.13.2/15">The ISA is apparently engaged in discussions with rehabilitative organisations, and perhaps the Minister will explain what action the Department is taking to encourage ex-offenders, and to educate employers, to ensure that the ISA will not have the negative impact that so many fear it will.</p>
	<p pid="b.13.2/16">The hon. Members for Luton, North and for Crawley (Laura Moffatt) have already discussed the costs of registration, so I shall not do so further, other than to say that I share the hon. Lady's concern that they may disproportionately affect female workers and those who choose to enter the caring professions, perhaps after having a family.</p>
	<p pid="b.13.2/17">The issue of overseas workers, although tangential to the points raised by the hon. Member for Luton, North, is probably of concern to trade union members. I have raised it with the Government in the past four years, and it has still not been fully addressed. In June 2006 the then Minister of State said that the Government were developing protocols with 21 different countries about how to deal with information about overseas workers who put themselves forward to be registered under the new system. Three years later, the Government have made initial agreements with Australia, France and Ireland-three countries. That is well short of the original objective. That was confirmed recently in a debate in the other place, when the Government spokesman Baroness Morgan said:</p>
	<p pid="b.13.2/18" class="indent">&quot;Concern was expressed about engaging with international protocols. I can confirm that we have an initial agreement with Australia and that we are in ongoing discussions with France and Ireland.&quot;-[<i>Official Report, House of Lords, </i><phrase class="date" code="2009-07-08">8 July 2009</phrase>; Vol. 712, c.

	<p pid="b.13.2/19">Considering the substantial number of individuals from overseas who now work in many areas that will be covered by the new registration process and about whose background and records there will be no information on the database, there seems to be a continuing glaring hole in the process. The Government have resisted any system of flagging the fact that someone has been working overseas, to give employers a heads-up on the fact that their ISA check is incomplete. Perhaps union members will be interested in that, because it means that there are two sets of rules for people applying for jobs. It is important that, if records are incomplete, that should be flagged up to employers and voluntary organisations.</p>
	<p pid="b.13.2/20">It is clear from the debate today, and the debate that has been going on outside Parliament, that there are big questions about how workable the new system will be. We are trying to create a system that will be implemented by employers, employees and voluntary organisations. If those of us who have been involved in the debate for four years find it difficult to unpick the Government's intentions, the Minister would do best to tell the House that some fundamental reviews are being undertaken, beyond what has been done by Singleton; otherwise, she is storing up significant problems for the future.</p>

	<p pid="b.17.0/1">It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Mr. Olner. I share the sadness that has been expressed about the death of my friend and colleague David Taylor, who was a fellow Co-operative MP and, as you said, a very active Member in Westminster Hall. It is fitting that we should remember him today.</p>
	<p pid="b.17.0/2">I thank my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1697" name="Kelvin Hopkins">the Member for Luton, North (Kelvin Hopkins)</phrase> for obtaining the debate. The issue is of great importance, and I am glad of the opportunity to clarify some of the matters that he raised and those raised by my hon. Friends the Members for Staffordshire, Moorlands (Charlotte Atkins) and for Crawley (Laura Moffatt) and the hon. Members for Yeovil (Mr. Laws) and for Basingstoke (Mrs. Miller).</p>
	<p pid="b.17.0/3">It is worth my giving an overview of the scheme, but I want to move quickly on to deal with the many points that have been raised. It is worth reiterating a fact on which I am glad that we have the support of hon. Members from all parties: we want a scheme that will ensure that we do our best to prevent the risk of harm involving those working with children and, just as importantly, vulnerable adults. I agree with the comments of the hon. Member for Basingstoke about where risk lies. Whatever the Government do, they can never eliminate all risk, and it is important that the system that we are debating should be seen as part of the armoury of information that an employer can have in making a decision about whether it is safe for someone to work in a particular environment.</p>
	<p pid="b.17.0/4">The scheme provides a simple, one-off registration that is-to reassure my hon. Friend the Member for Luton, North-free for volunteers and allows an organisation placing volunteers to verify the information quickly and free of charge, without requiring the disclosure of sensitive criminal records data. As hon. Members know, the scheme comes out of the terrible events in Soham. We have made quite a lot of progress. The hon. Member for Basingstoke called for fundamental reviews, but given the fact that the scheme was launched in October and will, as I shall outline, progress rapidly this year, a fundamental review at this stage would mean that we would have no scheme. Four years on, that would be a foolish step. I shall explain, and respond to hon. Members' points about, some of the matters that we are considering, because I am ever aware of the need to ensure that what we establish is proportionate and not over-bureaucratic and that it does what it is supposed to do. I shall set that out clearly.</p>
	<p pid="b.17.0/5">The scheme was launched on <phrase class="date" code="2010-10-12">12 October</phrase> last year. It was the first stage of the process, under which the three existing barring lists-the protection of vulnerable aduits and Protection of Children Act lists and list 99-were replaced by the two ISA barred lists, the lists of those barred from working with children or vulnerable adults. Some people would appear on both lists, and some on one or the other.</p>
	<p pid="b.17.0/6">A crucial point is worth stressing, as we have not talked enough about vulnerable adults in our four years of debate. Employers have had a legal duty imposed on them to refer to the ISA information about an individual who may pose a risk to children or vulnerable adults. That is critical. As a carer of a particularly vulnerable adult, I have seen over the years what can happen in some care settings-both professionally and personally. For example, an agency worker or a member of staff who is under investigation may choose to leave that employment. The employer does not need to take further action, because he no longer employs that person. Indeed, his investigation may not have progressed that far. On the same day, the individual can register with another employer or agency, sometimes working in the same care setting. From now on, if there is even a question mark or if an investigation has been started, that individual has to leave that employer and has a legal duty to provide that information. We will see some significant step changes in tackling the few-I echo the comments of my hon. Friend the Member for Crawley-bad apples who may pose a risk to vulnerable adults. That will be an important step.</p>
	<p pid="b.17.0/7">There are also new criminal penalties for barred individuals who work or apply to work with vulnerable groups. Applying to work will itself be a criminal offence if one has been barred. Criminal penalties were introduced to deal with employers who knowingly take on people with a poor record.</p>
	<p pid="b.17.0/8">About 15,000 people are on the ISA list of barred adults and 19,200 people are on the children's list, but as I said, some appear on both lists. The reasons for inclusion in the lists include physical abuse, sexual abuse, financial abuse, drug offences, neglect and emotional abuse. Paedophilia is only one reason why the scheme is essential. It is important to see things in the round. It is important to note that the majority of those on the current lists were moved from the previous barred lists, which is why so many have been added in such a short time.</p>
	<p pid="b.17.0/9">From July 2010, all new employees and volunteers who regularly come into contact with children or vulnerable people can be ISA-registered before starting work. Individuals will be able to apply for ISA registration and an enhanced Criminal Records Bureau check on one application form. I shall talk about fees in a moment, but the bureaucratic procedure is similar to going through a CRB check. For the individual, it will involve much the same process.</p>
	<p pid="b.17.0/10">The crucial aspect of the new scheme compared with existing and previous regimes is that people will be continuously monitored and their status reassessed whenever new information is received. There will be automatic triggers to ensure that such information is provided to the ISA. The employer will be able to register an interest in an individual with that person's consent. For example, were I to apply to for a job in a care home, I would be able to give my registration details to the employer, who would then be able to check that I was free and able to work.</p>
	<p pid="b.17.0/11">From November 2010, all new employees and volunteers who regularly come into contact with children or vulnerable people must be ISA-registered before starting work. It will become a legal requirement for employers and voluntary organisations to check the ISA status of new and current employees. As I explained earlier, it is not over-bureaucratic; it should be a swift and straightforward process.</p>
	<p pid="b.17.0/12">By July 2015, all employees and volunteers who work regularly with vulnerable people, including current employees, must be ISA-registered. It may seem a long time, but it is important that we get it right and that we do things proportionately. I recognise, however, that the checks and normal precautions that employers and voluntary groups should be taking have indeed been taking place.</p>
	<p pid="b.17.0/13">Many points have been raised this morning, so I may skip through certain matters that I think less important; I shall make a judgment on that. The hon. Member for Yeovil asked about Sir Roger Singleton's check. The scheme has received much publicity over the summer. I remember being on maternity leave and sometimes wanting to throw things at the radio when hearing the myths that abounded about who might be included. I was therefore delighted that my right hon. Friends the Home Secretary and the Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families agreed to ask Sir Roger to check whether what was being done was proportionate. I am glad that we are having this debate today, as it will lay to rest some of those myths.</p>
	<p pid="b.17.0/14">As a result of public concern, Sir Roger was asked to check whether the scheme had drawn the line in the right place for definitions of frequency and intensity of contact with children and vulnerable adults. His recommendations have been accepted; I believe that they improve the overall balance. They remove some 2 million people from the need for registration and ensure that the definitions of frequent and intensive activities are clear and understood.</p>
	<p pid="b.17.0/15">It is essential to ensure that children and vulnerable adults are properly safeguarded and that we do all that we reasonably can to protect them from those who seek to do them harm. However, to be effective, the system must be balanced and proportionate. It is no good making it so tight and difficult that is hard for people to understand. I am grateful to Sir Roger for the clear way in which he communicated his thoughts on how things should be done, and as I said, the Government have accepted them in full.</p>

	<p pid="b.19.1/1">I shall touch on a number of the points raised by the hon. Gentleman. It will depend on frequency, but I shall not pick up on one point. It would depend also on what the school felt was appropriate if that person had regular contact outside school. For example, schools in small towns may have more contact with that individual than with someone who comes from another geographical area. In essence, as the hon. Gentleman outlined, frequency may be defined as three times a month. However, recommendations 3 and 4 essentially need to work together. It will be a matter of judgment for the school on how it should work and what the timings should be. It is therefore difficult to comment on an example thrown at me in the Chamber.</p>
	<p pid="b.19.1/2">The hon. Gentleman usefully laid out the flaws of the previous system and reminded us all of the need for change. I shall now pick up on some general points, but I may come back to the point that he raised a moment ago.</p>
	<p pid="b.19.1/3">The question was asked whether police officers should register under the scheme. I and ministerial colleagues from the Departments of Health and for Children, Schools and Families have been alert to the need to ensure that the scheme is proportionate. The cost of police going through their own check, which is essentially the same, seemed over-bureaucratic. It has therefore been decided that police officers, for whom rigorous vetting arrangements are already in place, and who are uniquely placed to access all the relevant criminality and intelligence information on the police national computer, do not need to be ISA-registered. Some officers have regular contact with children, but that is a slightly different issue.</p>

	<p pid="b.20.0/1">I return to the intervention by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1951" name="David Laws">the hon. Member for Yeovil (Mr. Laws)</phrase>. If the Minister finds it difficult to give an answer to his question, surely school governors in our constituencies will find it difficult to assess whether or not an individual needs to be police checked and will therefore err on the side of caution. The lack of clarity-and perhaps the Minister's inability to answer that question-shows the scale of the problem.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2010-01-05b.20.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1605" speakername="Meg Hillier" colnum="20"  time="010:37:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm100105/halltext/100105h0004.htm#1001053000505">
	<p pid="b.20.1/1">I shall take the rare step of being candid. I have been up three times in the night with a young baby and I have a cold. I was worried that I might have misheard what the hon. Gentleman said and did not want to commit myself, in <i>Hansard</i>, to something that I may have had to correct. However, I shall address the point that he raised in more general terms. Forgive me, Mr. Olner, for being personal, but that is the reality.</p>
	<p pid="b.20.1/2">We believe that removing the police is a proportionate decision that will reduce bureaucracy. Voluntary sector support is high. Bodies such as the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children and Volunteering England support the inclusion of volunteers in the scheme. It is right. I have volunteered for groups in which my children have been involved. I am a mother of three. For example, I would sometimes turn up at a Cub Scouts camp. In those days, I needed a CRB check as there were other children. I recently turned up to make paper flowers with the Brownies, but I did not need a CRB check because, at all times, Brown Owl was present. We have to recognise that the balance is right for volunteers.</p>
	<p pid="b.20.1/3">As a number of hon. Members stressed, we also need to communicate clearly to those who are asked to undergo CRB checks or ISA registration which people need to be checked. It is important to get right the frequent contact test that was raised by Sir Roger Singleton. The hon. Member for Yeovil asked whether the test takes into account the nature of the contact. I hope that my story about the Brownies and the paper flowers has reassured him on that. Of more concern is the overnight stay on residential trips with children. I welcome the opportunity to make clear that difference.</p>
	<p pid="b.20.1/4">The CRB check gives information about a person, but it is left to the employer's discretion to decide whether it is relevant to the person having contact with a child. For example, someone who is not barred may have additional information on their CRB check, and it would be up to the employer to judge whether it was relevant to the job. If someone was to apply to be a minibus driver for a youth club, the fact that they had a criminal record may not be an issue, but if they had a record around children it may be. If they were to apply for a job in which they were handling money, a criminal record on a financial matter might be an issue. If they were providing children with counselling and the financial issue was a concern, the employer might use that as a reason not to employ them. That is the normal process for a CRB check. I am slightly digressing here. As I am anxious about time, I will have to rattle on a bit.</p>
	<p pid="b.20.1/5">As for children's authors, the Government accepts Sir Roger's analysis that in cases in which someone is working frequently with children but only in different schools and returns to the same school only infrequently, if at all, there is no opportunity to develop and abuse trust. If I understood the hon. Member for Yeovil correctly, he was talking about someone having fairly regular contact with the same group of children, in which case there would be a requirement for registration. The key issue is about the ability to develop a relationship. Schools can still choose to ask anyone for an up-to-date CRB check even if they are not barred from working with children. There may be information in the CRB check that is not relevant to the ISA. The impact assessment that was mentioned is being produced, but I cannot give a definite time scale on its production at the moment.</p>
	<p pid="b.20.1/6">Let me pick up on some of the points raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Luton, North, because he initiated the debate. He and other hon. Members touched on the issue of cost. The cost of the first registration is &#163;64. It is worth stressing that the cost was never &#163;20. I am not clear where that figure comes from. In the consultation carried out by Government, only 5 per cent. of respondents considered that &#163;20 was an appropriate cost. The cost for the ISA part of the check is &#163;28. At the same time, the scheme requires an enhanced CRB disclosure, which costs &#163;36. Therefore, in total, the cost is &#163;64, but the ISA registration is only &#163;28, which is a reasonable amount. Good and responsible employers may well choose to take on such a scheme, and it would be right for them to consider it and, arguably, it would make them competitive in attracting employees.</p>
	<p pid="b.20.1/7">We must recognise from where the funding comes. If we provide the checks for free, the money will come from tax funds. If we charge a fee, the scheme will be paid for from that. Therefore, we have two payment options because the money has to come from somewhere. It is not for the Home Office to direct employers what to do, but other Departments-the Departments of Health and for Children, Schools and Families-may choose to have discussions with some of those who require people to have checks.</p>

	<p pid="b.21.0/1">I am listening to my hon. Friend with interest, but I am sure that it requires only a simple adjustment to the legislation to make it statutory for employers to pay the costs.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2010-01-05b.21.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1605" speakername="Meg Hillier" colnum="21"  time="010:37:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm100105/halltext/100105h0004.htm#1001053000507">
	<p pid="b.21.1/1">There is no time for legislation on such a basis even if it were in the Government's mind. However, I hope that most employers will take up the scheme. Once employees register, the scheme is portable. There is a one-off registration. The scheme is similar to the security checks at airports in which employees can be required to contribute.</p>
	<p pid="b.21.1/2">I do not have the time to go into the issues around CRB performance, but let me reassure hon. Members that it is not as bad as it has been painted. We are regularly on target to achieve a turnaround within 28 days. For the ISA registration, there will be a seven-working-day turnaround to get the information back, and only if there is the trigger of information being sent to the ISA will the ISA have to go through its process, so that is much faster. I have already mentioned that volunteers do not have to pay anything at all, which addresses some points of concern.</p>
	<p pid="b.21.1/3">The concern about duplication of regulatory provisions is important, and I have had constructive discussions with Unison and other TUC members, and their arguments convinced me to consider the matter again. The work is ongoing, so I cannot reveal anything to hon. Members now, but I am grateful to the trade unions and professional bodies for their constructive and detailed input to the discussions. Intense work is still going on behind the scenes.</p>
	<p pid="b.21.1/4">I want to stress that the roles for regulators are different from those of the ISA, which must ensure that unsuitable persons are barred from work with children or vulnerable adults. It considers risk and not professional competence, which is the role of the regulators. It is important that we recognise the difference. Nevertheless, the ISA works with Unison and keepers of registers to develop clear and consistent guidelines on what information should be referred to the ISA and when. The ISA chief executive has held discussions with some bodies, including the General Social Care Council, the General Medical Council and Unison, and will be meeting Unison again later this month to take matters further forward. An operational workshop involving a number of stakeholders will take place later this month to work through the practical issues involved in the referral process. That came about as a result of a meeting that I had with trade unionists and keepers of registers last autumn.</p>
	<p pid="b.21.1/5">The point raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Luton, North in respect of harm is a sound one and goes to the heart of what we are discussing with stakeholders. The ISA has no interest in creating an unnecessary and unwieldy bureaucracy that might hinder rather than improve safeguarding. The suggestion that any person who is on a professional register would have their case heard and concluded by the professional regulator prior to referral to the ISA is, in all likelihood, how the process will work. We must ensure that we are aware of any potential loophole or flaw in the process, that we have a proper notification and that we know exactly where responsibility lies at each stage of the process. As the Minister responsible, I am anxious that we do not have a system that sets up a chain of events and that, when different bits of the chain slip, we do not end up with a tragedy for which no one takes responsibility. We must have clear lines of responsibility at every point.</p>
	<p pid="b.21.1/6">As for conflicting decisions between regulators and the ISA, different conclusions might be reached, but that may be for the reasons that I outlined at the beginning. The ISA might not bar someone who has been dismissed for professional misconduct because they might not be a risk to children or vulnerable adults, but it might bar someone not because they have been dismissed from the professional body but because it holds other relevant information, and it must take all that information in the round. Therefore, we will sometimes see different decisions, but we must be clear about why. I am very positive about our work with the trade unions and the registers of information on the matter.</p>
	<p pid="b.21.1/7">On appeals, individuals can appeal to a tribunal only on points of law or fact. It was recognised that the expertise of the ISA board and its professional judgment should not be overturned by a court that does not have the same expert knowledge. The option of continuing to a judicial review of decisions remains and discussions are ongoing with those involved in representing employees about how the scheme will work, and I am still open to discussion. We have to start as we mean to go on, and we start with what we have already outlined and laid out in law. If the scheme does not work, I pledge to review it after the fact and to continue to have discussions about how we ensure that it works properly. Let me reassure all concerned that the factual information provided will be properly considered.</p>
	<p pid="b.21.1/8">I have very little time left, but I want to stress that I went to Darlington and met the caseworkers, and I will write to the hon. Member for Basingstoke about the training aspects. I had a very positive experience meeting them and I was impressed with how seriously they take their jobs and their decisions, knowing the impact that they have on people's lives.</p>
	<p pid="b.21.1/9">Let me clarify that the ISA scheme does not apply to private and family arrangements or infrequent arrangements. However, when carers-those of us who are parents or caring for anyone who is an adult-hand someone over to others who are not in their direct control, they need the reassurance that they are safe. That is what this scheme is intended to do and what I believe, with the adjustments that we are making, it will do.</p>
	<p pid="b.21.1/10">Let me reassure the hon. Lady that we are making good progress on the police national database. Moreover, I have to say that we have not been inept on the communications front. We have done a lot to communicate with different bodies, but sometimes, alas-as a journalist myself I find this distressing-newspapers do not always check their facts properly and headlines can alarm people. We will continue to provide information. The helpline has dealt with many queries and e-mailed responses. A lot of work has been done by the ISA to help to guide people through the process. Youngsters of 16, 17 and 18 do not need to be vetted. As for the issues around overseas visitors, I will write to the hon. Lady about them and send a copy to other hon. Members.</p>
	<p pid="b.21.1/11">In summary, the scheme is important and I welcome the debate on it. It is a shame that we have not had more time to discuss it.</p>

	<p pid="b.24.1/1">This is a very important debate for my constituents, who are extremely concerned about the links between mainland Penzance in west Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly in my constituency.</p>
	<p pid="b.24.1/2">I am delighted to have secured this debate. Although I understand, of course, that there are very few constituencies south of the Scottish border that have islands with substantial populations who have questions about island transport services, such services are none the less important to my constituents.</p>
	<p pid="b.24.1/3">I am grateful to the Minister and his Department, particularly for their work during the passage of the Concessionary Bus Travel Act 2007. At that time, I raised concerns about what would happen to ensure that residents on the Isles of Scilly achieved parity with those people who were fortunate to have roads and bus services between the communities that they needed to communicate and travel between. I raised those concerns because the water buses-the launches that operate between the Isles of Scilly-are the equivalent of bus services elsewhere. Therefore, I am grateful that his Department was prepared to consider that issue in 2007 during the passage of the Act and that it found a settlement that I know both the council and the residents of the Isles of Scilly were satisfied with.</p>
	<p pid="b.24.1/4">This debate, which is a 90-minute debate rather than a 30-minute debate, is very specifically geographically focused on my constituency, particularly the west of my constituency, and it is related to the future plans for investment in and improvement of the Isles of Scilly ferry link. For reasons that I need to explain and that I must at least put on record today, this project has been seriously knocked off course by a recent decision, which had been predicted for some time beforehand. The reason that I have secured this debate in Westminster Hall is that I now need the support of the Minister; ideally, I need his intervention, but certainly I need his advice, to help to ensure that this project can be put back on course and that we can find a way forward for it. We need to find a way to ensure that this project can proceed.</p>
	<p pid="b.24.1/5">By way of assisting the Minister, I will just run through in advance a number of questions that will arise from what I am going to say, to give him the opportunity to reflect on those questions while I paint, if you like, the picture that lies behind them. I will perhaps come back to those questions at the end of my contribution, but I thought it would be helpful if I gave him early notice of them.</p>
	<p pid="b.24.1/6">The Minister's colleague, the Minister of State, Department for Transport, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1878" name="Sadiq Khan">the right hon. Member for Tooting (Mr. Khan)</phrase>, recently wrote a letter to me, dated <phrase class="date" code="2009-12-22">22 December 2009</phrase>; as the Minister knows, I have corresponded with both him and the Minister of State. In that letter, the Minister of State reasonably stated-I entirely understand his statement-that</p>
	<p pid="b.24.1/7" class="indent">&quot;as the decision Minister on any final funding approval for this scheme&quot;-</p>
	<p pid="b.24.1/8">that is the Isles of Scilly ferry scheme-</p>
	<p pid="b.24.1/9" class="indent">&quot;I must decline requests for a meeting. It would be inappropriate for me to involve myself in the local debate on specific proposals for a scheme and even more so as the scheme is also the subject of due planning process.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.24.1/10">I entirely accept and appreciate that comment. He goes on to say:</p>
	<p pid="b.24.1/11" class="indent">&quot;However, this should not be interpreted as a 'snub' by anyone-I remain fully supportive of your efforts to bring this scheme to a speedy conclusion.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.24.1/12">I appreciate those remarks, because I must say that it has been a difficult negotiation locally on this scheme and it remains difficult now.</p>
	<p pid="b.24.1/13">However, there has been a recent development, which is the rejection by Cornwall council of its own transportation department's application for listed building consent for one aspect of Penzance harbour. Of course, gaining that consent is critical to the progress of the ferry scheme and so there is now probably a need for aspects of the scheme to be reviewed. In the light of that development, are there circumstances in which the Minister would be prepared to join me in a meeting with others to help to find a productive and constructive way forward for this project?</p>
	<p pid="b.24.1/14">In my opinion, the best way forward would be to have input by the Regional Minister, the Minister for the South West, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1548" name="Jim Knight">the right hon. Member for South Dorset (Jim Knight)</phrase>; the Government office for the south-west, which I have been speaking to on this issue and which has been very helpful, I must say; senior officials from English Heritage, who I have also spoken to and who are very keen to make a constructive contribution to finding a way forward; and of course officers from Cornwall council. Crucially, however, we also need senior officials, or at least those who can be given an &quot;executive brief&quot;, from the Department for Transport to help us find a way forward. I have already offered to convene such a meeting or series of meetings, in the event of receiving the appropriate agreements from all concerned. My second question therefore is, will the Minister be prepared to commit some of his senior officials to assist with that meeting or series of meetings?</p>
	<p pid="b.24.1/15">In the letter dated <phrase class="date" code="2009-12-22">22 December 2009</phrase> from the Minister of State, Department for Transport, which I referred to a moment ago, he told me:</p>
	<p pid="b.24.1/16" class="indent">&quot;You may be aware that the South West Region recently carried out a further review of its current programme. I am pleased to report that the Region continues to support this scheme and have, on an exceptional basis, accepted to increase the allocation for the Isles of Scilly scheme to &#163;36m. I hope this provides some reassurance that this scheme is still a priority for the Region and Department.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.24.1/17">Although I query how decisions can be made in a region where there is no line of democratic accountability, I will not probe that issue at the moment. None the less, I am pleased that that decision has been made and that the scheme remains a priority.</p>
	<p pid="b.24.1/18">That letter from the Minister of State was clearly written after the planning decision that I referred to, which was made on <phrase class="date" code="2009-12-14">14 December 2009</phrase>. Therefore, bearing in mind the rather catastrophic situation that we found ourselves in just before Christmas, I am reading it into the Minister of State's letter that there is some support from the Department for Transport to find a way forward for the scheme.</p>
	<p pid="b.24.1/19">The funding package for the project, which should secure the improved ferry scheme for the next 25 years, therefore comprises &#163;36 million of the Department for Transport's regional transport fund; &#163;11 million from the European regional development fund, because Cornwall, being the poorest region in the UK, is a convergence region, and &#163;10 million of loan capital from Cornwall council. So my final question to the Minister today is, because this project will now inevitably spill over beyond the current financial year and, I am sure, beyond the general election, before a full approval case can be presented to him and his Department, what advice or assistance can he offer to help us ensure that both the hard-won funds and the work that has been going on during the last six years to bring this project forward will not be lost and that the project will proceed? I also ask the Conservative Front-Bench spokesman and my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2016" name="Mark Hunter">the Member for Cheadle (Mark Hunter)</phrase> what happens to projects that do not reach full business case approval before a general election. I will be interested to hear in their winding-up speeches what reassurance they can offer.</p>
	<p pid="b.24.1/20">I do not expect from any of the three hon. Members copper-bottomed guarantees to my constituents on the Isles of Scilly or in Penzance that the funds will be in place, but it is important to give some indication on that. I am interested in their comments, bearing in mind that the project has now gone through so many stages of preparation. It is the eleventh hour for a final decision; I will return to the reasons why we are in such a parlous situation. I would find it helpful if all three hon. Members, especially the Minister, addressed the matter. The Minister may also wish to offer other advice or recommendations that might help ensure that the project is brought to fruition in the current difficult circumstances.</p>
	<p pid="b.24.1/21">It might be worth while to outline a few points by way of background. The project originated in some campaigning in which I was involved when I was first elected and a debate that I secured, oddly enough, eight years ago in this very Chamber and more or less at this time, on <phrase class="date" code="2002-01-08">8 January 2002</phrase>. It was a 90-minute debate entitled &quot;Rural and Island Transport&quot; in which I compared the subsidy provided to the Isles of Scilly-zero-to that offered pre and post-devolution to the isles of Scotland. Parity with the Scottish islands was the primary basis on which I argued that the Government should consider seriously the need for improvements and investment in the future of the Isles of Scilly ferry link.</p>
	<p pid="b.24.1/22">The plans for the ferry link emanate from that, as well as from concerns expressed by the Isles of Scilly Steamship Company that its turnover provided insufficient capacity for investment in the kind of vessel and the harbour infrastructure needed to bring the service up to both the safety standards expected by the Government and the standard of comfort relative to services elsewhere in Europe expected by the travelling public.</p>
	<p pid="b.24.1/23">The Isles of Scilly Steamship Company vessel Scillonian III was purpose-built in 1997-I hope that the Minister is listening-with the support of the Labour Government in the form of a &#163;1 million loan to assist with purchase and construction. Perhaps former Prime Minister Harold Wilson's connection with the Isles of Scilly had something to do with it. I am sure that he would not have been pulling strings at the time, but it would have assisted negotiations. Because of the extremely rough and inclement sea conditions at this time of year, the service runs seven months a year, from March to November, crossing the 42 nautical miles between Penzance and St. Mary's in the Isles of Scilly. A freight vessel, the Gry Maritha, also runs three times a week throughout the year and is an essential lifeline to the Isles of Scilly.</p>
	<p pid="b.24.1/24">The progress of the project has been good since 2003. I took a delegation to see the then Minister and Member for Plymouth, Devonport, David Jamieson. One thing led to another, and we negotiated and secured a project, which put the funding in place and encouraged local authorities to establish what they described as a route partnership between local councils and the Duchy of Cornwall, which owns substantial amounts of land and property in Cornwall and especially on the Isles of Scilly. In the early days, a proposal was made to include within the route partnership a bid to purchase a new helicopter for British International Helicopters, which provides a lifeline air service to the Isles of Scilly in addition to the fixed-wing aircraft that runs mainly from Land's End to St. Mary's. However, that element of the project evaporated over time and the partnership returned to the issue of the vessel.</p>
	<p pid="b.24.1/25">A great deal of progress has been made, particularly in recent years. The proposed design of the vessel has been agreed and competitive tenders have been made. Some are very good, particularly in the current market, and would provide the island service with a lot of boat for little money, so I am sure that the partnership will be keen to proceed with them and not lose them. However, the competitive tenders expire at the end of the month, when the partnership must either seek an extension or run the whole process again. Equally, regarding the two remaining companies operating the service through the process, the tender exercise has been completed and the tenders will expire mid-February.</p>
	<p pid="b.24.1/26">Permissions have been granted at both the harbour revision and planning stages for St. Mary's harbour on the Isles of Scilly, and the harbour revision order for Penzance has proceeded, although a judicial review challenge is pending, so I do not imagine that the Minister will want to comment on that. The crucial issue is that the listed building consent planning application for Penzance has not proceeded, having failed on <phrase class="date" code="2010-12-14">14 December</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.24.1/27">A great deal of progress has been made over time, but the question is how the project has foundered on what are known in Penzance as the Battery rocks, which stand to the south of Penzance harbour. Difficult decisions have been made, and after much scoping and a working consultants' report, the narrowing of options regarding the vessel types and port infrastructure has proceeded with little contention, although a lot of the process was bound to be contentious. It was important that the route partnership and its membership listened and were prepared to compromise when they found themselves in difficulty.</p>
	<p pid="b.24.1/28">The proposed scheme for Penzance was exhibited on <phrase class="date" code="2008-09-30">30 September 2008</phrase>. Until then, because the decisions to be taken were all local, I, like any other Member of Parliament, kept out of them. The more contentious they were, the more likely I was to keep out of them, also like any other Member of Parliament, but what concerned me after the exhibition was the nature of some of the objections to the proposals and the vociferousness and widespread concern about how the project was proceeding. Although I did not wish to offer a view on any of the planning merits of the proposal, I was concerned about the process, particularly the consultation with the local community and English Heritage's recommendation that, for the project to proceed, the route partnership should seriously investigate alternatives. I was worried that that simply was not happening.</p>
	<p pid="b.24.1/29">I called for constructive dialogue and for calm and rational consideration of the route partnership's favoured proposal and the alternatives. As a result, rather than proceeding with the planning application in October 2008, the route partnership delayed and reconsidered. It held a further public engagement exhibition in Penzance in January 2009 and proceeded with the planning application in February. It was clear to me that there would be serious difficulties, given the extent and nature of the objections. Fearing that the project was about to be scuppered, I called on the partners to come together to take a genuine look at the alternatives. I am pleased to say that the officers agreed to such constructive discussions and that they began in April last year.</p>
	<p pid="b.24.1/30">At the same time, English Heritage wrote to Cornwall county council-that was before it was changed to a single unitary authority, which I voted against. English Heritage's letter of <phrase class="date" code="2010-04-21">21 April</phrase> followed other letters expressing its deep concern about the proposal and outlining the significance of the location for the proposed freight terminal. It was to be built in the part of the harbour with the most historical significance. In particular, a south-facing wall where five centuries of harbour development were visible was to be covered in concrete, and that was the fundamental reason why English Heritage urged the council to consider alternatives. The letter asked that</p>
	<p pid="b.24.1/31" class="indent">&quot;consideration be given to locating the passenger and freight terminus in an alternative location, less harmful to the historic environment.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.24.1/32">The lengthy correspondence from Mr. Simon Ramsden on behalf of the regional office of English Heritage contained clear warnings.</p>
	<p pid="b.24.1/33">On <phrase class="date" code="2010-06-12">12 June</phrase>, during negotiations in which I was encouraging the council to look at the alternatives, the planning application was eventually withdrawn and an options study agreed to. I convened meetings to ensure that that was pursued. Halcrow, the consultancy that had been engaged previously, was appointed to undertake the work. The Penzance Harbour Revision Order 2009 was finally passed on <phrase class="date" code="2010-08-27">27 August</phrase>. Halcrow's options appraisal report, which came out at the end of August, confirmed that although the preferred option of building on Battery rocks would be the most expensive in capital costs, it had the lowest forecast operational costs.</p>
	<p pid="b.24.1/34">That was a crucial turning point in the process because the route partnership had the opportunity to review its approach. Leaving aside the merits of the options and the report, my assessment was that the route partnership's favoured option was the least politically deliverable. I use that expression deliberately because my assessment was concerned not with economics, but with policy. I was concerned that the proposal simply would not get through because of the strong opposition to which I have referred. English Heritage, a statutory consultee, was saying that there should be more commitment to considering the alternatives. There was a threat and a likelihood of judicial review or legal challenge if the favoured option was decided on because a number of process issues were not satisfactory.</p>
	<p pid="b.24.1/35">As all Members of Parliament know, when providing political leadership, one has to take the rough with the smooth. There was a lot of rough coming my way at that time, but I do not mind that. We needed a considered, calm and rational debate on the proposals, but sadly we had a response that fanned-or poured paraffin on-the flames of the concerns and opposition in Penzance. Cornwall council's portfolio holder made injudicious comments and the Council of the Isles of Scilly felt it could tell Penzance what it should do with its harbour-not a clever move. That tipped the project into almost certain political undeliverability in September.</p>
	<p pid="b.24.1/36">I called seven public meetings: six on the Isles of Scilly and one in Penzance. They were well attended and the people were extremely passionate. The majority of those who spoke on the Isles of Scilly were passionately opposed to the line I was taking, to my warnings and to my preferred option, even though that is not a material consideration because I have no say in the matter, as the Minister knows. However, I answered the question of which option I preferred, rather than avoiding it.</p>
	<p pid="b.24.1/37">The Council of the Isles of Scilly proposed a motion that tried to draw the Minister into the merits of the planning decisions that were to be taken by Cornwall council, rather than communicating its concerns to the council. It also made some inaccurate and disparaging remarks about me, but I will leave that aside. I was provoked to write to the Minister to apologise that he had been troubled by questions that should not have been directed at him. I expressed concern that the actions of the Council of the Isles of Scilly risked derailing the project and about whether the council was representing the views of the islanders.</p>
	<p pid="b.24.1/38">As a result of the motion, I received my largest postbag ever of personal support from the islanders. Sadly, I cannot give names to the comments because of the fear of reprisals and intimidation on the islands, but I will give a flavour of what was written. On <phrase class="date" code="2010-10-16">16 October</phrase>, the day after the council's decision, one person wrote:</p>
	<p pid="b.24.1/39" class="indent">&quot;I personally do not think the residents of the Isles of Scilly should 'tell Penzance residents what they should do in their area/community'.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.24.1/40">It goes on to say that</p>
	<p pid="b.24.1/41" class="indent">&quot;the word so many people are forgetting is PARTNERSHIP. Not a dictatorship, which as an observer, appears to be the stance from the Council of Isles of Scilly. As MP for the Isles of Scilly, please could you ask for an enquiry as to why the Route Partnership failed to engage with the Penzance residents and how this 11th hour mess could have been avoided?&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.24.1/42">Another letter stated:</p>
	<p pid="b.24.1/43" class="indent">&quot;Unfortunately there is a climate of intimidation and few wish to speak out...I wish you strength and patience. Do not allow our council to bully or intimidate you. We rely on you to remain our voice of reason.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.24.1/44">Another person points out</p>
	<p pid="b.24.1/45" class="indent">&quot;how appalled I am by the recent actions from the Council of the Isles of Scilly, and I express all my sympathy to you when you face such unjustified, unfair, and misinformed fire&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.24.1/46">A further letter dated <phrase class="date" code="2010-10-19">19 October</phrase> states:</p>
	<p pid="b.24.1/47" class="indent">&quot;Many people, with a great deal of ability, within these Islands feel they are excluded from entering into debate on major issues that affect their community due to conflicting interests and the fear of persecution by what has become over the last few years an all-powerful local authority, led under the mantra of 'divide and rule.'&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.24.1/48">Another person has written:</p>
	<p pid="b.24.1/49" class="indent">&quot;I was extremely sorry to learn about the way you have been treated by the Isles of Scilly Council&quot;-</p>
	<p pid="b.24.1/50">and so on. There were many more such letters.</p>
	<p pid="b.24.1/51">I mention those letters simply because they show the concern that decisions were not necessarily being taken on behalf of the community as a whole. As I mentioned, on <phrase class="date" code="2010-12-14">14 December</phrase>, of course, Cornwall council's strategic planning committee recommended the rejection-it cannot ultimately make a decision-of the planning application for the critical element of Penzance harbour.</p>
	<p pid="b.24.1/52">There is no satisfaction in going through an &quot;I told you so&quot; routine when such an important project has been seriously jeopardised by what can be described only as wanton obstinacy. There is tremendous concern about the future of this important link, and although I do not think the link itself is in jeopardy, the project certainly is. Clearly, in such circumstances, there is no shortage of accusations flying around.</p>
	<p pid="b.24.1/53">Where do we go from here? In his message to council members before Christmas, the chief executive of Cornwall council stated:</p>
	<p pid="b.24.1/54" class="indent">&quot;We are continuing to work with English Heritage to remove its objections to certain aspects of the scheme.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.24.1/55">I have spoken to English Heritage and it is not aware that any representations are currently being made. He went on to say that</p>
	<p pid="b.24.1/56" class="indent">&quot;we are seriously looking at Falmouth as an alternative.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.24.1/57">Such a proposal would extend the ferry time by at least another hour and a half, would probably jeopardise the link completely and is therefore is not a serious option-in fact, I do not expect the Minister to comment on that.</p>
	<p pid="b.24.1/58">Many people are concerned about what has happened, and a number of criticisms have been made about the political nature of the decisions taken. There has been particular confusion about the kind of planning application that should have been made at Cornwall council's level, and concern about the lack of proper consultation, the misjudgement that I have mentioned, and the perceived bias of some of the planning documents.</p>
	<p pid="b.24.1/59">I mentioned a number of public meetings. More than 500 people turned up to the one in Penzance on a rainy Friday night-indeed, I believe that we had to turn people away because the hall did not have the capacity to take them. Some 500 people voted against the council's proposal and three voted in favour. I tried to urge the route partnership to play a part in that meeting, but it refused to engage with the public at that level. That is obviously an issue of deep concern.</p>
	<p pid="b.24.1/60">The two ships themselves-the Scillonian and the Gry Maritha-obviously provide a vital link to the Isles of Scilly. The Minister's Department-through the Maritime and Coastguard Agency-is clearly responsible for giving the ships their certificates of sea worthiness. I believe that once the freight ship itself completes this year's five-year survey, it will be seaworthy until 2015. Scillonian has a five-year cycle of surveys, which should at least mean that it is available until 2014. The sustainability of the link for the next few years is, I think, assured, unless the Minister has anything further to say about that.</p>
	<p pid="b.24.1/61">Although I passionately favour devolution and would like Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly to be given a great deal more power, as the Minister might know, I would like central Government to come in and offer support at this stage. I am keen to work with the Minister to achieve that. We need a quick review of the project and a quick exploration of the alternatives to the conundrum that Penzance faces. There are workable alternatives and the consultant's report certainly shows that.</p>
	<p pid="b.24.1/62">Perhaps the Minister will comment on the question of the extension to the deadline for the full approval submission. Such an extension is bound to happen, because I cannot see how the full approval submission can be given to his Department in the next four to six weeks. The matter will not therefore proceed before the end of this financial year. For that to happen, the Minister needs to indicate his discretion and intervene. I appreciate that legal consequences constrain what he can say, especially in the light of the judicial review of the harbour revision order for Penzance. However, leaving aside that order, there are substantial issues on which the Minister can comment in the context of the situation that we face.</p>
	<p pid="b.24.1/63">The portfolio holder for Cornwall council, Councillor Graeme Hicks-I do not think that I have mentioned his name already-said in the <i>Western Morning News</i> on <phrase class="date" code="2010-11-17">17 November</phrase> that the prime concern of the route partnership has not been to reduce capital costs, which will largely be covered by grant funding, which is vital to the islands' communities, but to decrease running costs, which will not be covered by such funding. The Minister might wish to reflect on the use of capital funding to reduce the revenue consequences of such a project. Whatever package is ultimately put in place to secure this vital link, my constituents on the Isles of Scilly are keen to ensure that the islands are not saddled with unacceptably high freight costs. The funding package needs to be managed in a way that ensures the economic viability and affordability of the scheme, whatever infrastructure configuration is put in place. That should remain uppermost in the minds of those who seek a settlement of the issue.</p>
	<p pid="b.24.1/64">I am grateful for the opportunity to raise such a parochial issue. Obviously, I understand the limitations in place, but I look forward to hearing whether the Front-Bench spokespeople can express some kind of recognition of the difficulties or a commitment to dealing with them. I know that other projects around the UK will experience such difficulties, because there is a risk of slippage beyond the financial year and the general election.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2010-01-05b.31.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2016" speakername="Mark Hunter" colnum="31"  time="011:38:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm100105/halltext/100105h0005.htm#1001053000509">
	<p pid="b.31.0/1">It is a pleasure to have the opportunity to contribute to this important debate under your chairmanship, Mr. Olner. I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1801" name="Andrew George">the Member for St. Ives (Andrew George)</phrase> on securing a debate on what is clearly a significant issue for the people he has the privilege of representing in Parliament.</p>
	<p pid="b.31.0/2">Having listened to my hon. Friend's contribution in great detail, I frankly do not have much more to add to the debate. He has covered almost all the relevant details of the subject in his usual calm and rational way, and he has spoken passionately and knowledgeably on the issue-indeed, he has a track record of doing so since he was first elected to the House in 1997.</p>
	<p pid="b.31.0/3">My hon. Friend has discussed a link that is important not only for the people who live on the Isles of Scilly, of whom there are approximately 2,000, but for the wider community that he represents. That link is, of course, also important to the many thousands of people who visit the area because it is a tourist hot spot. Indeed, the people of the Isles of Scilly would be the first to acknowledge, as would my hon. Friend, how important the tourism industry is to them.</p>
	<p pid="b.31.0/4">My hon. Friend set out the case for a new Isles of Scilly ferry service comprehensively and in his usual quiet and rational manner. In doing so, he made a simple and heartfelt plea on behalf of the people he represents, and I think we would all agree that that deserves a positive response from the Minister. It is a measure of the man that, despite all the difficulties and challenges of the issue, which he has chronicled in detail, and the controversy and the various threats of intimidation, which most of us will have heard with great concern, he has stood steadfast and continued his campaign for the much-needed ferry link between St. Mary's and Penzance.</p>
	<p pid="b.31.0/5">The ferry link, as I have said, is an issue of extreme concern not only to the 2,000-odd people who live there, but to the wider community. It is about links between the isles and the mainland. Public transport-indeed, transport links generally-is just as important, some would say more so, in the remote parts of the UK as in any other part. We must try to find a way to ensure that the project proceeds, despite the setback of Cornwall council's planning committee's failure to back the plans. My hon. Friend warned that that might happen, and today he simply seeks ministerial support to extend the funding deadline so that all workable options can be explored.</p>
	<p pid="b.31.0/6">The message is straightforward. Will the Minister throw the scheme a lifeline, so that those across the spectrum who want the project to succeed-my hon. Friend made great play of the fact that it is not a partisan or party political issue-can work together to seek a viable solution? Surely, the Government who are elected after the general election, of whatever political hue, will not abandon their commitment to those who live on the Scillies. I am prepared to say on behalf of my party that, despite the setbacks that were well chronicled in my hon. Friend's contribution, we believe a new Isles of Scilly ferry link is not only desirable but essential, and public funding is a key component of that.</p>
	<p pid="b.31.0/7">I think we would all agree that my hon. Friend made the case today comprehensively, in great detail and in a calm, rational and bipartisan manner, and it deserves that kind of response. I, too, look forward to what the Minister might be able to say by way of extending a lifeline and some hope to the people who live on the Isles of Scilly and the wider community that the ferry link will go ahead and will not fall merely as the result of a funding deadline that, despite the best efforts of so many, will not be met. That is the key question that should occupy Members in the debate today.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2010-01-05b.32.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1479" speakername="Julian Brazier" colnum="32"  time="011:43:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm100105/halltext/100105h0006.htm#1001053000510">
	<p pid="b.32.0/1">It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Mr. Olner. I, too, congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1801" name="Andrew George">the hon. Member for St. Ives (Andrew George)</phrase> on securing the debate. It is clear how committed he is to his constituents and how much work he has put into the issue, although I am a little puzzled by his stance, to which I shall return in a moment.</p>
	<p pid="b.32.0/2">I do not know the beautiful Isles of Scilly at all, but I get second-hand reports of them that are full of praise from a family member who holidays there regularly. The ferries to the isles from Penzance are pivotal to tourism not only for the Scillies, but for Penzance, where they play a significant role in the local economy, as the hon. Gentleman acknowledged. I am impressed by the project to regenerate Penzance harbour and the impact it could have on improving transport links for the town as well as for the isles. Derek Thomas, the Conservative parliamentary candidate for St. Ives, has told me that it is essential that the sea link from Penzance to the Isles of Scilly is improved, both for handling freight and for improving the passenger experience, through a new ferry service.</p>
	<p pid="b.32.0/3">I understand that three options were examined, of which two are still on the table. Option A, the main option that the hon. Member for St. Ives discussed, falls within the &#163;44 million budget originally allocated, including the substantial grants from central Government. It would comprise freight and terminal facilities on reclaimed land at Penzance harbour and a pier extension with rock armour protection for the pier. Cornwall county council was minded to accept that option. It had already applied, as the hon. Gentleman mentioned, for a harbour revision order, which involved significant changes to the grade II-listed harbour sea wall, and crucially, English Heritage accepted that. Sadly, English Heritage seems to have changed its tune and objected to option A because of concerns about the preservation of aspects of Penzance harbour, whose antiquity I fully recognise.</p>
	<p pid="b.32.0/4">Cornwall county council's strategic planning committee was forced to reject that proposal because it was told that it would not get past English Heritage. Nevertheless, Councillor Alec Robertson, the leader of the council, has told me that he continues to believe that that is a viable option and is working with English Heritage to resolve its concerns-I think that the Minister is nodding.</p>
	<p pid="b.32.0/5">Option B was dropped because it would have involved hugely increased operating costs and destroyed several local jobs. The only remaining option is option C, which proposes that the freight depot should be relocated to the village of Longrock and that the old Trinity House museum at Penzance should be converted into a passenger terminal. It does not include plans to extend the pier or provide it with rock armour protection. Both options include a new combined passenger freight vessel, which would operate at similar speeds to the existing Scillonian-I will not repeat the points that the hon. Member for St. Ives made about that.</p>
	<p pid="b.32.0/6">If a consensus is not reached on one of the options, and option A is clearly the favoured one, the historical links could be under threat as there is a danger that Falmouth could re-emerge as an option. For all the reasons the hon. Gentleman set out, that would be extremely unsatisfactory.</p>
	<p pid="b.32.0/7">According to the Office for National Statistics, about 100 jobs in Penzance and on the Isles of Scilly are within water-based transport. I understand that the recent Mott MacDonald analysis conducted on behalf of Cornwall country council showed that 31 of those jobs relate to the passenger and freight ferries operating from the harbour.</p>
	<p pid="b.32.0/8">Visitors generate revenue for local shops, restaurants, bars and taxi firms, and the council estimates that approximately 190 jobs in Penzance are dependent, directly or indirectly, on business links with Scilly. Although average earnings in the south-west hotel and restaurant sector are extremely low-&#163;11,500 a year-those jobs inject a combined &#163;2.2 million into the local economy, so Penzance's economy would be affected as well as that of the Isles of Scilly.</p>
	<p pid="b.32.0/9">It is also important to stress the impact that suspending freight services would have on Penzance. Some 12,000 tonnes of freight are delivered to the Isles of Scilly each year, 95 per cent. of which goes through Penzance, so the loss of freight services to the Isles of Scilly could kill off Penzance's harbour.</p>
	<p pid="b.32.0/10">Option C, which I have mentioned, would have several practical difficulties. It would delay the project further, which in turn would lead to the need to repeat vessel tenders that will have gone out of date, and another delay in the harbour works to suit the seasonable need of marine works. In a letter to the hon. Member for St. Ives, the Minister who was then responsible for shipping made it clear that the Government would withdraw funding if the agreed time scales were not met-I hope that the Minister will come back to that point in his speech. The delay involved in option C would further increase the costs by &#163;5 million anyway, so that option looks less attractive.</p>
	<p pid="b.32.0/11">Unsurprisingly, both Derek Thomas and Cornwall county council have told me that they have concluded that option A offers the best solution. Operationally, it is simpler and easier to manage with activity on only one site. Option A would maximise harbour regeneration opportunities, and allow enhancement of the south pier, reclamation and rock armour protection along the full length of the listed harbour, thereby reducing storm damage to it. Investment in the Penzance south pier would reduce future maintenance costs on the grade II-listed pier via the rock armour protection to the seaward face, but all that depends on persuading English Heritage to change its mind.</p>

	<p pid="b.34.0/1">I entirely accept the hon. Gentleman's points about the significant importance of the link between Penzance and the Isles of Scilly for jobs and economic benefits to Penzance, but I am not sure that he has been well briefed on the impact of pursuing option A versus that of pursuing option C. The &#163;5 million figure that he cited would be for anticipated additional costs should the project be delayed, whether it be option A that causes the delay or a failure to pursue option C at an earlier stage, which would also result in delay.</p>

	<p pid="b.34.1/1">I accept the hon. Gentleman's point, but option C includes inherent further delays. I mentioned a couple of them, including the requirement to retender for the vessels. There is a further point: Cornwall council has estimated that option C would involve an additional cost of up to &#163;150,000 a year for the freight facility, so there is a substantial extra operating cost.</p>
	<p pid="b.34.1/2">I should say something further about the hon. Gentleman's handling of the matter. I make it clear that I fully understand his commitment, but when any constituency MP is faced with competing desires among elements of their constituency, with some people in favour of one thing and some in favour of another, they of course hold consultation meetings, and the outcomes of those meetings tend to depend, to some extent, on the part of the constituency in which they are held. However, at the end of the day, attacks on the process, even if there have been flaws in the it-I am not in a position to comment on that-are no substitute for coming to the view that a particular outcome is needed.</p>
	<p pid="b.34.1/3">As I understand it, the hon. Gentleman believes that the project is needed, and needed soon, which really means that option A is needed. He accuses the Council of the Isles of Scilly of intimidation, but I must say that I do not recognise that. One does not normally identify the Isles of Scilly as an area of huge intimidation-that is not the picture painted by my family member who frequently holidays there.</p>
	<p pid="b.34.1/4">The <i>Western Morning News </i>reported a view that the hon. Gentleman's meetings were</p>
	<p pid="b.34.1/5" class="indent">&quot;not a constructive way forward for the project at this late stage in proceedings&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.34.1/6">I know that the county council also raised several points about that. He must accept the logic of his own conclusion. There will be some elements in Penzance that will be sorry to see the changes involved in the process, but, if something is to happen in a reasonably timely fashion and without a lot of extra costs, option A is the realistic option on the table. To will the end but not the means is not consistent.</p>
	<p pid="b.34.1/7">The hon. Gentleman rightly asked-if I were a constituency MP in his position, I would have done the same-for a view from each of the Front-Bench spokesmen as to whether the project will be funded. He did not get an answer from his party's Front-Bench spokesman-</p>

	<p pid="b.35.5/1">I apologise. I was out for a moment to answer a message on my mobile phone, so I withdraw the point. I listened to the hon.

If he did so earlier while I was out of the room for a moment, I apologise and withdraw my comment.</p>
	<p pid="b.35.5/2">Given the current state of the public finances, it is impossible for a spokesman for a party that might well be in office in a few months' time-I do not anticipate anything from the election, but there is a reasonable prospect that my party may be in office-to make an absolute commitment on public spending. However, there are two points that I can make.</p>
	<p pid="b.35.5/3">First, it seems wholly unreasonable to say that a deadline a few weeks away must be a hard and fast condition for receiving the money. Clearly, that is ridiculous. Secondly, I hope that, when considering this matter, English Heritage will not allow itself to become simply a spanner in the works. I have the greatest admiration for the work that it does to protect important heritage, including a great deal in my constituency. However, given that it has already conceded much important ground in respect of the harbour revision order, I very much hope that it will not simply become a spanner in the works should it prove possible, as I very much hope that it will, for this extremely worthy project to go ahead.</p>

	<p pid="b.36.5/1">I offer best wishes for 2010, Mr. Atkinson. Let us hope that we have a constructive year. If Mr. Olner had still been here, I might have said &quot;successful&quot;, but I will not say that. Seasons greetings to you and to hon. Members in this Chamber.</p>
	<p pid="b.36.5/2">At the outset, I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1801" name="Andrew George">the hon. Member for St. Ives (Andrew George)</phrase> on securing this debate on a fundamentally important issue. It is important not only to those on the Isles of Scilly for reasons of social inclusion, education, economic prosperity and tourism. As <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2016" name="Mark Hunter">the hon. Member for Cheadle (Mark Hunter)</phrase> said, it is also fundamentally important to Penzance and the wider region for attracting people, jobs, business and trade to the region. It is important to all the good people who work and operate in the area.</p>
	<p pid="b.36.5/3">The Isles of Scilly came to my attention as a young lad in short trousers when that great former right hon. Member for Huyton holidayed there. What a marvellous leader he was. Having put that on the record, I should say that I recognise the importance of that area.</p>
	<p pid="b.36.5/4">If hon. Members could see my in-tray and that of the officials in the Department for Transport, they would see that the hon. Member for St. Ives has certainly been working hard, seeking a way forward on this important issue. I recognise that he has held seven public meetings and so on, and all that has happened. However, I am interested in the fact that he now wishes the Government in Whitehall, many hundreds of miles away from his constituency, to start imposing processes on democratically elected bodies. I say that genuinely, because I am not going to comment on quotes such as the one about whether the decisions were being taken on behalf of residents overall. All local authorities, whether the council of the Isles of Scilly or Cornwall council, need to take part in these processes, as part of the day-to-day process that goes on.</p>
	<p pid="b.36.5/5">I give this commitment at the outset: we support the need for there to be a viable passenger and freight service, which is important for all the reasons that I have just outlined, but I cannot dictate-I would be highly surprised if any Liberal Democrat Member suggested that I should dictate-what should be the final outcome. The hon. Member for St. Ives quoted someone saying something about this needing to be a partnership not a dictatorship, and that is exactly where the solution must be found. I will answer the hon. Gentleman's questions, which he set out clearly at the beginning, as I go through.</p>

	<p pid="b.37.0/1">I look forward to hearing the Minister's response to the other issues. I want to reassure him, in case he misunderstood, about the nature of the question that I was fundamentally asking. I am not asking him or his Department, or anyone in the Government, to come in and impose a solution in circumstances where a solution needs to be the product of decisions taken by the democratically accountable bodies representing the communities that are served by the service. However, I seek reassurance that his Department will assist-and that requires some executive decisions. Certainly, a decision on the extension of the funding can be taken only by his Department, not by local authorities.</p>

	<p pid="b.37.1/1">I hear what the hon. Gentleman is saying and I recognise that. Let me reassure hon. Members again that we are doing all that we can. My ministerial colleague, the Minister of State for Transport, said in a letter written in December that</p>
	<p pid="b.37.1/2" class="indent">&quot;officials are working very closely and positively with Cornwall Council on this scheme with the most recent meeting held&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.37.1/3">in the middle of November. We continue to do that because we want to find a solution. This is an emotive issue that goes beyond the normal sort of transport debate to the heart of creating and nurturing flourishing communities.</p>
	<p pid="b.37.1/4">Regrettably, I have been unable to meet the hon. Member for St. Ives, despite his asking me on a number of occasions. That is not, to quote again from the letter, a snub: it is because ongoing legal matters are involved, and that is the only reason why. I am sure that hon. Members are aware that I cannot discuss in detail the harbour revision order, the listed buildings consent order or the proposed planning application from Cornwall council. It would not be advisable for me, a decision-making Minister, to do that because I could be involved in processes later on. However, it might be useful if I answered the questions posed by the hon. Gentleman and gave an indication of the implications of any revised time scales. I hope that this scene-setting will help to take that forward.</p>
	<p pid="b.37.1/5">It is crucial to maintain the existing links between the mainland and the isles. I put that on the record because it is clearly our position. They are an essential lifeline to more than 2,000 islanders and they allow trade and tourism to flourish. Some 140,000 visitors a year are attracted to make the journey down to the beautiful south-west. To give an indication of how vital retaining the Isles of Scilly link is, the tourist board for the south-west estimated that 77 per cent. of employment on the islands relies on tourism. It cannot be much clearer that there is an overriding need, just in economic terms, to ensure that there is a safe, affordable link to the islands.</p>
	<p pid="b.37.1/6">For many people the stopover in the scenic and historic town of Penzance and surrounding areas before moving on to the islands is an essential part of the experience. That is why I picked up on the comment made by the hon. Member for Cheadle about the economic prosperity not just of the isle, but of Penzance and the surrounding area. That is all part and parcel of the work that goes on. An assessment in 2009 said that 190 jobs in Penzance alone are directly or indirectly related to tourism and trade with the Isles of Scilly. Those issues should feature prominently and those two employment facts should be at the forefront of our thinking about the future and the timing of the delivery of a solution to the issues that we face.</p>
	<p pid="b.37.1/7">As hon. Members have already highlighted, current links include a plane from Land's End and a helicopter from Penzance, which continue to offer excellent, speedy transport links to the islands. Equally, the existing passenger vessel, Scillonian III, and the freight vessel, Gry Maritha, provide the unique travel experience enjoyed by many-although I understand it is not so good when the swell is up. I had that experience when I was in the North sea. I have been advised by members of my own office that the journey across on Scillonian III is beautiful. However, we have to recognise that although various works, including maintenance works, have been undertaken and that it probably has a certificate until 2012 on the passenger side, which might be able to be extended, there is clearly an issue vis-&#224;-vis health and safety and long-term sustainability that must be taken into account.</p>

	<p pid="b.38.0/1">The Minister is aware that the Maritime and Coastguard Agency regularly inspects the Scillonian III. I understand that, as a passenger ferry, it is subject to a five-year round of annual inspections. Obviously, the thing that is under inspection most in relation to the Scillonian III is its life-saving apparatus, which may have an impact on the passenger numbers that it can take. However, I hope that we can work together and ensure that we are communicating and will fully understand if the vessel requires some extension of life with regard to the certificate, which will be necessary should this project be delayed, and that there is some co-operation from the Minister's Department in ensuring that the concerns about the longevity of the vessel are communicated and actioned properly.</p>

	<p pid="b.39.0/1">I take that point on board. The Scillonian III was built in 1977 and I want to ensure-as does the hon. Gentleman, I am sure-that we continue to have a regime that is fit for purpose and ensures the safety of passengers, staff and operatives who use such vessels. That must be the overriding concern. If I am right, two overriding considerations were taken into account in 2002-03, one of which was the upgrading of the quays, which was needed to allow safer and more efficient passenger and freight movement. Most importantly, there was the need to acquire a new vessel or vessels, since the current vessels are likely to be past their service fitness by 2012.</p>
	<p pid="b.39.0/2">As already indicated, the Scillonian III has a licence to operate until February 2012. It is part of the MCA process to continue reviewing that, but we are talking about long-term viability and it is clearly not going to go much further than that date. The freight vessel has been subject to major repairs and is licensed until 2014. Further extensions to the licence may be possible, but that must be underpinned by a firm commitment to replace those vessels at the earliest opportunity.</p>
	<p pid="b.39.0/3">Cornwall council's proposal to replace both vessels with a single vessel for handling passengers and freight in a safer and more comfortable fashion has been clearly outlined, recognising the two overriding criteria that were identified in 2002. Improvements to the harbours at St. Mary's and Penzance would be needed to accommodate the larger single vessel. Obviously, there are always bones of contention with any such proposal. As <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1479" name="Julian Brazier">the hon. Member for Canterbury (Mr. Brazier)</phrase> said, that will always be the case due to the nature of planning and major changes, but we need to find the right way to proceed on that basis. It is partly the role of Cornwall council, along with the Council of the Isles of Scilly, to find ways through. I understand that concerns continue regarding the sight lines along Jubilee Pool, the future of Battery Rock beach and the proposed new terminal.</p>
	<p pid="b.39.0/4">I will not go through the rights and wrongs of what we now know as option A and option C, but I will state again that securing a long-term solution must allow the sea link to operate economically. It must be done on an economic basis or it will not work. I recognise some of the arguments about that being more expensive and issues about freight operations, but this must be done on an economic basis or it will have no sustainability. Any solution must secure vital jobs in Penzance and the island, and it must allow the Scillonians to contribute to the wider UK economy and community and allow passengers and freight to move safely. Those are our key concerns, which I am sure are shared across the Chamber.</p>

	<p pid="b.39.1/1">In terms of assessing the merits of the scheme before the full approval submission is made, the Minister will be aware that as a fall-back, both councils suggest that this might go to Falmouth as an alternative-a lot of people raise their eyebrows when they hear that. Given the test that he has just set for such an approval, I am sure he would acknowledge that such an alternative would require an entirely new business case, and the whole project would have to be started again. A business case of that nature would take at least 10 months to complete, and would probably require about half a million pounds of investment to undertake all the scoping and investigation work. I would be interested to hear the Minister's comments on that.</p>

	<p pid="b.40.0/1">I was coming on to the implications of that. The hon. Gentleman is right: if there is to be any major revision to the proposals, we will need a new appraisal process that would, quite rightly, have to be followed to ensure that a business case could be made and to protect the public funds and so on.</p>
	<p pid="b.40.0/2">There have been some issues about whether an options analysis was undertaken. My understanding is that in 2004, the route partnership started looking at the details and the range of options for delivery of the scheme, on the basis that I outlined a moment or two ago. It was agreed that the basis behind the options and analysis would be that the vessel and harbour-side operations would be self-financing, and would not continue to have revenue implications for the public sector through subsidised fares or freight costs. The scheme would need to provide for a payback to Cornwall council of any moneys that were provided, and create a sinking fund for the replacement of a new vessel in 20 to 25 years' time. Clearly, a prudent, sensible process was put in place. There were a number of scenarios to look at-doing nothing; doing a minimum option such as replacing the vessel; or doing something on a range of different harbour options, including alternative mainland port options, and alternative layouts for Penzance and St. Mary's harbours.</p>
	<p pid="b.40.0/3">The conclusion at local level was that option A was the best route forward as it had the smallest impact in terms of the development of the harbours, and was the most sustainable solution for the environment and as a business model. I understand that the route partnership undertook a comprehensive range of consultations on the necessary consents for the harbour revision order, the listed building consents at Penzance, and the planning and listed building consents at St. Mary's. As part and parcel of that process, an additional &#163;400,000 was found to review the potential of option C. That detailed financial analysis showed that such a solution would not solve the health and safety issues that I raised about port security. It also showed that the out-of-town depot would have increased operating costs of around &#163;300,000 a year, with no greater revenue. That was confirmed by a body that operates another out-of-town freight facility on the Isle of Wight. A number of assessments were made in getting to where the local stakeholders and bodies currently are. It would be a sad day if a workable solution could not come forward and a lifeline for economic prosperity was placed at risk.</p>
	<p pid="b.40.0/4">On the funding arrangements, I commend the south-west region for identifying the Isles of Scilly link as a priority scheme for the region. The region has had a number of pressures on it in respect of a range of transport demands, as many regions do. Not long before taking this portfolio, I made a three-day visit to the south-west and saw some of the work being undertaken at Truro and St. Austell. I opened the new Dobwalls bypass. There is a range of pressures, but I recognise that the south-west region has put the scheme very high on its agenda, and rightly so.</p>
	<p pid="b.40.0/5">The scheme was supported in the first round of regional funding allocations, and in last year's update to the region's transport programme continued to be so. The region has proposed an increase to the scheme, with a revised regional allocation of &#163;36 million. That is a resounding reflection of the importance that the regional partners attach to the scheme, for all the reasons that we have identified.</p>
	<p pid="b.40.0/6">The South West of England Regional Development Agency has also given its full support to the scheme, and long may the RDAs continue to play an important role in helping with economic development for regions such as the south-west. I am sure that the hon. Member for Canterbury would like to agree. The South West of England RDA has identified &#163;11 million-that has been made available-from the convergence fund to support the upgrade of the harbours. There is also, of course, funding from Cornwall council. The scheme has in place for the first time all the funding sources that it requires.</p>

	<p pid="b.41.2/1">Rather ironically, the decision taken by the regional development agency is to spend money that has been allocated to Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly through the European convergence programme, and of course many people in Cornwall and on the Isles of Scilly believe that such decisions would be better taken in Cornwall than by an unaccountable and unelected body covering the Government zone of the south-west.</p>

	<p pid="b.41.3/1">However, this is about bringing together minds and having representatives from local authorities-from Cornwall council in this case-and so on involved. It is about partnership, going back to the very first comment of the hon. Member for St. Ives. It is about partnership, not dictatorship, and drawing together many strands of importance to ensure that we have economically viable regions. That is exactly what has been happening.</p>
	<p pid="b.41.3/2">That said, it is evident that an appropriate scheme needs to be found, and quickly. The convergence funding must be programmed by the end of 2013 and spent by mid-2015. With pressures elsewhere and such a sizeable commitment involved, any submissions for funds made towards the end of the programme may be too late to secure the &#163;11 million required. Those are some of the issues that must exercise the minds of local and regional stakeholders in finding a way through.</p>
	<p pid="b.41.3/3">The south-west region will need to consider whether retaining the island link as a top priority represents good use of its capital allocations. Clearly, it believes that at the moment, because it has reaffirmed that and the allocation has been increased to &#163;36 million. Spend on the Isles of Scilly vessel and the harbour is due to start this year. With potential delay, regional partners may consider reprioritising this scheme and bringing forward another scheme from the region. Given the steps that the region has taken to improve scheme delivery and given other calls on funds, the Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly link could find itself reprioritised to later in the current 10-year transport programme, which runs to 2018-19. I think that all those involved in the debate today and the people of Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly would wish to avoid that scenario.</p>
	<p pid="b.41.3/4">As I said at the beginning, the officials at the Department for Transport have been working closely with all funding partners associated with the scheme and have taken a broader view of the economic and social issues attached to the scheme to ensure that it is ready for delivery. Working up alternative schemes to the one currently presented to the Department is possible but will be time-consuming and costly for the council to pursue, and there is no guarantee that the complex and hard-won funding arrangement in place today will be available when a new proposal is tabled. I believe that it is reasonable that hon. Members and others involved are aware of the risks to funding and relative priorities and how that impacts on the timing of replacement of the ageing vessels. Let me-</p>

	<p pid="b.42.2/1">The Minister refers to &quot;the region&quot; as if that body is somehow accountable to those in Cornwall and on the Isles of Scilly. I have to say that the decision-making process that it is engaged in is pretty opaque to those who consume the outcome of that decision making. Is it entirely a decision that is delegated to that body that makes decisions on behalf of the Government zone of the south-west as a whole, or do the Minister and his Department have any influence at all in the decisions that it takes? It clearly is not directly democratically accountable to the people whom it serves.</p>

	<p pid="b.42.3/1">This is an interesting debate. Clearly, the south-west regional body has said that it believes that one of the top priorities or the top priority is to go forward with the link service-with all the associated works-which needs to be in place for a host of reasons, and to take it through all the modelling and so on that is required to ensure that it is viable and has a sustainable future.</p>
	<p pid="b.42.3/2">The hon. Member for St. Ives will be well aware that record investment has gone into transport at regional and local level. We have said that it is for regional bodies to consider the schemes that are there and what is required to meet needs, whether that involves objectives to create homes and communities or jobs and prosperity. It is a question of bringing together all those areas to decide which are the best schemes that will help them to deliver their key targets for their regions. Clearly, a set of criteria is laid down to help that process, but it has been a great development that areas are brought together in that way. Rather than just whacking in schemes from Whitehall, with someone sitting in a room saying, &quot;Yes, this is very important. We'll have this scheme but we won't have that one&quot; or &quot;We'll have that one; Penzance doesn't matter&quot;, it is far better that that regional prioritisation, which is best understood at local level, is delivered at local level.</p>

	<p pid="b.43.1/1">I want to respond to one or two other points that have been raised and talk about a way forward. There is no deadline on the full approval submission. A business case could be submitted only when all the statutory processes-the legal and the planning-had been completed. The harbour revision order is subject to judicial review. As the hon. Gentleman will know, I have no powers over that to take it forward, but that is the backdrop to the process that is going on.</p>
	<p pid="b.43.1/2">I am delighted to hear the hon. Member for Canterbury say that the leader of Cornwall council continues to have dialogue with English Heritage. Indeed, I am delighted that the hon. Member for St. Ives says that he knows that there are people at English Heritage who are working hard to find a way forward. That is exactly what has to happen at that level, and I urge people to continue it. The planning application can then be considered as well. It is in that way that we will get a solution to the problem.</p>
	<p pid="b.43.1/3">Finally on funding, I have never said that we would withdraw the funding, but let me say, in terms of this being an election year, that certainly we have made it very clear that transport issues are important. I have said how important this matter is to the islanders as well as to Penzance and the wider community. I recognise its importance for prosperity, social inclusion and wider issues. Clearly, we will continue to ensure that transport is at the forefront of our spending as we have done over the past 10 years, but I certainly urge all local stakeholders to work hard to find the solution.</p>

	Treasury Accounting (Natural Capital)

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2010-01-05b.44.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1446" speakername="Barry Gardiner" colnum="44"  time="012:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm100105/halltext/100105h0007.htm#1001053000540">
	<p pid="b.44.1/1">I wish you the compliments of the season and a happy new year, Mr. Atkinson. The accuracy and transparency of Government accounts have long been accepted as among the fundamental pillars of good governance and democratic accountability, and it was for that reason that William Gladstone established the Public Accounts Committee almost 150 years ago. It is for that reason, too, that we have an Office for National Statistics. It is also why the Government publish a pre-Budget report and why every Budget day comes with not just a red box but, more importantly, a Red Book.</p>
	<p pid="b.44.1/2">In their policy decisions, the Government must be clear that they are using the country's resources wisely and efficiently. If they are to be sure that economic growth will be sustainable into the future, it is crucial to account for the impact of economic activity on the natural environment. It is also important to be able accurately to assess the value of the natural capital on which so much economic activity is based.</p>
	<p pid="b.44.1/3">Nature provides human society with an enormous range of benefits, which go well beyond the obvious commodities of food and fuel, for which we are accustomed to paying a market price. The benefits include ecosystem services, such as the soil stabilisation provided by forests and the pollination carried out by insects, coastal protection, climate regulation, nutrient cycling and water purification. They even include amenity services with aesthetic and recreational value.</p>
	<p pid="b.44.1/4">Recognising that many of those services are predominantly public goods, however, presents a considerable problem for Government accounting and effective policy making. Classical economics treats such benefits and ecosystem services as externalities-free goods with no market price. Given that they have no market price, their destruction does not show up as a cost in the balance of costs and benefits. As a result, natural ecosystems become depleted and the services that they provide become degraded, and human society suffers the consequences of that loss of natural capital. We lose clean air and suffer asthma. The fish in our seas disappear and we lose a vital source of food. We destroy our forests and suffer climate change; we build a cement factory and lose a beautiful view.</p>
	<p pid="b.44.1/5">Such changes are the inevitable consequence of human beings living beyond their environmental means and consuming every 12 months the resources that the planet takes 16 months to renew or replace. That is a credit bubble of far more terrifying proportions than the one that the world has just experienced. It saddles our children with debts that they might never be able to repay, because we have consumed not just money but whole ecosystems, and nature does not do bail-outs.</p>
	<p pid="b.44.1/6">That credit bubble has come about because Government accounting systems have not adequately been able to incorporate the true value of nature. If we wish to understand the true value of nature, we must do better at understanding the true nature of value. The Treasury Green Book sets out guidance to the civil service on appraisal and evaluation in central Government-indeed, that is reflected in its subtitle. The Green Book constitutes binding guidance to Departments and Executive agencies, and its latest edition has many virtues. It has replaced the old discount rate of 6 per cent. with one of 3.5 per cent. in real terms. It has introduced adjustment procedures to address the systemic optimism that has afflicted the proper appraisal of policies in the past. However, on the key issue of valuing environmental, non-market impacts, it is hopelessly inadequate.</p>
	<p pid="b.44.1/7">Here are some examples of the advice given on various ecosystem services. On biodiversity, the Green Book says:</p>
	<p pid="b.44.1/8" class="indent">&quot;The benefits of biodiversity can be difficult to measure, define and value.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.44.1/9">Of water, it says:</p>
	<p pid="b.44.1/10" class="indent">&quot;It is not easy to derive economic values for damage costs of water pollutants.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.44.1/11">On air quality, it remarks:</p>
	<p pid="b.44.1/12" class="indent">&quot;Assessing the impact of particular policies on air quality is a complex science...In cases where detailed modelling is not possible, a reasoned statement of whether or not a particular policy is likely to result in greater or lesser emissions of particular pollutants should be included in the appraisal.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.44.1/13">Finally, on greenhouse gas emissions, it records:</p>
	<p pid="b.44.1/14" class="indent">&quot;Current methodologies for assessment of the effects of policies and measures on greenhouse gas emissions are policy specific with no standard guidance available...In cases where quantification of the climate change effect is impractical, an assessment of whether the policy is likely to increase or decrease emissions, combined with a qualitative assessment of the significance of this change, should be included in the appraisal.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.44.1/15">If those pieces of advice were translated to meet the criteria for the crystal mark for clear English, they would say, &quot;This is all very difficult to measure. Where possible, please provide an indication of whether pollution will increase or decrease and by how much. Where you don't know, please make an educated guess.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.44.1/16">I agree that the process of evaluating natural capital is tremendously difficult, but what is startling in the exhortations that I have read out is that, aside from recognising the difficulty of the exercise, they provide virtually no guidance to civil servants or Executive agencies about what they should proactively do to arrive at a valuation that could be fed into a cost-benefit analysis.</p>
	<p pid="b.44.1/17">These issues are relevant not just to domestic policy and domestic decision making. My hon. Friend the Minister has supported the millennium development goals, so I am confident that she understands only too well the fact that the problem of valuing natural capital has a profound effect on the lives of the world's poorest people and goes to the heart of questions of international justice and poverty alleviation. If we are to meet the millennium development goal of taking half the world's poor out of poverty by 2015, we must enable them to preserve the value of their natural capital, which represents more than 50 per cent. of the gross domestic product of the world's poor. The Minister will acknowledge that developing countries that have taken proper account of their natural capital, such as Botswana, have been markedly more successful economically than countries that have not done so, such as the Democratic Republic of the Congo.</p>
	<p pid="b.44.1/18">One way to refine our methods of evaluation is to work on specific examples where natural capital is under threat. One such example is tropical coral reefs. Six months ago, the Royal Society set out the following scientific analysis:</p>
	<p pid="b.44.1/19" class="indent">&quot;Coral reefs are the most biologically diverse habitats of the oceans and provide essential ecosystem goods and services to hundreds of millions of people.</p>
	<p pid="b.44.1/20" class="indent">Temperature-induced mass coral bleaching causing widespread mortality on the Great Barrier Reef and many other reefs of the world started when atmospheric CO2 exceeded 320ppm&quot;-</p>
	<p pid="b.44.1/21">parts per million. It continues:</p>
	<p pid="b.44.1/22" class="indent">&quot;At today's level of approximately 387ppm CO2, reefs are seriously declining and time-lagged effects will result in their continued demise with parallel impacts on other marine and coastal ecosystems.</p>
	<p pid="b.44.1/23" class="indent">Proposals to limit CO2 levels to 450ppm will not prevent the catastrophic loss of coral reefs from the combined effects of global warming and ocean acidification.</p>
	<p pid="b.44.1/24" class="indent">To ensure the long-term viability of coral reefs the atmospheric CO2 level must be reduced significantly below 350ppm.</p>
	<p pid="b.44.1/25" class="indent">In addition to major reductions in CO2 emissions, achieving this safe level will require the active removal of CO2 from the atmosphere.</p>
	<p pid="b.44.1/26" class="indent">Given the above, ecosystem-based management of other direct human induced stresses on coral reefs, such as overfishing, destructive fishing, coastal pollution and sedimentation, will be essential for the survival of coral reefs on which so many people depend.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.44.1/27">That is a quotation from the Royal Society meeting of <phrase class="date" code="2009-07-06">6 July 2009</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.44.1/28">Only last month, in Copenhagen, the world spectacularly failed to agree a pathway to reduce emission levels to 450 ppm by 2050. The current saturation level stands at 370 ppm. Coral is doubly vulnerable to climate change because it cannot survive where CO2 concentrations make the pH balance of the sea water too acidic and it dies if the water becomes too warm.</p>
	<p pid="b.44.1/29">Tropical coral reefs are often referred to as the rain forests of the seas, because although they cover less than 2 per cent. of the planet's surface, they form the most biodiversity-rich ecosystem in the world, providing a home for more than one quarter of all the planet's fish species. They are therefore of tremendous economic importance, and more than 500 million people depend on them for their livelihoods. Estimates of the overall human welfare benefits from those ecosystems are significant. One estimate puts them at $172 billion annually. Those benefits arise not just from commercial and artisan fishing, but from shoreline protection, where the reefs help to prevent coastal erosion, as well as those from tourism and other recreational uses.</p>
	<p pid="b.44.1/30">I ask my hon. Friend specifically to task her officials to use tropical coral reefs as an appropriate study to refine their methods of ecosystem valuation. We have a superb opportunity to do that in relation to the current Foreign Office consultation on the future of the British Indian Ocean Territory. The Chagos archipelago in the Indian ocean comprises 55 tiny islands set in 250,000 square miles of what are some of the world's cleanest seas. It is one of the largest and healthiest coral atolls on the planet. The Foreign Office is consulting on whether that pristine coral reef should be established as a full, no-take marine protection area for the whole of the territorial waters. It is officially an environmental preservation and protection zone, and a fisheries conservation and management zone, and evidence suggests that if that action were to be taken, the British Indian Ocean Territory might be one of the coral reefs to hold out the longest against climate change, and could act as a potential seed bank for the reintroduction of coral to areas where the indigenous tropical reefs had been degraded and bleached. That could enable coral reefs to be re-established, once anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions were brought down to more manageable levels.</p>
	<p pid="b.44.1/31">There is one additional unique benefit that such a study of coral reefs may bring in improving our understanding of the valuation of natural capital. It relates to the fact that the degradation of the ecosystem is approaching a threshold of irreversibility. The Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity climate issues update report of September pointed out:</p>
	<p pid="b.44.1/32" class="indent">&quot;Monetary analysis may be misleading if we do not know how close a system is to a threshold. Care needs to be taken not simply to extrapolate using an underlying assumption of continued incremental losses in the ecosystem function. To illustrate with an extreme example, if the marginal quantum of benefits being valued happens to be the last available of its kind, then scarcity and ethics would set a completely different 'price' on that last quantum. What we face with coral reefs is not a 'marginal' problem, and the economics needs to reflect this. The reported science suggests that anthropogenic emissions have brought the coral reef ecosystem to the brink of potential irreversible collapse. Thus we may have encountered our first major global ecosystem 'threshold'. As pointed out...we need to move beyond marginal cost-benefit analysis and consider other dimensions of value: the ethical and social as well as the economic. We need to assess survival risks for this entire biome and its implications for ocean and coastal productivity and for human welfare.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.44.1/33">There have been only five great extinction events in the history of all life on Earth. None have taken place within the span of the human species. Scientists believe that each began with the collapse of a global ecosystem. If coral reefs were to collapse, that could presage an extinction event such as humanity has never before witnessed. The loss of fish stocks would almost certainly result in a global food crisis, but of potentially far more serious consequence is the fact that it would almost certainly change the very nature of the oceans and their interaction with the rest of life on our planet. The French philosopher Blaise Pascal was famous for his wager in which a lifetime of religious observance was staked against an eternity of damnation. Modern accounting for natural capital must similarly be able to reflect in its assessment of risk and probability the fact that action to prevent the loss of global ecosystems might be costly in economic terms but that when the alternative is global catastrophe, the odds must be adjusted accordingly. Our planet is a delicately balanced system. The continuation of human life and culture-the language of Shakespeare and the music of Bach-depends on the actions of our generation in the next 10 years.</p>
	<p pid="b.44.1/34">I ask my hon. Friend to accept that national economic accounts need to be complemented by natural capital accounts, and that there is a need for the existence and value of ecosystem services to be better reflected in national accounting processes and policy makers' decision making. Biodiversity and ecosystems are poorly recorded in the national economic accounts. Often they feature as an economic resource only in relation to their private benefit. Ecosystem services supporting production are considered as mere externalities. All the free amenities and regulating services supplied by well functioning ecosystems are simply not recorded. Depreciation of the natural capital is not reflected in the price of goods. I ask my hon. Friend to agree that natural capital accounts should be used to help policy makers to understand the natural resource stock available-land, water, soil, biodiversity and biomass-and better to calculate the changes to it and the delivery of ecosystem services that result from it.</p>
	<p pid="b.44.1/35">As part of the efforts to integrate the environment into national accounts, some countries have been developing air accounts, water accounts, land accounts, soil accounts, emissions accounts, waste accounts, and so on. Forest accounts figure in almost all resource accounting exercises, including, I am happy to say, those of the UK. Some countries have also measured the carbon sequestration services provided by forests. However, whereas the measurement of carbon sequestration by forests seems to be well established and accurate, on the whole, the measurement of carbon sequestration by soil, water and other biota, and the stock of carbon, is much less well developed. That needs to be standardised. The linkages across the wider set of ecosystems services are also still very weak. More needs to be done to integrate different natural capital accounts to cover the full spectrum of ecosystem services.</p>
	<p pid="b.44.1/36">I ask my hon. Friend to give her political commitment to take those tools to a more formal level, with full development and integration alongside national accounts. She will be aware that, at the international level, the London Group on Environmental Accounting is in the process of preparing a handbook on integrated environmental and economic accounting, the draft version of which was approved by the United Nations Statistical Commission in 2003. Eventually there needs to be a statistical standard covering all aspects of environmental accounting, and that is expected to be approved by the commission in 2012.</p>
	<p pid="b.44.1/37">Without good natural capital accounts, the importance of natural resources to economies will continue to be under-appreciated, and sub-optimal use will continue to be made of those assets-economically, environmentally and socially. As assets underperform, natural capital is being run down, and future benefit streams decrease as the asset base is eroded and product prices fail to reflect their full costs. That results in an environmental debt to future generations and/or to the exporters of commodities that are extracted from degrading ecosystems, often in poor developing countries. For low-income groups, which rely more than others on the ecosystem services supplied by natural capital in the environment, the image given by the current system of gross domestic product, national income and household consumption aggregates is seriously misleading.</p>
	<p pid="b.44.1/38">Valuable commodities are too often extracted from ecosystems at the expense of those free services and ancillary products, and no heed is paid to depreciation of natural capital and the resulting decline in future services. That means that, in terms of total welfare, the poorest in our world can get poorer, even though their monetary income might increase in real terms. That comes about because of the degradation of the natural capital that provides the biggest part of the goods they need for survival-food, fibre, water, and so on. By measuring those costs that are not covered by market prices, it must be possible to measure the &quot;GDP of the poor&quot; and how far it declines in proportion to the share of conventional GDP growth, based on ecosystem degradation.</p>
	<p pid="b.44.1/39">This year, 2010, is the international year of biodiversity. In Nagoya this year, the parties to the United Nations convention on biological diversity will meet. It is often seen as a poor relation to the United Nations framework convention on climate change, the parties to which have just met in Copenhagen. It is my belief that the CBD is every bit as important as its more glamorous sibling.</p>
	<p pid="b.44.1/40">A change in climate on its own would not matter were it not for the fact that species and ecosystems will not be able to keep pace with the rate of climate change. It is the inability of species to adapt and maintain biodiversity that will cause the ecosystem services upon which human life depends to break down.</p>
	<p pid="b.44.1/41">My final request is that my hon. Friend tasks Treasury officials with preparing the UK's submissions to the Nagoya conference. The environment is too important to be left to the politically weak environment Ministries of the world. The valuation of natural capital and the economic importance of ecosystem services will be essential elements of public policy accounting in the 21st century. Indeed, it is my belief that if Treasuries do not quickly incorporate those issues into the heart of Government accounting practices, the 21st century might well be our last.</p>

	<p pid="b.49.0/1">May I take this opportunity, Mr. Atkinson, to wish you a happy new year? It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship.</p>
	<p pid="b.49.0/2">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1446" name="Barry Gardiner">the Member for Brent, North (Barry Gardiner)</phrase> on securing a debate on the important topic of Treasury accounting in relation to natural capital. When he applied for it, I doubt whether he envisaged us debating the subject on a day on which, if the forecasters are to be believed, Britain will probably be feeling the effects of extreme weather. Of course, the inconvenience of unaccustomed snow in this country is nothing compared to what may happen in developing and poor countries if we cannot stem the tide of climate change. Part of that process will involve a proper understanding of economics in relation to natural capital and an improvement in our evidence base in relation to policy making.</p>
	<p pid="b.49.0/3">Many of the services provided by the natural environment are not traded, so they have no market value, but their value to society can be substantial. For example, the annual benefits provided by the world's coral reefs alone, through the provision of food, raw materials, recreational opportunities and protection against extreme events, have been estimated at $172 billion. Those services are threatened by a changed climate. The Government are fostering international and domestic efforts to promote an understanding of the economic benefits delivered by the environment and to improve the evidence used in policy making to ensure that we live within our environmental limits.</p>
	<p pid="b.49.0/4">The Government's strategy to help deliver a better quality of life through sustainable development was first set out in 1999, and reviewed in 2005 in &quot;Securing the Future&quot;. That strategy set out the principles that we must all follow in our duty of care towards the environment and the need for the Government to lead by example, to ensure the well-being of ourselves and of future generations.</p>
	<p pid="b.49.0/5">The development of policies and the selection of options for their implementation by the Government are governed by the guidance provided in the Treasury's Green Book. It provides guidance on how the total costs and benefits to society of any proposed interventions should be assessed. It recommends social cost-benefit analysis as the main tool of assessment, which quantifies in monetary terms as many of those costs and benefits as feasible. It stresses that it includes any environmental impacts, which are often difficult and controversial to value in monetary terms.</p>
	<p pid="b.49.0/6">Much valuation research is ongoing, however, to improve how such environmental impacts are accounted for. For example, updated guidance on the value of greenhouse gas emissions will be published shortly, with the intention of reviewing those values every two years as our knowledge of their impact and cost develops. Guidance already exists on adapting long-term policies to the expected impacts of climate change, and on how to value changes in biodiversity and in air quality.</p>
	<p pid="b.49.0/7">Invaluable though it is for aiding the inclusion of natural capital impacts in the appraisal of policy, it is recognised that social cost-benefit analysis cannot, on its own, fully inform decision making if significant changes are involved. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs is therefore leading a group of economists and experts on sustainable development from across government, which will draw on leading academics in these fields, in a review of the economics of sustainable development. The group was set up in autumn 2008 to investigate whether current approaches were sufficient to ensure that sustainability was taken into account in the design of policy changes, or whether revised or additional supplementary Green Book guidance was required.</p>
	<p pid="b.49.0/8">The group published an interim report in October 2009, in which it concluded</p>
	<p pid="b.49.0/9" class="indent">&quot;Social Cost Benefit Analysis...when done properly, goes a very long way towards ensuring the sustainability of policy is reflected in decision making.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.49.0/10">It went on to say that substantial work remains to be done to provide policy makers with a more complete toolkit, and noted that there are still many environmental assets for which we do not yet have agreed recommended values.</p>
	<p pid="b.49.0/11">The group's report also noted that more consideration needs to be given to the appraisal of policies that have large or so-called non-marginal impacts. Relevant in that respect are policies that impact on certain critical assets-assets that, if allowed to decline below certain levels, could change the long-term growth path of the economy and its potential for wealth creation. For other assets-for example, clean air-there will again be limits to the acceptable degree of pollution. A key limitation of cost-benefit analysis in that regard is that it treats all forms of capital as if they were completely substitutable for one another.</p>
	<p pid="b.49.0/12">There is therefore a need to limit the use of natural assets to supplement cost-benefit analysis assessments in many areas. Some limitations already exist-for example, the land use planning regulations in the UK. The use of minimum standards in certain contexts is being investigated for air quality issues-for instance, when uncertainty is particularly prevalent and it might pay to invoke the precautionary principle. An asset check study is also being considered; it would give greater clarity on the assets that should be sustained, the levels below which they should not be allowed to fall and the actions that would be necessary if those levels were breached.</p>
	<p pid="b.49.0/13">The Government are fostering further work to promote the understanding of natural capital issues and improve the evidence used in policy making. We are funding the work of the UK climate impacts programme, which helps organisations to assess the effects of climate change on construction, working practices, service delivery and health in their localities. It is funding a &#163;1 million national ecosystem assessment, which will report in 2011 and be the first comprehensive analysis of the UK's natural environment and the benefits that it provides to society and economic prosperity. It is also supporting the economics of ecosystems and biodiversity study-a major international initiative that aims to draw attention to the global economic benefits of biodiversity, that highlights the growing biodiversity loss and ecosystem degradation, and draws expertise together to enable practical action.</p>
	<p pid="b.49.0/14">So far, I have focused on taking account of natural capital in policy making. Including elements of natural capital in the public accounts is a relatively recent concept; it is being discussed as part of the wider debate but is not yet the subject of fully worked-out and agreed accounting standards and practices.</p>
	<p pid="b.49.0/15">The Government are keen that the UK should remain at the forefront in developing best practice in relation to public accounting. We therefore propose the introduction of a system of regular sustainability reporting, including related expenditure, by all Departments in their annual reports and accounts. That will begin in 2011-12. As a minimum, Departments will be required to report annually their performance against their sustainability targets for greenhouse gas emissions, waste minimisation and management, and their use of finite resources.</p>
	<p pid="b.49.0/16">A great deal of work has already been done and continues to be undertaken to improve the framework for policy making in relation to the natural environment, climate change and sustainability. Valuation research has already been published in relation to a large number of assets, and further research is ongoing.</p>

	Non-Domicile Tax Status
</minor-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2010-01-05b.52.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1680" speakername="Norman Baker" colnum="52"  time="013:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm100105/halltext/100105h0009.htm#1001053000544">
	<p pid="b.52.1/1">I am pleased to have the opportunity to raise the topical issue of non-doms, which is important in terms of both income to the Government and an ethical approach to politics. I do not pretend that it is a new issue; in November 1995, a Labour party policy paper said that</p>
	<p pid="b.52.1/2" class="indent">&quot;the taxation of...non-domiciles...should be overhauled in line with the recommendations of the Inland Revenue.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.52.1/3">In one of its publications, the Inland Revenue said that one defect of the remittance basis of non-dom status was</p>
	<p pid="b.52.1/4" class="indent">&quot;that it is easy for the well advised to arrange to bring back money from overseas to meet their expenditure in the United Kingdom without it being regarded under the present law as a 'remittance'.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.52.1/5">One might have hoped that a progressive Government would have dealt with that inequity early on in their term of office. Instead, we had to wait, after applying constant pressure, until 2002 for the announcement of a review. When it finally came forward, we hoped that the changes to the arrangements would lead to far-reaching consequences. In the 2002 Economic and Fiscal Strategy Report, the Government said:</p>
	<p pid="b.52.1/6" class="indent">&quot;The Government is reviewing the residence and domicile rules as they affect the tax liabilities of individuals. The Government believes that modernisation of these rules needs to be based on clear principles: the rules should be fair, clear, easy to operate, and support the competitiveness of the British economy.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.52.1/7">That was provisionally adopted in 2002. I will come back to the word &quot;fair&quot; as I move on. In 2003, the publication of the discussion document ensued, and there was a long gap in which nothing much appeared to happen despite the fact that a number of Members of Parliament from both my party and the Labour party were asking questions about why so little progress had been made.</p>
	<p pid="b.52.1/8">In April 2007, we ended up with some progress, but it was not sufficient. I raised the matter myself in an oral question to one of the Chancellor's colleagues on <phrase class="date" code="2007-07-12">12 July 2007</phrase>. I asked somewhat cynically whether the inordinate amount of time that the review was taking was in any way connected with the large sums of money given to the Labour party by those who qualify for non-domiciled status. Heaven forbid that that should be the case, and it was disgraceful of me to suggest it. Nevertheless, there was not much of a denial from the Financial Secretary. What is extraordinary is that despite the length of the review-over all these years-the Government seem to have amassed very little information on which to base their forward projections. For example, the question I asked the Paymaster General, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1457" name="Dawn Primarolo">the right hon. Member for Bristol, South (Dawn Primarolo)</phrase>, on <phrase class="date" code="2007-04-23">23 April 2007</phrase> elicited this response:</p>
	<p pid="b.52.1/9" class="indent">&quot;HM Revenue and Customs does not ask for information on whether individuals are registered to vote in the UK on <i>(a)</i> tax self-assessment forms, <i>(b)</i> form DOM1 or <i>(c)</i> other tax forms.&quot;-[<phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2007-04-23.993"><i>Official Report</i>, 23 April 2007; Vol. 459, c. 993W</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="b.52.1/10">I would have thought that knowing whether someone is registered to vote in this country is quite a good indication of whether they are domiciled in this country. I was not alone in asking those questions. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1418" name="Lynne Jones">The hon. Member for Birmingham, Selly Oak (Lynne Jones)</phrase> asked in 2007 about the effect on the economy of non-domiciled residents' tax status. One might have thought that after four years of review, that, would have been clarified. The Minister at the time, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1740" name="Edward Balls">the right hon. Member for Normanton (Ed Balls)</phrase>, said:</p>
	<p pid="b.52.1/11" class="indent">&quot;No overall figure for the number of individuals with non-domicile tax status is available. Estimates of the tax foregone in the UK as a consequence of the use of the remittance basis by those not domiciled in the UK are not routinely made... No estimates have been made of the economic benefits to the UK from the retention of the domicile laws on taxation.&quot;-[<phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2007-04-30.1382"><i>Official Report</i>, 30 April 2007; Vol. 459, c. 1382</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="b.52.1/12">In 2002, we were told that one of the purposes of the review was to support the competitiveness of the British economy. Yet, four years on, no assessment has been made of what that was. It seems a rather curious review that does not seem to go far in its depth.</p>
	<p pid="b.52.1/13">In 2008, we had an announcement that represented the worst of all possible worlds. It did nothing to deal with the rich oligarchs of whom the Government appear to be so enamoured these days, yet it introduced a &#163;30,000 poll tax for non-domicile qualifiers, which hits people such as university lecturers temporarily resident in my constituency and elsewhere. In other words, it clobbers the small fry and lets the big fish off the hook. That cannot be regarded as fair or sensible. After four or five years waiting for this review-or 14 years since the Labour party first proposed it in 1994-I have to say to the Minister that, coming from Lewes with a huge tradition of fireworks, I know a damp squib when I see one, and that was a damp squib par excellence. Even worse, in his Budget speech on <phrase class="date" code="2008-03-12">12 March 2008</phrase>, the Chancellor said:</p>
	<p pid="b.52.1/14" class="indent">&quot;There will be no further changes to this regime for the rest of this Parliament or the next.&quot; -[<phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2008-03-12.293"><i>Official Report</i>, 12 March 2008; Vol. 473, c. 293</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="b.52.1/15">We now have the Chancellor apparently tying the hands of the next Government-whoever that may be-the next Parliament and future Chancellors over how they deal with the matter. That seems to be unconstitutional as much as anything else.</p>
	<p pid="b.52.1/16">Non-domicile tax status is an important matter for the Treasury, because it is to do with income, fairness and equity in the taxation system. Why should my hard-working constituents in Lewes, Newhaven, Seaford, Polegate and elsewhere, who do an honest day's work and pay their taxes in full, have to put up with a regime that sees freeloading millionaires swan around avoiding tax apparently with the help of Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs and the Treasury? For the Chancellor's party, I have to say that such an unfortunate position seems to be a long way from Keir Hardie, Clement Attlee and even Harold Wilson.</p>
	<p pid="b.52.1/17">Further consideration must be given to this matter, and not simply for reasons of income, fairness and equity but because of the integrity of the political process-something that has been the focus of many of our minds for some time, not least because of the MPs' expenses issue. There is a general consensus, in words at least, that Parliament needs to clean up its act. We cannot have clean politics in this country until we set and apply a very clear principle, which is that no Member of Parliament, whether in the Commons or the Lords, should be sitting here if they declare themselves to be non-domiciled for tax purposes. That is a very clear position that we should adopt. It is perhaps the reverse of Reverend Jonathan Mayhew who said in 1750, &quot;No taxation without representation.&quot; I think that we should have no representation without taxation.</p>
	<p pid="b.52.1/18">A party that fails to tackle its own internal non-domicile issues can barely hope to be taken seriously if it then pretends to argue for a clean-up of politics, which the Minister will be pleased to know leads me on to the Conservative party and its problems with its own members. I have to refer to Lord Ashcroft, who bails out the Conservative party to a very large degree. He took a seat in the Lords in October 2000. At the time, it was reported that the then leader of the Conservative party, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1782" name="William Hague">the right hon. Member for Richmond, Yorks (Mr. Hague)</phrase>, had insisted that Lord Ashcroft end his tax exile before taking up his seat. That assurance was apparently given. It was a most interesting condition. The Honours Scrutiny Committee attached the condition to his peerage that</p>
	<p pid="b.52.1/19" class="indent">&quot;to meet the requirements for a working peer, Mr. Michael Ashcroft has given his clear and unequivocal assurance that he will take up personal residence in the United Kingdom again before the end of the calendar year.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.52.1/20">In other words, that should have happened before the end of 2000. More than nine years later, we are still no clearer in definitive terms about whether he has taken up that tax status. What we have had from Conservative spokesmen is a series of evasions punctuated by embarrassed silences when they are asked about those matters on radio and television programmes.</p>
	<p pid="b.52.1/21">Back in 2001, I wrote to the right hon. Member for Richmond, Yorks, who was then the leader of the Conservative party and who is now the shadow Foreign Secretary, about these matters and I asked him 10 questions about Lord Ashcroft. Let me just list a few of those questions:</p>
	<p pid="b.52.1/22" class="indent">&quot;Is Lord Ashcroft non-resident in the UK for tax purposes?</p>
	<p pid="b.52.1/23" class="indent">Is Lord Ashcroft non-domiciled in the UK for tax purposes?...</p>
	<p pid="b.52.1/24" class="indent">Has Lord Ashcroft or his agents notified the Inland Revenue of any change, or impending change in his tax status?...</p>
	<p pid="b.52.1/25" class="indent">Is Lord Ashcroft registered as a UK voter or an overseas voter? He is apparently still listed on the voters' register in Maidenhead as an overseas voter. Why is that the case when he was said in 1999 to be returning to Britain?&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.52.1/26">I would suggest that those questions and other questions that I put were quite germane. The reply that I received was not from the then leader of the Conservative party, but from <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1703" name="John Whittingdale">the hon. Member for Maldon and East Chelmsford (Mr. Whittingdale)</phrase>, his Parliamentary Private Secretary at the time, who said in a very short reply that</p>
	<p pid="b.52.1/27" class="indent">&quot;regarding Lord Ashcroft's financial affairs, these are matters for him and I have sent him a copy of your letter&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.52.1/28">No answer came forth from the Conservative party to those germane questions. However, I did receive a letter-</p>

	<p pid="b.54.0/1">Order. I am sorry to interrupt the hon. Gentleman, but he should be slightly careful in that the debate is on Government policy on the tax status of non-domiciles and not on the official Opposition's policy on the tax status of non-domiciles. I would be grateful if he reflected that in his remarks.</p>

	<p pid="b.54.1/1">Yes. I was hoping to make the case that the Government need to change their policy and that was my intention in what I said. I am sorry that that was not clear in my remarks. However, I am giving a couple of examples to show why it is necessary for the Government to change the position that they have adopted, which is inadequate for the challenge that we face in cleaning up politics in the House across all parties. That is the case that I am making.</p>
	<p pid="b.54.1/2">I was about to say that the only other response that I received to my letter to the right hon. Member for Richmond, Yorks was from Lord Ashcroft's solicitors, who were basically not particularly pleasant towards me.</p>
	<p pid="b.54.1/3">I referred to some of the quotes that we have heard on TV and radio, but it is important that all three main parties in the House commit themselves fully to an open regime. If we do not do that collectively, we will not be able to clean up politics in a way that is very important and that we can all hopefully agree on. The reality is that a position of &quot;Ashcroft's taxes nothing to do with me, says Cameron&quot;, which was a headline in <i>The Independent</i>, is not a sufficient response from the leader of the main Opposition party in the House.</p>
	<p pid="b.54.1/4">I conclude on this matter by noting that my colleague in the Lords, Lord Oakeshott, wrote to Lord Ashcroft in December 2009, asking him very bluntly whether he was a non-dom, to which no response has been forthcoming.</p>
	<p pid="b.54.1/5">There have been suggestions from the official Opposition that they have plans to change the taxation regime that relate to those people who do not pay full UK tax. Of course, those suggestions do not deal with non-doms in the same way.</p>
	<p pid="b.54.1/6">I also want to refer to potential parliamentary candidates. It seems to me that, if we are to clean up this place, it is important that the Government should not simply review their policy with regard to the declarations by Members of Parliament and Members of the House of Lords, although those declarations are important in terms of non-domicile status, but should consider whether it is necessary to review their policy on non-domicile status in so far as it reflects declarations by parliamentary candidates. We now have a more open regime in the House for Members of Parliament to declare what they earn and we are moving in the right direction on that issue, but no such restrictions or requirements apply to parliamentary candidates. It seems to me that when voters go to the polling booths, whenever that may be this year, they are entitled to decide, particularly in the present circumstances with all the expenses problems, whether they approve of the ethical, financial and moral positions adopted by their parliamentary candidates in so far as they relate to their public duties. However, that is clearly not the case at present.</p>
	<p pid="b.54.1/7">As another example in regard to parliamentary candidates, I give Zac Goldsmith, who has said:</p>
	<p pid="b.54.1/8" class="indent">&quot;My non-domicile status is a reflection of my father's international status&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.54.1/9">Of course, as the Minister will confirm, that is simply not the legal position, because non-domicile status is a matter of choice after someone is 16 and not a matter of fact. One must conclude that the attempt to avoid paying proper taxes in this country by Mr. Goldsmith, as appears to be the case, is one that undermines both the House and politics generally. I also reflect on the fact that he has spent &#163;250,000 or more in the Richmond Park constituency trying to buy the seat-money that should have been paid to the Exchequer in proper taxation. It is one thing to bribe the electorate; it is another for the electorate to be bribed with their own money, which appears to be what is happening in that constituency.</p>
	<p pid="b.54.1/10">I hope that I have made the case that the position regarding non-dom status is not satisfactory in this country; that the review that the Government conducted and concluded in 2008 has, in fact, been inadequate; that the Government have not dealt with the big fish, who continue to escape proper taxation while hard-working families pay it; and that the Government have, in fact, only clobbered small fry with a &#163;30,000 poll tax-people who should not be clobbered in that way when a better and much more equitable solution would be to have no tax and then full tax applied after seven years. I have also given an indication of how the current arrangements undermine the integrity of Parliament and the integrity of what we are trying to achieve in this place by tidying up politics.</p>
	<p pid="b.54.1/11">Therefore, I hope that the Government will first commit to review the non-dom rules and, secondly, that they will undertake before the election to take urgent action in line with the Bill that my colleague Lord Oakeshott introduced in the House of Lords to ensure that no Member can sit in either the Commons or the Lords unless they have given a clear indication that they are paying taxation in full in this country and are domiciled here. If the Government are not prepared to do that, they must explain why.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2010-01-05b.56.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1563" speakername="Stephen Timms" speakeroffice="The Financial Secretary to the Treasury"  colnum="56"  time="013:15:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm100105/halltext/100105h0009.htm#1001053000547">
	<p pid="b.56.0/1">Let me begin by congratulating <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1680" name="Norman Baker">the hon. Member for Lewes (Norman Baker)</phrase> on securing the debate. I welcome the opportunity to set out the Government's policy on the taxation of non-domiciles. I recognise the strength of feeling that he and others have expressed and I want to respond to that strength of feeling in my remarks today.</p>
	<p pid="b.56.0/2">Of course, there has been a good deal of debate about this issue recently, prompted in particular by the case that the hon. Gentleman mentioned at the conclusion of his remarks: the media and political interest in the tax status of the Conservative parliamentary candidate for Richmond Park, Zac Goldsmith, who is of course standing against the hon. Gentleman's colleague, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1783" name="Susan Kramer">the hon. Member for Richmond Park (Susan Kramer)</phrase>. What that issue has highlighted, again, is the fact that there might well be Members of Parliament-current Members or indeed prospective Members-who do not pay UK tax in full on all their income. However, before addressing that issue, I will follow the hon. Gentleman's lead by first outlining the Government's policy on the taxation of non-domiciles more generally, because that policy rightly provides the context for this debate.</p>
	<p pid="b.56.0/3">Domicile is a common-law concept that connects a person with a system of law. It is not a tax-law concept-tax law simply uses domicile status to determine certain tax issues-so the question whether a person is domiciled in the UK is to be decided primarily by reference to principles of common law. Domicile potentially depends on a wide range of factors, and it is a concept that is quite hard to define. It is often said to equate to an individual's &quot;permanent home&quot;. It is sometimes suggested that it is the place that someone expects to be buried, although that is only a rather approximate definition. Normally, a person takes his or her domicile at birth from their father, but once that person reaches adulthood they can change their domicile and make a domicile of choice in a different country, if that is their wish.</p>
	<p pid="b.56.0/4">People who are resident in the UK but who are not domiciled or ordinarily resident are eligible to claim the remittance basis of taxation for income tax and for capital gains tax. That means that they are taxable on their foreign income and gains only if they are brought-if they are remitted-into the UK. Any UK-source income, however, is fully taxable in the UK. I would be interested to know a little more about the issue that the hon. Gentleman raised about university lecturers in his constituency, because the only impact of those arrangements, of course, would be on people who were receiving income from outside the UK above a de minimis level, in addition to what I presume would be his constituents' university incomes in the cases to which he referred. However, I would be perfectly happy to have a look at the details of those cases, if he wanted me to do so.</p>
	<p pid="b.56.0/5">The alternative to the remittance basis is the arising basis, under which a UK resident pays UK income tax and capital gains tax on all his or her worldwide income and gains wherever they arise, subject to any relief due under double taxation agreements. The hon. Gentleman's constituents could certainly take advantage of that basis if they chose, in which case they would be taxed in exactly the same way as people resident and domiciled in the UK. That is the basis on which the vast majority of the UK population is taxed.</p>
	<p pid="b.56.0/6">The remittance basis has existed for a long time. The hon. Gentleman said that it sat ill with the party of Clement Attlee and Harold Wilson, but the remittance basis in fact goes back long before their premierships to the 1800s, and both those extremely distinguished former leaders of my party saw fit to leave it in place. Businesses see it as playing an important role in ensuring that the UK attracts skilled people from abroad to work, do business and invest. We would place ourselves at a significant competitive disadvantage if we simply scrapped the remittance basis at a time when countries with low tax regimes are competing to attract talent and investment-that would be an own goal. I do not think that that was what the hon. Gentleman was calling for, but as he mentioned competitiveness, it is important to explain why the arrangements exist.</p>
	<p pid="b.56.0/7">We considered that the tax rules for non-domiciles needed to be reformed to make them fairer and more sustainable, which was why we implemented a major package of reforms to the remittance basis in the Finance Act 2008. The hon. Gentleman criticised us for taking time over the reforms, but they are complicated and it was important to take the time to get them right. In particular, as he said, we introduced a &#163;30,000 annual tax charge for those non-domiciles choosing to use the remittance basis who have lived in the UK for more than seven years. We also abolished personal allowances for income tax and the annual exempt amount for capital gains tax for those claiming the remittance basis, closed a number of loopholes allowing non-domiciles unfairly to remit offshore income and gains to the UK without paying tax on them-that is the loophole to which he referred early in his speech-and tightened the day counting rules to make it more difficult for people to become non-resident and avoid UK tax, as some were unfairly doing.</p>
	<p pid="b.56.0/8">The reforms were designed to strike the right balance between promoting fairness and maintaining UK competitiveness. People choosing to make their home in the UK for the longer term now make a greater contribution through the tax system. At the same time, the remittance basis continues to play a valuable role in supporting competitiveness, which is particularly important, as I have said, in the current economic climate and as the economy moves back towards growth. Of course, it should not be forgotten that non-domiciles still contribute a significant amount of tax-it is estimated at &#163;4 billion a year-to the Exchequer. The hon. Gentleman complained about the lack of data. The nature of the subject means that sometimes there are not as many data as one might like, but I can give him information about the total amount of tax that we estimate is contributed currently.</p>
	<p pid="b.56.0/9">The reforms have achieved their objective. We estimate that, as a result, the Exchequer will gain an additional &#163;700 million this year and about &#163;500 million next year and thereafter. My right hon. Friend the Chancellor made it clear during the 2008 Budget that we would not make further substantive changes to the remittance basis during this Parliament or the next. The hon. Gentleman asked me to renounce that commitment, but I will not do so. We stand by that commitment, because we take the view that it is the right thing to do-that is something that I have in common with Clement Attlee and Harold Wilson.</p>
	<p pid="b.56.0/10">Since 2008, we have worked with external stakeholders to ensure that the new rules deliver what we promised. As a result, we made further minor changes in the Finance Act 2009 to address concerns, particularly those raised by people on low incomes. That work has been widely praised and has helped to ensure that we deliver sustainable and fair changes.</p>
	<p pid="b.56.0/11">I agree with the hon. Gentleman's view that some people with a privileged position in the democratic process should pay UK tax in full on all their global income, gains and assets, wherever they arise. This is how the vast majority of the UK population is taxed, so it seems right to me, as it does to him, that MPs and Members of the House of Lords should be taxed on that basis and should not have access to the remittance basis. The hon. Gentleman asked some perfectly reasonable questions about Lord Ashcroft, and I would be as intrigued as to whether he knows the answers. The hon. Gentleman will, of course, recognise that it is not for me to answer them, although I am disturbed to hear that he received a threatening letter from the noble Lord's solicitors.</p>
	<p pid="b.56.0/12">The Government have consistently promoted the principle that that Members of Parliament should be full UK taxpayers. For example, the 2008 White Paper on House of Lords reform proposed that Members of the reformed second Chamber should be resident in the UK for tax purposes. We are now finalising draft legislation setting out the framework for a reformed second Chamber. We supported the intention behind the private Members' Bills introduced by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1757" name="Gordon Prentice">the Member for Pendle (Mr. Prentice)</phrase> in this place and by Lord Oakeshott of Seagrove Bay in the other place, both of which sought to restrict membership of Parliament to those paying full UK taxes.</p>
	<p pid="b.56.0/13">People other than parliamentarians can, of course, participate to a significant degree in the democratic process, and we have stated our view that the relationship between tax status and democratic participation deserves wider consideration. In view of strong support in both Houses, we took action and legislated in the Political Parties and Elections Act 2009 to provide that anyone wishing to donate or loan more than &#163;7,500 to a political party in a calendar year would be required to confirm that they were resident, ordinarily resident and domiciled in the UK for tax purposes at the time at which the donation was made. Without such a declaration, the donation or loan will not be regarded as permissible. The provisions will ensure that anyone wishing to donate or loan a significant amount to a political party or other regulated entity must pay UK tax in full. I think that the hon. Gentleman will welcome that legislation.</p>
	<p pid="b.56.0/14">Returning to the hon. Gentleman's specific question about MPs and Members of the House of Lords, I assure him that we are committed to introducing legislation in this Parliament to ensure that Members of Parliament are taxed in the same way as the vast majority of UK taxpayers. My right hon. and learned Friend the Leader of the House made that clear at Prime Minister's questions on <phrase class="date" code="2010-12-16">16 December</phrase> when she made the point that, as the hon. Gentleman put it, there should be no representation without taxation. She said:</p>
	<p pid="b.56.0/15" class="indent">&quot;We will introduce legislation to ensure that people are domiciled, resident and ordinarily resident in order to sit in this House or in the House of Lords.&quot;-[<phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2009-12-16.960"><i>Official Report</i>, 16 December 2009; Vol. 502, c. 960</phrase>.]</p>

	<p pid="b.59.1/1">We are considering how to bring about the change that I described. It is helpful that there is now clear, albeit rather belated, cross-party support for action, following the Conservative's change of position to supporting the principle that MPs and Members of the House of Lords should be required to pay tax in full on their overseas income, gains and assets. We are considering in detail how to do so and what the right legislative vehicle is. After we resolve those issues, the answer to the hon. Gentleman's question will be clear.</p>
	<p pid="b.59.1/2">Two amendments to the Constitutional Reform and Governance Bill were tabled in December with the aim of achieving our objective. We support and sympathise with the principle behind the amendments, but the drafting needed some attention-for example, to cover inheritance tax as well as income tax and capital gains tax, which are dealt with by the remittance basis. We will introduce measures during this Parliament to ensure that parliamentarians cannot avoid UK tax on offshore income, gains and assets. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will welcome that commitment. The detail will become clear as soon as the amendments are brought forward.</p>
	<p pid="b.59.1/3">I welcome this debate. It is an important contribution to the Government's commitment to fairness in the tax treatment of non-domiciles. I hope that I have made clear the importance of the current non-domicile tax regime for the UK economy but, equally, I underline the fact that we are committed to ensuring that MPs and Members of the House of Lords pay tax on their worldwide income and gains, alongside the vast majority of the UK population.</p>

	<p pid="b.60.1/1">I am grateful for the opportunity to raise the important matter of mobility scooters and pedestrian safety. Let me say from the outset that mobility scooters are great and that they enhance the quality of life of many of my elderly and disabled constituents. Indeed, my mother and mother-in-law, who are both in their 80s, have mobility scooters and benefit greatly from them.</p>
	<p pid="b.60.1/2">As you know, Mr. Atkinson, my constituency has the highest number of claims in the country from former miners for chronic bronchitis and emphysema. That means that it contains more people who are disabled than the national average, particularly in the former pit villages. However, my main reason for calling this debate was not that, but an e-mail I received from Kerry McNair, who is from Shafton in my constituency:</p>
	<p pid="b.60.1/3" class="indent">&quot;Hello. I was advised to contact you regarding my daughter. She is 23 months old and was recently run down in Doncaster by a mobility scooter. We were in the pedestrian zone when I was struck from behind, then watched in horror as my little girl was knocked to the ground and driven over. The old lady did not stop, she kept going, dragging my baby under her machine. I screamed at her to stop. Eventually some men lifted her off, she refused to dismount, and I grabbed my little girl. The old lady then tried to drive off but someone grabbed her keys. An ambulance was called and took us to hospital. The old lady was spoken to by police but allowed on her way. She did not apologise and has made no effort to be in touch. No charges can be brought against her as there are no laws covering mobility scooters. This is wrong. My daughter has had a patch of her Scalp ripped off, she is covered in cuts and bruises. At night she takes ages to go to sleep as is afraid to close her eyes. I struggle changing her nappy as she now hates being laid down. And she is terribly clingy. I have been diagnosed with post traumatic stress. Why can this lady be allowed to ruin our lives. I close my eyes and picture it all the time. Please help me to fight this. I want to take a stand. I will not allow my daughter to be treated like this by anyone. Justice needs to be done. Can you help. I would be grateful for your advice. Kind regards, Kerry McNair&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.60.1/4">That sums up in a nutshell the trauma that people experience when small children are knocked down by mobility scooters.</p>
	<p pid="b.60.1/5">Mrs. McNair is right that there are no suitable laws covering mobility scooters. The death of a 90-year-old lady called Lillian Macey last September led to no action by the police. Since raising this issue, I have received many e-mails in support of Mrs. McNair's point from across the nation. I recently received a short e-mail from a constituent of my neighbouring MP, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1386" name="Michael Clapham">the Member for Barnsley, West and Penistone (Mr. Clapham)</phrase>. Jane Kaye from Barugh Green wrote:</p>
	<p pid="b.60.1/6" class="indent">&quot;I have been reading in the Barnsley Chronicle about your concerns regarding mobility scooters. I'm pleased you are looking into this as we (myself and my husband) have witnessed some near misses and scooters being driven at a worrying speed round streets in town where young children are walking.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.60.1/7">For the rest of my speech I will investigate possible solutions, which the Minister can consider, to make mobility scooters as safe as possible for their users and other members of the public. I would like him to consider an e-mail from Mr. Michael Rushton from Wombwell in my constituency:</p>
	<p pid="b.60.1/8" class="indent">&quot;Dear Jeff Ennis,</p>
	<p pid="b.60.1/9" class="indent">I'm glad to hear at last on the local radio station someone's taking up the problem of Motability Scooters. My son was nearly crushed against a wall a couple of years ago. Let me tell you the motability scooters weigh quite a bit. There are 2 or 3 questions that come to mind.</p>
	<p pid="b.60.1/10" class="indent">1. Why are motability scooter owners not made to take a test, such as a proficiency test that the suppliers could enforce?</p>
	<p pid="b.60.1/11" class="indent">2. Why are scooter owners seemingly exempt from prosecution for dangerous driving? For example, driving straight down the white line or going straight across at junctions while traffic is turning in to it, which I have witnessed dozens of times at Main Street in Wombwell.</p>
	<p pid="b.60.1/12" class="indent">3. Why are the owners also not penalised for carrying passengers?</p>
	<p pid="b.60.1/13" class="indent">4. Why are motability owners not breathalysed when they have been drinking in pubs and clubs? Surely this is drink driving. If riding a bicycle, they would be stopped for drink driving.</p>
	<p pid="b.60.1/14" class="indent">I understand the need for the scooters as I have a child with cerebral palsy and can appreciate the need for mobility, but safety for pedestrians and also the mobility scooter user must be paramount. The story on the radio must be repeated up and down the country.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.60.1/15">As the Minister knows, there is no requirement for people to undergo training before taking a mobility scooter on to the streets. Many reputable retailers provide rudimentary instruction, but whether they do so is at their discretion. More people are now buying mobility scooters over the internet and second-hand ones through local newspapers, so the first time many mobility scooter users sit on their scooter is the day on which they take it out on to the streets.</p>
	<p pid="b.60.1/16">The crux of the problem is how we can ensure that mobility scooter users are proficient at riding their machines and are safe for themselves and other road users. I do not believe that the answer is a compulsory test for mobility scooter users like a driving test. That would be using a sledgehammer to crack a nut. However, serious consideration should be given to allowing users the opportunity to take a proficiency test on a voluntary basis, along the lines of the scheme recently trialled by Norfolk police in Great Yarmouth. The impetus for that scheme was generated by the high volume of complaints about accidents caused by mobility scooter users on Great Yarmouth's streets and pavements.</p>
	<p pid="b.60.1/17">The scheme is run by Penny Carpenter, a crime prevention officer with Norfolk police. In a recent article, she was quoted as saying:</p>
	<p pid="b.60.1/18" class="indent">&quot;Anyone can get a mobility scooter and you don't have to have a licence...There's no test involved. There's no legal requirement to have insurance and anybody can drive one with no training at all.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.60.1/19">However, it is recommended that users should have at least third-party cover. The article continued:</p>
	<p pid="b.60.1/20" class="indent">&quot;The courses, there have been two of them so far, aim to fill that gap. Improving users' handling skills and creating an awareness of road safety are all key, as is installing a sense of pavement etiquette.</p>
	<p pid="b.60.1/21" class="indent">It takes about 25 minutes to complete, but there is no pass or fail. So far more than 50 people have volunteered to do it. And it is not just for beginners. The majority are people who have been using their scooters for years.</p>
	<p pid="b.60.1/22" class="indent">Shiela Adair, 64, is one of them. 'Even though I've used a scooter before the course was ideal to learn about reversing.'&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.60.1/23">Norfolk police started the scheme because it believed that the number of accidents involving mobility scooters was on the increase. That cannot be proved nationally because mobility scooters come under the Department's &quot;other motorised vehicles&quot; category, which includes ambulances, fire engines, motor caravans, motorised wheelchairs and quad bikes. Over the last three years, the number of accidents involving all vehicles in that category has increased substantially. For example, there were 1,970 accidents in 2006, 2,971 accidents in 2007 and 3,238 in 2008, which is the last year for which statistics are available. Those figures show a 60-odd per cent. increase over three years in that category. However, we cannot say how many of those accidents are directly attributable to mobility scooters. The Minister should therefore consider creating a separate category for mobility scooters, so that we can build up an evidence base on this important issue and find out one way or the other whether accidents involving mobility scooters are on the increase.</p>
	<p pid="b.60.1/24">My final point regards a matter I have recently written about to the Chairman of the Transport Committee, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1688" name="Louise Ellman">the Member for Liverpool, Riverside (Mrs. Ellman)</phrase>. I asked her whether her Select Committee would consider the issue and I am pleased to say-this is for the Minister's information-that in the coming months she has indeed agreed to carry out a short inquiry into the issue of mobility scooters. I obviously hope that the Minister will give evidence to that inquiry.</p>
	<p pid="b.60.1/25">In conclusion I shall cover three key points, which I would like the Minister specifically to address in his closing remarks. First, will he consider the merits of introducing a voluntary proficiency test, preferably at no charge to the user? Such a test could be administered in conjunction with reputable retailers and local police authorities working together, as is done in Norfolk and one or two other police authority areas. I certainly intend to write to the chief constable of South Yorkshire to draw the matter to his attention, and to see whether we can establish a course similar to the Norfolk one in South Yorkshire. I hope that the Minister will talk to his counterpart in the Home Office, the Minister for Policing, Crime and Counter-Terrorism, on the matter to establish whether progress on such a course can be made.</p>
	<p pid="b.60.1/26">The second issue I would like the Minister to address is whether he will consider introducing the new offence of riding a mobility scooter in a dangerous way. That was very much the point that Mrs. McNair made in her revealing e-mail, which I read out at the beginning of my contribution. Finally, will the Minister consider introducing the specific category of &quot;mobility scooter&quot; in relation to the departmental statistics issue that I have already outlined, so that we can definitely say whether this is an increasing problem?</p>

	<p pid="b.62.4/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1385" name="Jeff Ennis">the Member for Barnsley, East and Mexborough (Jeff Ennis)</phrase> on securing this important debate. I am grateful to him and the Minister for allowing me a few moments to speak about my constituent, Mrs. Margaret Macalagan, who was hit by a mobility scooter when out shopping in 2008. She suffered serious injuries that meant she was admitted to hospital and her own mobility was badly affected. The driver of the scooter that hit her was untrained and uninsured, and was also elderly, disabled and of limited means. Mrs. Macalagan was therefore unable to gain any compensation for the injuries she sustained.</p>
	<p pid="b.62.4/2">York Older People's Assembly asked me to take up the issue and I raised it in 2008 with the Department for Work and Pensions and the Department for Transport. I do not want to stop people using mobility scooters-they are a benefit-but I want to create an environment in which they are used safely and to ensure as far as possible that other people are not injured.</p>
	<p pid="b.62.4/3">I would particularly like the Government to consider making insurance for such scooters compulsory. The DWP funds a number of people to run scooters through the disability living allowance scheme. One scheme under which people obtain scooters that are paid for with their DLA is the Motability powered wheelchair and scooter scheme. Those who get scooters under that scheme are required to insure the scooters, both for injury to third parties and for fire and theft. So when the Government fund scooters, they believe that insurance is not only reasonable but necessary. The same prescription should be applied to others who use scooters.</p>
	<p pid="b.62.4/4">Like my hon. Friend, I am concerned that statistics on the number of accidents involving those scooters have not been collected. The Department for Transport should change that. In October 2009, I wrote again to the Department for Transport about the problem. The Minister who is present today replied very promptly in November, and told me:</p>
	<p pid="b.62.4/5" class="indent">&quot;We are considering consulting on issues such as compulsory insurance and training&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.62.4/6">I am glad that is being considered, but I simply urge the Minister to start consulting on making those changes. Such changes are overdue and the sooner they are made, the better.</p>

	<p pid="b.63.0/1">It is a pleasure to respond to a debate with you in the Chair, Mr. Atkinson-I think it is the first time I have done so. I also thank my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1385" name="Jeff Ennis">the Member for Barnsley, East and Mexborough (Jeff Ennis)</phrase> for raising some important issues about the use of mobility vehicles, for the way he has done so and for proffering some solutions to the problems he has highlighted-that makes one's life a lot easier, when one is in the hot seat.</p>
	<p pid="b.63.0/2">May I put on the record my sadness and concern to hear about the serious injury suffered by his constituent, Madison McNair, who is two years old, and the impact the injury she suffered has had on her family? I was also sad to hear about the other examples he gave, including the recent fatality.</p>
	<p pid="b.63.0/3">By way of background, Britain has one of the best road safety records among developed countries. Since 2000, we have reduced the number of deaths and serious injuries by 40 per cent. and we remain committed to do more to make our roads and pavements safer still. All the evidence suggests that the use of mobility vehicles is growing and that trend is likely to continue as our population ages. Indeed, the number of people aged over 80 is likely to increase by 85 per cent. over the next 20 years.</p>
	<p pid="b.63.0/4">One of the reasons I welcome the comments made by my hon. Friends the Members for City of York (Hugh Bayley) and for Barnsley, East and Mexborough is because of the balance of their remarks. For example, my hon. Friend the Member for Barnsley, East and Mexborough referred to the benefits of mobility scooters both to his direct family and constituents. Unfortunately, some people have physical or social needs that require something more innovative to enable them to get around. In providing for that innovation, it is important for us to balance the rights of people with disabilities with the rights of other people to feel safe. I thank my hon. Friend for his letter to the Chair of the Transport Committee, which I believe will mean that I give evidence. The Committee is considering an important subject and I genuinely thank him for his interest. I also encourage him to give evidence to that inquiry-I am sure he will enjoy doing so and revel in it as much as I will.</p>
	<p pid="b.63.0/5">My hon. Friend will be pleased to know that similar considerations for innovative transport modes and the opportunities that new technologies offer have meant that, earlier today, we launched parallel consultations on whether we should allow electric personal vehicles such as the Segway on our roads and cycle tracks, and on the requirements for electrically assisted pedal cycles. That is why, considering the increasing numbers of these vehicles, I am considering whether to consult on changing legislation concerning mobility scooters.</p>
	<p pid="b.63.0/6">I shall return to some of the points raised by my hon. Friends. I am keen to work with my hon. Friend on the recent rates of incidents involving scooters and I would be grateful if he provided the sources for any data he has reported today, so that we can build up an evidence base. I should start by saying that, as he said, information on incidents involving and injuries caused by mobility scooters is not recorded centrally. However, some research databases have given us an indication of the risk that they pose. Primarily, mobility scooters are used among pedestrians, who I am afraid do occasionally trip over them or are perhaps hit by them. However, because pavement speeds are limited to 4 mph, injuries are rare and mostly minor. That assertion is supported by several studies.</p>
	<p pid="b.63.0/7">Estimates from a set of data collected from 18 representative A and E departments from a survey undertaken between 2000 and 2002 suggested that nationally there might be around 750 incidents a year involving three or four-wheeled mobility vehicles that warrant a hospital visit, although regrettably no indication of the severity of such incidents is available. I accept that since 2002 the number of people using mobility scooters has increased.</p>
	<p pid="b.63.0/8">Fortunately, data are recorded from certain hospitals about people who have an NHS hospital stay of three days or more due to trauma. That suggests that each year across the country fewer than 40 people are injured by mobility scooters severely enough to require a lengthy stay in hospital. It is worth noting that around 95 per cent. of the injuries were to mobility scooter drivers, rather than to people being hit by them. That is an important point, and I will come back to the point about proficiency training, to which my hon. Friend referred, because it is linked to that point as well.</p>
	<p pid="b.63.0/9">For fatal injuries, we have scanned press reports, which show that it is likely that a mobility scooter incident was the cause of at least one pedestrian death in 2009, and at least one in 2008. Of course, we would wish to avoid any incidents if possible, but the figure of one death a year should be compared with the seven deaths a day on the roads overall. I am not minimising the deaths caused by mobility scooters, but merely stating that the risk they pose to pedestrians is small when compared to the deaths caused by road vehicles overall.</p>
	<p pid="b.63.0/10">To summarise that point, it would be fair to say that the evidence suggests that mobility scooters are reasonably safe, certainly when compared to other modes of transport. However, it is worth recognising that their primary design consideration appears in most cases to be to improve mobility, rather than to ensure the safety of the pedestrians with which they are most mixed.</p>
	<p pid="b.63.0/11">My hon. Friend will be aware, perhaps from Christmas presents he has bought for younger people, that it is possible to buy a remote control car that, when it comes into contact with an object, such as a table, TV or CD rack, will do a U-turn to avoid hitting that object. As a lay person, I do not have technical expertise on that, but I do not see why mobility scooters could not do something similar. I would like to look at that in the design standards and in any consultations we have as well.</p>
	<p pid="b.63.0/12">Another big issue that was raised is whether users of mobility scooters can be prosecuted for dangerous use. I should start by saying that that is a separate issue from how they should be prosecuted. The Chronically Sick and Disabled Persons Act 1970 specifically exempts &quot;invalid carriages&quot;-I am afraid that that is the language they used in those days-from road traffic legislation, defining them as &quot;mechanically propelled vehicles&quot;, rather than &quot;motor vehicles&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.63.0/13">There is an offence in law under paragraph 35 of the Offences Against the Person Act 1861, which gives the police powers to deal with those who use mobility vehicles in a dangerous manner, and in proven cases a maximum sentence of two years imprisonment may be carried. Section 28 of the Road Safety Act 2006 now permits the application of discretionary points or disqualification for drivers with a driving licence. Of course, a person who has been injured by a scooter may also file a civil claim for damages or personal injury. For that reason, we strongly recommend that scooter users take out insurance, and available figures suggest that around 90 per cent. of them may already do so. I do, however, take on board the points raised by my hon. Friend.</p>

	<p pid="b.65.0/1">I thank the Minister for his reasoned response, which I am really happy with so far. On his point about the number of accidents and the actions that can be taken against individuals who are guilty of dangerous driving, I accept that that can be covered by the 2006 Act. However, Mr. Rushton from Wombwell, whose e-mail I read out, mentioned people using mobility scooters when drunk. One cannot be breathalysed when riding a mobility scooter, but one can still be prosecuted under the Licensing Act 1872 for riding a horse and cart when drunk. Surely we should introduce legislation. We should not be relying on laws from 1861 and 1872 for issues such as this. We should be bringing the legislation up to date.</p>

	<p pid="b.66.0/1">My hon. Friend is in danger of making better than I have the points about why consultation is needed on some of the challenges that we face as the number of users increases and the potential risks that they pose to pedestrians increase as well. I was struck not just by his point but by what my hon. Friend the Member for City of York said about the apparent anomalies in requirements and prescription when it comes to insurance for some mobility scooter users and others as well. Clearly, those are issues that any consultation would need to take on board.</p>
	<p pid="b.66.0/2">There is a caveat in respect of the lack of evidence for reasons that have been discussed over the past 25 minutes, but, on the available evidence, it appears that mobility vehicles are not having a significant impact on road safety, and that existing law does permit prosecution, with the caveats that we discussed in the last interaction.</p>
	<p pid="b.66.0/3">A point was raised about users not being required to undergo compulsory training. The advice and training that are available from retailers, local authorities and charities are not compulsory, but the Department and I strongly recommend that scooter users avail themselves of them. My hon. Friend the Member for Barnsley, East and Mexborough gave examples of proficiency courses available to mobility scooters, and I commend organisations such as Norfolk police, which has been in the media today, that have put in place voluntary training schemes.</p>
	<p pid="b.66.0/4">The key questions for any compulsory training would be who would be responsible for the training standards, which body would apply them and how the trainers themselves would be trained and assessed. I am interested in rolling out the idea of voluntary proficiency tests, which is perhaps an issue for consultation.</p>
	<p pid="b.66.0/5">Another point that has been canvassed is remedial training for users who have been involved in an accident. There are practical problems with doing that, as there is no specific offence in law of riding a mobility scooter in a dangerous manner. It is difficult to see how we would do remedial training schemes, but training is an issue on which any consultation would seek views. I am also not opposed to the idea that was profferred about the Department creating a separate statistical category to collect evidence.</p>
	<p pid="b.66.0/6">The legislation is now more than 20 years old. My hon. Friend has reminded me that we rely on an Act from 1861 for this area. In the last period, the use of such vehicles has increased. In 2005-06, for example, there were an estimated 70,000 to 100,000 powered mobility vehicles. A more recent estimate from the national travel survey suggests that there could now be up to 330,000, and the figure is likely to grow for the reasons that I have set out. The increasing number of such vehicles and the increasing interest in safety concerns make this an opportune time to look again at the legislation covering mobility vehicles. In doing so, our aim would remain to balancing the mobility needs of scooter users with the safety needs of pedestrians and other road users.</p>
	<p pid="b.66.0/7">I am grateful to my hon. Friends the Members for Barnsley, East and Mexborough and for City of York for articulating in a proportionate and balanced manner some of the challenges that we face. I hope to work with them to try to find some of the solutions, and to return to this matter with some better news in the not too distant future.</p>
	<p pid="b.66.0/8" class="italic">Question put and agreed to.</p>
	<p pid="b.66.0/9" class="italic">Sitting adjourned.</p>
