<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-03-27a.370.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1834" speakername="Charlotte Atkins" colnum="370"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070327/halltext/70327h0001.htm#07032749000394">
	<p pid="a.370.0/1">I could not agree more. My hon. Friend is absolutely right. That may be one of the problems, because our inland waterways deliver so much; yet DEFRA does not seem to consider them to be a priority.</p>
	<p pid="a.370.0/2">The Minister may have thought that I was exaggerating when I said that the cuts in British Waterways budgets threaten the survival of the smaller, vulnerable canals such as the Caldon in my constituency. However, I am sure that he will say that my constituency has seen tremendous investment in the canals; we certainly have seen the successful restoration of the first lock and basin of the Uttoxeter canal at Froghall, which is now an enhanced visitor destination with access to all walking paths. We have also seen work done on the Harecastle tunnel on the Trent and Mersey canal.</p>
	<p pid="a.370.0/3">In reality, however, the future of the Caldon canal is far more dismal. As a cul-de-sac, it does not have the same status as the canals on the north-south through route on the national waterways network. Many ofthe structures on the Caldon have been awaiting maintenance for years. In the light of current funding cuts, those works are likely to be postponed for even more years. For instance, piecemeal repairs have been made to the Hazelhurst aqueduct and embankment over the last few years rather than the necessary major work that was planned. Its structural failure could easily cause the Caldon to be closed, which would have far-reaching effects for the local economy and the entire canal network.</p>
	<p pid="a.370.0/4">We should remember that the Caldon was reopened by a dedicated band of volunteers back in 1974, and there is a real risk that, within living memory, whose who reopened the canal could see it close again. The water supply from the Rudyard, Knypersley and Stanley reservoirs is vital to the local canal network, yet some of the valve mechanisms are now on the list of structures at risk. The maintenance of the 200-year-old network has to be kept up, because failures of small elements such as sluices and culverts can have a catastrophic effect. For instance, we have already seen the closure of the Long Butts bridge on the Caldon between Baddeley Green and Norton Green. It would cost &pound;130,000 to replace, so when it closed for two months a sticking-plaster job was done. It is therefore fragile and can no longer be used by vehicles but only by pedestrians.</p>
	<p pid="a.370.0/5">The staff cuts and reorganisations are already having an impact. It is not possible to get rid of 180 jobs and not have an impact on the canal network. British Waterways has always played a vital role in leading and underwriting the construction risk of regeneration projects. It can no longer be assumed that it will continue to do so, which puts the Burslem port and Leek basin developments on hold.</p>
	<p pid="a.370.0/6">In Leek, the Caldon canal corridor study to investigate the potential for the restoration, extension and development of the canal in the town is ready to go to the council, but without British Waterways expert assistance&mdash;the result of the staff cuts&mdash;it is likely to be put on the back burner. There are plans to bring the Uttoxeter canal back to life, as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1465" name="Janet Dean">my hon. Friend the Member for Burton (Mrs. Dean)</phrase> said, by opening a 13-mile stretch from Froghall in my constituency to the wharf in Uttoxeter. That has the potential to be a real gem of a development.</p>
	<p pid="a.370.0/7">As <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1844" name="William Cash">the hon. Member for Stone (Mr. Cash)</phrase> indicated, local councils are already on board, but a full feasibility study needs to be undertaken. That is less likely to happen given the impact of the funding cuts.</p>

<gidredirect oldgid="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-03-27a.371.1" newgid="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-03-27b.371.1" matchtype="changes"/>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-03-27a.371.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1834" speakername="Charlotte Atkins" colnum="371"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070327/halltext/70327h0001.htm#07032749000396">
	<p pid="a.371.1/1">Absolutely. British Waterways plays a vital role in underpinning all those restoration projects. It will not always be possible for bands of volunteers to bring the whole team together, right across the voluntary and political sectors. British Waterways always plays a vital role. Indeed, the chief executive of British Waterways, Robin Evans, has always believed the organisation's vision to be one of expanding the network. Will that change under the new regime? I hope not, and I hope that the Minister will comment on network expansion.</p>
	<p pid="a.371.1/2">Another victim of the cuts has been British Waterways' central freight unit. The unit has been disbanded, and responsibility for freight has passed to already hard-pressed regional offices. That is likely further to deprioritise freight and reduce the degree to which water freight can help the Government achieve their key environmental objectives by cutting carbon emissions. Coastal and inland shipping emits 80 per cent. less carbon dioxide per tonne per kilometre than road haulage. It also helps relieve congestion by taking lorries off the roads.</p>
	<p pid="a.371.1/3">There is an extensive network of inland waterways in the west midlands, but it is hugely underused by freight. Nevertheless, the potential is there. The west midlands freight quality partnership is conducting a feasibility study of two waterways&mdash;the Wolverhampton level and the Birmingham level&mdash;which together provide 87 miles of lock-free transport into the centre of Birmingham, including from the M6.</p>
	<p pid="a.371.1/4">The Severn-Trent canal proves that things can be made to work. In 2005, a brand new water transport service began on the river Severn, and that was the first time in 10 years that the river had been used for freight transport. Locally quarried aggregates are extracted from a quarry near Ripple and transported two miles north by barge to the Cemex plant at Ryall near Upton-upon-Severn in Worcestershire. On average, that happens four to seven times a day.</p>
	<p pid="a.371.1/5">It is intended that there will also be a twice-weekly service whereby some 65,000 tonnes a year of newly-processed material will be loaded back on barges. Material will be transported down the river Severn, via the Sharpness canal and the Gloucester docks, to the Cemex ready-mixed concrete plant two miles south of Gloucester.</p>
	<p pid="a.371.1/6">When did the Minister last meet his transport colleagues to discuss the carriage of water-borne freight, and what conclusions did they reach? For the Department for Transport to be awarding funds to transfer freight from road to water under the freight facilities grant scheme while DEFRA forces British Waterways to close its central freight unit does not seem to me to be joined-up government.</p>
	<p pid="a.371.1/7">In case the Minister considers that the issue of British Waterways cuts is not urgent, I should like him to consider just two examples in which urgent action is demanded but money may not be forthcoming due to funding cuts. Those cases have already been covered in the press.</p>
	<p pid="a.371.1/8">The first is that of Netherton tunnel, near Dudley, which is more than 3,000 yards long. It was the last major canal tunnel to be built in Britain, in 1858, but it could be the first to close, because it has begun to sink as a result of mining subsidence. The bottom ofthe tunnel is getting closer and closer to the top of the water, making it more difficult for boats to pass. At the same time, the two towpaths have been disturbed by subsidence and were closed to the public before Christmas. I understand that one towpath may be reopened, but no one can say when the works will begin.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-03-27a.373.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1818" speakername="Owen Paterson" colnum="373"  time="009:59:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070327/halltext/70327h0002.htm#07032749000399">
	<p pid="a.373.0/1">It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Mr. Martlew. I begin by congratulating <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1834" name="Charlotte Atkins">the hon. Member for Staffordshire, Moorlands (Charlotte Atkins)</phrase> on bringing this important matter to the attention of the House and I endorse much of what she said.</p>
	<p pid="a.373.0/2">On your way north, Mr Martlew, you might one day turn left and visit my area. You would find a lot of canals there, and it is poignant that we are discussing this subject in the bicentenary year of Thomas Telford. The Llangollen canal has a spectacular viaduct at Chirk Bank, which has attracted international names such as Harrison Ford and Calista Flockhart. A little further on beyond my patch there is the Pontcysyllte aqueduct, which is a world heritage site.</p>
	<p pid="a.373.0/3">The Montgomery canal in my constituency is a spectacular example of what Governments of both parties have done. The Minister last time made some rather tiresome party political comments, but I would like to stress that this development has been supported by Governments of both parties. Aston lock was restored in 1994. There is a site of special scientific interest beside the canal. I entirely endorse the comments by the hon. Member for Staffordshire, Moorlands that the vast majority of people who visit canals are not boaters; they are pedestrians&mdash;people who go to walk beside the canals.</p>
	<p pid="a.373.0/4">We have seen a tremendous voluntary effort in the area. There is national Government money and local government money and there has been a tremendous effort by volunteers, with people coming up from Birmingham for weekends. As a result, a large section of the Montgomery canal has been reopened and there is more to come. New businesses, such as Barry Tuffin's boatyard, have been created. Such businesses simply would not have existed when there was only bog and mud.</p>
	<p pid="a.373.0/5">At the other end of my constituency, the Shropshire Union canal is extremely busy, taking traffic up towards the Mersey, going through Market Drayton. The size of that network is significant. The Shropshire Union covers 66 miles within my area&mdash;that is, it goes outside my constituency but is reachable from my constituency. Similarly, the Llangollen is 46 miles long and the Montgomery is 33 miles long. Another waterway is 10 miles long. That is 155 miles in total. The group of canals in that geographical area attracts a significant number of visits: 8.3 million a year. Gross direct and indirect spending arising from canal visitors is &pound;54 million, and up to 1,500 direct and indirect permanent full-time equivalent jobs are supported.</p>
	<p pid="a.373.0/6">As the hon. Member for Staffordshire, Moorlands clearly explained, much of that could be put in jeopardy. Great work has been done over the past20 years through state action and voluntary action, but due to the cataclysmic incompetence of DEFRA in handling single farm payments, the Government are liable to be fined &pound;130 million and pay &pound;40 million in compensation. It is utterly disgraceful that an area of activity that is completely separate from single farm payments will be penalised.</p>
	<p pid="a.373.0/7">The sums are pretty simple. The income of British Waterways is &pound;100 million. The subsidy is &pound;60 million, and there is &pound;30 million from the Heritage Lottery Fund and local authorities. If that subsidy is changed radically without planning and at very short notice, it is very hard for British Waterways, which is working its way towards making itself self-sufficient, suddenly to have that reverse dumped on it without being able to plan ahead.</p>
	<p pid="a.373.0/8">My constituents are very angry. Michael Limbrey, the chairman of the Montgomery Waterway Restoration Trust, who has done a huge amount of work on the issue, reckons that phase 1 restoration of the Montgomery would bring in 100 to 120 long-term jobs, but that that</p>
	<p pid="a.373.0/9" class="indent">&quot;could increase to 250-300 with associated developments&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.373.0/10">He says of the cuts:</p>
	<p pid="a.373.0/11" class="indent">&quot;This could all be very significant for a rural canal like the Montgomery, and if implemented could put the restoration at risk, and prejudice all that has been achieved so far.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.373.0/12">Ken and Lindsay Green of Whitchurch said that</p>
	<p pid="a.373.0/13" class="indent">&quot;the cuts are to pay the fines imposed on DEFRA for the late payment of farm subsidies. We are just gobsmacked that everyone should be penalised because some people can't do their jobs properly.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.373.0/14">Mr. Green says:</p>
	<p pid="a.373.0/15" class="indent">&quot;When I ran my own business anyone making that sort of mistake would be sacked.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.373.0/16">Similarly, Mr. Alan Wisener from Market Drayton said:</p>
	<p pid="a.373.0/17" class="indent">&quot;Why should our Waterways and other environmental departments suffer because of gross bad management by DEFRA?&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.373.0/18">in other words, because of farming subsidies.</p>
	<p pid="a.373.0/19">Let me explain what this amounts to. As the hon. Lady said, there will first be a degradation of the network, which in the long term will lead to more expensive costs. I have been told that, at Calveley, just outside <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1567" name="Stephen O'Brien">my patch, in the seat of my hon. Friend the Member for Eddisbury (Mr. O'Brien)</phrase>, the towpath is falling into the canal. At Audlem bridge, against just outside my area, &pound;90,000 is needed. In my area, there is Greaves bridge at Ellesmere, which is a listed 18th-century structure. It will need &pound;150,000 to repair, because the foundations are falling in. If the foundations do fall in, the long-term bill, and the disruption, will be immensely greater.</p>
	<p pid="a.373.0/20">I raised the question of breaches with the Minister in our last debate, initiated by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1675" name="Peter Soulsby">the hon. Member for Leicester, South (Sir Peter Soulsby)</phrase>, and I have raised it in questions, but I had a wholly unacceptable reply. There were two breaches on the Llangollen, in December 2005 and June 2006. That is the busiest waterway in the country. It is also one of the main means of feeding water to Hurleston reservoir, feeding large numbers of homes and businesses in the Cheshire area. Let us imagine what will happen if there is a significant breach. There are 16,000 boat movements on the Llangollen a year, which could be jeopardised, along with that water supply.</p>
	<p pid="a.373.0/21">I would like the Minister to give us a very clear answer, because the last time we debated t<phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1382" name="Tony Baldry">his, myhon. Friend the Member for Banbury (Tony Baldry)</phrase>, who had previously been a junior Minister in the Department of the Environment, said that there was a contingency fund. No Opposition Member is asking for a penny more money from the Treasury. We are just asking that, if there is a breach, which would cause serious damage to the network, the Minister considers using contingency money, which every Government have done for many years.</p>
	<p pid="a.373.0/22">I would like a clear commitment about what will happen if there is a major breach on the network. The most recent breach was in January on the Brecon and Monmouth canal, which cost &pound;300,000. Luckily, the water just emptied out into a field, but one of these breaches could pose a danger to human and animal life and cause massive disruption to legitimate businesses and jobs. Will the Minister state categorically whether he would be prepared to use contingency funds? They do exist. They have all been allocated; they have all been voted through. It is not new money. If the Minister will not do that, why not?</p>
	<p pid="a.373.0/23">As for the safety backlog, if British Waterways had continued on the course on which it had been led to believe it was set on, it would have eliminated the statutory arrears by 2012. Given that there has now been this complete hiccup, when does the Minister consider that the arrears will be eliminated?</p>
	<p pid="a.373.0/24">On the British Waterways website, there is an interesting comment at paragraph 5.3.6:</p>
	<p pid="a.373.0/25" class="indent">&quot;BW is currently only able to operate commercially on or adjacent to waterways it owns or manages. This restricts both its direct activities and those of its joint ventures. DEFRA and the Cabinet Office are currently considering ways in which this restriction could be removed.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.373.0/26">It seems extraordinary that an organisation with great expertise in managing waterways can operate only on stretches of water contiguous to its existing network.</p>

	<p pid="a.376.0/1">I am glad that the hon. Gentleman pressed that point, because I was about to make it. I wanted to draw the Minister's attention to our rivers. The Severn is currently navigable only as far as Bewdley; in the 17th and 18th centuries, it was navigable right up through Shropshire. In towns such as Bridgnorth, one can still see the remnants of the island that divided the main river from a weir, which generated power, and the channel through which boats travelled.</p>
	<p pid="a.376.0/2">There is a triple hit on this. If we made our rivers navigable again, we would have a very significant source of renewable clean energy. Unlike ridiculous wind farms, which demand vast amounts of public subsidy and do not work, water has been a source of power in this country for centuries. I have been told that the Rhone supplies 10 per cent. of France's energy. If we made the Severn navigable, we could use the power from the weir for green energy. We would then get much more activity through the river, by using the lock system. That would have a further impact on general employment outside matters directly related to boating.</p>
	<p pid="a.376.0/3">I entirely endorse what <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1675" name="Peter Soulsby">the hon. Member for Leicester, South (Sir Peter Soulsby)</phrase> said. We have an organisation, British Waterways, which has great expertise in managing waterways. Why on earth can it not get involved in other projects on stretches of water not contiguous to its own network? Everyone would like British Waterways to stand on its own two feet. Everyone would like it to escape from the clutches of DEFRA and the requirement for subsidies. It seems extraordinary that British Waterways is precluded by statute from taking advantage of our natural river system, which could be a tremendous source of energy and of employment and prosperity.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-03-27a.376.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1842" speakername="Joan Walley" colnum="376"  time="010:09:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070327/halltext/70327h0002.htm#07032749000402">
	<p pid="a.376.1/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1834" name="Charlotte Atkins">my hon. Friend the Member for Staffordshire, Moorlands (Charlotte Atkins)</phrase> on instigating the debate. It is very important that we debate canals in the west midlands. It forms part of what is happening to British waterways altogether and to canals throughout the country. The fact that so many west midlands Members are here to support her sends the Minister the powerful message that we want to find a way to work with him to resolve the problems facing our canal structure.</p>
	<p pid="a.376.1/2">Let me briefly set out my concerns. For some of my first 10 years in Parliament I shadowed the then Transport Minister, and one issue that was constantly raised was what we could do about inland waterways and how we could ensure that we got the investment that we needed. As my hon. Friend the Member for Staffordshire, Moorlands made clear, the Labour Government brought about a real renaissance in investment in the canal structure and built on much of the preparatory work that went on before 1997. I was proud of the fact that what had begun as a transport policy ended up as a far-reaching policy that made it clear that canals were important and that we needed to invest in them. The money that the Government allocated to canals meant that we started to deal with some of the huge backlogs.</p>
	<p pid="a.376.1/3">The Government therefore have a strong and proud record on this issue, but we now face another problem, as we have heard. Problems with single-pot payments and farm subsidies, as well as the mistakes that have been made, mean that the canal structure has become a scapegoat as we try to find the money that we need for other purposes. I understand the problem that the Minister has to solve and I sympathise with him, but I hope that the debate will allow him to draw on the help of those of us who are present and include us in a partnership, because we can ill afford to lose this money and we need to make good the losses. He has been spectacularly successful at encouraging investment in canals, and that has made it all the more clear to people across the country that we cannot afford to lose what is there now. Given that we have seen local canal partnerships with local authorities, with British Waterways taking the lead, and that we have introduced other regeneration initiatives, I hope that the Minister can introduce similar measures now.</p>
	<p pid="a.376.1/4">Most hon. Members present have met representatives of British Waterways and will know that there is a need for a new mechanism that will work across Departments and through the upcoming comprehensive spending review process, as my hon. Friend the Member for Staffordshire, Moorlands suggested. We need a pooled budget so that we can make good the current shortfall at DEFRA using money from transport, regeneration and other budgets. Such a measure is urgently needed because, without it, we will lose momentum on important initiatives. We cannot wait for repairs and we cannot have years of indecision only for projects not to go ahead&mdash;such urgent decisions must be made now. I want the Government, the Minister and the Treasury to be committed to finding a way of working towards all that.</p>
	<p pid="a.376.1/5">Let me briefly flag up a couple of other issues. I am grateful for the work that the British Waterways Board has done in my constituency, particularly under the inspiring leadership of Derek Cochrane. I am sad that he is one of the casualties of the cutbacks and is taking early retirement. Of course, he will do great work elsewhere, but he will not oversee the initiatives that are ready to proceed in my constituency. Much of the local knowledge that British Waterways Board staff have built up will be lost once they leave, having become casualties of the cutbacks of which we are afraid. When that happens, who will lead the continuing renaissance that our canal structure needs? It is incumbent on the Minister to tell us what he can do with British Waterways to have those posts reinstated.</p>
	<p pid="a.376.1/6">When I first came to the House, several hon. Members&mdash;you might well have been one of them, Mr. Martlew&mdash;told me, &quot;Joan, I've recently been to your constituency.&quot; When I expressed surprise and asked why they had been there, they said that they had gone through the canal structure&mdash;along the Trent and Mersey&mdash;to visit the wonderful tourist attractions in my area, including the potteries and the magnificent Staffordshire moorlands. Many people go to the hidden jewel in our area&mdash;the spur of the Caldon canal, to which my hon. Friend the Member for Staffordshire, Moorlands referred, which starts just by the Trent and Mersey and goes through both our constituencies. Many stop off at the improved towpath by the Middle Port pottery, from which, I am pleased to say, the &quot;Antiques Roadshow&quot; will be broadcast in May. Such people come to the area to celebrate the renaissance and regeneration that we have seen, and there have been improvements to the towpath across my constituency, from Burslem right the way up to the Harecastle tunnel. It is essential that those repairs to the tunnel continue, because, without them, Stoke-on-Trent will be completely cut off from a major thoroughfare.</p>
	<p pid="a.376.1/7">I know many of the volunteers who worked so hard all those years ago to dig and reinstate the Caldon canal, and we will not sit back and see it taken away&mdash;no way. We are working with the Inland Waterways Association and everybody who valuesthe canal. We cannot afford to lose parts of the infrastructure that provide the canal with water, such as Stanley reservoir in my constituency and Knypersley pool, to which my hon. Friend referred. At Westport lake, Brownhills high school is building an eco-school as part of a regeneration initiative, but such projects will be under threat if we do not move ahead.</p>
	<p pid="a.376.1/8">Regeneration is not the responsibility only of DEFRA and British Waterways. There is a great deal of commitment on this issue, and we must find a way not only of reinstating the money and getting the continuing commercial agreement and contracts to which my hon. Friend referred, but of getting funding from other Departments to ensure that we build on what we have. Above all, I want the big Burslem port regeneration project in my constituency to go ahead, and we need the British Waterways Board to help with that. Hundreds of years ago, people met in the The Leopard in Burslem to plan the canal system, and I do not want to have meetings there so that people can complain about the system's demise. We must find a way around this problem and we are here to work with the Minister to do that.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-03-27a.379.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1532" speakername="Bob Laxton" colnum="379"  time="010:23:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070327/halltext/70327h0003.htm#07032749000406">
	<p pid="a.379.0/1">I am conscious of the time, so I shall be speedy. My interest in canals goes back many years. I own a narrow-boat. I am not a Member for the west midlands, but I probe into them&mdash;aiming, steering, at the helm or however it is described, through the west midlands toward the BCN. For those who are not aficionados, the BCN is the Birmingham canal navigation, where one can see the huge impact that canals have made. Regeneration in the centres of our major cities, such as Manchester and Birmingham, has been immense, and much of it, although not all, built around the revived canal network.</p>
	<p pid="a.379.0/2">My concern is simply that this debate is a bit of a two-edged sword. On one side, we need to raise the concerns of all users of our inland waterways, whether boaters like myself, cyclists, runners or people who want to go peer at flowers. That is absolutely legitimate. We should do it, we should do more of it and we should do it louder and longer. We should raise that profile. The other side of the sword, though, is that if we are not careful, we will generate in the wider public a view that the canal network is all doom and gloom&mdash;that it will all go back to being bogs and infested ditches with trickles of water down the middle, and will all fall apart. If that happened, it would be an absolute tragedy. Why? Because British Waterways, notwithstanding the cuts in grant aid from DEFRA that it has had to endure, has been eminently successful in its redevelopment work and remains so. It is doing tremendous work through joint venture companies such as ISIS and one of its other commercial arms, British Waterways Marinas Ltd, which has generated large profits that have been ploughed back into British Waterways.</p>
	<p pid="a.379.0/3">The conundrum that we face is that on one hand, we should raise such issues, but on the other, we must consider the view of developers, speculators, homeowners and all those who want to live by water. According to the figures, the values of residential properties by water are 20 per cent. higher than those that are not. Everyone seems to want to live by or on water, and I can readily understand that. I see the look on your face, Mr. Martlew. You may not want to live near water. In fact, at times you have had far too much water, with the floods that your constituency has had to endure. You have suffered personally from too much water, but many people like to live by it.</p>
	<p pid="a.379.0/4">For that reason, we must ensure that we raise the issues but remain optimistic that the canals will remain and improve, and that opportunities for investmentand development along the wonderful network of waterways are enhanced and improved. If that does not happen, British Waterways will find that the income that it is trying to generate to maintain the network falls away. It will not just suffer from the sizeable reduction&mdash;although DEFRA may say that it is a minor one&mdash;in the money made available to it. It will be unable to generate the sort of funds that enable it to maintain the network, and that will send it into a downward spiral.</p>
	<p pid="a.379.0/5">I want to hear the Minister's views about future funding for British Waterways. To my friends and colleagues here, I say that while raising these issues, we need to maintain a buoyant approach, if they will excuse the pun, to the future of British Waterways. We must ensure in managing the system that it remains as financially successful as it has been in the past, if not more so.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-03-27a.382.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1679" speakername="Bill Wiggin" colnum="382"  time="010:33:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070327/halltext/70327h0003.htm#07032749000412">
	<p pid="a.382.1/1">I could not possibly comment on that.</p>
	<p pid="a.382.1/2">This is an important subject. British Waterways is involved in &pound;6 billion-worth of waterside regeneration, including at the Olympic site&mdash;quoting figures about the Olympic site always makes me nervous. It manages 65 sites of special scientific interest and more than1,000 locally designated wildlife sites. It also manages 2,200 miles of canals and rivers, to which there are300 million visitors a year, 5 million visits by coarse anglers and 9 million visits by boaters. There are also 29,000 canal boats on those waterways. About half of this country's population live within five miles of a British Waterways canal or river. British Waterways also manages 11,000 principal assets such as bridges and tunnels, and 12,000 other assets such as embankments, buildings and lock gates. It needs a long-term asset management programme of an estimated &pound;35 million a year&mdash;at 2004 prices&mdash;to ensure sustainability. That is a significant and important catalogue of what British Waterways does.</p>
	<p pid="a.382.1/3">We do not want the impact of cuts to be felt either in the west midlands, where waterways have an historic role, or nationwide. Important capital projects have suffered from reduced investment or have been deferred in the hope that funds will become available. The bridge at Trub farm on the Rochdale canal has been able to find an alternative source of money to cope with the &pound;586,000 reduction in British Waterways investment, but others have not been so lucky. There has been a &pound;464,000 reduction in investment in the Ribble link, and there have been deferments of investments of &pound;208,000 for the Coates lane retaining wall on the Leeds and Liverpool canal and &pound;176,000 for the Milton Keynes culvert. There has been a &pound;250,000 reduction in investment in the Rowlington embankment on the Grand Union canal, which has led to a winter stoppage, and there have been deferments of investments of &pound;252,000 for the refurbishment of Aston locks Nos. 9 and 11, of &pound;133,000 for the Tividale aqueduct repairs, and of &pound;592,000 for the refurbishment of the Vale Royal lock at the Weaver navigation. An investment of &pound;485,000 for the refurbishment at Calverley Wood embankment has been deferred, and there are reduced schemes for 2007-08.</p>
	<p pid="a.382.1/4">There have been further deferments of investments of &pound;540,000 for the piling works at the Shenton embankment and &pound;544,000 for the construction of a new pedestrian bridge at the Long Horse bridge on the River Trent. The maintenance of the Caldon canal has been put back and, as we have heard, towpaths along the Netherton canal and tunnel have been closed. Those are sad statistics to read out, especially given that so many hon. Members care so much about these important assets to our nation.</p>
	<p pid="a.382.1/5">British Waterways has been told to expect a retail prices index minus 5 per cent. funding formula for the forthcoming comprehensive spending review. It cannot maintain its renovation programme with the current budget plans and probably needs at least &pound;5 million a year more to maintain the network at current levels. The Minister in our last debate on this matter said that it was clear that because the Government have funded waterways so generously in the past, they probably need not continue to be so generous. That is similar to the argument that we hear about the NHS, but just because something has been funded generously in the past&mdash;the Government wrongly call it investment, although they have been generous to the NHS and, to some extent, British Waterways&mdash;does not mean that that funding can stop. That is the fundamental problem, and is a great shame. I look forward to hearing from the Minister what we can expect for British Waterways.</p>
	<p pid="a.382.1/6"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1818" name="Owen Paterson">My hon. Friend the Member for North Shropshire (Mr. Paterson)</phrase> spoke passionately about the canals in his constituency, with particular reference to Thomas Telford, including the popular Montgomery canal and the Shropshire Union and Llangollen canals. He also touched on a matter of great importance&mdash;the breaches, particularly to the Llangollen canal. I would like the Minister to answer his question about contingency funds. I doubt whether the Minister will give a commitment, but this is a good opportunity to find out what is available.</p>
	<p pid="a.382.1/7">I agreed with my hon. Friend's comments about what he called the triple hit. If the River Severn were navigable above Bewdley, which is just outside my constituency, there would be a possibility of harnessing green energy from hydro sources. That has been done on the Wye and generates good, clean, sustainable energy. We would also have better transport links, which would move more traffic from the roads on to the waterways. Best of all, more people would be able to take holidays here, which would mean less air travel and would therefore bring a third environmental benefit.</p>
	<p pid="a.382.1/8">Other hon. Members have made important and passionate speeches about their love of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1532" name="Bob Laxton">the canal system. The hon. Member for Derby, North (Mr. Laxton)</phrase> created some wonderful images; I could almost see him in his cap at the helm. He was right about the public relations element to this debate, because we must be conscious not to run down the image of British Waterways or the important work that it does. Its efforts are tremendous. I look forward to going on a canalling holiday because it sounds such fun, and because of the environmental benefits that my hon. Friends have mentioned. I am unable to do so in my constituency because the canal there is still full of mud. All credit to the teams of volunteers who are digging it out, because they do a great job and we should be proud of them.</p>
	<p pid="a.382.1/9">This is a sad debate to be having again. There are a great many questions for the Minister to answer, and I look forward to hearing his responses. We need to know why British Waterways is having its budget cut in this way. We have all assumed that the reason is the Government's grotesque mishandling of the Rural Payments Agency; that has not been confirmed, so perhaps the Minister will do so.</p>
	<p pid="a.382.1/10">Lord Rooker has apologised in another place forthe initial assertions that cuts will not affect the programme of work. They were clearly not true. Perhaps the Minister will apologise for Lord Rooker's earlier statements, because cuts of this nature do impact on the programme of work. Ministerial discussions need to take place between the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and the Treasury about the budget for British Waterways. No such discussions had taken place by the time that I last asked about that. Given the importance of the work of British Waterways, perhaps they have now taken place. I think we should know whether they have.</p>
	<p pid="a.382.1/11">The future of British Waterways is of great importance. Considerations for moving responsibility for British Waterways into the Department for Transport or the Department for Communities and Local Government have been mentioned in this debate, because of the cross-departmental remit involved. The area is clearly not a priority for DEFRA, and that is a tragedy. It might have fitted better under the old Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions, because the subject does not sit comfortably with the DEFRA brief. We can only assume that that is true because of the nature of the replies that we have received on this important debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.382.1/12">The reduction in lottery funding could have a disastrous impact because money is now being diverted to the Olympics, and thus other funding sources will have to be found. Such sources may simply not exist. The DEFRA grant is not the only source of revenue for British Waterways, but it is a very important one. It is also one of the keys to unlocking other sources of money and investment opportunities.</p>
	<p pid="a.382.1/13">The danger of letting the waterways slip into disrepair will affect &pound;6 billion-worth of waterside regeneration, including homes and businesses. I cannot think of anything worse than threatening people's homes and businesses, which is why I agree when the shadow Chancellor talks about the importance of stability and sharing the proceeds of growth. We understand how important people's homes and mortgages are, and how important public expenditure is. That is why we want to share the proceeds of growth.</p>
	<p pid="a.382.1/14">More than 300 million visitors a year could be affected by this situation. I mentioned that there are 29,000 boat owners, but we have also heard about the freight businesses and recreation&mdash;people admiring flowers were even cited; all those people have a valid claim on the Government's ensuring that their beloved canals are maintained. A failure to ensure that inland waterways are maintained will undermine their regeneration and sustainability agendas. We hear all the time about the importance of sustainability, so it is a great shame that we do not see the evidence of that. In fact, we see the opposite&mdash;the damage that the cut will do.</p>
	<p pid="a.382.1/15">There are a lot of unanswered questions. Thanks to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1675" name="Peter Soulsby">the hon. Member for Leicester, South (Sir Peter Soulsby)</phrase>, we tried on <phrase class="date" code="">6 December</phrase> to resolve them. We now need to know more specifics from the Minister. We do not want to be fobbed off with the usual, &quot;Oh, we have been generous in the past&quot; or to be told, &quot;This is just a DEFRA budgeting alteration.&quot; We want to know exactly what the Government are doing and why they are doing it, and to be confident and sure that all the good things that we have heard about from hon. Members today will be safe and secure in the Government's hands. Unfortunately, the evidence shows that that will not be the case.</p>

	<p pid="a.384.0/1">I am delighted to be able to respond to a debate that has been going on for some time. I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1834" name="Charlotte Atkins">my hon. Friend the Member for Staffordshire, Moorlands (Charlotte Atkins)</phrase> not only on securing this debate, but on her studious care and attention to the inland waterways network over a number of years. It has recently resulted in her being awarded the Titania Salver by the Inland Waterways Association. I hesitate to quote from the citation that was used on that occasion, because I suspect that she was partly given the award for her browbeating of me and my Department. The association is conscious of all the work that she has done in her constituency and the surrounding areas for inland waterways over a long period. May I say only that as she has been awarded the Titania Salver, I am pleased to play Bottom to her Titania?</p>
	<p pid="a.384.0/2">A number of hon. Members have spoken. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1842" name="Joan Walley">My hon. Friend the Member for Stoke-on-Trent, North (Joan Walley)</phrase> made <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1844" name="William Cash">her point courteously. The hon. Member for Stone (Mr. Cash)</phrase> made his point in an impartial and neutral way&mdash;the same point was made in a rather less courteous and extremely party political fashion by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1818" name="Owen Paterson">the hon. Member for North Shropshire (Mr. Paterson)</phrase>. The point has recurred throughout the debate, so I should attend to it.</p>
	<p pid="a.384.0/3">I shall not attempt to read out a prepared speech, because much of the discussion that has taken place during parliamentary questions and in other debates in the House over the past months has laid down certain facts in this debate. My seeking to respond to the specific questions raised by colleagues and other hon. Members this morning would be a better use of the available time. First, I shall tackle the key issue assertion that the situation relates in large part to failures in DEFRA's administration of the Rural Payments Agency and the single farm payment.</p>
	<p pid="a.384.0/4">I should make it clear that DEFRA was seeking to find, in-year, &pound;200 million from within its budget. I have detailed in writing to many hon. Members the exact breakdown of that sum, but I shall rehearse it briefly: &pound;95 million was in respect of legacy issues; &pound;40 million was to help meet various other pressures that had arisen early in 2005-06, such as compensation, structural funds, the final cost of foot and mouth disease and property rent increases; and &pound;55 million related to work on flood management, waste, IT and research and development delayed from the previous year.</p>
	<p pid="a.384.0/5">So, some &pound;95 million was devoted to legacy issues coming into the year. Some &pound;65 million related to tighter fiscal rules; a surplus capital charge budget was no longer available to fund programme expenditure due to the clarification of fiscal rules. Some &pound;10 million was needed for extra emergency preparation for dealing with avian influenza. Earlier this year, I received many letters from members of the boating community up and down the country saying that this was all a waste of time and asking why on earth we were spending money on avian influenza. I think that subsequent events put a stop to those rather foolish letters, and that the &pound;10 million was deemed to be well spent on the extra readiness that we put in place.</p>
	<p pid="a.384.0/6">Out of that total of &pound;200 million to deal with pressures, only &pound;23 million&mdash;11 per cent. of the total&mdash;related to the extra RPA running costs inthat financial year. It is extremely ill informed or disingenuous for anyone to suggest that the in-year &pound;3.9 million cut in British Waterways' budget resulted principally from the situation at the Rural Payments Agency. That is just not true; it is not the case, and I hope that this debate has provided the opportunity to lay that to rest at long last.</p>
	<p pid="a.384.0/7">Now for the figures. My hon. Friend the Member for Staffordshire, Moorlands referred to a 12.5 per cent. cut in the budget, which I shall try to clarify again&mdash;I have done so in writing many times&mdash;because it is inaccurate. The indicative baseline figure that was set under the 2004 spending round for 2006-07 was in fact &pound;62.59 million. My hon. Friend has held ministerial office and is an experienced Member of Parliament, so she knows that the formal allocation is always worked out before the financial year and that it does not usually bear a strict correlation with the final year of a three-year comprehensive spending review period.</p>
	<p pid="a.384.0/8">The formal allocation for 2006-07 was &pound;59.429 million. That represents a reduction in the indicative baseline of &pound;3.171 million or 5.066 per cent. Following that, there was an in-year cut&mdash;this is the one to which everyone refers&mdash;of &pound;3.9 million, representing 6.6 per cent. of the budget. The total is &pound;7.1 million, which even on the indicative baseline figure&mdash;that is what my hon. Friend used&mdash;represents 11.3 per cent. However, as she knows, as I know and as every Member in the Chamber knows, the actual in-year cut relates to the formal allocation&mdash;it always does&mdash;which was a cut of 6.61 per cent.&mdash;&pound;3.9 million.</p>
	<p pid="a.384.0/9">I do not want to be tendentious, and I am not trying to say that &pound;3.9 million does not matter, because it does, or that it is a drop in the ocean, because it is not. A cut of the order of &pound;4 million from a total budget of &pound;189.4 million is a sizeable amount for any public body to find and, as my hon. Friend clearly indicated, because it was in-year, it was all the more difficult to find, because many of the funds had already been committed.</p>
	<p pid="a.384.0/10">I am not trying to diminish the difficulty that such a cut in-year can pose for an organisation, but if we believed that every single one of the difficulties, cutbacks and figures to which hon. Members referred this morning related to that &pound;3.9 million, it would have been multiplied many times. Things were being ascribed to that one-off in-year cut&mdash;I emphasise that it is a one-off in-year cut&mdash;that were simply not tenable.</p>

	<p pid="a.387.1/1">I am glad that my hon. Friend raised that issue, and I stress that, as was confirmed in public by Robin Evans at the boat show earlier this year, where there was a public debate on these matters, the&pound;3.9 million funding cut this year has had absolutelyno impact on British Waterways' restructuring programme. That programme was always planned as part of its commitment in its &quot;Waterways for Tomorrow&quot; report, and the efficiencies that it planned better to deliver for the future of the network.</p>
	<p pid="a.387.1/2">Those elements should be clearly separated out. It may be convenient to hide behind the cuts and to say that the restructuring programme was then imposed, and I accept that British Waterways may have brought that programme forward by a few months in response to the cuts, but the restructuring was always planned as part of its commitment to reduce the in-year grant in aid from the Government.</p>
	<p pid="a.387.1/3">Before time runs out, it is essential to address the points about British Waterways' long-term funding. We are working with it to develop a long-term future funding model, and to give it the flexibility to engage in more commercial activity to help it to improve its income stream and to enable the Government's grant in aid to be reduced over time. That has always beenits intention. We are awaiting its proposals for a regulatory reform order to that effect.</p>

	<p pid="a.388.1/1">I welcome the opportunity to discuss the Mines Rescue Service, which has evolved and diversified from a service that was purely focused on coal mines to a specialist organisation and a confined-space rescue service. Owing to the shrinking deep coal mining industry, income is falling, but the basic requirement remains the same, and as a result, the whole service is in danger of collapse at a time when the threat from terrorism and the potential for confined-space attacks like the London underground bombings are high.</p>
	<p pid="a.388.1/2">Mines rescue in one form or another is as old as the coal mines themselves. Standards in the past were slack, and it was common for miners to lose their lives or suffer crippling injuries without the shedding of a single tear from a callous mine owner. Standards developed over the years as tolerance for such atrocities diminished, but disasters still occurred. For example, in my own village of Kelty in Fife, the Lindsay colliery disaster in 1957 cost the lives of nine men, and a further 11 were injured by an explosion. One of the men who was killed was overcome by gas while trying to rescue other miners.</p>
	<p pid="a.388.1/3">At Hill of Beath in 1901, seven men were poisoned by carbon monoxide that was given off as a result of a fire at the Engine colliery. Initially, two men went in to inspect the fire, and when they failed to return, five miners and the colliery manager went to look for them, but they, too, were overcome by gas. They all died. At Seafield in 1973, five miners were killed. In 1931,10 miners at Bowhill were killed by a firedamp.</p>
	<p pid="a.388.1/4">There is a memorial on the site of the Valleyfield miners welfare club, commemorating the 35 men who died in the Valleyfield pit disaster in 1939. The memorial depicts a woman holding a child, and she represents the lost miners' wives, waiting at the pithead for news of their loved ones. I have selected Fife disasters, but I could fill the whole debate with victims from pits throughout the country. That is why the MRS is so important. We must never return to those days of pit disasters.</p>
	<p pid="a.388.1/5">The main focus of the debate is the modernMRS. Following privatisation in 1994, the Health and Safety Commission set objectives for mines rescue:to maintain the existing high standards of rescue provision; command the confidence of all who work in the underground coal industry; ensure the preservation of a national mines rescue capability; ensure small and remote mines have access to rescue services; and avoid disproportionate cost burdens on small mines.</p>
	<p pid="a.388.1/6">In 1996, the company was incorporated to offer a similar service to non-coal mines and to provide other services that would reduce the expense of operating the service for coal mines. It was designated as a non-profit making company, as the mine owners, the Health and Safety Executive, trade unions and the Department for Trade and Industry agreed, and the coal mining companies effectively own it. Today, the MRS has costs of more than &pound;6 million, 122 employees and six sites, and it services 16 coal mines and 28 non-coal mines, storage mines and museums.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-03-27a.389.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2021" speakername="Willie Rennie" colnum="389"  time="011:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070327/halltext/70327h0004.htm#07032749000422">
	<p pid="a.389.0/1">The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right, and I was fortunate to have joined him and the delegation that met the Minister. The MRS needs a short-term respite to keep it going. It is an excellent service, and it has shown great efforts to diversify. It is a first-class organisation that deserves support to keepit going, because, as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1677" name="David Taylor">the hon. Member for North-West Leicestershire (David Taylor)</phrase> says, there are possibilities for coal mining in the future.</p>
	<p pid="a.389.0/2">The Escape and Rescue from Mines Regulations 1995 state that every coal mine owner shall ensure that there are two teams of five rescue workers that are capable of reaching the mine within 60 minutes on a 24-hour basis, and that no mine of coal shall be worked unless the owner is participant in a mines rescue scheme approved by the Secretary of State. It is quite a commitment, and in effect it means that to support the 16 coal mines, there must be 48 brigadesmen and12 rescue officers in four stations. The four stations are at Kellingley in West Yorkshire, Mansfield in Nottinghamshire, Rawdon in Leicestershire and Dinas in Wales. In addition, there are two training centres, in Houghton in Tyne and Wear and at Crossgates in Fife in my constituency.</p>
	<p pid="a.389.0/3">Funding has been mentioned. The centres' core funding is provided by the mine owners on a fee per tonne extracted basis. In 1996, 59 mines extracted some 32 million tonnes; today, there are 16 mines, fewer than one third of the 1996 number, which extract 10 million tonnes, which is also about one third of the 1996 amount. During that time, the fee per tonne has risen only from 12p to 16p, and in fact, the 16p rate has remained the same since 2003-04. The income from the mines has dropped from &pound;3.6 million in 1996 to about &pound;1.67 million for 2006-07. As the mining industry contracts, so does the MRS income. The situation will become worse during the financial year ahead. The fee per tonne will not increase, but yet again, costs have risen. The extraction volume is also expected to fall by another 1.5 million tonnes, which means a further reduction in income of &pound;240,000.</p>
	<p pid="a.389.0/4">For more than 100 years, the MRS has developed its specialist skills, experience and knowledge from working in difficult and potentially dangerous environments to effect the rescue and escape of mine workers from underground. The MRS brings that expertise to support a comprehensive range of health and safety related products. Training and services are available to a range of private sector companies, large and small businesses and public sector organisations, and a variety of courses are provided, with each one structured around first aid, firefighting, health and safety, confined space, breathing apparatus and rescue and consultancy. Its brochure lists 31 different courses, from emergency planning to automatic external defibrillation.</p>
	<p pid="a.389.0/5">The MRS is also contracted to the Coal Authority to attend all coal mining related hazards to ensure public safety. The MRS has diversified into research, and it receives funding from the European Union and the Health and Safety Executive. The company also has contracts with other underground mines.</p>
	<p pid="a.389.0/6">In the most recent financial year, the income from non-deep coal mine reserve cover and training was about &pound;4.5 million&mdash;three times as much as its deep coal mine rescue income. However, that still left a shortfall of about &pound;150,000, and next year, as I have explained, the shortfall will increase to &pound;250,000. The Minister knows that the MRS team from Crossgates was highly praised for its work at the Stockline Plastics factory explosion in Glasgow in 2004. Brian Sweeney, chief officer of Strathclyde fire and rescue service, said at the time:</p>
	<p pid="a.389.0/7" class="indent">&quot;The expertise and commitment of the Mines Rescue team from Crossgates...was invaluable during the search and rescue phase of this tragic incident...This has led to the development of a partnership between both organisations to train firefighters in techniques, to carry out rescues in collapsed structures. The knowledge, skills and expertise of the Mines Rescue staff provide a much valued resource to enhance the skills and safety of firefighters in the area of Urban Search and Rescue.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.389.0/8">Here are some more testimonials. Doncaster chamber of commerce has said:</p>
	<p pid="a.389.0/9" class="indent">&quot;thank you for the excellent first aid refresher&quot;,</p>
	<p pid="a.389.0/10">while the Environment Agency has said:</p>
	<p pid="a.389.0/11" class="indent">&quot;It just goes to show that if you want to have advice on a subject such as rescuing in breathing apparatus, then go to the professional people that do it for a living&quot;.</p>

	<p pid="a.390.1/1">The hon. Gentleman is right to raise that. I had the good fortune of opening the enclosed spaces training facility in Crossgates last year. Some of the organisations that attended, such as the fire and rescue service and the health service, were extremely impressed by the quality of the training provided and were keen to have greater connections. We need to spread those connections throughout the country, to ensure that everybody knows what the Mines Rescue Service can offer. The Under-Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1813" name="Meg Munn">the hon. Member for Sheffield, Heeley (Meg Munn)</phrase>, has been extremely helpful in setting up some of those introductions, but much more needs to be done, so I am grateful for the hon. Gentleman's intervention.</p>
	<p pid="a.390.1/2">British Airways has said:</p>
	<p pid="a.390.1/3" class="indent">&quot;The professional way in which the material was delivered also deserves high credit, and feedback from the students was the best course some had ever been on.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.390.1/4">Nottinghamshire police said:</p>
	<p pid="a.390.1/5" class="indent">&quot;Police drivers are highly skilled officers and require highly skilled training development. The course provided certainly met up to our expectations.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.390.1/6">There are many more recommendations from those who have received training from the MRS up and down the country.</p>
	<p pid="a.390.1/7">What are the solutions? Those testimonials are just the tip of the iceberg. The Mines Rescue Service can provide so much more, but it is in severe danger of collapsing. How do we plug the &pound;250,000 shortfall this coming year and secure the financial future of the organisation with a contracting deep mines industry? Could the shortfall come from the owners of the MRS? Ironically, the deep mines are holding back the MRS, because the fees from the mines do not cover the real costs of providing the service. Fees from other work are much more lucrative. For example, the Crossgates and Houghton stations make a surplus each year, which contributes to the viability of the company as a whole. It is no coincidence that there is no requirement to support the mining industry at those stations.</p>
	<p pid="a.390.1/8">I therefore believe that the mine owners should be paying more, but can they afford it? Last year, the company that owns most of the country's deep mines, UK Coal, made a &pound;17.5 million operating profit. However, in the previous year the company made a loss of &pound;33 million. The turnaround was due mainly to the revaluation of the land bank, which returned a&pound;69 million profit.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-03-27a.391.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2021" speakername="Willie Rennie" colnum="391"  time="011:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070327/halltext/70327h0005.htm#07032749000426">
	<p pid="a.391.1/1">One of the objectives that was set out for the company in the first place was that the cost of the Mines Rescue Service should not fall unfairly on the small mines. That is something that we must consider when we are developing policy. UK Coal has made substantial profits in the past year. Perhaps we need to work out an innovative way to ensure that it pays its fair share towards the development of the service, but we must also ensure that the small mines do not suffer and that we support them.</p>
	<p pid="a.391.1/2">The &pound;69 million profit from the revaluation of the land bank, the &pound;33 million operating loss from last year and the &pound;17.5 million operating profit from this year gives a confused picture. One wonders what UK Coal can actually afford. However, since it made a profitthis year, it should be stepping up to the plate and contributing more.</p>
	<p pid="a.391.1/3">The MRS has made great strides in securing funding from other markets, including from the Health and Safety Executive for research and the European Union. The difficulty with funding from European Union is that a significant bond is required in case the research is not completed to the satisfaction of the Commission. Perhaps the Government could act as guarantors and provide that bond, thereby releasing the MRS reserves for the development of the organisation. I should be interested to hear the Minister's response on that.</p>
	<p pid="a.391.1/4">The MRS has also been increasingly involved in the provision of training for a large number of private and public sector bodies. There is so much scope for expansion in that area. I am grateful to the Under-Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government for the introductions to the Chief Fire Officers Association, which resulted from a meeting with a delegation of Members of Parliament last year. I was unable to attend that meeting, but I understand that it was productive, so I hope that there will be some more income for the MRS as a result of it. That should help to secure additional sources of funding, when those other services see the invaluable service that the MRS provides. We need every Department in the whole of Government, at the UK and devolved levels, to think about what further introductions can be made. The more introductions that are made, the greater chance we have to sell the MRS's wares. I am grateful to the Minister for meeting us last year to explore some of the quite complex issues to do with the Mines Rescue Service. I know that he is keen to ensure that the service continues.</p>
	<p pid="a.391.1/5">Most important of all is the essential service that the Mines Rescue Service can provide in the event of violent terrorist attacks that require the rescue of civilians from confined spaces. As we have heard from Brian Sweeney, the service provided by the MRS was invaluable at the Stockline Plastics disaster. However, we could face more underground terrorist attacks like the 7/7 attacks. In such circumstances we would need to call on the MRS for expert rescue assistance. When the MRS currently responds to a national disaster it is not paid for that turnout, nor is it paid a retainer. That must change.</p>
	<p pid="a.391.1/6">Perhaps we should be turning the MRS into the fourth emergency service. The cost of providing the police, ambulance and fire services in the United Kingdom is approximately &pound;15 billion a year. We are not suggesting anything near that level of funding, especially as the MRS is increasingly successful in training, research and other private work. However, surely the Government could plug the projected current annual shortfall of &pound;250,000, so that they could call on the MRS in emergency situations. That figure is only around 0.0017 per cent. of the total budget for the police, fire and ambulance services&mdash;not a considerable sum.</p>
	<p pid="a.391.1/7">I still consider myself the new boy in the House. I recognise the work of hon. Members who have pressed tirelessly on this issue for some time, including the hon. Members for North-West Leicestershire (David Taylor), for Elmet (Colin Burgon), for Houghton and Washington, East (Mr. Kemp), for Rhondda (Chris Bryant) and for Sherwood (Paddy Tipping), and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1789" name="Kevin Barron">the right hon. Member for Rother Valley (Mr. Barron)</phrase>. They have been strong advocates for the MRS and I can see why. I am very proud to have the Mines Rescue Service in my constituency. It is an excellent example of a professional and innovative organisation that has triumphed against the odds, and in extremely challenging financial circumstances. In this world, there is little room for reward for things done in the past, but the Government should recognise the value of something when it has it.</p>

	<p pid="a.392.0/1">I am delighted to follow <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2021" name="Willie Rennie">the hon. Member for Dunfermline and West Fife (Willie Rennie)</phrase>. I hear what he said about his recent interest in the Mines Rescue Service, but he has been a powerful champion of it. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1677" name="David Taylor">My hon. Friends the Members for North-West Leicestershire (David Taylor)</phrase> and for Houghton and Washington, East (Mr. Kemp) and I have been involved in the campaign for a longer period. My association with the Mines Rescue Service goes back to before privatisation. In 1994, I was involved in the debate about the future of the Mines Rescue Service post-privatisation. The service became a limited company in 1996 and, as has been said, it is in effect owned by the coal mining industry.</p>
	<p pid="a.392.0/2">The Mines Rescue Service has changed dramatically in the past 10 years because the UK coal industry has changed. I strongly believe that there is still a case for the future of the deep-mined coal industry in this country, but it will be far smaller than in the past. That is the essence of the service's difficulty. As collieries have closed and production has reduced, the income or levy from production for the Mines Rescue Service has dwindled away. We have heard the figures in this debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.392.0/3">In Nottinghamshire, there are still three collieries: Thorsby, Welbeck and Harworth, which at present is mothballed and not producing. The Mines Rescue Service headquarters is based in Mansfield. It is important for the coal industry&mdash;the three collieries in Nottinghamshire, the 15 collieries nationally and the30 other mining operations to which the service offers support and assistance. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1462" name="Nick Palmer">My hon. Friend the Member for Broxtowe (Dr. Palmer)</phrase> is here, but he is unable to speak in this debate; he knows only too well the value and importance of the Mines Rescue Service and the high regard in which it is held in the Nottinghamshire area.</p>
	<p pid="a.392.0/4">Under the leadership of Barrie Jones, its chief executive, the Mines Rescue Service has changed dramatically. It has perceived that there is a problem about income and has diversified dramatically. It runs a range of training courses across the country; they are highly valued, seen to be highly professional and provide an alternative income for the service.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-03-27a.395.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1473" speakername="David Howarth" colnum="395"  time="011:31:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070327/halltext/70327h0005.htm#07032749000430">
	<p pid="a.395.0/1">I, too, congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2021" name="Willie Rennie">my hon. Friend the Member for Dunfermline and West Fife (Willie Rennie)</phrase> on securing this debate on an important subject. As some hon. Members in the Chamber already know, I am the grandson of a miner, and I am fully aware of the effects that mining disasters have on communities. When I was a boy in the village in which my father was born and in which my sister still lives, people still talked about the mine disaster at Pelsall Hall colliery in 1872, which was almost 100 years before then, when 22 people died. The disasters in the 1930s at the Grove colliery in Brownhills and the West Cannock colliery had a similar effect. The Mines Rescue Service is extremely important, and it is right that the coal industry morally and legally should be not allowed to operate without a fully-fledged rescue service in operation.</p>
	<p pid="a.395.0/2">In 2002, the Health and Safety Executive concluded after considering all the other possible models for running the Mines Rescue Service that the present model was the best. The other options were rejected. That is quite right. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1815" name="Paddy Tipping">The study said, as the hon. Member for Sherwood (Paddy Tipping)</phrase> mentioned, that one of the long-term problems with the service was financial. As the amount of coal mined declined, the levy per tonne would eventually not raise enough money for the Mines Rescue Service to operate unless the levy were raised or other forms of finance were found. The Mines Rescue Service has been active in looking for other forms of finance.</p>
	<p pid="a.395.0/3">However, the shortfall of &pound;250,000 needs to be dealt with. The case has been made for extra state funding and, given the wider benefits of the Mines Rescue Service, including those mentioned by the hon. Gentleman, I accept that there is a case for doing that. It seems to me that the fundamental purpose of the Mines Rescue Service remains one that arises from the activities of coal mining. Fundamentally, mine rescue is a cost of coal mining and the coal mining industry should bear its fair share of that cost. That brings us back to the levy.</p>
	<p pid="a.395.0/4">The levy has not been increased since 2003, when it was increased to 16p per tonne. In the two years that the hon. Member for Sherwood mentioned, when the coal authority paid &pound;2.5 million, that was instead of the levy rather than in addition to it. For the &pound;250,000 gap to be closed just by using the levy would require an increase of between 2p and 3p per tonne of coal, depending on the assumptions about how much coal will be mined in future years. In a transitional year there may be some need for transitional funding, but in the longer term the increase would have to be around that amount.</p>
	<p pid="a.395.0/5">The question has been raised whether the coal industry could afford an increase in the levy of between 2p and 3p. Well, what is the price of coal? At the moment, it is about $68 per metric tonne. It has risen by about 28 per cent. in recent times. Those figures are all taken from UK Coal's annual financial statement. It seems that an increase in the levy of less than a 10th of 1 per cent. of the price of coal per tonne would not be an unreasonable amount to add to the industry's costs.</p>
	<p pid="a.395.0/6">The hon. Member for Sherwood mentioned the difficulty for small mines that are starting up, especially in Wales, but the regulations already allow for some variation to deal with that point. Such an increase would add only a small burden on UK Coal, asthe biggest player in the industry. My hon. Friend the Member for Dunfermline and West Fife raised the question whether UK Coal, which is now as much a property company as a coal company, could bear those burdens. UK Coal's financial results&mdash;let us ignore the property aspects of the company for now&mdash;statethat deep mining is showing &quot;improved operating performance&quot; and that in the last three months of the previous financial year, the company's coal mining operation was operating at a profit.</p>
	<p pid="a.395.0/7">I would be interested to hear the Minister's view on the levy. I accept that there might have to be some blending of public funding and levy funding to get the Mines Rescue Service through the difficult period that it is in. However, we should not let the owners off the hook in the way they have been for many centuries.</p>

	<p pid="a.397.0/1">The income to which the hon. Gentleman has referred is the fee income fromcoal mining. Almost &pound;5 million per year&mdash;a growing figure&mdash;of income comes from other sources and that is what balances the books at the moment. That is an important point.</p>

	<p pid="a.397.1/1">Indeed, but the service is making an overall loss even when that is taken into account. The hon. Gentleman is right to say that the figures to which I have referred are for the income from revenues from the coal industry.</p>
	<p pid="a.397.1/2">If the charge is kept at 16p a tonne, the Mines Rescue Service expects the revenue to drop by some &pound;250,000 as less coal is produced. The UK produced13 million tonnes of coal in 2004-05, which dropped to &pound;9.5 million in 2005-06. It rose again slightly last year, but is expected to drop in the year to come.</p>
	<p pid="a.397.1/3">Without any doubt, the Mines Rescue Service deserves a great deal of credit for the way in which it has diversified and been able to bring its expertise to bear in other areas, too. The hon. Member for Dunfermline and West Fife rightly quoted Brian Sweeney, chief officer of Strathclyde fire and rescue service, who paid tribute to the work that the Mines Rescue Service had been able to do at the fire at Stockline Plastics in Glasgow.</p>
	<p pid="a.397.1/4">A submission that we received from the Mines Rescue Service outlines the main risks that it faces. They include any marked decline in the coal industry greater than that already anticipated, the loss of major customers such as the Coal Authority, the actions of competitors, particularly in pricing where roster restrictions impact on the company's cost base, and the pension scheme obligations. The submission states that</p>
	<p pid="a.397.1/5" class="indent">&quot;a triennial valuation is currently under way and the deficit, already recognised in our accounts...is expected to be confirmed as a 'funding' deficit which will mean additional cash contributions to clear the deficit over the next 5 years&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.397.1/6">Those are the issues that the Mines Rescue Service recognises as being the most challenging.</p>
	<p pid="a.397.1/7">There are several key questions for the Minister to answer. We heard about the delegation that visited him last year. Following on from that meeting, can he tell us precisely what steps he is taking to ensure the long-term survival of the Mines Rescue Service? As we heard, three quarters of its work is now not connected with mining; for example, it now works in conjunction with the fire and rescue services. What discussions is the Minister having, or has he had, with the Home Office and other Departments in respect of encouraging and promoting that aspect of its work?</p>
	<p pid="a.397.1/8">We also heard about issues connected to potential terrorist atrocities and incidents in this country. Conservatives happen to believe that they would be better approached through a department of homeland security, but, in the absence of such a department, is the Minister having discussions with other Government Departments about the role that the Mines Rescue Service can play in this area? It has expertise, but we have heard that it is not actually remunerated when that expertise is drawn on. We must ensure that such expertise is readily available when the country needs it most. That will take the role of the Mines Rescue Service beyond providing a service to the mining industry alone to being something that the nation needs and relies on.</p>
	<p pid="a.397.1/9">Has the Minister had discussions with the Mines Rescue Service about exporting its expertise? We have seen how the nuclear research establishment has rebranded itself as Nexia and is now selling its expertise around the world so that people who want to know how to build nuclear power stations, and who want to understand all the associated risks and issues, can come to a British company that is a world leader. A similar approach could be adopted by the Mines Rescue Service. What conversations is the Minister having with UK Trade and Investment about the support that it might be able to give in developing such lines of business?</p>
	<p pid="a.397.1/10">Does the Minister have evidence about whether the coal that is imported into this country&mdash;an increasing proportion of the amount that is used&mdash;is produced to the same levels of safety protection that we have in this country? Many of us suspect that it probably is not. We can look around the world to countries such as China. It is estimated&mdash;there are no exact figures&mdash;that between 3,000 and 5,000 people die each year in its coal mining industry. We know that the safety standards in many countries are not nearly as high as they are in this country, and that the price of domestic coal is therefore higher. What efforts is the Minister taking with international partners to ensure that overall safety levels around the world are driven up? In that context, what is he doing with UKTI to increase the export potential for UK coal?</p>
	<p pid="a.397.1/11">There has been a useful discussion during this debate about the scope for increasing fees. Has the Minister had direct discussions with the Mines Rescue Service board about that? Clearly, there is a dilemma. There is a potential conflict of interest when the board is made up of the people who are actually the users of the service. On the one hand, from the Mines Rescue Service perspective, board members want to charge a realistic price that will cover the cost of the service, but, on the other hand, they want to keep costs down so that they have fewer costs to pass on to their consumers. I believe that we all agree that there should be no compromising of safety, and that the costs must be realistic and reflected in the price of coal. What conversations has the Minister had with the board to ensure that it is truly charging realistic but affordable fees?</p>
	<p pid="a.397.1/12">Clearly, one way to deal with the issue is to produce more coal in this country. The Minister is well aware of the problems that many of those who are involved in coal production face in respect of planning consents, especially in Scotland. Such problems are hampering many potential new developments that would enable British coal to compete more effectively against cheaper imports. What discussions is he having with Department for Communities and Local Government Ministers about that? Does he expect that the energy White Paper that will be produced soon will address this issue so that the potential for producing more coal can be developed and, therefore, the money available to the Mines Rescue Service can be increased?</p>
	<p pid="a.397.1/13">I am sure that the Minister is also well aware of the Mines Rescue Service pension deficit. The pension liabilities that the company inherited from the Government following privatisation could threaten the future of the service. Does he have plans for support that might be given, or has he been involved in discussions with other Ministers about the matter?</p>
	<p pid="a.397.1/14">What came through in the contributions of everyone who spoke in this debate is the recognition that this issue is wider than the coal industry, and that other Government Departments should be involved as well. I hope that the Minister will be able to give us some reassurance in that respect.</p>
	<p pid="a.397.1/15">This is an extremely exciting time in terms of energy. The energy White Paper that came out four years ago dealt with extending the lifespan of existing sources of electricity supply. Now the debate is about how we can bring on stream entirely new sources of supply that had not been thought of just a short time ago. Those sources will have a fundamental impact on the coal industry. Last week, the Minister and I were discussing a statutory instrument on the use of biomass, and how it could increase the use of coal and give it a more viable future. There is a debate about carbon capture and storage, which also has the potential to give the coal industry in this country an extraordinarily exciting new lease of life. If those developments occur, the Mines Rescue Service will become more important than ever. What is needed is a vision that tides it over this current difficult period to a time when its prospects may be much greater.</p>
	<p pid="a.397.1/16">There are other areas into which the service could move. Nuclear waste storage is something that Governments have consistently failed to address seriously enough. The approach being taken in other countries of deep disposal would require exactly the sort of service, and the knowledge of underground working and safety provisions that the Mines Rescue Service currently provides. We are approaching a situation in which the Government expect a major expansion of the nuclear programme. Should that come to fruition, it would yet again provide new opportunities for the Mines Rescue Service.</p>
	<p pid="a.397.1/17">At present we do not know which developments are feasible. We do not know whether carbon capture and storage can be made to work, or whether there will be a new fleet of nuclear power stations. Such matters must be worked out on a cross-party basis.</p>
	<p pid="a.397.1/18">The Mines Rescue Service was set up with one specific objective&mdash;mine safety&mdash;but the world has moved on greatly since that time. Opportunities will come from other areas where its expertise can be developed. The time has therefore come to decide whether the current structure of the Mines Rescue Service is right to meet the challenges, or whether its format needs to be restructured to allow it to compete in a new and exciting world. I hope that the Minister can answer some of those questions, and, once again, I commend the hon. Member for Dunfermline and West Fife for raising this important subject.</p>

	<p pid="a.399.0/1">It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship this morning, Mr. Martlew. I, too, would like to congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2021" name="Willie Rennie">the hon. Member for Dunfermline and West Fife (Willie Rennie)</phrase> on securing this debate. We have debated the issue on previous occasions, but <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1815" name="Paddy Tipping">the speech by my hon. Friend the Member for Sherwood (Paddy Tipping)</phrase> and the interventions by colleagues show the interest and concern in the House on this important matter.</p>
	<p pid="a.399.0/2">By way of background, after privatisation of the coal industry in 1994, two of the principal stated aims of the Health and Safety Executive were, first, that the high standard of mines rescue provision be maintained, and, secondly, that a national capability be preserved. I am glad to say that those aims have been fulfilled by Mines Rescue Services Ltd. With its origins as the in-house rescue operation of the British Coal Corporation, it has, as a private sector company, delivered the statutory mines rescue scheme for more than 10 years.</p>
	<p pid="a.399.0/3">I met representatives of the company in the recent past in my former role as Energy Minister and was extremely impressed by the obvious professionalism and dedication that they bring to their work. I note and support the commendations of the Mines Rescue Service that we have heard from colleagues today. Clearly, it is hazardous work. Mining is by its very nature an industry that faces constant challenges involving the control and minimisation of risk. I have nothing but admiration for the workers who day in and day out face up to such risks to win the coal that continues to provide an important element of our energy needs. Members of the Mines Rescue Service and the MRS trained teams at individual mines take such risks a step further. They are the men who choose to make themselves available to enter the most hostile environments, where risk has crystallised into full-blown danger and lives, including their own, may be at immediate risk. Although, I sadly note that there have been recent fatalities at English mines, I am glad to say that such circumstances are rare.</p>
	<p pid="a.399.0/4">Those who work for the Mines Rescue Service have invaluable, highly specialist skills. Local authority emergency services will in most cases attend fires, explosions and gas leaks that are mainly on the surface in normal residential, commercial and industrial premises, but they do not generally have the specialist knowledge, technical skills and practical experience necessary to cope with underground emergencies, which, as we have heard, require very particular skills in tunnelling, gas management and the use of specialist breathing apparatus. Mines rescuers are the people who do have such skills.</p>
	<p pid="a.399.0/5">As well as physical risks, those involved in deep mining face considerable commercial risks. That issue has provided something of a backdrop to this debate. Clearly, as production contracts, whether through mine closures or otherwise disrupted production, the MRS levy income suffers. It is an open secret that deep-mine operators have a difficult set of challenges to meet if they are to compete successfully with internationally traded coal. Conscious of those pressures, I understand that MRS Ltd has taken the decision, thus far at least, not to increase the tonnage levy from its current level of 16p. Although I fully appreciate that any increase would be unwelcome from the operators' perspective, we should not lose sight of the fact that it is within MRS's rights to set the levy at the rate required to cover its operating expenses. I carefully noted <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1473" name="David Howarth">the comments of the hon. Member for Cambridge (David Howarth)</phrase> on that matter and although I am sure that it is constantly under review by the board, it would be a useful outcome from this debate if, on hearing our words, the board revisited that issue as a matter of urgency.</p>

	<p pid="a.400.0/1"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1473" name="David Howarth">The hon. Member for Cambridge (David Howarth)</phrase> clearly made the point that for each penny extra on the levy, there would be &pound;100,000 extra income accruing. The gap that we are trying to bridge is only hundreds of thousands of pounds and, although such a figure is a miniscule fraction of operating costs, the mine owners are resisting it. I wonder whether the Minister will also raise that point.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-03-27a.401.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1523" speakername="Malcolm Wicks" colnum="401"  time="011:48:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070327/halltext/70327h0006.htm#07032749000438">
	<p pid="a.401.2/1">I am mindful of the fact that I am no longer the Energy Minister and that I am now learning my science, but I think that the coal forum deliberations are proceeding well and that they will, of course, feed into the policy process leading to the publication of the White Paper. The area of greatest success and further potential for MRS lies in its expertise in working in confined spaces with sophisticated breathing apparatus. That can provide inroads into assistance with training of the established emergency services and, in some cases, into working alongside them. Again, I am echoing the words of colleagues in making that point.</p>
	<p pid="a.401.2/2">When I met with MRS representatives last year, I noted with interest that two out of the company's six operational bases were no longer involved in the core business of mines rescue at all and, indeed, had ceased to be required in the context of the statutory mines rescue scheme. However, Crossgates and Houghton stations, which serve the latterly isolated collieries of Longannet and Ellington respectively, have remained open despite the closures of the mines because, through training and other third-party services, a surplus has been generated that cross-subsidises the core rescue function.</p>
	<p pid="a.401.2/3">MRS Ltd has already forged links with a number of regional fire services, the Fire Service College and committees concerned with the operational procedures that underpin the new urban search and rescue capability within the regional emergency services. It has also had recent discussions with ministerial colleagues in the Department for Communities and Local Government and is following up further avenues. Despite all those efforts, I understand that, as was the case last financial year, MRS Ltd anticipates posting an operational loss in the region of &pound;300,000 as at the end of this month. Although my Department has provided the company with substantial funding in the past, I am afraid that, given our own budgetary pressures, it continues to be the case that the Department of Trade and Industry is no longer in a position to provide financial support. I continue to encourage the company to build on the excellent progress that it has made in broadening its client base and its range of activity. Therein, I believe, lies the key to a sustainable future.</p>
	<p pid="a.401.2/4">I add two things. First, I shall explore with colleagues whether it would be useful&mdash;I suspect that it will be&mdash;to have a meeting between the relevant DTI Minister, my noble colleague Lord Truscott, and a Minister from the Department for Communities and Local Government. I am mindful also of the interest of the Department for Work and Pensions, through its ministerial responsibility for the Health and Safety Executive. I shall explore that with colleagues. I know that there have been meetings at official level between the DCLG and my Department on the matter. I think that it might now be useful to have a ministerial meeting.</p>
	<p pid="a.401.2/5">Secondly, I note the comments of the hon. Member for Dunfermline and West Fife about the security that MRS has to provide in relation to EU grant funding, which obviously ties up cash. Without making any commitments, I promise that we will consider that. We may not have the scope to do much, but I promise to look at the matter.</p>
	<p pid="a.401.2/6">It has been a useful debate. It shows the deep regard that the House has for the coal mining industry and our warm affection for the valuable and hazardous work of MRS. In the longer term, there will be solutions as MRS expands its role. I acknowledge that there are some short-term difficulties; I and my colleagues will continue to discuss them and think them through.</p>

	<p pid="a.403.3/1">I shall mention T in the Park later, but my hon. Friend is right that such things happen all too often.</p>
	<p pid="a.403.3/2">Touting is rife at major sporting and cultural events throughout the UK. We host some of the world's best events, be they football matches at Hampden and Wembley, rugby matches at Twickenham or music concerts at the Scottish exhibition and conference centre in Glasgow, the national exhibition centre in Birmingham, Old Trafford in Manchester or the Millennium stadium in Cardiff. Ticket touting affects fans all over the country, and the touting industry has grown rapidly with the growth of online purchasing. At the click of a button, people can purchase tickets for any concert at any venue worldwide. Online sites such as eBay and frontrowtickets.com offer easy methods of buying and selling tickets at grossly inflated prices, but no laws deem that to be illegal. Our reputation as the host of some of the world's best acts or sporting events is threatened by touts, and some acts are reluctant to perform in the UK because of them. The question is whether we would have been successful in our 2012 Olympic bid if we had not addressed the problem.</p>
	<p pid="a.403.3/3">We recently saw the frenzy when Take That announced their Beautiful reunion tour. The tickets were sold out within 30 minutes; indeed, no sooner had the hotlines opened that fans were greeted with a telephone message saying that the tour was sold out. Then, however, they found that the precious tickets that they had been waiting for were on sale on eBay for about three times the original price. A search on eBay on <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-26">26 March</phrase> found that 617 Take That tickets were available to buy or bid for, with the cheapest selling at &pound;200 for two tickets, even though the original price had been &pound;45. That is unacceptable and something must be done about it. It is daylight robbery, and those responsible should be punished for their actions.</p>
	<p pid="a.403.3/4">It is not only music fans who suffer at the hands of touts, and some of our major sporting events have been threatened. A search on eBay on <phrase class="date" code="2005-06-06">6 June 2005</phrase> found137 tickets for sale for the Wimbledon men's final, but they were priced at &pound;1,650 per pair. The site even offered tickets allocated to wheelchair users, but they were double the price. That in itself is a scandal.</p>
	<p pid="a.403.3/5">Often, sellers pretend that they have a clash of commitments and are no longer able to go to the event. Such people must suffer from amnesia, because the majority sell their tickets only minutes after the tour has been announced, with most tickets being auctioned before they have even been printed or distributed. I have no problem with people who genuinely have to sell their tickets&mdash;at the original price&mdash;because they suddenly realise that they have another commitment. However, those who fleece people to line their own wallets should face the consequences.</p>

	<p pid="a.405.1/1">I have three daughters and I tried to get tickets for them for the very same concert. I failed miserably, and much though they might have thought that an MP can get them everything they want, things did not work out that way.</p>
	<p pid="a.405.1/2">The key principle that STAR's terms and conditions require the OFT to agree to is that people cannot resell their ticket for commercial gain, and that is quite fair. The Government must pursue the OFT to ensure that it concludes its deliberations and rules that it is a breach of the terms and conditions to resell tickets for profit.</p>
	<p pid="a.405.1/3">The Secretary of State encouraged the industry to tackle the problem without Government intervention. Primary markets have tried different methods, but there has been no voluntary movement from the secondary markets to sign up to a code of conduct on ticketing. That makes things increasingly difficult for concert promoters and managers, who spend every night of their week dealing with distraught members of the public who turn up at gigs only to find that the person who has their ticket has not appeared.</p>
	<p pid="a.405.1/4">It should be remembered that doing something about touting was a 1997 Labour party manifesto commitment. I appreciate that the Minister was not sympathetic to the aims of my party at that time, but he saw the light in 1999 and joined the Labour party, so perhaps he could see the light again as regards touting.</p>
	<p pid="a.405.1/5">The Rugby Football Union spends &pound;50,000 a year on average fighting ticket touts. Although legislation is in place to target some touts, enforcement is poor, and many sports associations must spend their own time and money monitoring the secondary market to ensure that supporters do not lost out to touts. Many websites offering tickets use the official logos of concert promoters, groups and sporting associations to imply that the tickets are on sale from official sites. That is intellectual property theft and must also be stopped.</p>
	<p pid="a.405.1/6">Many organisers must increase security and the number of stewards on the day of their event to target double-booking, touts not turning up with tickets and fans who are duped into thinking they have seats when they do not, because unfortunately that occasionally leads to violence in arenas and surrounding areas. Not only must stewards act as seating guides and health and safety officers, they must double up as police officers to patrol the grounds. I am also concerned that young people, particularly young girls, who are desperate to see their favourite pop acts spend time hanging around concert venues waiting to buy tickets from touts.</p>
	<p pid="a.405.1/7">How can we fix the problem and allow loyal supporters and true fans to get the tickets that they deserve? One way is for the Government and the industry to work together. The industry has outlined its needs and has worked hard on its own in the past few years, but it is about time that legislation was passed. The Government recently enacted legislation to prevent ticket touts from operating at the London Olympics. It was easily done through an amendment to the London Olympics Bill. Why can it not be done for all major sporting and cultural events? Should the legal position regarding the resale of tickets change, eBay has stated that for all other sports it will review its policies to comply with any new regulations. What better case is there for the Government to act? Perhaps the 2014 Commonwealth games bid in Glasgow might help. Addressing ticket touting would show the Commonwealth Games Federation that Glasgow and the rest of the UK are serious about tackling the problem, which would help the bid.</p>
	<p pid="a.405.1/8">In the Australian Parliament, an amendment to the Major Sports Facilities Act 2001 made ticket touting illegal, resulting in the prosecution of three women who attempted to sell tickets to a Red Hot Chili Peppers gig in April for more than their face value. The Police Minister warned that ticket touting, known there as scalping, would not be tolerated and that anyone wanting to make a quick buck would be charged. If Australia can do it, why cannot we? Some believe that the public want a secondary market to buy tickets that sell out within minutes of going on sale. Why, then, have I received letters, e-mails and telephone calls from my constituents and many others thanking me for raising the subject in Parliament and calling on the Government to do something?</p>
	<p pid="a.405.1/9">I met people from eBay recently, as I was interested to hear what it had to say. It has yielded to public pressure following backlashes after Princess Diana memorial concert tickets were sold at over-inflated prices. When tickets to the memorial of Australian wildlife expert Steve Irwin were sold for commercial gain, they were withdrawn from eBay, a move welcomed by the public. Why should it be any different for someone selling tickets for a profit of &pound;900? Surely denying real fans access to tickets and making obscene profits as a result is just as bad. However, eBay is not the only online company dealing with the problem. It is only a marketplace. Indeed, eBay is not the company exploiting individuals; it is just the middleman.</p>
	<p pid="a.405.1/10">I welcome the Scottish Sunday newspapers' campaign against ticket touting. They recently profiled the touts caught selling tickets to T in <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2020" name="Jim Devine">the Park, which my hon. Friend the Member for Livingston (Mr. Devine)</phrase> mentioned. They are encouraging readers to contact them if they encounter a tout, and have named and shamed touts with photographs. Probably more sinister is Ticketmaster, a primary market that has recently introduced a ticket bidding option on its site. As an example, the lowest original price on Ticketmaster for Genesis tickets was &pound;55. Why, then, is it allowing bidding on the option part of its website to begin at &pound;80, climbing to &pound;440 for a front row, centre stage ticket? I have not yet received any requests for meetings with Ticketmaster, but I would be interested to know why it believes that to be a fair system of accessing concert tickets.</p>
	<p pid="a.405.1/11">How will the future of concerts and sporting events look if the problem is not addressed? There is a worry that company shareholders will put their percentage of allocated tickets up for auction in the same way as touts. That means, for example, that 75 per cent. of capacity would sell in the normal way and the remaining 25 per cent. would be auctioned, with grossly inflated profits going into the hands of the shareholders. Either way, the consumer, the electorate and the constituents whom we try to protect with every law that we pass will lose out.</p>
	<p pid="a.405.1/12">Many artists, promoters and sporting associations have tried their own methods of targeting ticket touting, but to no avail. The only avenue left is through Government intervention and legislation. T in the Park, which Geoff Ellis boasts is Scotland's largest outdoor festival, has been working on the problem for years. He has contacted lawyers to get websites to remove the official T in the Park logos that many use to advertise tickets. Indie rock band the Arctic Monkeys weighed in by offering tickets to the latest gig only to fans on the mailing list. However, that did not prove successful, as anyone could register, as they did, receive a personal identification number, and then flog tickets minutes later in an online marketplace for double their face value.</p>
	<p pid="a.405.1/13">I urge the Government to conduct a public consultation into ticket touting, taking evidence from all involved, from concert promoters to eBay and other websites, to individual music and sporting fans. The industry has gone as far as it possibly can in self-regulation, something that we do poorly in this country. We need further and stronger Government intervention. The all-party group on music, of which I am the chair, is willing to help. We have contacts among artists, concert promoters and other primary markets who are more than willing to help to tackle the problem. It is not rocket science. The first move to is to make it illegal, and the how will follow.</p>
	<p pid="a.405.1/14">I am also chair of the communications all-party group. After 31 years' work in the industry and six as chair, I know that the technology exists to stop touting. All that we need is a commitment to the cause from everybody. I recently attended a reception hosted by O2, where a representative told me of a recent event to which ticket entry involved scanning the bar code of a guest's O2 mobile phone. O2 believed that the method worked extremely well and was not complex. I am sure that something similar could be piloted for other events.</p>
	<p pid="a.405.1/15">I do not begrudge people selling on their tickets for one reason or another, provided that they do not do so for commercial profit, but I do have difficulty with those who advertise tickets before they have even gone on sale or before the date has been set, as with tickets for the 2006 FA cup final, which were sold before either the date or the venue had been decided. I also find it appalling that some set up call centres using more than one identity and credit card to maximise their chances of getting tickets. A telephone line should be set up to allow individuals to contact companies such as eBay to notify them of people trying to make money on the backs of ordinary fans. Feedback forms can be accessed to notify eBay of good and bad selling, but individuals must buy something before they can get to them.</p>
	<p pid="a.405.1/16">I have specific questions for the Minister. At thelast summit, he promised to circulate a statement of collective agreement to which all parties attending the summit could sign up, a key point of which would be a request that all sectors of the ticket industry do all that they can to prevent the resale of tickets for profit. Has that statement been circulated? What action has he taken to ensure that online companies refrain from selling tickets for profit? Does he think that the Ticketmaster option is right? If not, what is he going to do about it? What direct discussions has he had about the problem with his colleagues in the Department of Trade and Industry? Finally, is he willing to meet me and a delegation of concert promoters, sporting event organisers and DTI colleagues to discuss the issue further?</p>
	<p pid="a.405.1/17">Ticket touting is daylight robbery and innocent fans should not lose out to those who want to make obscene profits. At least Dick Turpin wore a mask when he robbed people; these people hide behind computers and the fact that no laws exist to prevent them from doing what they do.</p>

	<p pid="a.408.1/1">I accept what the Minister says, but the problem with the surveys that he mentions is the way that the questions are phrased. If I asked members of the public, &quot;Do you think it's right that somebody buys a ticket to sell at an exorbitant price?&quot; about95 per cent. of them would say &quot;No.&quot; I would be much happier with a survey that was conducted by an independent body asking the right questions rather than questions like, &quot;Do you think it is right that you can buy a ticket from somebody?&quot;</p>

	<p pid="a.409.1/1">I would, but several points have been raised and I have only four minutes to deal with them all.</p>
	<p pid="a.409.1/2">Online sites are beginning to provide buyers with information about the price that they are paying for their tickets and their location. Consumers buying on the internet have faced the considerable problem of having no idea of the original price of the ticket that they were buying or where it would be located. An agreement is now being drawn up with the industry that that information must be provided when a ticket is put on the internet.</p>
	<p pid="a.409.1/3">My hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, North-West drew a comparison with the situation for certain sporting events. One of the reasons why we have legislation to deal with sporting matches is because of the public order issue. My Department is working closelywith other Government Departments, including the DTI, to put together a fair, effective and proportionate policy.</p>
	<p pid="a.409.1/4">My hon. Friend talked about the OFT's important work, and I understand his frustration, but I must recognise the independence of the OFT. I was aware that there was some frustration, and I recognise my hon. Friend's comments; I am sure that they will not fall on deaf ears at the OFT. It would be prudent for me to leave that issue there.</p>
	<p pid="a.409.1/5">My hon. Friend rightly and understandably talked about the hugely successful T in the Park. The problems with that event reveal the nature of the problem: we have amazing music and sporting events, but there are many more fans than available seats. We could deal with that problem through legislation, as has been suggested, but the public have told us that they do not want their right to resell their tickets to be taken away. We therefore need to work with the industry to produce a fair secondary market for tickets. We must also recognise the abuses that take place in the primary market.</p>
	<p pid="a.409.1/6">I remind my hon. Friend that technology, particularly the internet, is a friend as well as a problem. This year, the organisers of the Glastonbury festival are taking matters into their own hands and introducing a method whereby people will have to register their personal details to apply for tickets and there will be photo identity documents. That creates an opportunity to outlaw some of the people who have been exploiting the primary market.</p>
	<p pid="a.409.1/7">I know that my hon. Friend, who has a great knowledge of the music industry, as does the Chancellor, is aware that the Arctic Monkeys are using similar technology for their next concert. Consumers will have to register their personal details and will be given a personal identification number. Only if the PIN and personal details cross-match will consumers be allowed to take part in a ballot for tickets. The problem with that system is that it will be in the hands of the music organisers to ensure that only those with legitimate tickets are allowed into the concerts, so it will be important that the organisers see the system through. They have started well by using technology and trying to create the kind of fairness that my hon. Friend wants for legitimate fans, but people must not be able to exploit the market on the day&mdash;either at the primary or secondary stage.</p>
	<p pid="a.409.1/8">We look to the industry to see what can be done, but I am conscious that we might have to introduce legislation. European directives to encourage fairer selling and practices will be transposed later this year. The Secretary of State and I are aware of hon. Members' concerns and we are making the industry address the problem. However, the industry should be in no doubt that the Government are prepared to act if its application of technology and available enforcement mechanisms ultimately fail the consumer.</p>

	<p pid="a.411.1/1">I am glad to have the opportunity to raise an important constituency matter, which has wider policy implications for the handling by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office of the consular services provided to British citizens who are in difficulties overseas. Although this is a detailed matter relating to a particular constituency, I have no embarrassment in raising it, because it has general policy implications. I hope that the Minister will be able to address some of them.</p>
	<p pid="a.411.1/2">The case concerns the awful death of Mr. Toby Charnaud. His parents, Mr. and Mrs. Jeremy Charnaud, and sister, Mrs. Hannah Allan, have raised the matter with me. By a poignant coincidence, we are having this debate two years to the day after Toby Charnaud's murder in Thailand on <phrase class="date" code="2005-03-27">27 March 2005</phrase>, and we think of the family at this difficult time.</p>
	<p pid="a.411.1/3">I am glad to say that the murderers, including Toby Charnaud's ex-wife, have been brought to justice and are now serving life sentences in Thailand, and that Toby's son is settling happily in my constituency. In a certain sense, the family have been able to put all of this behind them, and I am glad about that. I also pay tribute to them, because they are raising these consular matters not to seek any benefit to themselves but because they believe that raising them with the Government in this way may help other families who find themselves in a similar situation in future.</p>
	<p pid="a.411.1/4">The events were awful enough without their being added to by the inadequacies of the consular service and the British embassy in Bangkok. It is too late to correct what happened, because we cannot turn the clock back, but we want these issues addressed and improved.</p>
	<p pid="a.411.1/5">The criticisms of the consular service fall into seven categories, which are perhaps best explained by going through Toby Charnaud's case chronologically. Between the time of his disappearance and the discovery of his body, there was a significant lack of activity by the embassy. One of the most obvious and basic things to do in such difficult circumstances is to appoint a police liaison officer in the UK. It took the embassy two weeks before it got round to telling the family that it was possible to do such a thing, and there was then a delay&mdash;admittedly, this was the fault of the Wiltshire constabulary, rather than the FCO&mdash;before the liaison officer was appointed.</p>
	<p pid="a.411.1/6">The appointment of a police family liaison officer ought not to be a discretionary matter in future; it should be routine and compulsory when it looks as if some awful circumstances such as this have occurred. The Minister will know that his noble Friend Lord Triesman met the Charnaud family and assured them that aspects of the police liaison service would be addressed. I would be grateful if the Minister would tell us what steps have been taken on that initiative.</p>
	<p pid="a.411.1/7">The embassy in Thailand was unable to advise or help the Charnaud family in any way, so they had to take the matter into their own hands. Their son had disappeared, they suspected foul play and the embassy would not help them, so they appointed a private investigator. It was thanks to the private investigator, who was at all times aided by an interpreter, that Toby's body was eventually found. Without that investigation, the family would have been kept in the dark throughout. The embassy was able only to give the family various phone numbers, such as the number for Support After Murder and Manslaughter&mdash;SAMM&mdash;abroad, and to advise them to hire a local lawyer from an inaccurate and out-of-date list that it provided. There was no real reason why the family should have hired a lawyer at that stage, because there was no evidence of foul play. They had no way of communicating with the Thai police and were entirely reliant on the embassy in Bangkok for information about any police investigation. The embassy gave them no such information.</p>
	<p pid="a.411.1/8">Even after the discovery of Toby Charnaud's body, the consular service's handling of the matter was sadly lacking. It was the private investigator, speaking on the phone from Thailand through an interpreter, who broke the news to the family that their son's body had been discovered in Thailand and that he had been brutally murdered; it was not the consul or the family liaison officer who did so, and that is unacceptable.</p>
	<p pid="a.411.1/9">The family had to ring the police liaison officer to tell him about the discovery of the body rather than the other way round. The press arrived at the Charnaud family's doorstep in Wiltshire 10 hours before the embassy got round to telling them about the death.The press knew about the situation, although neither the police nor the family had been told about it&mdash;the consul may have known about it, but did not tell the family. As a result of the huge press interest, the family called a press conference for 3 pm that afternoon, in the hope that they might be able to handle the matter with some dignity.</p>
	<p pid="a.411.1/10">Toby's body had been found at 4 o'clock that morning, and a British vice-consul had been present when the body was discovered, so the embassy knew about the situation, but did nothing about it until 10 hours later. The Minister and the Foreign Office must tell us why that was the case. Why were people sitting on the information that Toby Charnaud had been killed for 10 hours before they finally got round to doing anything about it? It was only then, just as the press conference was about to start at 3 pm, that an e-mail&mdash;believe it or not&mdash;was received from the British embassy in Thailand. It was expressed in the most insensitive terms, which included graphic descriptions of the way in which Toby had been murdered. For example, there was a description of a long and bloody knife, covered in hairs, that had been discovered in the car of Toby Charnaud's wife, despite the fact that there was no suspicion at that stage that she had been involved in the murder. The FCO chose to tell my constituents in an e-mail that their son had been murdered. It did so shortly before they were to give a press conference that they had been forced to call to let people know all about it. That is totally unacceptable.</p>
	<p pid="a.411.1/11">What went on between then and the perpetrators' trial? The FCO's service did not even improve during that time. Mr. Charnaud's mother had to travel to London to get various documents approved in the Foreign Office. She arrived to find huge queues, and she had to stand up on a boiling hot day, because there was nowhere to sit down. The lady was 70, and she had travelled up a few days after the news of her son's death had been announced. Having phoned people in Wiltshire, she eventually got the desk officer to come down to the front office in the Foreign Office. In a rather relaxed, laid back way, he said that he would see what he could do to help, and then disappeared. He reappeared one and a half hours later to find the 70-year-old lady still standing in the heat in the Foreign Office, and said, in his relaxed way, that he felt that she probably ought to go to the Thai embassy to get the documents dealt with. It is quite wrong for a family to be dealt with in such a way.</p>
	<p pid="a.411.1/12">It was important for the family to travel out to Thailand several times to find out what on earth was going on in respect of both the disposal of the body and the cremation, and the trial, which was pending by then. The family asked whether the consular serviceat the embassy could help them with the travel arrangements. They were told that the embassy could not help with flights, but it could provide the telephone number of British Airways, that it could not help to book hotels, but it could provide the numbers of a few local hotels that they might want to try, that it could not provide them with a translator to help them to deal with the authorities, but it could supply the number of a translation service in Bangkok, and that it could not meet them at the airport.</p>
	<p pid="a.411.1/13">Will the Minister tell us what steps his Department has now taken to clarify the arrangements that can be made for families in such terrible circumstances? Perhaps he could tell us whether families are now routinely met by an embassy car or official for an initial meeting about what has gone wrong and what can be done about it. As it turned out, it was the Charnauds' privately hired investigator who met them at the airport, and got them off the plane and throughthe formalities. That job should have been done by the consular service, but it was not.</p>
	<p pid="a.411.1/14">The family eventually met the vice-consul, but they did not do so over the weekend because he does not work at weekends. He only got round to visiting them the following Monday to discuss the matter. They explained to the vice-consul that Daniel&mdash;Toby's son&mdash;was a British citizen whose father was dead and whose mother was in jail, and that they feared for the boy's safety. They were worried that he would be kidnapped by the mother's family.</p>
	<p pid="a.411.1/15">Despite those concerns, the Charnaud family were told that even if they visited Toby's son and felt he was in severe danger, they would need to contact the Thai authorities to ensure that something was done. No one will be surprised to learn that the Charnaud family do not speak Thai and have no way of communicating with the Thai authorities. Surely it is the job of the British consulate in a place such as Bangkok to act as a go-between for a bereaved family who are concerned that their grandson, a five-year-old British citizen, is in the hands of someone who might be the murderer&mdash;as, it turned out, she was. What did the British consular service do? It said, &quot;We will give you the number of an interpreter and you can then go to see the Thai authorities yourselves to secure the well-being of your little five-year-old grandson.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.411.1/16">Incidentally, the Charnaud family agreed at that time to have the body incinerated, but the Foreign Office's consular service in Thailand did not tell them that had they had the body repatriated to the UK, it would have been possible to have conducted a separate inquest in the UK. They had the body incinerated in Thailand in difficult circumstances.</p>
	<p pid="a.411.1/17">Trials in Thailand are strange affairs, compared with British justice, because the court meets one day a week and its sittings are often adjourned. Proceedings are in the Thai language and difficult to follow. During that awful trial, the consulate provided no information whatever about what was happening, and the Charnaud family were not allowed to attend. Information about the trial was almost non-existent, consisting only of a short paragraph stating who had appeared and the date of the next part of the trial.</p>
	<p pid="a.411.1/18">Eventually, the trial came to fruition and the accused were convicted of an appalling and brutal murder of the worst imaginable sort. They were sent to prison for life&mdash;in Thailand life means life, and I hope that those vile people are never released from prison&mdash;but an appeal is pending and still little help or information is being provided to the Charnaud family.</p>
	<p pid="a.411.1/19">The event is history for the Charnaud family. The loss of a brother and a son was bad enough and an awful experience, but they are beginning to get over the aftermath of that dreadful event. However, they want consular handling of people in similar circumstances to be changed. First, the British embassy should provide much better information to families in this country. If the event happens a long way away in a country with a foreign language, the family have no way of finding out what is going on from the local authorities. Surely it is of prime importance that the embassy provides detailed and sensitive information&mdash;not a daft e-mail with brutal details&mdash;to families here at home.</p>
	<p pid="a.411.1/20">The Home Office provides a helpful information booklet to families of murder victims in the UK. Could not the Foreign Office provide a similar guidance booklet for relatives in the UK of murder victims abroad? I understand that it has been thinking of doing that, and that such a booklet has been in the offing for two years, so perhaps the Minister will tell us what progress has been made.</p>
	<p pid="a.411.1/21">Police liaison officers are important, and I believe that the Foreign Office has been persuaded of that.We need to know what progress is being made in encouraging police liaison officers and the UK police to look after the families of the bereaved. Families of Brits who are murdered overseas also need help with the police overseas and with the trial. We need better consular services all round. Another constituent, Paul Lawrenson of Chippenham, lost an arm in the Bali bombing and found that the consular services provided in Bali were equally poor.</p>
	<p pid="a.411.1/22">There is a more general question whether there has been a decline in British consular services overseas, of which we were once so proud. The British pay taxes for certain services to be provided by Her Majesty's Government. Protection while overseas and assistance if people get into trouble overseas should be a basic, Rolls-Royce service. That is what we need if our brother or son is murdered in Thailand. We need to be certain that local British officials are doing what they can to make the situation better. What does the Minister intend to do to improve that service? I want to know whether he accepts that there has been a general decline in consular services, not only in Thailand but elsewhere. In the months to come, other people who have had a similar experience with other consulates may like to let the Government know about their experience, and I shall be happy to act as a conduit if that is useful. As citizens, we expect, and are entitled to, proper services overseas when we get into trouble.</p>
	<p pid="a.411.1/23">I hope that the Minister accepts the lessons of the appalling Toby Charnaud case, and that he will let me know what will be done to improve the service.</p>

	<p pid="a.415.0/1">I thank the hon. Gentleman for this debate on behalf of his constituents on the handling of the tragic case of Toby Charnaud, who was murdered on <phrase class="date" code="2005-03-27">27 March 2005</phrase> at the age of 40 in the most appalling circumstances in Thailand, where he was resident. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman has already offered his condolences to the family on this second anniversary of Toby's brutal and senseless death, and I would like to add my condolences and those of my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State.</p>
	<p pid="a.415.0/2">I am fully aware that the family are unhappy about certain aspects of the way in which information was passed to them. We have apologised to the family in the past and I have no hesitation in apologising again for the insensitive way in which consular staff gave the family this distressing news. None of us would ever want to receive news of this type&mdash;news of the death of a child, a brother, or a father&mdash;in this way.</p>
	<p pid="a.415.0/3">I shall set out the help that we gave the family, where we got it wrong, and what we are doing to ensure that it does not happen again. To put the matter in context, more than 750,000 British visitors go to Thailand every year, and it is home to around 30,000 British nationals. The vast majority of those visits are trouble free, but in 2006 consular staff provided assistance to 252 families who had suffered the bereavement of a family member in Thailand. In the majority of cases the death was from natural causes, but three of those who died were, sadly, murdered. We fully recognise that the murder of a family member is a devastating experience for those concerned.</p>
	<p pid="a.415.0/4">The hon. Gentleman referred to the background of Toby's case and his family's concerns about the level and nature of the consular assistance that they received from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. I confirm, as Baroness Symons, a former Foreign Office Minister, did in her letter to him on <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-28">28 April 2005</phrase>, that consular officials did everything they properly could on learning of Toby's disappearance, and stayed in frequent contact with his family. When it seemed that the Royal Thai Police had taken no action, we expressed serious concern about Toby at both local and regional level. As a result, a special Thai police team was set up to assist the local police in their investigation.</p>
	<p pid="a.415.0/5">We also checked with local immigration officials and hospitals to ensure that there were no unidentified foreign nationals in their care, and we checked the mortuaries. As Baroness Symons wrote to the hon. Gentleman, and as is confirmed in our &quot;Support for British Nationals Abroad: a Guide&quot;&mdash;hereafter referred to as &quot;our consular guide&quot;&mdash;which was published in March 2006, we cannot perform physical searches for missing persons, and that was explained to Toby's family. We therefore provided them with contact details of charitable and voluntary organisations specialising in tracing missing people, a private detective agency and English-speaking lawyers whom the family could appoint to act on their behalf.</p>
	<p pid="a.415.0/6">When Toby's family decided to travel to Thailand, we provided them with information about local hotels, and offered to make appointments with Thai officials, as well as calls to discuss transportation and interpretation. I apologise that consular staff were unable to meet the family at the airport on their arrival, but we were, fortunately, able to tell the family that before they left the UK, and we offered to help to make arrangements for staff from their hotel to meet them.</p>
	<p pid="a.415.0/7">When Toby was found, we kept the family up to date with the Thai police's progress on DNA analysis, and on their investigation into his murder. We explained to the family that while we were able to relay key case information and subsequent court dates, it was their lawyer's responsibility to ensure that they received a full report of the legal proceedings. We ensured that we quickly relayed to the family all information that was passed to us by the Thai authorities about the case and court proceedings, and often chased the court for further information on the family's behalf. If the family received conflicting information from their lawyer and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, we sought clarification from the court on their behalf. Consular staff attended the verdict and sentencing of thefour murderers, the details of which were passed immediately to Toby's family.</p>
	<p pid="a.415.0/8">As the hon. Gentleman is aware, the four guilty parties have submitted appeals to the Thai court of appeal, and I assure him and the family that we continue to monitor the progress of the appeals through the courts, and that the Thai authorities are fully aware of our interest in the outcome. However, we are unable to interfere in the process. I will take personal responsibility in my role with Thailand to communicate with him on behalf of the family to ensure that there is no breakdown in communication about the process and outcome.</p>
	<p pid="a.415.0/9">I have personal experience of losing a son&mdash;indeed, my only son&mdash;in tragic circumstances, so I am one of the few people who can begin to imagine the family's distress on learning by e-mail of the discovery of Toby's remains and other upsetting facts about his case, and their continuing distress. As with the Charnaud family, in my case the media were informed of my son's death before I was, so I understand completely how traumatic that was and will continue to be for the family. I know that the family have received apologies, but I apologise again for the regrettable way in which such terrible information was conveyed. I am assured that it was due to a real misunderstanding between the then desk officer concerned and the family liaison officer, and not a result of a fundamental flaw in our procedures. I reassure the hon. Gentleman and the family that our consular staff receive training on the way in which such distressing news should be passed on to the families concerned.</p>
	<p pid="a.415.0/10">In the event of a death overseas in suspicious circumstances, consular staff can provide practical information on, for example, local post mortem procedures, funeral arrangements, the local police and legal systems and registering the death in the country concerned. We produce an information sheet, which I think the hon. Gentleman inquired about. The sheet that I have with me deals with Thailand itself, and I shall ensure that he receives a copy after the debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.415.0/11">British missions abroad also maintain lists of English-speaking lawyers and translation and interpretation facilities. We provide them to families as necessary, but consular staff are not legally trained, cannot provide legal advice and cannot act as interpreters. There are locally employed staff, some of whom speak good English and have a working knowledge of it, but they are not interpreters.</p>
	<p pid="a.415.0/12">Where possible, we also meet the next of kin if they travel to the country in which the person died. As the hon. Gentleman knows, consular staff met the family in Thailand. However, we cannot arrange or pay families' travel or accommodation costs. That is the reality of the situation.</p>
	<p pid="a.415.0/13">Regrettably, there is sometimes a limit to what we can do, but we aim to deliver a high quality service to British nationals abroad, and in most instances we do exactly that. We aim to provide a consistent service worldwide, but we do so within the constraints that I have set out, some of which are genuine policy and resource constraints. Last year, British nationals made 67 million overseas visits and 3.1 million consular inquiries to our posts overseas. Consular staff gave assistance in more than 4,200 cases in which British nationals had died. Sadly, about 70 cases involved the murder of one of our citizens.</p>
	<p pid="a.415.0/14">I also reassure the hon. Gentleman that we are committed to making our consular staff support as effective and of as high a quality as we can. We take comments such as those that the family expressed very seriously indeed, and we use such feedback to learn the lessons that help improve the service that we offer. We are grateful to the family for meeting our staff in London to raise those concerns.</p>
	<p pid="a.415.0/15">On the 10-hour delay, the family's private investigator, the Thai police and the British embassy consul were together and talking to the family when Toby's body was found. The embassy therefore assumed that the family had been informed either by the investigator or by the Thai police, and I apologise for that. We will ensure that when deaths occur in future, there is certainty about the process of informing the families of people found dead.</p>
	<p pid="a.415.0/16">The consulate staff reassured the family in April about those matters, but we are aware that it is important for each UK police force to appoint police family liaison officers. They are responsible for the appointment. We can only recommend that they appoint them; it is for the police to instruct the appointment. Again, however, as a result of the debate, I shall write to the Home Office to ensure that the police liaison arrangements between ourselves and local constabularies throughout the UK operate effectively, so that in such circumstances, a police family liaison officer is appointed at the earliest opportunity.</p>
	<p pid="a.415.0/17">Where appropriate, our staff attend key court hearings, but we could never give a daily, blow-by-blow account of proceedings, because our staff are neither legally trained nor lawyers. That is why it is so important for families to be able to appoint a local lawyer, which in turn is why we maintain lists of local lawyers&mdash;particularly those who can speak English and who are competent in their country's legal processes.</p>
	<p pid="a.415.0/18">On the legalisation of documents, I can again give an absolute assurance. Owing to the family's feedback and the way in which Mrs. Charnaud was dealt with in May 2005, we have established a new fast-track system for bereaved relatives. Families can wait in privacy while the case officer organises the documentation for them. We also now waive the fees for bereaved relatives. I hope that my response provides some reassurance that we have learned lessons from the tragedy.</p>
	<p pid="a.415.0/19">It is not natural for parents to outlive their children. As a parent who has suffered the death of a son, I am probably better able than most to empathise with the family. They are grieving for two lives: the life that they had with their son, and the life that they were going to have. That second grieving process is the most difficult to cope with.</p>
	<p pid="a.415.0/20">This debate is not about my son; it is about the Charnauds' son. However, I genuinely understand the situation, and if the family wish to do so, I am happy to meet them personally to go through what I have said to the hon. Gentleman. Indeed, I call him my hon. Friend, because although we are from different parties, we have known each other for 20 years. I should genuinely like to see the family&mdash;if they wish&mdash;to talk the matter through and reassure them that we have learned the lessons.</p>
	<p pid="a.415.0/21">The situation should not have occurred, and I cannot take back what occurred, but from my assurances today, I hope that I can show that we have learned the lessons. I hope also that it can help the family to move on and to cope a bit better with the terrible grief that they have suffered through the loss of their son.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-03-27a.419.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1478" speakername="Tony Wright" colnum="419"  time="013:25:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070327/halltext/70327h0009.htm#07032749000453">
	<p pid="a.419.1/1">Spring is here, and summer is coming. It is a time for open windows, chairs in the garden, walks in the park and quiet strolls along town and village streets. However, it is also a time when we have to endure a relentless sonic assault from what are known as boom cars. In the United States, they are also known as trunk thumpers and street pounders. They are cars with sound systems that are designed to assault our senses, invade our privacy and pulverise our neighbourhoods, and they are driven by people who have an arrogant disregard for the basic civilities of community life.</p>
	<p pid="a.419.1/2">We are talking not about cars with ordinary radio or CD players that are played inconsiderately loud, but about cars with separately installed audio systems&mdash;often in the boot&mdash;producing a relentless, pounding bass beat that can be heard from streets away. The volume output, which can exceed 1,000 W, can shake windows, penetrate walls and set off car alarms. It also causes annoyance, stress and misery to everyone who has such sonic mugging inflicted on them&mdash;no doubt adding immeasurably to the satisfaction of the perpetrators.</p>
	<p pid="a.419.1/3">A recent survey on traffic and vehicle noise carried out by the UK Noise Association, an organisation to which I pay tribute and with which I have worked closely, revealed that boom cars were the greatest source of annoyance to people. There is also a safety factor. Research carried out by the RAC Foundation found that drivers who were listening to loud music with a fast beat were twice as likely to go through a red light, and that they have twice as many accidents. Cocooned in their sound bubble, they are oblivious to other road users and to their general environment.</p>
	<p pid="a.419.1/4">Boom car equipment is big business. As cars have become quieter, the equipment has ensured that they can become much noisier. It is true of factory fitted sound systems, and even more so of the equipment that is fitted afterwards. System manufacturers have a sales pitch that deliberately plays to its antisocial potential, feeding a culture that thinks that blasting people out of their beds is the height of cool. Sony uses the brand name &quot;Xplod&quot;, with the slogan, &quot;Disturb the Peace&quot;. Pioneer Electronics has the slogans, &quot;Disturb&quot;, &quot;Defy&quot;, &quot;Disrupt&quot; and &quot;Ignite&quot;. The car audio industry is an effective lobbyist. It has organised against anti-noise legislation in the United States and has sought to defeat attempts by local communities there to act against boom cars.</p>
	<p pid="a.419.1/5">So what have we done, with our armoury of antisocial behaviour legislation, our respect agenda, our extra police, our community support officers and our street wardens? What action have we taken against the antisocial menace of boom cars? That was the question that I began with, puzzled as I was bythe seeming indifference displayed by the authorities in the face of such a pervasive and unavoidable assault. I have discovered that several pieces of existing legislation might be mobilised for an attack on boom cars, but that in practice none seem to be employed robustly and consistently for that purpose.</p>
	<p pid="a.419.1/6">For example, section 62 of the Control of Pollution Act 1974 deals with loudspeakers in a street and can be applied to car stereos, the test being annoyance to people in the vicinity. No enforcement agency is specified, but in practice the task falls to local authorities. However, they have no power to stop vehicles and there could be evidential problems in identifying the person responsible. There is also the Environmental Protection Act 1990, section 79 of which had a subsection added by the Noise and Statutory Nuisance Act 1993 to cover noise caused by a vehicle in a street. That subsection allows a local authority to serve an abatement notice. However, there is again no power either to stop vehicles or to require the names and addresses of drivers, and the same enforcement and evidential difficulties arise.</p>
	<p pid="a.419.1/7">More recently, there has been the Police ReformAct 2002, section 59 of which enables the police to stop and seize a vehicle that is causing alarm, distress or annoyance to members of the public. If a police officer observes a car with a loud stereo, the offender can be warned to turn the volume down. In what was said to be a unique action, in Bradford in 2004, a man whose car sound system regularly caused shop windows to vibrate and stationary vehicles' alarms to be activated had his car seized by police. To get the vehicle back, the owner was required to pay a fine of &pound;105 plus VAT, as well as &pound;12 a day for storage charges, which, if not paid within 21 days, would lead to disposal of the vehicle. Finally, there are the Road Vehicles (Construction and Use) Regulations 1986, which allow the police to take action through an oral warning, a fixed penalty notice or prosecution against the drivers of excessively noisy vehicles. However, there seems to be a question whether the regulations can be applied only to the mechanical parts of vehicles or to loud audio systems, too.</p>
	<p pid="a.419.1/8">We have several pieces of legislation, with several different kinds of enforcement, which could be deployed against the problem of boom cars. The effect of that seems to be that there is no systematic or effective enforcement at all. As responsibility is diffused across Government and between enforcement agencies, the problem is nobody's particular responsibility&mdash;indeed, nobody seems to want it to be. I recently asked the Home Office:</p>
	<p pid="a.419.1/9" class="indent">&quot;how many prosecutions were brought in each of the last five years for offences involving excessive noise from car audio systems.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.419.1/10">I was told that although data were collected on police action for noise offences, under the Road Vehicles (Construction and Use) Regulations 1986, it was</p>
	<p pid="a.419.1/11" class="indent">&quot;not possible to identify from the data those offences resulting from excessive noise from car audio systems.&quot;&mdash;[<i>Official Report</i>, <phrase class="date" code="2007-02-07">7 February 2007</phrase>; Vol. 456, c. 970W.]</p>
	<p pid="a.419.1/12">No mention at all was made in that answer of data on noise offences under any other legislation. There are at least three Departments involved, but no single focus for attention and action. In that respect, it is revealing that when I was approached about this debate, I was asked which Department I would like to answer. I am of course delighted to see my hon. Friend the Minister here, but the answer is that I do not care which Department answers, as long as there is a commitment to effective, coherent, joined-up action across Government to deal with the menace of boom cars.</p>
	<p pid="a.419.1/13">That should not be too difficult. The noise is plainly audible, the cars are visible and identifiable, and the audio equipment is fitted to produce the intended sonic effects. We need on-the-spot fines, with seizure to follow if necessary. We need action against those who manufacture and those who sell sound equipment for cars in terms of its capacity for turning quiet streets into pounding hells. Boom cars are surely one kind of antisocial behaviour that we can do something about if we really want to. We may or may not need new legislation, but we certainly need better enforcement. As we look forward to the pleasures of warmer and longer days, let us resolve to have our peace disturbed no more by the bane of boom cars.</p>
	<p pid="a.419.1/14">There is one final consideration. If Governments do not act effectively against the daily incivilities inflicted by some people on everybody else, not only will such incivility grow, but its victims will draw the conclusion that Governments are either impotent or indifferent in the face of the problem. That in turn will bring consequences for both individuals and society that we would do well to try to avoid.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-03-27a.421.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1580" speakername="Ben Bradshaw" speakeroffice="The Minister for Local Environment, Marine and Animal Welfare"  colnum="421"  time="013:38:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070327/halltext/70327h0009.htm#07032749000455">
	<p pid="a.421.1/1">Thank you, Mr. Conway. I apologise for the latter, while the former is not really my responsibility. However, as a Minister for the environment, I do have some responsibility for the subject of the debate, which I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1478" name="Tony Wright">my hon. Friend the Member for Cannock Chase (Dr. Wright)</phrase> on securing. It is customary on these occasions for the Minister to congratulate the hon. Member who has secured the debate, often without really meaning it, but I do mean it in this case. The subject is important and affects us all, including me. I also congratulate my hon. Friend not only on the content of the debate, but on its poetic quality. With the help of the representative of the fourth estate who is here, I hope that the debate might reach a wider audience than those of us in Westminster Hall. It certainly deserves one and would, dare I suggest, make a fabulous &quot;op-ed&quot; piece for a Sunday newspaper.</p>
	<p pid="a.421.1/2">My hon. Friend is right to identify the problem, which is growing. It causes nuisance and alarm to householders, pedestrians and other road users, and is, quite frankly, dangerous. How many people, I wonder, have been distracted by the sudden &quot;Boom! Boom! Boom!&quot; coming from one of those cars, wondering what on earth was happening, as the ground beneath them shook or the walls and windows of their home vibrated to the heavy thud of some violent bass beat? As a cyclist, I do not mind experiencing the varied musical tastes of car drivers as I sidle up beside them at the traffic lights, but at the appropriate volume. In fact, I sometimes quite like it; it can raise my spirits. However, the monster systems that cause cars to bounce and houses to shake are a completely different matter. They are a menace.</p>
	<p pid="a.421.1/3">As my hon. Friend said, unwelcome noise can have a highly detrimental impact on our communities and quality of life. Statistics collected annually by the Chartered Institute of Environmental Health show a year-on-year increase in the number of complaints made to local authorities about neighbourhood noise, which has been the most complained-about issue for more than a decade.</p>
	<p pid="a.421.1/4">According to a MORI poll carried out last year, noisy cars and motorbikes are the second most irritating neighbourhood noise. Some 15 per cent. of the people questioned reported being annoyed by car and motorbike noises and 14 per cent. were annoyed by car or burglar alarms. The level of annoyance is clearly rising, given that noisy cars and motorbikes were only seventh on the list three years before. To some of us, noise coming from a passing car is momentary, so the annoyance goes as the car passes. However, for others, loud music played from stationary cars or those driving past houses&mdash;particularly at night&mdash;can result in serious disturbance and sleep deprivation.</p>
	<p pid="a.421.1/5">Although it is unlikely that noise from cars would damage the hearing of residents or passers-by, the volumes that we are talking about pose a serious risk to the hearing of those inside the car. They also cause danger, because the drivers cannot possibly hear anything going on outside, such as another car's horn or an emergency vehicle's siren&mdash;certainly not my bicycle bell. Research has shown that loud music in cars causes accidents, particularly if it has a fast beat. The RAC Foundation research to which my hon. Friend referred found that drivers listening to such music were twice as likely to go through a red light and twice as likely to have an accident. There is also the potential to damage the hearing of drivers and passengers.</p>
	<p pid="a.421.1/6">Modern car stereos fitted with the ubiquitous boom boxes can produce 110 dB if turned right up. That is almost as loud as what we would hear if standing just 30 m from a jet at its point of take-off at Heathrow airport and is far more than the 85 dB limit enforced by the Health and Safety Executive in the workplace. When that limit is exceeded, it is compulsory to wear hearing protection.</p>
	<p pid="a.421.1/7">As my hon. Friend said, there are powers to deal with this menace, and I urge the police and local authorities to use them. Under the Control of Pollution Act 1974, local environmental health officers can take action where the relevant car is parked. Under the Clean Neighbourhoods and Environment Act 2005, local authorities also have enhanced powers to deal with noise. Under the Road Vehicles (Construction and Use) Regulations 1986, the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 and the Police Reform Act 2002, the police have the powers to act when the car is moving or stationary in traffic. That legislation gives police the power to take action against someone who uses a vehicle in such a manner as to cause any excessive noise. The police may give an oral warning, an on-the-spot fine of &pound;80 or make a report for prosecution, as appropriate.</p>
	<p pid="a.421.1/8">Since January 2003, the police have also had the power to seize a vehicle, and my hon. Friend referred to a recent example of that in Bradford. Some police authorities have already made wider use of such powers to tackle noisy car audio systems. For example, Lancashire police recently undertook a crackdown called &quot;Operation Cruiser&quot; and North Yorkshire police have taken action to protect residents along the seafront in Scarborough. I strongly urge other police forces to take noise from car audio systems seriously and to use their powers. I also urge the public to report offenders.</p>
	<p pid="a.421.1/9">My hon. Friend referred to certain adverts and marketing techniques, and I join him in deploring them. He may be interested to learn that the Advertising Standards Authority investigated a recent complaint against the Sony advert to which he referred. The member of the public concerned believed that the advert would encourage people to behave in an antisocial way. The complaint was upheld, and I hope that that will serve as a warning to some manufacturers that they should be a little more sensible about how they market such equipment.</p>
	<p pid="a.421.1/10">My hon. Friend urged the Government to be more joined-up on the issue. I accept that, like many other things, noise and environmental quality crosses the responsibilities of a number of Departments. I hope that he accepts that legislation is now in place. However, we need to work more closely with colleagues from the Home Office and other Departments to ensure that every Department takes the issue seriously and that the message spreads to local authorities and the police. We are determined that people's lives and environments should not be blighted by noise or antisocial behaviour. We have legislated for that, although the implementation, certainly in respect of this problem, could be a lot better.</p>
	<p pid="a.421.1/11">My hon. Friend should be made aware of one other matter that I hope will help us to be more joined-up and strategic. This year, the Government will publish our long-awaited national noise strategy, which will cover both neighbourhood and ambient noise. We intend it to go to consultation soon, and I would welcome the input of my hon. Friend, other hon. Members and anyone who has an interest in the subject. We hope that by highlighting the problem of noise and providing for the first time a joined-up national policy framework within which to work, we will give the issue of noise the importance that it deserves across Government, and that in future it will be addressed in a more strategic and proactive way.</p>
	<p pid="a.421.1/12" class="italic">Question put and agreed to.</p>
	<p pid="a.421.1/13" class="italic">Adjourned accordingly at fourteen minutes toTwo o'clock.</p>
