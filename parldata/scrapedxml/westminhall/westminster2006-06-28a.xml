	<p pid="a.75.1/1">I have been listening to the hon. Lady with considerable interest. I congratulate her not only on securing this debate but on the manner in which she is presenting her arguments. Does she agree that it is important not only to get volunteers to assist in the retraining&mdash;if that is the word&mdash;of people who are offending in the ways that she described but to have an audit afterwards to ensure that they have not regressed to the same bad old ways. She gave the example of the children on the balcony. I wonder whether six months later she would receive the same complaints again if she were the MP for the area.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-06-28a.75.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1838" speakername="Ann Coffey" colnum="75"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060628/halltext/60628h0251.htm#06062860000441">
	<p pid="a.75.2/1">I entirely agree that it is important to evaluate the outcomes of ISOs. I hope that the Minister will touch on that in his reply. It is important to know that legislation is successful in its intention, otherwise why bother?</p>
	<p pid="a.75.2/2">The Home Affairs Committee report on antisocial behaviour published in April 2005 welcomed the introduction of ISOs and said that they usefully complemented the aims of ASBOs in preventing antisocial behaviour. The Committee was disappointed that take-up was not matching expectations.</p>
	<p pid="a.75.2/3">Many organisations said that ISOs were potentially of great benefit. For example, the Magistrates Association said that they should be granted as a matter of course if magistrates are satisfied that they will help prevent repetition of the behaviour. The Local Government Association &quot;warmly welcomed&quot; them, arguing that the approach</p>
	<p pid="a.75.2/4" class="indent">&quot;fits firmly with the LGA vision to reducing anti-social behaviour.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.75.2/5">The Committee expressed disappointment that social services departments and other key players such as local education authorities, the child and adolescent mental heath services and youth services were often not fully committed to antisocial behaviour strategies. It stated:</p>
	<p pid="a.75.2/6" class="indent">&quot;Given the concerns expressed by the ADSS&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.75.2/7">the Association of Directors of Social Services&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.75.2/8" class="indent">&quot;amongst others that the Government's ASB strategy is too punitive, we are somewhat disappointed that social services are not making greater efforts to...support measures such as ISOs and Parenting Orders.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.75.2/9">I hope that the directors of the new children's services that are being set up by local authorities will have a more positive approach.</p>
	<p pid="a.75.2/10">Funding is a key issue. There was no initial funding for ISOs, and many organisations, including the Home Affairs Committee, complained that lack of cash was a barrier to take-up. A ring-fenced &pound;500,000 was eventually made available in June 2005, more than a year after ISOs were introduced. I understand that the take-up was poor, but that could have been for a variety of reasons. The money came late, and often it takes time for knowledge about funding streams to spread. The ISO is new and we must remember that the use of ASBOs was slow to begin with, but has sped up in the past two years as their value has become fully appreciated.</p>
	<p pid="a.75.2/11">In view of the criticisms of funding that the ring-fenced money for ISOs addressed, I am disappointed that it has proved short-lived and that the funding arrangements have changed. Funding for this financial year, and from now on, will be available through the &pound;45 million uplift given to the Youth Justice Board as part of its prevention budget. That means that it now comes from a general pot of cash. Youth offending teams have been asked to submit plans to the Youth Justice Board for how they will spend their allocations from the preventive money.</p>
	<p pid="a.75.2/12">I believe that the latest funding arrangements for ISOs will not help to increase their use. Because the money is not ring-fenced, ISO money will be in competition with other preventive work, much of which is informal and does not have the force of a court order behind it.</p>
	<p pid="a.75.2/13">Given, I believe, that youth offending teams have not fully appreciated the value of ISOs as a preventive measure, it is likely that they will not see it as one of their preventive tools and will prefer to use the money on other projects. That seems to be borne out by the fact that of the 156 YOTs in the country only six have applied for specific money to resource ISOs.</p>
	<p pid="a.75.2/14">If, for example, a court decided that it was appropriate to have an ISO that involved one-to-one counselling sessions with a trained therapist on an aspect of a young person's behaviour, and funds had not been set aside, the resources would have to come from another part of the budget. That might not be a serious barrier to an ISO, if it cost about &pound;1,500 to &pound;2,500, especially at the beginning of a financial year. However, it might become a barrier as funds are used for other purposes.</p>
	<p pid="a.75.2/15">Of course, nobody is happy about applying for orders that carry no resources, and indeed take from existing ones, be it the YOTs, the children's service's or the local primary care trust's. Indeed, that argument, between local and national Government, is well-worn and has gone on down the years.</p>
	<p pid="a.75.2/16">Furthermore, housing associations and other social landlords can apply for stand-alone ASBOs, to which courts can attach an ISO. It is likely that those applications will increase from social landlords under pressure from tenants to deal with antisocial neighbours and behaviour on their estates. If one of the criteria for granting an ISO is that the magistrate be satisfied that arrangements for implementing the order are available locally, how can he or she be satisfied if specific money has not been set aside and there is no transparency in the availability of that money?</p>

	<p pid="a.78.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1838" name="Ann Coffey">the hon. Member for Stockport (Ann Coffey)</phrase> on securing this morning's debate. I shall be speaking as one of my party's spokespersons on home affairs, but I also speak as a neighbouring Member of Parliament to the hon. Lady and a fellow Stockport borough MP.</p>
	<p pid="a.78.0/2">I also compliment the hon. Lady on what we probably all thought was the thoughtful and considered approach she took in the speech while outlining her concerns. I do not think she will find much substantive difference between us as I support her general contention. I sympathise with her concerns over the issue for various reasons.</p>
	<p pid="a.78.0/3">First, I am all too aware that in the hon. Lady's constituency and in mine issues relating to antisocial behaviour are a key quality-of-life factor and local people care passionately about them throughout the borough of Stockport, which in addition to the her constituency includes both the Cheadle and the Hazel Grove constituencies and, indeed, part of the Denton and Reddish constituency. It is true to say that although the borough itself is a relatively safe place in which to live and work, we still have some way to go before any of us can be totally satisfied that we have the problems fully under control.</p>
	<p pid="a.78.0/4">Secondly, I sympathise with the hon. Lady because, in her efforts to find and promote better ways of dealing with antisocial behaviour and people who participate in those activities, she has tacitly recognised the limitation of many Government policies in that area. While ASBOs, around which so much Government policy and rhetoric seem to be based, have their place, it is clear that there is a problem with the huge failure rate&mdash;just under 50 per cent.&mdash;and continuing public concerns that they are at best a limited weapon in the fight against the nuisance of antisocial behaviour.</p>

	<p pid="a.79.1/1">I thank the hon. Gentleman for his intervention and agree with that comment. We all need to do what we can to support parents to take more responsibility for and interest in the activities of the children when the children are not at home.</p>
	<p pid="a.79.1/2">I shall take this opportunity to clear up an urban myth that has been cultivated in certain places, namely that the Liberal Democrats have never supported and still do not support ASBOs in principle. As I have said, they have their place and the hon. Member for Stockport will be aware that if we did not support them the local Liberal Democrat-controlled council in her area would not have issued over 40 in recent times.</p>
	<p pid="a.79.1/3">We have argued consistently as a party that ASBOs should always be used selectively and in conjunction with other methods of intervention to tackle the causes of the offenders' behaviour. I fully support the hon. Lady's position and support orders and the theory and rationale behind them. My party and I have been arguing for some years that Government policy has not adequately addressed the underlying causes of antisocial behaviour and that it has not dealt with the long-term issues. That is precisely why we have advocated, and indeed used, alternatives to stand-alone ASBOs, in particular acceptable behaviour contracts, commonly known as ABCs.</p>
	<p pid="a.79.1/4">The hon. Lady will know that her local council has issued well over 100 ABCs, and in Stockport and beyond they are proven to have a higher success rate than ASBOs. I believe this success is down to the fact that they address, or at least attempt to address, the causes of antisocial behaviour. They are a more genuine attempt at rehabilitation than ASBOs and that is why they are more effective in dealing with offenders' patterns of behaviour.</p>

	<p pid="a.80.0/1">Does the hon. Gentleman accept that ABCs are usually a contract with young people who do have not such an extensive history of antisocial behaviour, while ASBOs tend to be served on people after intervention with an ABC has been attempted? It is not a question of either/or but of having them all as tools that can be used to intervene at every level. ABCs are a good way of dealing with things, but, sometimes, with a small minority of young people they are not successful.</p>

	<p pid="a.83.3/1">On the whole, this has been a pretty consensual debate, with only one or two little controversial elements, which put this Chamber in an excitable mood.</p>
	<p pid="a.83.3/2">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1838" name="Ann Coffey">the hon. Member for Stockport (Ann Coffey)</phrase> on initiating the debate on the subject of ISOs, which we all agree are a very good idea. She wants the Government to take up initiatives to ensure that ISOs are effective, which is particularly important. I wait with considerable interest to see how the Minister responds in that respect.</p>
	<p pid="a.83.3/3">The hon. Member for Stockport mentioned the Prime Minister's Bristol speech. Once again, it was a fine example of good intentions, but delivery is all-important and this debate is about the delivery of ISOs. They are a very good idea, but how can we make them work?</p>
	<p pid="a.83.3/4">As we heard, ISOs were introduced under the Criminal Justice Act 2003. They allow positive conditions to be attached to ASBOs for 10 to 17-year-olds for up to six months, and they are designed to help to address the underlying causes of unacceptable and damaging behaviour by imposing preventive conditions on troubled young people.</p>
	<p pid="a.83.3/5">As <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1488" name="Bob Spink">my hon. Friend the Member for Castle Point (Bob Spink)</phrase> said, we are talking about a minority of young people. Years ago, I worked with the BBC in Northern Ireland during the troubles and it struck me then that only about 4 to 5 per cent. caused the troubles. The vast majority of people wanted a quiet life, which demonstrates what a thin veneer society can be. It needs just a few troublemakers&mdash;whether those involved in gangsterism or terrorism in Northern Ireland, or children causing a noise on an estate, as the hon. Member for Stockport described&mdash;to ruin of the lives of many.</p>

	<p pid="a.84.1/1">The Minister makes an important and interesting point that I hope people will note. It is indeed not just young people who are involved, but older people too. Again, however, it is a minority of adults and younger people who do not wish to ensure that society remains calm and do not have the respect for others that we expect. The other point, which my hon. Friend the Member for Castle Point made, is that parents also have a responsibility, and we should never forget that. He made that point in a number of telling interventions.</p>
	<p pid="a.84.1/2">The principle behind ISOs is valuable. We should be tackling the root causes of disorderly behaviour, not just the symptoms. Both sides of the debate will agree with that principle, and we have heard that today. With that in mind, I would like to be able to say that the Government have made good use of ISOs since their introduction. However, as we have heard, that has not been the case.</p>
	<p pid="a.84.1/3">As the hon. Member for Stockport said, only31 ISOs have been issued since May 2004. That point was also made by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1677" name="David Taylor">the hon. Member for North-West Leicestershire (David Taylor)</phrase>. Over the same period, 789 ASBOs were issued to persons aged between10 and 17. That means that ISOs were issued in only4 per cent. of cases, which is a startlingly low take-up.</p>
	<p pid="a.84.1/4">We have again heard some reasons for that, and the hon. Member for Stockport made some good suggestions on how to deal with the problem. I note, too, that she has been consistent on the issue, which she raised during Home Office questions last month. Following the somewhat lacklustre response from the Minister for Policing, Security and Community Safety, she said:</p>
	<p pid="a.84.1/5" class="indent">&quot;It is disappointing...that so few applications have been made for stand-alone civil antisocial behaviour orders with individual support orders attached.&quot;&mdash;[<i>Official Report</i>, <phrase class="date" code="2006-05-15">15 May 2006</phrase>;Vol. 446, c. 688.]</p>
	<p pid="a.84.1/6">Today, she has repeated that view, which gets to the heart of the matter. Until now, the take-up rate has been too low and too slow.</p>
	<p pid="a.84.1/7">Under the guidance that the Youth Justice Board has produced since May 2004, a magistrates court making a stand-alone ASBO is obliged to impose an ISO where three conditions are met. The first is that doing so is</p>
	<p pid="a.84.1/8" class="indent">&quot;desirable in the interests of preventing any repetition of the kind of behaviour which led to the making of the anti-social behaviour order&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.84.1/9">The second is purely technical, but the third, which is quite interesting, is</p>
	<p pid="a.84.1/10" class="indent">&quot;that the court has been notified by the Secretary of State that arrangements for implementing individual support orders are available in the area&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.84.1/11">In other words, it is up to the Government to give the support that the courts need to make a difference.</p>

	<p pid="a.87.1/1">We run recruitment campaigns for specials all the time&mdash;there are poster campaigns and adverts all over the place because we are trying to increase their numbers. However, we are determined to have active specials on the books, instead of there being just a number on paper, because specials make a great contribution to policing in our communities.</p>
	<p pid="a.87.1/2">Individual support orders were introduced under section 322 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003 and have been available since May 2004. They are civil orders that can be attached to antisocial behaviour orders made against young people aged between 10 and 17. They can last for up to six months and they impose positive conditions on young people. They are designed to tackle the underlying causes of antisocial behaviour.</p>
	<p pid="a.87.1/3">ISOs are available for stand-alone ASBOs, which are made only in magistrates courts. Legislation sets out that when a magistrates court makes an ASBO against a young person, the court must also make an ISO if it considers that an ISO would help to prevent further antisocial behaviour. ISOs are not available for orders on conviction if it is expected that sentencing will address the underlying causes of the criminal offence. If a court declines to make an ISO, it must give reasons why it considers that it is inappropriate to do so. That point was made by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1677" name="David Taylor">my hon. Friend the Member for North-West Leicestershire (David Taylor)</phrase>, and perhaps when he reads my response, he will be reassured.</p>
	<p pid="a.87.1/4">ISOs contain positive requirements that are tailor-made to suit the individual needs of each young person. They are based on a needs assessment of the young person in each question. Examples of such requirements include treatment for alcohol and substance misuse, attendance at counselling sessions for anger management, and extra support in school. ISOs are not mandatory, although we want to see many more being used by the courts. To clarify an point of confusion, an ISO can be made even if another order is in place.</p>
	<p pid="a.87.1/5">I should like to mention an example from the Norfolk area that shows the value of ISOs&mdash;I believe in using practical examples to show how policies can make a difference. The example shows how an ISO has been used to turn around the behaviour of a group of boys who had brought misery to residents for more than a year. The police and the housing office worked together closely on the case and discovered a pattern of nuisance, largely based on the playing of rowdy games on a shared landing between two flats. PCSOs and the estate manager mediated between the families and their neighbours. When mediation failed, joint visits were made to warn the families of their continued antisocial behaviour. The boys were given formal warnings that spelled out the consequences of their actions in terms of potential ASBOs and possible loss of their parents' tenancy. When all the warnings had failed, a multi-agency team obtained an interim ASBO against the five boys to put an immediate stop to the nuisance. Evidence provided by the PCSOs and by the estate manager was used at the hearing, and interim orders were granted.</p>
	<p pid="a.87.1/6">Minor breaches during the Christmas period were reported by witnesses between the interim and the full hearings, which strengthened the case for the ASBOs at the full hearing. Witnesses who were previously fearful of giving evidence were willing to testify at the full hearing when the ASBOs were granted. Importantly, an ISO was attached to each ASBO to tackle some of the underlying causes of the behaviour. If that can be done in one area, it can be done in many other areas too.</p>
	<p pid="a.87.1/7">The main benefit of the ASBOs was the relief brought to the neighbours, who felt that they had been supported through the process by the police and the housing office. The ISO that was devised and facilitated by the north Norfolk youth offending team consisted of sessions aimed at helping the boys to develop an understanding of how their antisocial behaviour&mdash;their constant shouting and banging&mdash;impacted on themselves as a group, on their immediate family, and on their neighbours. The advantage of the ISO was that it gave the boys an opportunity to understand the effects of their rowdy behaviour on themselves and on others. As a result of the order and the interventions of the youth worker, the boys took up recreational activities and found constructive ways to spend their spare time.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-06-28a.95.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1528" speakername="Howard Stoate" colnum="95"  time="011:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060628/halltext/60628h0253.htm#06062860000484">
	<p pid="a.95.1/1">The evidence of men's and boy's poor mental well-being is all around us. Some 75 per cent. of people who kill themselves are men, most of them young men, among whom suicide is the commonest cause of death. One man in eight is dependent on alcohol and 72 per cent. of male prisoners suffer from two or more mental disorders, while boys are five times more likely to be diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder than girls.</p>
	<p pid="a.95.1/2">Alarming numbers of men are unhappy, anxious, stressed and depressed. The results of a recent YouGov survey for the Men's Health Forum show that more than 18 million men in the UK could be affected by common mental health problems. The survey found that men in the UK experience very high stress levels, with nearly half&mdash;46 per cent.&mdash;suffering from moderate or extreme stress in a normal week. Just over half&mdash;51 per cent.&mdash;said that they felt down, stressed, depressed or anxious at least once a month, while one in 10 felt that way a few times a week or even every day. Up to 76 per cent. of men have experienced depression or anxiety in their lives. The study also shows that while mental health is a major problem, nearly one fifth of men suffer in silence and do not turn to anyone for help.</p>
	<p pid="a.95.1/3">What causes such men to feel stressed, depressed and down? Some 48 per cent. of men blame work or study as the key trigger for mental health problems, while44 per cent. blame financial worries. Fast-paced living was mentioned as the cause by 27 per cent. of men, and relationship problems by 25 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="a.95.1/4">Earlier this month, during national men's health week, the all-party group on men's health, which I chair, held a meeting with the all-party group on mental health. We heard from experts in the field of men's and boy's mental well-being. David Wilkins, from the Men's Health Forum, presented a new report on the issue, &quot;Mind Your Head: Men, boys and mental well-being&quot;, which argues that although women are more likely to be diagnosed with a mental disorder, problems in men are massively under-diagnosed.</p>
	<p pid="a.95.1/5">According to the report, in many cases that is simply because we do not fully understand the differences between how mental health problems manifest themselves in men and women. The report concludes that</p>
	<p pid="a.95.1/6" class="indent">&quot;men's mental well-being as a whole is poorly understood and seriously undervalued.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.95.1/7">That conclusion is at odds with the importance given to mental well-being by the general public. The publication of the White Paper, &quot;Our health, our care, our say&quot;, followed an extensive consultation programme, in which a focus on mental well-being was ranked second on the general public's list of priorities for the NHS. Only regular preventive health checks were considered more of a priority.</p>
	<p pid="a.95.1/8">Specialists recognise that importance too. The National Institute for Mental Health in England is explicit about the benefits to the nation of working to enhance mental well-being. In &quot;Making it possible: improving mental health and well-being in England&quot;, the institute wrote:</p>
	<p pid="a.95.1/9" class="indent">&quot;The skills and attributes associated with positive mental health lead to improved physical health, better quality of life, reduced crime, higher educational attainment, economic well-being and personal dignity.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.95.1/10">At the meeting of the all-party groups, we also heard from Dr. Phil Timms of the Royal College of Psychiatrists, who told us that men tend to like being in control, which can prevent them from seeking help. However, if that can be turned around so that men see that they are taking control of their own health, it might be positive.</p>
	<p pid="a.95.1/11">Men's mental health problems are often missed by GPs and friends because they are covered up.Dr. Timms also spoke about a friend of his who committed suicide while at medical school and had not spoken to anyone about his feelings. He also noted that that is not uncommon. Instead, men start drinking, take risks and become angry or complain of headaches, rather than admitting that they are feeling distressed or depressed.</p>
	<p pid="a.95.1/12">National men's health week looked at men's mental well-being. At national level, the Men's Health Forum worked closely with 40 other organisations to make the week a success and to show what can be done to improve men's mental well-being. I shall not list all40 organisations, but partners in the week included the Royal Mail, which is the country's biggest employer of men, the TUC, and charities such as the Mental Health Foundation, the Samaritans and the Afiya Trust. The Department of Health and NHS organisations were also partners. They all did some great work, showing what can be done to improve men's mental well-being.</p>
	<p pid="a.95.1/13">The partners also worked with Haynes Publishing to produce the &quot;Brain Manual&quot;, which was compiled by a good friend of mine, Dr. Ian Banks. He is not only president of the Men's Health Forum, having done a huge amount of work in support of men's health, but has recently been appointed as one of only two professors of men's health in the country. About 2,000 local events took place in national men's health week too. These events&mdash;run by NHS professionals, voluntary groups and occupational teams&mdash;undertook an extremely broad range of activity in an even broader range of settings. Activities ranged from display stands and father-and-son days to a five-a-side football competition and everything in between.</p>
	<p pid="a.95.1/14">In my constituency in Dartford, the primary care trust health promotion team worked with pharmacists on a leaflet that they could either give to clients as a takeaway or use to prompt conversations on health issues. The overall aim is to engage men in promoting activities in ways that are local and flexible. Pharmacists, as we know, are both local and flexible. I am delighted that my local PCT and local council were able to get involved in men's health week.</p>
	<p pid="a.95.1/15">I had the good fortune to chair a recent men's health supported conference on men's mental well-being, at which the Minister also spoke. That conference and the &quot;Brain Manual&quot; received financial support from the Government, for which I know the Men's Health Forum was extremely grateful. The Government were also supported by the Mental Health Foundation and the Football Association.</p>
	<p pid="a.95.1/16">The wide range of factors that positively and negatively influence a man's mental well-being were explained and discussed at the event. The Football Association highlighted how sport can help to improve mental well-being. It has announced that it has appointed former England captain Tony Adams as a new football for all ambassador, with specific responsibility for mental health.</p>
	<p pid="a.95.1/17">The FA's Simon Johnson also called on the mental health practitioners at the conference to become involved in the new football for all project, which uses football as a tool to help service users. That is clearly a welcome development. As the conference was supposed to have taken place in the new Wembley stadium, the FA could have spoken also about its experience of managing workplace stress.</p>
	<p pid="a.95.1/18">Many gay men in particular face challenges to mental health well-being. There is still widespread homophobic bullying in schools, for example, and many mainstream religions regard homosexuality as sinful. Homophobia results in depression, anxiety, fear, apathy, mistrust and other mental health problems. There is also an impact on heterosexual men who might fear being labelled gay. That limits personal expression and creates fear of closeness with other men.</p>
	<p pid="a.95.1/19">The conference held workshops run in London by PACE, which is London's largest gay and lesbian organisation. Evaluation shows that 96 per cent. of participants found the workshops useful, 71 per cent. felt more assured and 40 per cent. felt less unhappy about being gay.</p>
	<p pid="a.95.1/20">Many of the lessons of that work could be used to help men in general. The &quot;Mind Your Head&quot; report from the Men's Health Forum is heavily influenced by Professor Richard Layard's work on happiness. A key area here is the effect of work on well-being. Far more men than women work full-time, and experiencing satisfaction at work is an important predisposing factor for positive mental well-being in men.</p>
	<p pid="a.95.1/21">We usually associate higher earning power and higher status for men at work as representing a disadvantage for women, but this is a double-edged sword. The traditional role of breadwinner brings its own stresses, and long working hours can harm good family relationships, which are crucial for the mental well-being of future generations.</p>
	<p pid="a.95.1/22">Lack of job satisfaction, work-related stress, the pressure to work long hours and unemployment are all damaging to mental well-being and, for numerical reasons, more likely to affect men than women. Men in the UK work the longest hours in Europe; 27 per cent. of men with full-time jobs in the UK work more than 48 hours a week, and 11 per cent. do more than60 hours a week.</p>
	<p pid="a.95.1/23">According to the TUC, 5 million people work more than seven hours of unpaid overtime every week. Most of those are likely to be men. The TUC work on this suggests that almost half the UK work force want to work fewer hours, with 10 per cent. willing to accept a pay reduction to do so.</p>
	<p pid="a.95.1/24">Perhaps that has an influence on some of the other statistics highlighted by the YouGov survey published during men's health week. For example, stress, anxiety or depression are causing a third of sufferers to drink more alcohol. A further 18 per cent. start or increase smoking, and 4 per cent. admit to using illegal drugs in a bid to make themselves feel better. Nearly a fifth say that that makes them feel more aggressive.</p>
	<p pid="a.95.1/25">We also know that 73 per cent. of adults who go missing are men. Let us remember that the reverse of that issue&mdash;unemployment&mdash;is also a common factor in poor mental well-being. Last year, the Health Development Agency reported that</p>
	<p pid="a.95.1/26" class="indent">&quot;there is a strong association between unemployment and psychological and psychiatric morbidity... Upon re-employment, there appears to be a reversal of these effects.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.95.1/27">Just last week, the <i>Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine</i> reported that the stress caused by job loss in the over-50s doubled their chances of suffering a stroke or heart attack.</p>
	<p pid="a.95.1/28">As I have said, understanding and valuing of men's mental well-being are low, but the position is even worse when it comes to ethnic minority men. There is little awareness among health care professionals of how to engage effectively with black and minority ethnic men. Young African-Caribbean men are much more likely to receive a diagnosis of schizophrenia, more likely to be detained under the Mental Health Act 1983 and less likely to be offered psychological treatments. Asian men have high incidence of compulsory admissions to psychiatric institutions and low uptake of aftercare services. Irish men have a particularly high suicide rate, while Chinese men are generally reluctant to express emotions or to seek help with emotional problems.</p>
	<p pid="a.95.1/29">Black and minority ethnic organisations, including Destigmatize and SIRI Counselling, were also partners in national men's health week. I am particularly pleased that the Men's Health Forum is continuing to work with those organisations and others on a project on the mental well-being of BME men. It is good news that the Department of Health is providing the majority of the funding needed for the project, and I hope that a sponsor can soon be found to provide the remainder.</p>
	<p pid="a.95.1/30">I know that the forum has had a long relationship with Professor Kamlesh Patel, chair of the Mental Health Act Commission and director of the ethnicity and health unit at the university of Central Lancashire. In fact, I would like to congratulate Professor Patel on his recent appointment to another place, and I look forward to welcoming Lord Patel of Bradford to meetings of the all-party group on men's health.</p>
	<p pid="a.95.1/31">There are isolated examples of innovative work going on in Kilburn. Brent council, the local child and adolescent health service, and the charity Corum Family run the boys2MEN project, which aims to give young African-Caribbean men healthy relationships with men when many do not have a father figure in their household. Last year, they won an award for that work.</p>
	<p pid="a.95.1/32">Another groundbreaking project is CALM, the Campaign Against Living Miserably. CALM has been successful in working with the music industry in clubs and local radio. Its telephone helpline and website also allow young men to talk about problems and find local support.</p>
	<p pid="a.95.1/33">I urge the Minister to ensure continuing and increasing support for such projects. Those charities, councils and local NHS bodies are helping young men to avoid alcohol abuse, suicide and aggression. Others have had success too. Dr. Phil Timms has noted that in New Zealand, 10 to 12-year-olds are taught about mental well-being. That is proving very successful.</p>
	<p pid="a.95.1/34">The Men's Health Forum survey identified relationship problems as troubling a quarter of men. It is often claimed that men will not seek help for such problems, but the national Mensline scheme in Australia shows that that is simply not true. By offering a male-friendly male-specific service, it has attracted 400,000 callers since 2001 in a culture internationally known for its macho men. That suggests that with a little encouragement and by respecting men's maleness, we might help large numbers of men suffering marital breakdown. That would have knock-on effects, helping men and women to tackle some troublesome problems of relationship breakdown that can be so damaging for children.</p>
	<p pid="a.95.1/35">I think I have shown that on a range of measures men's mental well-being is poor, and that despite the successes of isolated and small-scale initiatives, no one really knows how to tackle things comprehensively. As the Men's Health Forum told the all-party groups on men's health and on mental health:</p>
	<p pid="a.95.1/36" class="indent">&quot;Men are less likely to be diagnosed with depression because male specific symptoms may not be taken into account.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.95.1/37">We need to understand that. We need to tackle it. We need to stop men's physical health, those in relationships with them and society at large suffering through men's poor mental health.</p>
	<p pid="a.95.1/38">The first step must be a detailed investigation of levels of male psychological distress in all its manifestations. I believe that the Government should fund and start that work now. Specialists at the National Institute for Mental Health in England should examine the key risk factors, establish good practice and make recommendations for new and more flexible male-friendly services. They should also consider how we deal with the significant inequalities such as those affecting gay men and those from BME communities.</p>
	<p pid="a.95.1/39">I hope that the Minister can announce progress on that important work. Such a gender-sensitive approach will soon be mandatory, when the new gender duty, introduced by the Equality Act 2006, becomes operational next April. I am also concerned that the public sector as a whole, not least the NHS, is not yet preparing for its new responsibilities, even though they have the potential dramatically to improve service delivery for men and for women.</p>
	<p pid="a.95.1/40">We must avoid at all costs a society in which chronic poor mental health, as well as its effect on other areas of health and society, is endemic in men and repeated from generation to generation.</p>

	<p pid="a.104.0/1">I apologise if I am unable to stay for the whole debate, but it might be helpful if those who wrote to the hon. Gentleman understood that we are where we are and that no one is proposing the extermination of grey squirrels throughout the United Kingdom. Our aim is to safeguard areas such as the hon. Gentleman's constituency and the area that I represent in Northumberland that still offer havens to red squirrels, which are under serious threat. Somehow we need to devise ways in which to protect some terrain on which the red squirrel can survive.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-06-28a.104.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1635" speakername="Peter Atkinson" colnum="104"  time="014:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060628/halltext/60628h0254.htm#06062860000491">
	<p pid="a.104.1/1">I agree with my right hon. neighbour, whose constituency, like mine, has a large number of red squirrels. In fact, the Hexham constituency contains 80 per cent. of the red squirrel population in England. There are other healthy populations on the Isle of Wight and on Brownsea island off the south-coast, for many of the same reasons. There are a few in Thetford forest, at Sefton in Merseyside and in Cumbria, as well as some populations in central Wales, the Scottish borders and the Scottish highlands. However, their numbers are shrinking. That is the problem that we face, and the problem on which I shall focus.</p>
	<p pid="a.104.1/2">Not only is the grey squirrel a pest and a threat to the red squirrel, but it does considerable damage to forestry interests. In addition, the cobnut growers of Kent estimate that they lose about 50 per cent. of their crop annually because of theft by grey squirrels. Just the other day, I was in Kensington Gardens on an all-party horticultural trip. The park authorities find that the grey squirrel is a particular menace to trees and flowerbeds and they are desperately trying to discourage people from feeding them, which I can well understand.</p>
	<p pid="a.104.1/3">The news has been bad so far, but <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1404" name="A J Beith">the right hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Mr. Beith)</phrase> touched on some good news for the red squirrel. There has been a substantial new initiative in the north&mdash;in Cumbria and Northumberland and on the Scottish borders&mdash;to preserve what we have. That is our first priority: we must save what we have and stop the remorseless advance of the greys. Kielder forest is an ideal habitat for red squirrels and the Forestry Commission and others have formed an organisation, Red Alert, which represents all sorts of interests in the area. About a year ago, it had a meeting in Newcastle and determined a new strategy to create 16 reserve areas mainly in the north. They will be guarded and a buffer zone&mdash;a cordon sanitaire&mdash;will created around round them in which everyone will make an effort to stop the spread of grey squirrels. All the legal methods available will be used to control the populations in that area and stop the squirrels mixing, which is important.</p>
	<p pid="a.104.1/4">The 16 areas are mainly in Northumberland and Cumbria, but there is also one at Widdale near Hawes and at Sefton in Merseyside. The partners in the scheme will band together and take every possible action to protect the red squirrels within the cordon. Recently, there was a pleasant announcement that the campaign will receive a little more than &pound;600,000 from the Heritage Lottery Fund, which will be added to the &pound;500,000 that the partners in the Red Alert squirrel campaign have raised themselves. I particularly appreciate the Heritage Lottery Fund and its chairman, Liz Forgan, for being so imaginative and providing funding for that purpose. It will be put to good use. Lord Redesdale, a colleague of the right hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed, is putting together a campaign to link farmers and landowners in the area better so that the control of the grey squirrel can go ahead.</p>
	<p pid="a.104.1/5">That is good news in the sense that the Scottish authorities are co-operating. In the past, Scotland has tended to do its own thing. It has its own problems with grey squirrels introduced in the central belt, which are advancing down into the borders and up into the highlands. From a selfish point of view, those in the borders worry us most of all because they are coming down south and could invade from that side. We need the co-operation of the forestry interests in Scotland, Scottish Natural Heritage and others to make the circle round Kielder forest and the forests on the borders tight and complete. That is the good news.</p>
	<p pid="a.104.1/6">The bad news is something called squirrel pox virus, which is an affliction to which grey squirrels are immune, but to which the reds are not. Not all grey squirrels have it, but the problem is that some of those that do are in Cumbria, and they are beginning to cross the border and spread out into Scotland. That could bring them into contact with the protective buffer zone around the squirrels in Kielder forest. We are concerned because two red squirrels were recently found within two miles of my home in Northumberland, and examination showed that they had died from the squirrel pox virus. So the virus is spreading in Northumberland, which is particularly bad news.</p>
	<p pid="a.104.1/7">Generally, when grey squirrels invade an area, the reds disappear slowly&mdash;it is a gradual erosion. Many experts who are listening will know better than I, but I believe that it happens largely because the grey squirrel is about twice the weight of a red squirrel and eats a lot more than the red squirrel. In addition, the densities of squirrel populations vary&mdash;the density of the red squirrel population is estimated to be slightly more than one per hectare, whereas the density of the grey is about eight per hectare. There is therefore much more pressure on a piece of woodland where the grey squirrels are present, yet the greys and the reds are competing for the same food supplies. We believe that lack of food and perhaps lack of breeding space causes the reds' physical condition to deteriorate, so that they die over the winter or fail to reproduce because the females' fertility is affected by their poor physical condition. When squirrel pox virus starts to spread, however, the decline becomes 20 times greater and the population crashes very quickly. It is an immediate and serious threat to the future of the red squirrel.</p>
	<p pid="a.104.1/8">The argument is not simply a UK-centric one. The red squirrel is common throughout Europe and, I believe, in part of Asia. Red squirrels are all slightly different but they are all red, though some in parts of Germany they look black. They are part of the European wildlife scene, whereas greys were introduced into the UK and Ireland&mdash;where they are also a problem. They were introduced into Italy just after the war, in 1948, and they have spread so that it is estimated that there are now some 8 million in northern Italy. There is a danger that they will spread northwards into and over the Alps&mdash;like Hannibal&mdash;and once they achieve that they will be present in France and Switzerland and throughout Europe. The Italian Government had not done a lot about the problem, but the European Squirrel Initiative tells me that following a helpful meeting the Italian Government have decided to take action against the spread of greys. As with everything in life there is usually a commercial interest involved. The advent of the greys in part of Italy where there is a large hazelnut industry has concentrated minds, because the industry regards them as a threat to an important crop in the Italian economy. It is good news that Europeans are taking an interest.</p>
	<p pid="a.104.1/9">I do not wish to become a bore, but there are some slight complications with which the Minister may be able to help. One way forward that we have identified is to get some European money to help to fund research projects that will benefit the squirrel population in Europe and the UK. The Berne convention protects the European squirrel&mdash;European squirrels are listed in appendix 3 of the convention. For reasons that we do not understand, however, the 1992 habitats directive, which introduced the Berne convention into European domestic legislation, does not list the red squirrel in its annexes. The Berne convention and the habitats directive put an obligation on national authorities to safeguard endangered species and to tackle introduction of alien species. If the Government could persuade the European Commission to add the red squirrel to the European directive, we could consider the issue on a European basis, which could have helpful repercussions for research funding.</p>
	<p pid="a.104.1/10">The Government can help in a number of respects&mdash;some small, but others more important. The first&mdash;the most important and most immediate&mdash;relates to Government help with funding for research into the squirrel pox virus. The problem is that we do not know how the virus is transmitted, and there is only circumstantial, rather than positive evidence about how it affects the red. We know that it does affect the red, because the red population crashes, but, scientifically, there is no link. We know from tests that greys have antibodies to the virus, so we can see that they have had it but not been affected. However, no one knows where in the animal's body the virus is kept, how it is translated&mdash;perhaps it is at feeding sites&mdash;or how it has moved from the grey to the red.</p>
	<p pid="a.104.1/11">I am pleased to say that considerable research is going on at the Moredun research institute in Edinburgh and at Liverpool university. The problem is that the researchers are on short-term contracts, and if we do not get research funding, there is a danger that those contracts will run out before any progress has been made. I therefore make a plea to the Minister to see whether we can find some funds&mdash;they will not be extensive&mdash;so that those research programmes can carry on and find out much more about the pox virus. Once we understand how it is translated from the grey to the red, we can start to do research on developing a vaccine to help the red squirrel, which would be of great interest.</p>
	<p pid="a.104.1/12">The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs could also help through its woodland grant programme. It currently gives out woodland grants which, in areas where there are red squirrels, make allowances for grey squirrel control. The difficulty is that the grants are cash-limited, so there is no guarantee that somebody who has a grant now will get continue to get one; that will depend on how much money there is in the budget in the next round. Of course, it was always thus in government, but hon. Members will understand that that would lead to a break in the continuity of grey squirrel control. In addition, small woods&mdash;those covering less than3 hectares, although I might be wrong about the size&mdash;are not included in the woodland grant schemes. However, grey squirrels use small broadleaf woods as a stepping stone into new territory, and it would be extremely helpful if the Minister could see whether there was any way of giving some of the grant money for grey squirrel control to owners of small woodlands.</p>
	<p pid="a.104.1/13">I mentioned listing the red squirrel in the habitats directive, but I hope that the Minister will also give us more support in our search for the holy grail&mdash;a method of restricting grey squirrels. I am not advocating a complete cull or slaughter of grey squirrels, which would be totally pointless, given the size of the population. One could not exterminate them using normal means of control such as shooting and trapping. Scientists across the world who deal with introduced alien species are trying to find an immuno-contraception method&mdash;a way of interfering with the fertility of the animal. If they can develop such a method, it would be the answer to the problem of the grey squirrel population. We would not be slaughtering the greys; instead, they would slowly die out in the areas where we used that technique. That would allow us to pick areas that were suitable for the reintroduction of the red and then to carry a gentle programme of humane eradication of the grey squirrel population there.</p>
	<p pid="a.104.1/14">Work was done on that system at Sheffield university, and much was made of it 10 years ago when I had a debate on this issue, but that work came to an end. However, the Central Science Laboratory in York, with the help of some DEFRA funding, is looking again at the system. The Australians have been trying for years to introduce it among rabbits, but without success. It is something that science needs to pursue it if we are to get rid of the alien species that cause so much damage to our native species.</p>
	<p pid="a.104.1/15">We need to make a real effort to save the red squirrel. The new sanctuaries around the country will be our last chance. If they are invaded and the march of the greys continues, the gloomy prediction of some scientists, that the red squirrel population in this country will have died out within 20 years, will be realised. I think that we would all say that that would be a great tragedy.</p>

	<p pid="a.108.0/1">I commend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1635" name="Peter Atkinson">the hon. Member for Hexham(Mr. Atkinson)</phrase> on his persistence, coming back to the subject 10 years later to point out that the situation has become worse in the meantime, with the invasion of greys into the areas of red squirrel population, which were once more widespread in Northumberland than they are today. I well remember often seeing red squirrels in the Tyne valley, for example, where I believe that greys are now to be found. We hope that Kielder forest will remain a major sanctuary, and across the north of Northumberland there are a number of smaller woodland areas where we still have red squirrels. We do not want to see that territory taken over by greys.</p>
	<p pid="a.108.0/2">Grey squirrels are a feature of the landscape of much of the United Kingdom, and clearly it would be neither possible nor popular to remove them entirely. In many parts of the country, they are quite natural. They are the only squirrel that people see, people enjoy seeing them and they are fascinating creatures. However, in those areas where we still have red squirrels it is vital under any interpretation of biodiversity that we retain them. That will require tough action, such as the rigid maintenance of sanctuary areas and the buffer zones around them, and definite action to ensure that any arrival of greys into those areas is dealt with quickly. Research such as that mentioned by the hon. Gentleman offers us considerable possibilities for the future. Finally, we need urgently to find some way to deal with squirrel pox. What a bitter blow it was when the news came to those in Northumberland who have made such assiduous efforts over long periods to try to preserve the habitat of the reds that there was another threat to their survival.</p>
	<p pid="a.108.0/3">I hope that the population in the Isle of Wight, represented <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1654" name="Andrew Turner">here by the hon. Member for Isle of Wight (Mr. Turner)</phrase>, can be sustained. Species have crossed stretches of water before now, although I am not sure whether there have been serious grey sightings on the island. Keeping species out is that much more difficult when the only barrier is a land barrier.</p>
	<p pid="a.108.0/4">I welcome the fact that the hon. Member for Hexham has secured this debate again. I welcome the continued efforts of volunteers and volunteer organisations and the part that they are playing, and I plead for Government recognition of the problem and for Government support, resources&mdash;not enormous resources but enough to help with the essential research needs&mdash;and a willingness to support the decisive action that will need to be taken where greys directly threaten those few remaining sanctuary areas that we must keep for red squirrels.</p>

	<p pid="a.109.0/1">I had not intended to make a speech in this debate, but I see that there might be a moment or two to spare and I thought that I would mention one or two courses of action that I cannot recommend to every part of the country but that we have found useful on the Isle of Wight.</p>
	<p pid="a.109.0/2">The first, of course, was the beneficial effect of global warming, when the island was separated from the mainland of the United Kingdom. That is not a course of action whose use I advocate in other parts of the country, but it has meant that we have had some immunity from other diseases. Bovine TB, for example, is much less prevalent on the island and, thankfully, foot and mouth did not come to the island during the most recent outbreak because people were very vigilant. The red squirrel has been protected by the stretch of water that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1404" name="A J Beith">the right hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Mr. Beith)</phrase> mentioned.</p>
	<p pid="a.109.0/3">I would also like to congratulate and place on the record my appreciation of the Wight Squirrel Project&mdash;note the spelling, in case the colours should get further mixed up. The project keeps a close eye on the welfare and well-being of red squirrels on the island. All my constituents want the red squirrel to continue to thrive and they are worried by any report that grey squirrels have been seen. The sighting or putative sighting of a grey squirrel is a matter of great concern: it is reported in the local papers and people make a great effort to find the offending animal. Recently, an acquaintance of mine was successfully prosecuted for spreading rumours about the importation on to the island of grey squirrels&mdash;the New Labour equivalent of spreading alarm and despondency. We take the matter very seriously.</p>
	<p pid="a.109.0/4">The only specific point that I want to make is about habitat. He may have done so, but I did not hear <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1635" name="Peter Atkinson">my hon. Friend the Member for Hexham (Mr. Atkinson)</phrase> mention in particular what habitats are more likely to support red squirrel populations than grey squirrel populations. My understanding is that coniferous forests are more likely than deciduous forests to support the grey squirrel. I hope that any further work of the Government and the Forestry Commission will give appropriate provision.</p>

	<p pid="a.110.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1635" name="Peter Atkinson">the hon. Member for Hexham (Mr. Atkinson)</phrase> on securing the debate. He has been involved in a number of occasions in the past and, more recently, in the other place where there was a debate on the issue.</p>
	<p pid="a.110.0/2">The issue raises a fundamental question of biodiversity within the United Kingdom and with a species in which we clearly have a considerable interest. Estimates that I have seen suggest that there may be as few as 160,000 red squirrels left within the United Kingdom, with somewhat upwards of 2 million grey squirrels competing for the same sorts of habitat. We have already heard a clear description of the means by which the red squirrel is gradually being chased out of traditional habitats within the UK, notably the pressure on resources&mdash;in particular habitats&mdash;but also the parapox or squirrel pox, which has the unfortunate effect of causing skin ulcers and lesions on the red squirrel but to which the grey squirrel has immunity.</p>
	<p pid="a.110.0/3">The introduction of the grey squirrel from north America at the end of the 19th century has an exact parallel with other transatlantic migrations. We wrought havoc in America with human diseases and the invasion of Cortez. In the other direction, there is a direct parallel in agricultural, for example, with the importation of the phylloxera beetle into France and the destruction of the vineyards. With the exception of one small area of France, every French vine now grows on American root stock because of its immunity to diseases and particularly to the phylloxera beetle.</p>
	<p pid="a.110.0/4">An excellent way forward would be to develop an immunity to the parapox virus or some means of ensuring that the red squirrel was better protected. Realistically, however, I fear that the time scale for research is inevitably uncertain, although I hope that we can do more to support the research that is being conducted into the problem.</p>
	<p pid="a.110.0/5">I note that other suggestions have been made. Despite its robust animal welfare traditions, the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals has not entirely set its face against the need for selective culling in order to protect areas for the red squirrel. I am afraid that that is something we have to do to protect habitats and, as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1404" name="A J Beith">my right hon. Friend the Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Mr. Beith)</phrase> said, establish buffer zones and sanctuaries for the red squirrels. We also need to consider the habitats directive and provide what protection we can for the red squirrels in that context.</p>
	<p pid="a.110.0/6">There is a real sense of urgency. The hon. Member for Hexham is one of the few remaining MPs who, along with my right hon. Friend the Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed, represents an area in which the red squirrel is still extant in England. As has been mentioned, if more radical action is not taken to protect the red squirrel, there is a chance that within20 years we will see a steady spread of the grey squirrel and a steady pushing out of the red squirrel from these islands altogether, with the possible exception of sanctuaries such as the Isle of Wight, which, as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1654" name="Andrew Turner">the hon. Member for Isle of Wight (Mr. Turner)</phrase> rightly pointed out, has so far managed to preserve its peculiar advantages in that respect.</p>
	<p pid="a.110.0/7">I hope that this debate serves as a wake-up call for the Government to take action along the lines that I have suggested in improving the research commitment and habitat protection, including selective culling where necessary, perhaps with a premium or bounty offered to foresters, in order to protect areas for the red squirrel so that it may thrive.</p>

	<p pid="a.111.0/1">I, too, congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1635" name="Peter Atkinson">my hon. Friend the Member for Hexham (Mr. Atkinson)</phrase> on securing this important debate. It has been 10 years since his Adjournment debate that called for the control of grey squirrels and, I believe, two years since the last Westminster Hall debate on the matter.</p>
	<p pid="a.111.0/2">Although some progress has been made, it is such a pity that the Government have not done more during that period. Indeed, the present Administration have quite a sad record on wildlife management. I hope that the decline of the red squirrel will be removed from the catalogue of errors that has included the increase of tuberculosis in wildlife. Moreover, the Government have failed to get the red squirrel included in the habitats directive, but that does not mean that it should not receive the same level of protection.</p>
	<p pid="a.111.0/3">It would also be helpful if the Minister could update us on developments in the research into immuno-contraceptive vaccines for grey squirrels. I am curious to know how much of the &pound;1 million the three-year fertility control project has devoted specifically to squirrels. I understand that the Government have been encouraging landowners to cull grey squirrels in certain areas where they pose a critical threat to red squirrels, but I am curious about the fact that the proposed measures, which include giving the grant to woodland owners, will be rolled out for only three years. Thousands of red squirrels could have disappeared from England by then, and the measures could prove to be too little, too late. Can the Minister let us know what information he has on the extent to which private landowners are managing the grey squirrel population?</p>
	<p pid="a.111.0/4">It is difficult to see how we can save the red squirrel without some control of the grey squirrel population, as the latter has two distinct advantages that are causing the red squirrel to decline. The first is the survival of the fittest, and the second the fact that the grey squirrel is a carrier of the parapox virus, which we have heard about in this debate. We know that the dreadful parapox virus has played its part in demise of the red squirrel and that the grey squirrel is immune to its deadly effects.</p>
	<p pid="a.111.0/5">There is an especially urgent need to learn more about the virus and how to fight it, because there are reports that it is beginning to penetrate the red squirrel's heartlands, in the Kielder forest. If the virus should become endemic to the area, there would be a serious and possibly irreversible decline in England's red squirrel numbers. I am consequently keen to hear from the Minister what studies are being carried out into these differences and into the mode of transmission and whether there has been any progress in searching for a parapox cure. I am aware that the Moredun research institute is doing a lot of work in this area and I would be interested to know whether the Government intend to commission it to continue and to conduct further research.</p>
	<p pid="a.111.0/6">We have much to learn from existing research, but there is far more work to be done if we are to save the red squirrel population. We are running out of time and it would be a terrible tragedy if the Government did not get it right. The red squirrel evokes considerable emotion among the public, not just because of its underdog status but because of its iconic status immortalised by Beatrix Potter. I have very young children, and it is probably worth mentioning briefly that Squirrel Nutkin, who is a red squirrel, is not a particularly good squirrel compared with Timmy Tiptoes, the grey squirrel, who, although greedy, is a better behaved squirrel.</p>
	<p pid="a.111.0/7">I also note that in April the Heritage Lottery Fund contributed &pound;626,000 of the &pound;1 million going into the &quot;Save Our Squirrels&quot; project as part of the Red Alert North England partnership. Will this be sufficient to halt the decline? The red squirrel is an essential part of England's heritage and to lose it would send out all the wrong signals and be a disaster for conservation, as well as for our heritage and for our biodiversity. Over our own lifetimes, I am sure hon. Members have noticed how increasingly unusual it is becoming to see red squirrels, even in their few remaining most populous pockets. Clearly, the challenge and way forward now is to find and develop effective conservation methods, many of which have been raised in this debate, if the red squirrel population of England and Wales is to avoid its predicted fate.</p>
	<p pid="a.111.0/8">This year marks the 130th anniversary of the introduction of grey squirrels into Britain and with that the beginning of the slow decline of native red squirrels. Who would have thought back in 1876 that the handful of greys from north America, introduced into the woodlands of Cheshire, and subsequent introductions would have placed the red squirrels into the position of peril and near extinction that they face today? Indeed, three years ago a DEFRA report stated that the extinction of the red squirrel in England and Wales was likely in the foreseeable future. I am sure that this is something that nobody wishes to see.</p>
	<p pid="a.111.0/9">While it is estimated that the red squirrel population throughout the UK is 160,000 and in England stands at around 20,000 but could be as low as 12,000, the greys have flourished with their numbers heading swiftly upwards towards the 3 million mark. With such a contrast in fortunes, we must do what we can primarily to maintain, and then if possible increase, our red squirrel numbers. There are so many species that are native to Britain which were once abundant and are now threatened with extinction, but I hope that it is not too late for the red squirrel.</p>
	<p pid="a.111.0/10">With that in mind, I mention that back in 2004 in a written answer, the Under-Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1580" name="Ben Bradshaw">the hon. Member for Exeter (Mr. Bradshaw)</phrase>, confirmed that there had been no assessment made of the changes to the red squirrel population over the last five years, and English Nature stated that the population knowledge was poor. I should therefore be grateful if the Minister could let us know whether that is still the case. I will be disappointed if it is, as there are no precise figures for the red squirrel population although there are for some of the other biodiversity action plan priority species.</p>
	<p pid="a.111.0/11">Aside from Scotland where the majority of reds in the UK live, the Isle of Wight, northern England, Anglesey and Brownsea island can also boast a reasonably strong presence. However, to preserve these strongholds we must see stringent measures adopted. In this respect, I broadly welcomed the &quot;Grey Squirrels and England's Woodlands: Policy and Action Statement&quot; announcement on <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-22">22 January</phrase> which aimed to manage the risks presented by the grey squirrel.</p>
	<p pid="a.111.0/12">Nevertheless, I was curious to know why the Government decided only this year to encourage the Forestry Commission to focus its efforts on disrupting the grey squirrel population. Only back in April 2003 did the then Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1533" name="Margaret Beckett">the right hon. Member for Derby, South (Margaret Beckett)</phrase>, say that the Government's emphasis is on protecting current red squirrel habitats, rather than interfering with the grey squirrel. Perhaps the Minister will be able to enlighten us on that change in Government policy.</p>

	<p pid="a.113.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1635" name="Peter Atkinson">the hon. Member for Hexham (Mr. Atkinson)</phrase> on securing this debate on the red squirrel. Perhaps appropriately, the species' greatest stronghold, Kielder forest, lies in his northern England constituency. The decline of red squirrel numbers was the subject of a debate in another place about three months ago. I share the widespread desire expressed then and today in this Chamber to see the red squirrel maintained as part of our native wildlife, although, as was acknowledged by Earl Peel and others, it is unrealistic, at least in the foreseeable future, to envisage the eradication of the grey squirrel to enable the red squirrel to re-establish itself across its original range.</p>
	<p pid="a.113.0/2">Although the red squirrel in certainly not at risk in continental Europe, its decline here over the past 50 years means that it is at risk in the UK. That is why the red squirrel is offered strong protection in the UK under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981, which makes it an offence intentionally to kill, injure, take or sell the animal, or to destroy or damage or obstruct access to its breeding place. It is also the subject of a species action plan as part of the UK biodiversity action plan. I say that in response to a number of suggestions by hon. Members this afternoon that because it is not listed in the annexe to the habitats directive, it is not protected to the same degree as species that are. In fact, it is afforded such protection under the Wildlife and Countryside Act within the UK. I hope that that provides some reassurance to right hon. and hon. Members.</p>

	<p pid="a.114.2/1">What I can say to the hon. Gentleman is that we shall do absolutely all that we can to ensure that the red squirrel is protected and preserved. If the opportunity should present itself within the revision of the annexes, and if that proves to be an efficient way of achieving the objective that everyone in the Chamber this afternoon shares, it is of course something that we should, and will, consider.</p>
	<p pid="a.114.2/2">What we are talking about now, however, is how we can safeguard and preserve those remaining viable populations of red squirrels. In England, there are two areas where viable red squirrel populations remain: in the south, on the Isle of Wight, as we have heard, and Poole harbour islands, and in the forests of northern England. In both regions, partnerships involving private landowners, local authorities and conservation bodies are working together to try to save the red squirrel. The Government play a key role in such partnerships, as a land manager and funder and by providing expert advice. On the whole, the debate this afternoon has been extremely good natured and focused on the same aim, although I was somewhat disappointed that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1565" name="Christopher Huhne">the hon. Member for Eastleigh (Chris Huhne)</phrase> said that the Government needed a wake-up call. In fact, the Government have been heavily engaged in the issue and earlier this year, as he may know, launched their action plan in January on the red squirrel. The Government have been standing idly by, as he and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1679" name="Bill Wiggin">the hon. Member for Leominster (Bill Wiggin)</phrase> might have suggested.</p>
	<p pid="a.114.2/3">In both regions, the partnerships involving private landowners, local authorities and conservation bodies working together to save the red squirrel are critical. The Isle of Wight Red Squirrel Forum, led by Isle of Wight council, has led a wide range of initiatives including the monitoring of the red squirrel population. It has prepared contingency plans for dealing with any incursion of grey squirrels, and those plans have already successfully been put to the test, albeit, fortunately, by a false alarm. The contingency plan sprang into action and there was an invasion of people with the appropriate measures for dealing with a grey squirrel incursion before it was found that there was no threat.</p>
	<p pid="a.114.2/4">Grants totalling &pound;735,000 have supported the creation of 210 hectares of new woodland by landowners on the Isle of Wight. The new woods link areas of existing woodland, much of which is managed by the Forestry Commission to favour red squirrels. The links have increased red squirrels' ability to move around, as they are a species that prefers to keep to the trees rather than travel on the ground. They have also been helped by the introduction of rope bridges to cross busy highways.</p>
	<p pid="a.114.2/5">The work to maintain red squirrels on the Isle of Wight is a good illustration of what can be done through co-operation between local communities and organisations and national bodies. Co-operation between a wide range of bodies is equally key in the north of England, where there is no water barrier to protect the reds and where the greys have advanced inexorably through mixed woodland in the past 20 years. Research by Newcastle university has shown that the best chance for red squirrels to survive is in large coniferous forests that are unsuitable for greys. The Red Alert North England partnership has brought together private landowners' representatives, the wildlife trusts, national park authorities, DEFRA, English Nature and the Forestry Commission to work together to preserve the remaining red squirrel population.</p>
	<p pid="a.114.2/6">Based on research evidence the partnership has produced the north of England red squirrel conservation strategy, which identifies 16 red squirrel reserves where it believes the red has the best chance of long-term survival. Those reserve areas and the surrounding buffer zones now have management guidelines to help landowners and managers to conserve red squirrels.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-06-28a.116.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1446" speakername="Barry Gardiner" colnum="116"  time="015:32:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060628/halltext/60628h0255.htm#06062860000507">
	<p pid="a.116.3/1">Five hundred people from across the country wrote to him saying that he was a cruel and evil man. I cannot imagine what his postbag will grow to now.</p>
	<p pid="a.116.3/2">I understand that Gordon Ramsay has cooked grey squirrel and offered it to the public, but, as Minister responsible for biodiversity, I do not feel able to promote eating a grey squirrel to save a red one. The relationship between red and grey squirrels is not straightforward. It is not simply the case that greys drive out reds, as they have been known to live in the same area for up to 50 years. However, it appears that, in the end, greys do displace the reds.</p>
	<p pid="a.116.3/3">Some grey squirrels carry the squirrel pox virus, as has been mentioned by hon. Members this afternoon. Although they appear to be unaffected themselves, the virus can have a devastating effect on the red squirrel population and accelerate the red's displacement by up to 20 times, as the hon. Member for Hexham said. The squirrel pox virus is a worrying development and the Forestry Commission organised a workshop to develop ideas for further research, which funding agencies are examining closely.</p>
	<p pid="a.116.3/4">The Forestry Commission and DEFRA are collaborating on research into the use of the immuno-contraception as a method of controlling the grey squirrel population. That is part of a larger DEFRA-led project looking at fertility control methods for a range of problem species. The work on squirrels is based on methods recently developed in the United States where a single-dose vaccine remains effective for a number of years. For a number of years in the USA, that vaccine has been administered successfully by injection, but of course injection is not an option for squirrels. We are looking therefore at oral delivery systems, which also are being developed in the United States.</p>
	<p pid="a.116.3/5">Obviously, we need to ensure that drugs are fully tested and trialled before they are put into a context in which UK wild animals might come across them, that they are effective on the target species and that they can be administered safely without adverse effects on other wildlife and of course humans. One problem is that the vaccine is not species-specific so initial work is concentrating on identification of the best carrier bait and the means to prevent access to the bait by other animals, including red squirrels. It is hoped that sufficient progress will be made for enclosure trials between 2006 and 2008. Clearly, however, it is a difficult problem and we would be foolish to act precipitately, before we are absolutely sure of the science.</p>
	<p pid="a.116.3/6">As I said earlier, our policy for the control of the grey squirrel in woodland prepared by DEFRA and the Forestry Commission was published on <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-22">22 January</phrase>. It sets out a framework for controlling grey squirrels so that populations are held at a level that does not threaten our native woodlands and priority species. The policy articulates a comprehensive policy and action programme, recognises the wider impact of grey squirrels on priority species and woodland habitats, develops a framework and rationale for targeting action where it will be most effective, and promotes new areas of research. Those new research areas are of particular interest. Scientists from DEFRA and the Forestry Commission are following new developments overseas, particularly in the United States where they have been looking at those matters carefully. They are now investigating fertility control agents for managing wild animal populations. Work will continue on that, but we will not see success overnight.</p>
	<p pid="a.116.3/7">Previous work on immuno-contraception involving the university of Sheffield ended without success, but demonstrated the difficulties of delivering an effective vaccine in sufficient quantities to wild animals. Non-lethal population control measures alone are not guaranteed to be an effective control and most likely we would need lethal control to reduce numbers before non-lethal methods were used to maintain populations at a reduced level.</p>
	<p pid="a.116.3/8">Looking a little wider, responsibility for red and grey squirrels in Scotland and Wales lies with the relevant Administrations. However, as squirrels can and do move across borders, I can assure the House that experts in the field work in close co-operation. The hon. Member for Hexham spoke about dangers from the north, which have been a feature of life in Hexham for 1,000 years or more, but dangers from the north are very real to the population of red squirrels. A costed action plan is being prepared in Scotland to implement the Scottish squirrels strategy, which aims to maintain viable populations of red squirrels across their current range in Scotland. In Wales, there has been considerable success in saving and expanding the red squirrel population on Anglesey. That has involved the culling of more than 6,500 grey squirrels, but the greys remain and continued vigilance and control will be required to keep them in check.</p>
	<p pid="a.116.3/9">Preservation of red squirrel populations is not something that the Government can achieve on their own, but we are taking a lead and will continue to do so. Many people love grey squirrels, but the reality is that they are a problem for some of our most threatened native species, such as the red squirrel and the dormouse. It is not realistic, practical or even desirable to eradicate grey squirrels completely, but we must effectively control them if we are to preserve our population of reds and the biodiversity that they represent.</p>

	<p pid="a.119.3/1">I agree. I am well aware of the problems in Cheadle, because a number of my constituents used to access NHS dentists there and are now unable to do so.</p>
	<p pid="a.119.3/2">I shall focus on three points: first, the impact of the new contract on the availability of certain treatment on the NHS, dentists' decisions to provide cheaper and less effective treatments, and the knock-on effect on dental laboratories; secondly, the influx of cheaper dental appliances from abroad; and finally, the lack of information given to patients about their entitlement to certain dental work.</p>
	<p pid="a.119.3/3">There are about 2,700 laboratories in the UK, providing dental appliances to dentists in the NHS and in private dental practices. Seventy per cent. of all dental appliances produced in UK laboratories are made for the NHS, so it is fair to say that any Department of Health decision on dentistry will affect the laboratories and their employees.</p>
	<p pid="a.119.3/4">The sector employs about 10,000 technicians and a further 11,500 administration and support staff, and the industry operates in one of the few remaining UK manufacturing sectors that still compete against imports. However, the new contract and the threat from overseas competition make the future of the industry look bleak.</p>
	<p pid="a.119.3/5">The new dental contract aims to simplify the charging system through the use of three bands: diagnosis, treatment and provision of appliances. As such, all work prepared by the dental laboratories falls within band 3. The cost of each appliance to the dentist varies dramatically, but some dentists pick the least expensive items available in band 3, instead of the most appropriate appliance for a patient's dental needs.</p>
	<p pid="a.119.3/6">The patient is treated and the dentist gains their required unit of dental activity target, but at a minimum cost. For example, many patients requiring a crown, which perhaps costs &pound;80 from the dental laboratory, are instead being offered single-tooth dentures, which might cost only &pound;20 from the laboratory.</p>
	<p pid="a.119.3/7">A survey carried out in May of 200 members of the Dental Laboratories Association discovered that orders for single-unit crowns had decreased by 44 per cent. compared with the same month last year, while the amount of one-tooth denture work had increased by61 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="a.119.3/8">It is widely accepted that, when feasible, a crown is more appropriate than a single-tooth denture, but there are significant health benefits in avoiding a denture. Although the denture might provide the aesthetic appearance of a natural tooth, it has many more potential complications: the patient may be unable to keep it in their mouth, or it may cause speech problems, compromise other teeth or strip gum tissue away from healthy teeth.</p>
	<p pid="a.119.3/9">The overall results from the new contract have been startling and prove pretty conclusively, I would argue, that certain dental appliances are not being provided by some dentists under the new contract, and that more people are being forced to go private to receive the treatment that they require.</p>
	<p pid="a.119.3/10">The May survey showed that NHS denture work had decreased by 79 per cent., and private denture work had increased by 52 per cent. NHS chrome work had decreased by 91 per cent. and private chrome workhad increased by 21 per cent. NHS bonded crown work had decreased by 79 per cent. and NHS precious bonded crown work had decreased by 86 per cent. Veneer work had decreased by 73 per cent. and yellow gold metal work had decreased by 38 per cent. in the NHS. Non-precious metal crown work had decreased by 61 per cent. Private bonded crown work had increased by 17 per cent. The number of dentists still providing NHS denture repairs had decreased by 34 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="a.119.3/11">The Minister cannot argue that she was not warned that that would happen, because in December 2005 she received figures from a survey carried out in the pilot area in September that year. They produced pretty similar results.</p>
	<p pid="a.119.3/12">One of the core problems with the new contractual arrangements is the significant balancing act that dentists must carry out to ensure that their monthly payment covers the cost of providing a comprehensive NHS dental service while still providing a profit for the practice and a salary for the dentists.</p>
	<p pid="a.119.3/13">The laboratory fee is a substantial element of a dental practice's budget, so it is in the interest of the dental practice to shop around for the best deal. However, the best deal often means sourcing appliances abroad. In fact, over the past four years, the market for overseas dental appliances has grown substantially. Estimates are that 10 per cent. of UK dental appliances are supplied by overseas laboratories.</p>
	<p pid="a.119.3/14">In the UK, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency allows dental appliances made overseas to be supplied to the UK as long as they have come via a laboratory in Europe that is registered to comply with the medical devices directive. The process is not one of proactively seeking to ensure that overseas dental appliances are being made in accordance with the directive. Without assessing the individual laboratory and checking the materials that were used at the time of production, a laboratory that receives dental appliances from an overseas laboratory cannot prove that the device has been made in accordance with the directive, so patients are potentially at risk. They could be supplied with dental appliances on which there was no information about the materials used or who produced and supplied them.</p>
	<p pid="a.119.3/15">It is imperative that we ensure that patients are aware of what treatment they are entitled to, and what they are receiving. It is important that patients should be made aware that a crown is available instead of a single-tooth denture. If a dentist tells a patient that they need a single-tooth denture, most will assume that that is the most appropriate treatment. I know that if I were to go to the dentist, and if the dentist told me that that was the most appropriate treatment, I would assume that that information was correct. However, some dentists are making decisions based not on clinical need, but on financial considerations.</p>
	<p pid="a.119.3/16">There is also a lack of awareness about payment for treatment. I have heard of several cases in which patients have had some work done and there have been significant delays in carrying out the rest of the work. Appointments have been made for three months later, so patients have incurred a charge a second time, even though there was a perfectly good reason for doing the work on the first visit or within the three-month time scale.</p>
	<p pid="a.119.3/17">The new contract encourages dentists to offer cheaper alternatives and to drag out treatment time, rather than to provide the most appropriate treatment as quickly as possible. I therefore hope that I shall receive some assurances from the Minister on raising patient awareness, and some commitment to assessing the impact of the new contract on the provision and availability of dental appliances under the new NHS contract.</p>

	<p pid="a.121.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1707" name="John Leech">the hon. Member for Manchester, Withington (Mr. Leech)</phrase> on raising this significant issue. Dental health is an important part of our public health strategy. There have been major improvements in oral health in recent years. Between 1978 and 1998, the proportion of adults with no natural teeth, who need full dentures, declined from37 to 11 per cent. However, as the hon. Gentleman pointed out, a reliable supply of well-made dental appliances remains essential to the delivery of high-quality dental care, which is where the dental laboratories can make their contribution.</p>
	<p pid="a.121.0/2">As the hon. Gentleman said, there are about 2,000 dental laboratories in England, which manufacture dental appliances, including dentures, bridges and crowns, to a dentist's prescription. Last December, I met members of the Dental Laboratories Association, which represents most of those laboratories, and we discussed the reforms in some detail. Following that, I invited the association to join the implementation group that I have established to review the new commissioning arrangements and to help to ensure that they are achieving their objectives.</p>
	<p pid="a.121.0/3">The hon. Gentleman talked about the new contract and the result of it. In his constituency, only one contract was rejected, which represented 0.7 per cent. of NHS activity. The point about the new system is that the money that would previously have been given to a dentist who did not take up the contract is now available for recommissioning locally, so his local primary care trust should be using that money to recommission dentistry. We saw from the pilots that over a longer period it is often possible for freed-up capacity, resulting from the new ways of working, to be used to take on extra people, so that more people can see an NHS dentist.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-06-28a.124.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1544" speakername="Rosie Winterton" colnum="124"  time="016:09:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060628/halltext/60628h0256.htm#06062860000521">
	<p pid="a.124.1/1">I do not agree. I do not believe that, as the new system to monitor activity beds down, there will be a vast falling off over time, because there is the ability to look at both the prescribing of appliances and the patient profile.</p>
	<p pid="a.124.1/2">It is important to put all those things together and say that we should pay the dentist to look after the holistic needs of the patients, not just for each filling and so on. Dentists should look at the patient and decide what is best. If what is not clinically appropriate is prescribed, that is wrong. We should be prescribing what is clinically appropriate, including appliances. That, combined with the monitoring, through the UDA system, of the work that dentists are carrying out should ensure that the same number of appliances are prescribed.</p>
	<p pid="a.124.1/3">However, I have been keen to monitor the effect of the reforms. That is why we have established an implementation group to ensure that the new commissioning objectives that we have set out are met. The Dental Laboratories Association is on that review group, which will be given information on prescribing patterns since <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-01">1 April</phrase> as soon as we have sufficient data to establish any trends. I am not sure what the hon. Gentleman was referring to in relation to May&mdash;with the new contract coming in, there would not have been enough time to notice any difference by then&mdash;but we expect to have something by September.</p>
	<p pid="a.124.1/4">If the data show that dentists are not prescribing all the dental appliances for which their patients have a clinical need, we will be able to obtain further information from patient inspections conducted by the dental reference service, which is an important part of the protections that the hon. Gentleman seeks. The DRS is a team of experienced dentists who are charged with ensuring that NHS dental treatment is necessary and carried out to satisfactory standards.</p>
	<p pid="a.124.1/5">Each year, DRS dentists examine more than 80,000 randomly selected patients. The DRS might be asked to target patients who have undergone extensive courses of treatment under band 2 to see whether an appliance such as a bridge or crown has been clinically indicated but not given, or patients in band 3 to ensure that an appliance has been appropriately prescribed.</p>
	<p pid="a.124.1/6">That gives a measure whereby we can say whether there are any indications that the prescribing of appliances is not taking place as we think it should be. That is another measure&mdash;this time at the national level&mdash;to ensure a check. So, there is a check at the patient level, the PCT level and the national level.</p>
	<p pid="a.124.1/7">I understand the points that the hon. Gentleman made. I hope that I have reassured him that we have not taken the representations from the dental laboratories lightly.</p>

	<p pid="a.126.1/1">I am grateful for the opportunity to debate this issue. First, congratulations are in order to the Department of Trade and Industry and the Government on giving such high priority to energy issues and the question of Britain's future energy provision. In this era of increasing emissions and climate change, taking steps now to reduce the negative effects of our energy consumption has never been so important.</p>
	<p pid="a.126.1/2">Today, I want to draw attention to an aspect of our energy policy that I believe has been overlooked and which has the potential to inflict serious damage on one of the greener industries in the UK. The renewables obligation, introduced in 2002, requires all commercial electricity suppliers to generate a specific and increasing proportion of their energy from renewable energy sources.</p>
	<p pid="a.126.1/3">A supplier can demonstrate compliance with the obligation by the redemption of renewables obligation certificates, which are issued to accredited generators for each megawatt-hour of eligible generation. Alternatively, suppliers can pay a buy-out price, originally set at&pound;30 per megawatt-hour but subsequently adjusted in accordance with the retail prices index. Renewables obligation certificates can be traded and provide a financial incentive for generators to reduce their dependence on fossil fuels. It is laudable that the renewables obligation is stimulating the growth of the renewable energy market and encouraging Britain's more conventional electricity generators to consider alternative technologies and methods as well as contributing financially to their development. I understand that the renewables obligation has been particularly successful in driving the development of onshore wind technology.</p>
	<p pid="a.126.1/4">An unintended consequence of the obligation and the financial support that it offers to electricity generators is that it threatens the survival of the UK's wood panel industry by introducing subsidised competition for the same timber resources that are the lifeblood of that industry. Panel producers use as raw material timber-based materials including sustainable forest products, sawmilling products such as chips and sawdust and post-consumer recycled wood to produce chipboard, oriented strand board and medium density fibreboard, or MDF, which, as you might remember, Mr. Cook, was popularised by the BBC's &quot;Changing Rooms&quot; in the DIY boom of the late 1990s. On the other hand, you might not remember.</p>
	<p pid="a.126.1/5">Aside from DIY, the main markets for the industry's products are furniture production and construction, and with a turnover of more than &pound;650 million the UK's eight manufacturing facilities produce nearly 3.5 million cu m annually. Together, UK wood panel manufacturers supply between 70 and 80 per cent. of our national market. It is a high-volume, capital-intensive industry, and it directly and indirectly employs about 7,000 people, several hundred of them in my constituency at Kronospan.</p>
	<p pid="a.126.1/6">Next to the sawmill industry, wood panel manufacturers are the largest consumers of wood raw materials sourced from UK sustainable forestry and reprocess some90 per cent. of available recycled wood into boards, promoting carbon storage while preventing a reusable resource from going to landfill. Those timber-based raw materials are in greater demand than might be imagined since the introduction of the renewables obligation. Some UK generators have turned to the same timber products as a valuable source of biomass fuel. In fact, I was on a Welsh Affairs Committee visit in Aberthaw power station when we were considering energy in Wales, and I saw mounds of perfectly clean sawdust being burned in the power station, mixed with coal.</p>
	<p pid="a.126.1/7">Other fossil fuels can also be used in conjunction with wood and sawdust. In return, the power stations get renewables obligation certificates that, as I described earlier, can be sold on to other electricity providers at a higher price than producing the electricity itself offers. It is a profitable way of generating electricity and the UK energy industry has caught on. The award of renewables obligation certificates to coal-firing generators has risen by 392 per cent. in the past two years and now represents one fifth of all certificates that have been issued.</p>
	<p pid="a.126.1/8">The point is not the use of fuel, which has gone on since mankind inhabited caves, but the provision of financial support for the use of a raw material that is known to be essential for use in product manufacture by a generating technology that is not new and in which relatively little investment is required for co-firing. The issue, therefore, is about scale and the potential for wood-supply distortions as a consequence of co-fired power stations moving towards an increased use of UK-sourced wood.</p>
	<p pid="a.126.1/9">One study funded by the Minister's Department shows that, with the aid of subsidy, co-fired power stations have acquired the potential to outbid the panel industry in the price that it can economically pay for its wood raw material. That potential also exists with purpose-built, biomass power stations, but to a lesser degree. Such competition has the effect of forcing up the price, which on the one hand may provide a needed benefit for forestry, but which equally erodes the competitiveness of wood processing industries.</p>
	<p pid="a.126.1/10">The wood panel industry operates on low margins and is subject to significant foreign competition, so its ability to pay more for that resource is therefore limited. It is also struggling at the moment with energy prices, as are many energy-intensive industries. If the wood panel industry and, potentially, other wood-processing industries were to be forced out of business, the consequences for the forest-based supply industry and downstream users could be severe.</p>
	<p pid="a.126.1/11">Timber supply is not something that can be quickly or easily increased. I am informed that on paper there should be more than enough wood available in the UK to supply both the existing industries and the developing wood fuel market. Much of the potential biomass is not, however, either economically or physically available due to ownership, terrain and infrastructure issues. Furthermore, most combustion plant is restrictive as to the specification of fuel that can be burned.</p>
	<p pid="a.126.1/12">The statistics that we have on wood availability show that there is already tightness in the supply of sawmill product. As a consequence, price rises have been incurred and wood panel producers are reporting lower than average availability of small roundwood. In that context, it is worth noting that Drax Power, for instance, has been sourcing wood from the Kielder forest, a key source of supply for wood panel producers. There is little scope for the amount of wood types quoted earlier to expand in the present climate, and importing wood for wood panel manufacturing is not an option. We will end up importing wood panels, to the detriment of our industry and our balance of payments.</p>
	<p pid="a.126.1/13">I understand that co-firing has been supported in order to stimulate the development of the energy crop market, which is an extremely commendable aim but, unfortunately, to date it has been less than successful. In the absence of significant volumes of energy crop on the ground, and with questions being asked about the sustainability of importing biomass fuels for co-firing, what biomass fuel would generators turn to?</p>
	<p pid="a.126.1/14">The wood panel industry fears that, as suggested by the terms of reference of the co-firing review, if co-firing were to be encouraged further to provide a greater contribution towards renewable energy objectives, the potential would be there for the rapid demise of the wood panel industry because there would be a period before sufficient energy crop was available when demand for timber would outstrip supply. It is an esoteric point, but it is essential that the Government grasp it because of the dire consequences for the industry if they do not.</p>
	<p pid="a.126.1/15">I will not dwell on the environmental case, but although co-firing with biomass might be more environmentally sustainable than sole reliance on fossil fuels, it still pollutes more than alternative sustainable technologies. Co-firing is also extremely inefficient, with combustion efficiencies only 33 to 37 per cent. when co-fired with coal. Co-firing is marginally cleaner than reliance on fossil fuels, but not so green that UK energy policy can afford to turn the lights out on a responsible and environmentally conscious industry such as the wood panel industry.</p>
	<p pid="a.126.1/16">On support mechanisms, the renewables obligation had an objective to support the development of new technologies, which is surely not a claim applicable to co-firing. Although it is understood that the RO has failed in a number of respects, I ask whether it is an appropriate mechanism for the support of co-firing, especially as the energy sector could receive substantial benefit from carbon credits awarded under the EU emissions-trading scheme. To compound the problem, in the future if the large combustion plant directive encourages co-fired power stations to convert to 100 per cent. biomass, demand for UK wood waste supplies could far outstrip supply. Without substantive action taken now, the wood panel industry's days are numbered.</p>
	<p pid="a.126.1/17">The current strain placed on the wood fibre market could be alleviated considerably by reducing the general obligation for biomass combustion in co-firing, and at the same time removing barriers and further incentivising energy crops such as short-rotation coppice or miscanthus. More energy crops would mitigate against the potential crisis faced by the wood panel industry and further incentivise existing energy generators to convert to sustainable sources of biomass. It is clear that energy crops must be encouraged if energy generators and the wood panel industry are to co-exist.</p>
	<p pid="a.126.1/18">There are a great many possible solutions to the problem that would allow the renewable energy sector and the wood panel industry to flourish alongside one another. Providing push incentives for the supply side of the equation as well as pull incentives is worthy of consideration. In terms of broader biomass policy, I am told that many millions of tonnes of biomass currently go to landfill, and I wonder what consideration is being given to using that discarded material as a fuel.</p>
	<p pid="a.126.1/19">As I said, one of the UK's leading wood panel manufacturers is based in my constituency. Kronospan employs 670 people in very good jobs and has the largest single site in the UK. In 1999, it won the Queen's award for environmental achievement in industry and during the past five years improved its own energy efficiency by 20 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="a.126.1/20">The impacts are beginning to be felt. Indeed, for the first time since the company has been at the site&mdash;some 29 years, I believe&mdash;it had to stop for four days over Christmas. Normally, it is a 365-day operation. Although there may be technical or other reasons why decisions may be made that some co-fired generators will not burn wood, there is no restriction in policy terms to prevent the scenarios that I have alluded to from occurring. Without a thorough examination of the issues and a review of the co-firing rules in the renewables obligation, the Minister's undertaking to minimise the potential for a negative impact on co-firing and other industries that use biomass as feedstock is not achievable, and the 670 jobs at Kronospan might well be lost, along with 6,500 others nationwide. That is as needless as it would be regrettable. What is most evident is that whatever the Government do, they cannot do nothing.</p>

	<p pid="a.129.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1505" name="Martyn Jones">my hon. Friend the Member for Clwyd, South (Mr. Jones)</phrase> on securing this debate on behalf of his constituents. I know that he has pursued the issue with great vigour and has had meetings with Ministers and officials in my Department about it.</p>
	<p pid="a.129.0/2">The debate highlights the tensions and potential conflicts that can arise when we pursue priorities for energy policy and sustainability alongside what I have responsibility for, which is maintaining and encouraging the continuation and development of our manufacturing base. I shall try to respond to some of the issues that my hon. Friend raised, particularly the concerns that the wood panel sector has about the impact of co-firing on the cost of its raw materials. We must consider those issues in the context of the tension between our broader sustainability agenda and our manufacturing policy.</p>
	<p pid="a.129.0/3">The wood panel industry is important. In preparing for the debate today, I learned a great deal about it. Its contribution is growing, because it provides a sustainable solution to many of our problems. Wood panels are used in a range of the Government's capital projects, whether housing, hospitals or schools, and as individual consumers we use wood panels in our homes. We therefore want to maintain the British base. The wood panel industry has undertaken a great deal of good work in modernising its construction methods, and we want to hold on to that. For example, it has been involved in initiatives such as prefabricated building modules for housing, which now make a considerable contribution to the housing market, accounting for an 8 per cent. share. The timber frame sector is helping to produce housing more quickly and at a better cost using the engineered beams to which my hon. Friend referred, which are made from chip and oriented strand board and offer structural components that can compete directly with steel and concrete. That is all good stuff that we want to hang on to. Combined with chipboard decking, that offers an off-site manufactured flooring solution, which is becoming increasingly popular and is now the material of choice for carpeting, flooring, decking and shuttered applications, so a lot of good stuff is going on.</p>
	<p pid="a.129.0/4">Let us consider the wood panel industry in the round. It makes a significant contribution to the United Kingdom economy. Its turnover is nearly&pound;1 billion, with a gross added value of &pound;275 million. My hon. Friend said that 7,000 people are employed in the industry; the figure that I have is 6,000, but the number of people involved is certainly substantial. We are conscious that increasingly the industry is having to compete. We import more than we export&mdash;we import about &pound;800 million worth of goods and we export&pound;100 million of goods. That gives us some idea that the cost pressures arising from reasonable developments in sustainable energy can have a big impact and provide a genuine threat. I recognise that from what my hon. Friend has said.</p>
	<p pid="a.129.0/5">Why are we in the present situation? Our drive to ensure a sustainable economy has led us to look for new ways in which to provide sustainable energy. We are striving to achieve not only a sustainable innovative and productive economy that delivers high levels of employment and manufacturing activity, but a society that promotes sustainable communities and personal well-being. We want that to be delivered in ways that protect and enhance the physical and natural environment and use our resources and energy as efficiently as possible. We need to reconcile those competing objectives and build them as interlinked ambitions.</p>
	<p pid="a.129.0/6">Economic growth is obviously as vital today as it has always been, but we face new environmental challenges. They become particularly potent in the global world as many other countries expand their industries at a time when the global environment is struggling to cope with the impact of existing economic and manufacturing activity. In that context, undoubtedly our consumption of natural resources throughout the world is unsustainable. We need to be more far-sighted in respect of the solutions to the environmental challenges that we face.</p>
	<p pid="a.129.0/7">In that context, recycling inevitably plays a major part in the solution. Wood is a versatile product. It has economic value; it is used in buildings, where the panel industry plays its part; and, when it is finished with, it can be recycled, re-used or burned and the energy recovered. In addition, the wood industry sustains jobs. We are therefore considering competing uses of jobs, wood as a source of sustainable energy and wood providing the products that we want and need.</p>
	<p pid="a.129.0/8">Let me draw attention to our commitments under &quot;Kyoto and Beyond&quot; in respect of the threats of environmental change. As my hon. Friend will know, we set ourselves the tough target of reducing carbon emissions by 20 per cent. by 2010. In our 2003 energy White Paper, we flagged up the important role that biomass can play in that. We expect that it may become one of the largest contributors to our renewables generation mix. Through our policies, that is what we are hoping to use to meet the target of 20 per cent. of electricity produced from renewables by 2020. In our response to the report of the Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution on biomass as a renewable energy source, which was published in 2004, we agreed that biomass has the potential to make a significant contribution to the reduction of carbon dioxide levels, if it is substituted for fossil fuel in the generation of heat and electricity.</p>
	<p pid="a.129.0/9">How can we achieve those objectives and reconcile them? We need to expand the biomass industry. We have set ourselves targets and, to achieve them, we need to increase the amount of energy cropping by as much as 125,000 hectares, not including crops that might be developed for transport use&mdash;biofuels, biodiesel and the like. With colleagues in the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, we are actively encouraging the development of biomass crops and directly supporting the planting of short rotation coppices using willow and miscanthus&mdash;a species of woody, perennial grasses that came from Asia. The Government agreed with the royal commission that an integrated approach is needed to ensure that our industrial, agricultural and environmental policies cohere effectively to ensure maximum, optimum benefits from our biomass energy.</p>
	<p pid="a.129.0/10">The renewables obligation, to which my hon. Friend referred, was introduced in 2002. It provides a substantial market incentive for all eligible forms of renewable energy by providing support for biomass in the form of renewables obligation capital grants for biomass heat and power generation, planting grants for establishing energy crops, set-up costs for producer groups to harvest and market biomass, and certificates that can be claimed under the renewables obligation if biomass is co-fired with coal. By the end of 2004, generation from renewable sources eligible under the renewables obligation stood at 3.1 per cent. of the UK's electricity supply. In the 2003 energy White Paper, we committed to review the obligation in 2005-06. That review is not a fundamental rethink of our renewables policy but an opportunity to look at amendments to improve the effectiveness of the obligation in certain areas. We published a preliminary consultation document, setting out the Government's proposed policy, on which we sought stakeholders' views in March 2005. We followed that with a statutory consultation document, published in September 2005, in which we set out our proposed policy and sought views on the specific changes.</p>
	<p pid="a.129.0/11">One outcome of &quot;Renewable Obligations&quot;, the DTI review, was the lowering of the biomass purity requirement from 98 to 90 per cent to bring more waste woods, which are currently sent to landfill, to be burned. That seems wasteful&mdash;my hon. Friend said that he had seen clean materials going into landfill&mdash;but I am told that biomass material goes to landfill because it is too contaminated for either processing into other products or burning. However, I shall look again at that matter, because it is an important means by which we could try to make progress. As my hon. Friend knows, interest in co-firing has exceeded the10 per cent. cap that came into effect in April this year. There is also growing interest in clean coal and carbon capture and storage, which form a significant part of our long-term generation mix. We are looking again at co-firing as part of the ongoing energy review. We are focusing on the potential contribution that it can make to our energy policy goals and the level of support that it will require. I am conscious that that may create additional problems for my hon. Friend and the industry that he seeks to support in the debate today.</p>
	<p pid="a.129.0/12">We understand the importance of investor confidence in the renewables obligation. We have said that a careful assessment of the impact of any changes on other renewable technologies and other biomass-using industries will be a key factor in that review. I can give him that commitment. When we have published the energy review, which is on course to be published in July before the recess, we will make a high-level statement on co-firing. If we decide to propose changes in respect of co-firing or any of the other matters, we will have a full consultation. I urge my hon. Friend to discuss the matter further with the Minister for Energy.</p>
	<p pid="a.129.0/13">The Wood Panels Industry Federation has made a significant contribution to the energy review and representatives have met the Minister for Energy. My hon. Friend the Member for Clwyd, South has also met and consulted officials from the renewable policy and development section of the Department of Trade and Industry and voiced the concerns that he has expressed today about co-firing. Those views will certainly be taken into account. We are trying to take a tough set of decisions to reconcile our objectives, as I hope he appreciates.</p>
	<p pid="a.129.0/14">We are also talking to our colleagues at DEFRA in a biomass taskforce and trying to put together what is described as a biomass action plan, to grow that industry. We hope to publish that document next year. Clearly, if we can get that part of our policy better, that will help us to reconcile the manufacturing and the sustainable energy objectives for which we are striving.</p>
	<p pid="a.129.0/15">DEFRA has also been looking into the use of non-food crops for more sustainable improved homes; it will publish the findings of that study in November. There will always be a conflict, as I am sure my hon. Friend appreciates, between balancing all the aspects of our economic, social and environmental ambitions. It would be unreasonable to prejudge the outcome of the consultations, but I hope that I can reassure my hon. Friend that the concerns raised by the industry, many of them through him, are being listened to. I assure him then we come to implement policies flowing from the energy review, the effects on the wood panel sector will be taken into account. I hope that in that context, my hon. Friend can engage with the Department, and with relevant Ministers, to ensure that he can continue to protect an industry and a factory in his constituency that undoubtedly makes an important contribution not only by providing local people with jobs, but by providing more modern ways of construction, which are themselves sustainable, so meeting one of our objectives.</p>
	<p pid="a.129.0/16" class="italic">Question put and agreed to.</p>
	<p pid="a.129.0/17" class="italic">Adjourned accordingly at three minutes to Five o'clock.</p>
