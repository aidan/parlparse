	<p pid="a.164.0/1">I congratulate the hon. Gentleman on bringing a most important subject to the attention of the House. He mentioned carbon capture and storage but moved on very quickly, although I am sure that he will return to the subject. Does he share my slight disappointment that although we could lead the world in that technology, our demonstration plant will not come on line until 2014 or, given how the Government have invested in it, be commercially viable until 2020? That is just too long, and I want it brought forward so that we can use the coal that we have in this country.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-03-17a.165.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1427" speakername="David Anderson" colnum="165"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090317/halltext/90317h0001.htm#09031745000504">
	<p pid="a.165.2/1">I do, and I shall come on to that. My hon. Friend will not be surprised to know that they are not very stable.</p>
	<p pid="a.165.2/2">In 2007, we imported 43 million tonnes of coal, of which 22 million, more than half, came from Russia. Responding to a question that I raised, the Minister with responsibility for coal said that the value of those imports was &pound;2.072 billion. So, we have exported more than &pound;2 billion of our money to bring in foreign coal. The cost to our balance of payments has been a massive &pound;2 billion, and our dependence on Russian coal is both startling and frightening. This whole debate is about how green we are, and it is not very green to transport millions of tonnes of coal halfway around the world.</p>
	<p pid="a.165.2/3">The real scandal and even greater cost, however, is the human cost, because that coal is covered in blood. More than 5,000 deaths a year occur in the coal mines of China: four deaths for every 1 million tonnes of coal that are mined. That is bad. But it is even worse in Ukraine, where the death rate is seven deaths per 1 million tonnes. To put those figures into perspective, the last time the death rates in the UK industry were as high as those in China was in the 1920s, and we have to go back to the 1880s to find rates as high as those in Ukraine. Hon. Members should consider what life was like in the 1880s in the places that they represent, compared with now. That is what we are talking about. That is why we are subsidising coal. We have done away with British Coal&mdash;the cleanest, safest coal industry in the world&mdash;and we are relying on cheap imports based on death and dying. There is blood on the coal; there is no doubt about it. We are doing this for cost.</p>
	<p pid="a.165.2/4">I should like hon. Members to think about something tonight when they go home. On walking into their houses or flats, putting the light on, turning the television on and turning the heating up and even putting the electric blanket on if it is cold, they should just think that tonight 20 Chinese miners will not be going home&mdash;not tonight; not ever again. That is the cost of importing coal into this country. There will be more deaths than that in Ukraine.</p>
	<p pid="a.165.2/5">About 10 years ago there was a potential disaster at a mine called Quecreek in Somerset county, Pennsylvania. Guys were trapped underground in an air pocket and, thankfully, thanks to bore holes being drilled, they were rescued. But for three days the whole world held its breath. There were nine men involved. Twice that many will die in China today, on average. That is what we are talking about.</p>
	<p pid="a.165.2/6">If we were talking about importing leather footballs made by kids, perfumes that had been tested on animals or cheap T-shirts from sweatshops, we would say, &quot;No, this is disgraceful.&quot; But it is coal, so nobody cares. Well, somebody cares. I was approached by one of the boiler manufacturers this morning by e-mail, saying, &quot;Do you think it's wise to mention the true cost of importing coal?&quot; I think it is wise; it is a moral question for our Government. We have to answer the question: &quot;Are we happy to carry on burning coal that has been produced in that way?&quot; It does not have to be like that. This country was like that. In the 1930s, a miner was killed every six hours in this country, but by the height of the mining industry in the 1970s and 80s, the numbers were down almost into single figures. Yes, mining will always be a dangerous occupation and people realise that, but with the proper investment and technology it can be made much safer in every sense. That is the reality.</p>

	<p pid="a.167.2/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend on securing this excellent Adjournment debate. I am sure that he is aware of the Welsh Affairs Committee report on energy, in which there is a strong recommendation that endorses all the points that he makes, particularly in relation to carbon capture technology. The report emphasises that to exploit this coal we need to invest not only in carbon capture technology, but in skills, including higher-level skills, and mining degrees. Has he undertaken any survey of what is available in terms of skills training across the UK and would he endorse my view that it is underdeveloped and needs to be focused on particularly by the UK Government and the devolved Administrations?</p>

	<p pid="a.167.3/1">That is a key question. The average age of miners in this country is 49 and the skills will be lost when they go. We have raised that issue with the Secretary of State and he is clear that, if we are going to have a mining industry, we have to look at the skills level. The truth is that the National Coal Board had some of the best training facilities anywhere in the world, which led to our having the safest, most technologically advanced coal industry in the world, as I said earlier. That is a major issue, whatever we choose to do.</p>
	<p pid="a.167.3/2">We cannot close the energy gap without coal, wherever we get it from, and we must burn coal more cleanly, which means investing in carbon capture and storage. There is, as was mentioned earlier, a proposed demonstration project out for tender. But everyone in the industry that I speak to is saying, &quot;When's it going to happen and will it be enough? Is it going to be big enough.&quot; One demonstration project will not show the way. We must get on as quickly as possible with demonstration projects. We should also give further support, particularly, as I have mentioned, to some of the initiatives in the north-east and certainly the positive one advanced by Yorkshire Forward, linking with Hatfield colliery in the Secretary of State's constituency, which will allow the infrastructure that is already in place to bring oil and gas out of the North sea to be used to take carbon back out and store it under the North sea. We can lead the world on this if we get our act together; if we do not, we will be left behind.</p>

	<p pid="a.168.1/1">The hon. Gentleman is correct. Everybody accepts that the technology will work. However, it has not been tested on the scale that we need. It all comes back to a discussion that we had before about where the investment is coming from. A private stakeholder in BP would probably say, &quot;I don't want you investing in clean coal and carbon capture. I want you to go out and exploit some more Chinese miners or get some cheap gas from somewhere else in the world and we will drag it round the world in tankers.&quot; But as serious, legitimate people who are worried about the impact on our country in terms of stability, security, jobs and climate, we must say, &quot;Sorry, but these things do not add up&quot;. We must say to the investors that we as a Government will play our part, and we will not ask but insist that they do what is necessary, or we will not work with them.</p>

	<p pid="a.170.0/1">The hon.

Member for Blaydon (Mr. Anderson)</phrase>, who referred extensively to carbon capture and storage. I want to reinforce the point that the technology exists. Almost four years ago, the then Select Committee on science and technology produced a report with evidence showing that political will and investment were required from the Government to get it moving. It is not something that we are discovering today, because the Select Committee said that nearly four years ago.</p>

	<p pid="a.171.0/1">I shall come to locational charging in a second. We talked earlier about importing coal from Russia and China and the impact that that has on the people who exploit the coal in those countries. We do not have locational charging for the coal that comes from Russia or China. Why do we not have an extra charge for the importation of that coal from other countries, so that we can get some balance in the system and not compete on the lowest cost throughout the world? Ofgem does not have responsibility worldwide, so it will not implement such a scheme, but we need to consider the effect that importing cheap coal from other countries has on the industry in this country. That is why I would like to see some recognition of the cost of importing that coal&mdash;the transportation costs from other countries&mdash;so that we are not penalising mines in this country and over-supporting mines in other countries. We have hundreds of years of coal under our feet, and we need to consider exactly how we will exploit it sustainably for the future.</p>
	<p pid="a.171.0/2">I am deeply concerned about locational charging in the United Kingdom. The crude formula exaggerates the impact of the costs of transmission of energy up and down the country. I am not necessarily against some form of transmission charge or locational charge, because we need to reflect the fact that energy is lost as it is transported down the line, but to have such an extreme formula, which penalises in an extreme form energy plants and emerging renewable power resources in Scotland is unfortunate. It will restrict renewable energy resources and potentially hamper investment in new technology at Longannet and other power stations in Scotland.</p>
	<p pid="a.171.0/3">I would like Ofgem to change the formula to reflect the fact that those power stations already exist and that we can invest in new technologies that have greater potential to allow the United Kingdom to be energy secure. If we continue the way we are going, we shall destroy the economic case for plants such as Longannet, and we will not have the supplies that we need in 10 or 15 years' time, when we will be short of energy supplies before renewables are up and running at full speed and before we have been able to exploit new technology. I would like Ofgem to reflect on the exaggerated effect that the formula has on the plants that already exist in Scotland.</p>
	<p pid="a.171.0/4">The figure for Longannet is staggering. It costs an additional &pound;30 million to run Longannet power station because it is in Fife in Scotland as compared with Cornwall. It would be better to put it on a barge and ship it all the way down to Cornwall. It would be cheaper to run it on that basis than to continue to operate on the current basis&mdash;a super-barge would be needed to get it down there. It shows how farcical the situation is that a plant that already exists and that is the second-biggest coal-fired power station in the United Kingdom is penalised in such a way. It does not reflect the fact that the power station exists&mdash;it cannot just be knocked down and put somewhere else. I would like Ofgem to reflect on that and to have a much more sensible, balanced approach that does not penalise either renewables or plants such as Longannet in Scotland.</p>
	<p pid="a.171.0/5">Let me return to carbon capture. Chris Davies, an MEP in the European Parliament, deserves credit for the work that he has done to secure, through the emissions trading scheme, about &euro;9 billion-worth of funding for new carbon capture technology, which will boost the future of coal in the United Kingdom. That funding will ensure that we invest significant sums in developing the technology, which could be developed into something much more efficient at a later stage. I am pleased that significant sums will be invested in carbon capture technology by way of the emissions trading scheme through the European Parliament and the work of Chris Davies.</p>
	<p pid="a.171.0/6">There is a farcical situation at Longannet, because the Scottish Environment Protection Agency does not allow the power station to burn the coal that remains within the ash. There is a company called ScotAsh that takes the ash from the power station and turns it into grouts and cements. The ash has coal in it, and the coal can be extracted, but SEPA does not allow the power station to burn it, because it is regarded as waste. That is a complete farce&mdash;a complete misreading of the regulations. I hope that SEPA reflects on that and allows Longannet and other power stations in Scotland to burn that coal, which is being wasted. Tonnes of coal are sitting around and cannot be exploited. They are currently treated as waste, which is a situation that should be changed. If we are to secure coal for the future, we need to ensure that we overcome those barriers. If we do not, we will not be able to fill the energy gap that is coming down the track very fast.</p>

His central theme is that coal&mdash;particularly indigenous coal&mdash;is part of a balanced UK energy policy, and he is right to stress the importance of coal.</p>
	<p pid="a.172.0/2">The only plant being built at the moment, save for renewables, is new gas plant. I am concerned about the fact that the dash for gas continues. The Department's own estimate suggests that a worst-case scenario is that by 2020, 80 per cent. of our electricity could be generated from gas, 90 per cent. of which could be imported from places such as Algeria and Russia. There are real issues about security of supply.</p>
	<p pid="a.172.0/3">My hon. Friend also talked about the health and safety record in the coal industry and he is right to talk about blood on imported coal. I just add one caveat: after years in which there were no fatalities in the mining industry in the United Kingdom, there have now been several. That is a stark reminder of the fact that men still give their health and their lives to keep us warm.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-03-17a.173.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1815" speakername="Paddy Tipping" colnum="173"  time="010:05:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090317/halltext/90317h0002.htm#09031745000526">
	<p pid="a.173.0/1">I am sure that that is correct, but I just add a caveat to say that things have gone backwards rather than forwards.</p>
	<p pid="a.173.0/2">Two challenges face the coal industry: the economy and the environment. I shall talk about both briefly. British miners are the most efficient in Europe. We ought to be backing them, not continuing to lay them off. There are immediate prospects for the UK deep coal industry. My hon. and learned Friend the Minister knows about the discussions on Harworth, where UK Coal is sounding new ground and looking for new reserves. I think that it will be successful. The difficulties are in funding that new development.</p>
	<p pid="a.173.0/3">The company and the trade unions tell me that the cost of the development will be about &pound;200 million. The Minister and his officials are well aware of that. Given the economic situation, the prospect of borrowing &pound;200 million from the banks is remote, but there are other opportunities.</p>
	<p pid="a.173.0/4">The European Investment Bank has been talked about. There have been initial discussions with the EIB, but they are not going well. The more support the Government can give UK Coal in its discussions with Europe, the better. Europe is not an obstacle in this; there have been subsidies from Europe in the past. Of course, the EIB lends on commercial terms. The more the Government can do to help that, the better, but at the end of the day there may be difficulties with money from the EIB. That means that there needs to be a discussion&mdash;I know that there have been preliminary talks&mdash;about the notion of the Government acting as a guarantor in some way. We are serious about the fact that indigenous coal can help us with security of supply.</p>
	<p pid="a.173.0/5">There need to be meaningful discussions with UK Coal about the prospect of underwriting. We are doing that in other industries, and the coal industry has a long tradition in that respect; indeed, the Minister is well aware of that because he represents a mining community and has been in direct discussions with UK Coal and the trade unions. We should at least consider such a proposal, and do so fairly quickly, because as my hon. Friend the Member for Blaydon said, the prospects at Welbeck are limited. Ideally, we should transfer the men who work there to the new Harworth prospects, because that would make sense.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-03-17a.175.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1844" speakername="William Cash" colnum="175"  time="010:15:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090317/halltext/90317h0002.htm#09031745000533">
	<p pid="a.175.3/1">One reason why I am still vice-chairman of the all-party group on coalfield communities is that I really believe in it. I do not want to get too nostalgic, but when I was a young boy in Sheffield, I used to go to Woodhouse on the outskirts of the city to play cricket at Welbeck. I played cricket and rugger with miners&mdash;that is the environment I grew up in. I therefore have a strong sense not only of the social side of things, which the hon. Gentleman correctly mentioned, but of the economic consequences.</p>
	<p pid="a.175.3/2">Everything that has been said about the reserves and carbon capture is on the record, and I do not need to repeat it. The Minister knows me quite well and he will forgive me for using quite strong language, but I condemn the Government for not really having got their act together on CCS. We have heard about Kingsnorth, and perhaps I can slightly modify what has been said and put it in an encouraging way by saying that we should really start pitching in to ensure that we move things forward.</p>
	<p pid="a.175.3/3">Why should this be done by companies from abroad? We used to be at the forefront of coal technology, and we still have people with the ability to think about the matter and to do the research. The company E.ON is almost a case in point. It is alarming that we should effectively be in the hands of other countries when it comes to development. We ought to be developing our indigenous resources. We have the brains and the know-how, and we have the tradition. We should be doing it ourselves.</p>
	<p pid="a.175.3/4">As my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1913" name="Charles Hendry">the Member for Wealden (Charles Hendry)</phrase> knows, I have grave concerns about our being an integral part of the European Union energy policy. I have said why I was so much against the fact that the Germans had those unbelievable subsidies when we had none. It is all part of a package. Will the House please understand that, and that we are not being given anything, and never have been given anything, under the arrangements of the European Coal and Steel Community or subsequently, despite what was said by one MEP about the amount of money being put back through interventions. The fact is that many of those policies should be developed to ensure our indigenous security policy.</p>
	<p pid="a.175.3/5">I mentioned earlier, and I repeat the fact, that this is also a foreign policy question. If we consider Gazprom and Mr. Schr&ouml;der, and how these things are organised&mdash;we do not have time to go into all that today&mdash;we can see that it is a big landscape. Energy security lies at the heart of national security. We therefore need a proper balance. I do not mean that we should not co-operate with other countries in Europe; I am often misunderstood on that point. Co-operation is one thing, but to have a common energy policy through European government is another story. I must ask people to consider the fact that, for new coal technology and energy security, we need our own policy.</p>
	<p pid="a.175.3/6">I and my party voted against the Lisbon treaty, which contains the European energy policy. I do not ask my hon. Friend to go into that today, but for heaven's sake, my party should ensure that we look after ourselves. We should co-operate with other countries, and trade with them, but we should not allow the entire energy system ultimately to fall into the hands of subsidy and over-dependence on other countries&mdash;and a system of rule-making that is governed by a Court of Justice, against which there is no effective appeal.</p>
	<p pid="a.175.3/7">I feel strongly that this has been a first-class debate and I pay tribute to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1427" name="David Anderson">the hon. Member for Blaydon (Mr. Anderson)</phrase>. I was delighted to hear that he came from Stoke-on-Trent; I did not know that.</p>

	<p pid="a.177.0/1">I echo the remarks made today in congratulating my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1427" name="David Anderson">the Member for Blaydon (Mr. Anderson)</phrase> on securing this debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.177.0/2">The volatility of global energy markets has once again pushed the case for coal to the forefront. Twenty five years ago, we could not have imagined that such a thing would ever occur. Although coal is an abundant source of energy&mdash;it is the fuel of choice in newly industrialised countries such as China and India, but without the environmental safeguards that we would expect&mdash;in Britain it is has been written off by all sides. Indeed, for many people, even those in my constituency of Islwyn in south Wales, which is a former mining area, people think that the debate belongs to a bygone era. That attitude does not reconcile itself to the fact that clean coal technology can give us a great new opportunity for using this wonderful source of energy.</p>
	<p pid="a.177.0/3">In recent years, the volatility in global energy markets has made the case for clean coal technology even more powerful. That is why I believe that the pits in south Wales that closed many years ago may still have a vital role to play in providing Britain's future energy needs. Aneurin Bevan once said:</p>
	<p pid="a.177.0/4" class="indent">&quot;This island is made mainly of coal and surrounded by fish. Only an organising genius could produce a shortage of coal and fish at the same time.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.177.0/5">Even now those words still have relevance. It is complete madness to import billions of tonnes of coal from other countries, when we are sitting on an island of coal. It is those coal reserves that we should be using to meet our future energy needs. It is common sense that we should look to ourselves to help solve some of our energy needs. However, as my mother used to say when I was growing up, &quot;Son, in life you will find that sense is not that common.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.177.0/6">Clean coal technology represents a massive opportunity not only to revive the coal industry and guarantee a market for coal, but to make us less reliant on energy from other countries&mdash;a point well made by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1844" name="William Cash">the hon. Member for Stone (Mr. Cash)</phrase>. I welcome the fact that the Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills supports the Technology Strategy Board, which has done some research on the matter. The board has identified carbon abatement technologies as being a priority. It is supporting 11 projects to the value of more than &pound;13 million. However, that is the tip of the iceberg. More needs to done, and we need to take a long-term approach to using coal in our energy policy. By a long-term approach, I do not mean a five-year strategy, but one of 20 or 30 years, if we are to recoup the benefits of clean coal technology.</p>
	<p pid="a.177.0/7">Our long-term aim surely must be to attract long-term investment for the production of coal, through clean coal technology. Such a commitment would give confidence to those who are developing the technologies through the knowledge that the Government support them. My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1815" name="Paddy Tipping">the Member for Sherwood (Paddy Tipping)</phrase> referred to support from the European Union, which is important. I once borrowed &pound;37 million from the European Investment Bank&mdash;<i>[</i><i>Interruption.</i><i>]</i> I paid it back; I do not owe it a penny. The EU is a source of support that we ought to exploit in such circumstances. We have the opportunity to become a world leader in the new technology, but for that to happen we will need investment. I am sure that we are all keen to hear the Minister's response to the debate, because it will not happen without investment and Government support; it is as simple as that.</p>
	<p pid="a.177.0/8">At the end of the day, there will be all sorts of wonderful arguments for the environment and for clean coal technology, but without the political will, it simply cannot happen. If we invest in that way, we will have the chance to revitalise the coal industry, providing jobs and helping to improve the quality of our environment. I hope that my hon. and learned Friend the Minister will take the opportunity to give an assurance that the Government are with us on this matter.</p>
	<p pid="a.177.0/9">When we reflect on what has happened during the past 25 years&mdash;the commemorations of the end of the strike and so on&mdash;it would be a tragedy and a betrayal of those men and those communities that fought so hard for that industry, who fought to keep the jobs that would keep their communities going. Many were destroyed when the pits went; it would be a betrayal of them if we fail now to say, &quot;Here is an opportunity to produce coal in a clean and safe way for our environment.&quot; It is something that we owe; it is also something that we can bequeath to a new generation. At the end of the day, it is a political decision, and I look to our Government&mdash;a Labour Government&mdash;to answer that important call.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-03-17a.178.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1831" speakername="Simon Hughes" colnum="178"  time="010:28:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090317/halltext/90317h0003.htm#09031745000537">
	<p pid="a.178.0/1">I sincerely congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1427" name="David Anderson">the hon. Member for Blaydon (Mr. Anderson)</phrase> on a timely debate. I hope that the Minister has paid heed, not least so that he can pass the message on to his colleague the Chancellor; as we come to the Budget, the Government could take positive and immediate action to respond to the debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.178.0/2">I was born at about the same time as the hon. Member for Blaydon. Then, more than 85 per cent. of the country's energy needs were met by the coal industry. The figure is now below 20 per cent. Like <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1844" name="William Cash">the hon. Member for Stone (Mr. Cash)</phrase>, I am not being wise after the event. I was a Member of the House when the Tory Government&mdash;Mr. Heseltine with the then Prime Minister's support&mdash;were seeking hugely to reduce the size of the coal industry. My colleagues and I opposed that strategy, because we believed that it was short-sighted and inappropriate.</p>
	<p pid="a.178.0/3">In those days, we were not thinking so much of CO2 emissions or environmental considerations. I was brought up in south Wales, and a large part of my younger days was spent there, so I also had clear emotional links with the coal communities and understood the importance of coal to their jobs. As my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2021" name="Willie Rennie">the Member for Dunfermline and West Fife (Willie Rennie)</phrase> has argued, the coal industry has never been unwilling to adapt, respond or make itself appropriate to the modern generation. As we debate the future of the coal industry, we should debate the energy industry as a whole and understand the interrelationship between the two.</p>
	<p pid="a.178.0/4">Last month, HSBC produced a very telling report on the extent to which many Governments and the European Union have taken the opportunity provided by the current global economic difficulties to use economic stimulus packages to advance new green technologies&mdash;the two obvious options being renewables and carbon capture and storage. The report states that the only countries to have taken the opportunity to push renewables are South Korea, France, countries in the European Union as a whole and the United States. The only countries to have done the same for carbon capture and storage are Canada, the United States and those in the European Union. The opportunity has not been taken to encourage further investment in renewables and the development of carbon capture and storage, both of which are hugely important, although I probably take a different view from the hon. Member for Stone on renewables. I hope that next month's Budget will go down both those roads and that Britain's fiscal stimulus strategy will commit to a reinvestment in the kitty for science and technology.</p>
	<p pid="a.178.0/5">I intervened on the hon. Member for Blaydon to point out that yesterday, when the very high-powered delegation from California visited the UK, it became clear that this is not a question of the inability of the technology to deliver. I think that the delegation met Ministers, or will do so later this week&mdash;it is in Brussels today and tomorrow. Of course, the process must be a gradual one, and we need demonstration plants to test the technologies&mdash;there are various options. However, plenty of evidence on this subject is available already, including, not least, a very good publication written last year by the Green Alliance, with a forward by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1533" name="Margaret Beckett">the right hon. Member for Derby, South (Margaret Beckett)</phrase>, entitled, &quot;Last Chance for Coal: Making Carbon Capture and Storage a Reality&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.178.0/6">My party, at its formal, deliberative, decision-making conferences, has made it clear that we envisage a future role for coal. However, we take a pretty hard-line view on the necessity of carbon capture and storage, and the Minister will know that we do not think that the Government should permit a new generation of coal-fired power stations without that new technology. We welcome the fact, therefore, that the Government now appear to understand that need and that the Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change has deferred the decision on the Kingsnorth application to ensure that E.ON understands it, too.</p>
	<p pid="a.178.0/7">Last year, there was interesting speculation in the press that the Government had given in to E.ON, that they would not insist on any technology in advance and that they could live with retro-fitting. However, the situation now appears otherwise, judging from recent press coverage. On <phrase class="date" code="2009-03-02">2 March</phrase>, a headline in <i>The Guardian </i>read, &quot;Decision on new coal-fired plant delayed again&quot;. The decision has been delayed until the autumn to ensure the right Government policy. I urge the Government to stand firm on these issues and to make it clear to E.ON and the rest that they must deliver a new generation of power stations with that new technology in place. That applies not only to Kingsnorth, but to other parts of the county, especially the midlands which has a significant interest in the matter, and potentially to Scotland, too. If the will is there, coal-fired power stations can come on stream with the new technology in place. However, we need that double commitment, and the Government must stand firm, although I do not doubt that there will be some tough negotiations with the industry.</p>

	<p pid="a.181.0/1">May I begin with a sincere apology to you, Miss Begg, to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1427" name="David Anderson">the hon. Member for Blaydon (Mr. Anderson)</phrase>, and to the other hon. Members in the Chamber for not being here at the opening of the debate? This is one of two energy debates currently going on&mdash;the other is a Statutory Instrument Committee. Faced with the challenge of being in two places at the same time, I ended up being in neither place at the right time, and I apologise for that. I am particularly sorry, because the speech that the hon. Gentleman gave was a wonderful example of how such a debate should be carried out: it was extremely thoughtful, it looked back at history and it considered the future potential of coal.</p>
	<p pid="a.181.0/2">The issue of coal has been one of the big dividing lines of political history. Now that there is a tremendous sense of unity, we can move forward together and agree on the important role of coal in the future. We can see a great opportunity for the UK coal mining industry, and we all hope that this is an area in which Britain can lead the world.</p>
	<p pid="a.181.0/3">I also want to pay tribute to those who work in the mines. I fought two mining seats&mdash;Clackmannan and Mansfield. In fact, I nearly became the first Conservative Member of Parliament for Mansfield. I have incredible respect for those who, day in and day out, work in the mines, and I wish to put that firmly on record. Moreover, I want to thank them for the contribution that they have made to making this a very modern industry.</p>
	<p pid="a.181.0/4">In the early 1980s, the average output per miner was about 375 tonnes per year; it is now 3,500 tonnes per year. That is an incredible contribution from the people working in the industry. I understand, too, why they often feel frustrated when we end up importing so much coal from elsewhere. We now import more coal from Russia than we produce domestically. As we have heard this morning, it is a matter of concern that more of that market is not being taken by British coal mining.</p>
	<p pid="a.181.0/5">I should also like to have a brief word about surface mining, because that is an important contributor to this debate. It is an industry that has moved on incredibly in recent years. A year or so ago, I went to a surface mine in Ayrshire to see the way in which the miners backfill. No sooner have they taken out the coal, then they are back filling the mine, replanting it and recreating the scenery that was there before. Often the scenery is enhanced by the sustainability of the habitats. Therefore, we should recognise that this is an industry that has an important contribution to make.</p>
	<p pid="a.181.0/6">As a nation, we heavily depend on coal for our energy security. Last year, coal accounted for 37 per cent. of our electricity output, and there were times when that percentage went up to 50 per cent. There is widespread agreement that coal should play an important part in our energy future.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-03-17a.182.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1913" speakername="Charles Hendry" colnum="182"  time="010:40:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090317/halltext/90317h0004.htm#09031745000546">
	<p pid="a.182.1/1">I thank my hon. Friend for his intervention and for his remarks earlier on as well. If we look to companies such as E.ON and RWE to invest in this area and build coal-fired facilities in this country, we should understand that they will not take out their investment. They will be keen to run their facilities and make the best return out of that investment that they can get. We should be willing to understand the role that international companies can play in this process.</p>
	<p pid="a.182.1/2">None the less, there is a big challenge ahead. The large combustion plant directive 2001 means that by 2016 a third of our coal-fired generation capacity should be coming out of commission. That is a massive hole that needs to be filled. As the Minister appreciates, that could come rather sooner, as there are 20,000 maximum hours of generation capacity left. Some plants are getting through that at a very fast rate, and they could have used those 20,000 hours by 2012 or 2013. They have to make active decisions now on whether they spend &pound;200 million to ensure that their plants will be compliant with the LCPD. Some within the industry say that we may need to seek a derogation from that, and I am interested to hear the Minister's view on that. If a derogation is to be sought from the LCPD, then businesses need to know that sooner rather than later. If they are spending millions and millions of pounds on something that ultimately will not be necessary, then there will be significant arguments afterwards about whether they should be compensated for such payments.</p>
	<p pid="a.182.1/3">I want to focus on carbon capture and storage. CCS is one of the most exciting technologies in the whole energy sector, and it is an area in which Britain should be leading. When the Government started talking about the matter three years ago, we were leading the world. However, in the time that we have been talking, other countries have been investing ahead of us. Germany now has a small plant working as does Alberta. Moreover, America, Australia, China and Abu Dhabi have such plants. Therefore, we have lost some of our lead, which is a matter of great concern. All of us who have spoken in this debate are giving the Minister a push and some encouragement to go further, to be braver and do a bit more to give Britain the leadership that it should have in this area.</p>
	<p pid="a.182.1/4">It was very interesting to listen to the chief executive of Kingsnorth this week. We want to see three full-scale plants operating with carbon capture and storage. We would fund the cost of the CCS technology through the receipts that Britain will receive from the next round of the European Union Emission Trading Scheme, so funding is available. CCS technology is an entirely appropriate way of using the funding and it would give a huge boost to those who are considering taking forward the investment.</p>
	<p pid="a.182.1/5">When I spoke to people involved in the sector, I found a tremendous sense of frustration. The companies involved want to move forward and do more. Companies such as Shell want to take advantage of their depleted gas fields. Within British universities, such as Imperial college and elsewhere, there are people with incredible academic ability who could make a massive contribution. However, what they are waiting for is the go-ahead from the Government. They want a real signal that we are moving forward and making changes in this area.</p>
	<p pid="a.182.1/6">Inevitably, there will be aspects and matters that only the Government can provide, such as pipeline infrastructure. If every coal-fired power station is expected to put in place its own pipeline to its own sequestration facility, that will make them unaffordable. That is a natural role where the Government can take the lead. They should put in place an oversized pipeline so that others can tap into it. I commend the work that Yorkshire Forward has been doing in that regard, because it is exactly the kind of proactive, thoughtful work that we need.</p>
	<p pid="a.182.1/7">Scoping work is not yet under way, so it will be a long time before we identify which of the depleted fields could potentially be used. Again, that is an area in which the Government could be moving further forward and faster. Moreover, such work should be tied to an emission performance standard, like the one in California. Like <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1831" name="Simon Hughes">the hon. Member for North Southwark and Bermondsey (Simon Hughes)</phrase>, I had a meeting with the people from California yesterday. They see the standard as an integral part of driving change; people know what the level of emissions will be and that they will decline over time. As long as people have a secure outlook and they understand what is expected of them, they can invest to meet that standard; without that ability, the situation becomes more challenging.</p>

	<p pid="a.184.2/1">This is an important debate. I join colleagues in congratulating my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1427" name="David Anderson">the Member for Blaydon (Mr. Anderson)</phrase> on securing it and on giving such a serious and powerful speech. It deserves a wide hearing, particularly what he said about the moral questions concerning imported coal and the need to ensure that we consider the health and safety issues, as well as the case for developing a long-term strategy for coal in this country.</p>
	<p pid="a.184.2/2">As someone who is proud to represent a constituency containing what is probably the most profitable coal mine in the UK&mdash;Daw Mill, which exceeded 3 million tonnes last year and is doing extremely well&mdash;I want the coal industry to have a long-term future that does not damage the environment. As in most debates about the role of coal in energy policy, especially UK-produced coal, contributions have been made from a number of standpoints. I particularly welcome the points of view raised by colleagues such as my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1815" name="Paddy Tipping">the Member for Sherwood (Paddy Tipping)</phrase> and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1844" name="William Cash">the hon. Member for Stone (Mr. Cash)</phrase>, who has a record, unlike most Conservatives, of supporting the coal industry over a long period. His comments on the issue are perhaps regarded as having more credibility than those of most Conservatives.</p>
	<p pid="a.184.2/3">The Government are committed to the future of coal as part of the UK's energy mix. We want to ensure that it provides the flexibility that is key to energy. We have just had a cold snap, during which more than 50 per cent. of our electricity generation came from coal. Normally, it provides about a third, but when we need to expand our electricity supply quickly and flexibly to meet demand, we must rely on coal. It is an important asset for our energy generation. The lights would literally go off if we did not have coal. Renewables will play an increasingly important part, but the problem with renewables, which we cannot run away from, is intermittency. Unless that issue is addressed, we will have difficulty relying on renewables alone.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-03-17a.185.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1910" speakername="Mike O'Brien" colnum="185"  time="010:50:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090317/halltext/90317h0004.htm#09031745000553">
	<p pid="a.185.3/1">Coal can work, but renewables are also an essential part of a proper energy mix to provide long-term security for the energy supply in this country. We need renewables. We need to ensure that they are used, because they do not damage the environment as many other sorts of energy do. We need oil and gas at the moment. We are importing them increasingly because we are depleting the amounts available from the North sea. Oil and gas from the North sea will be available for decades more&mdash;they will not disappear overnight&mdash;but they are being depleted, which means that we are relying more on imports.</p>
	<p pid="a.185.3/2">We therefore need to develop our other domestic energy sources. Nuclear is an invaluable base for the production of energy and electricity. It provides the base load that we will need in future. I must say to the Liberal Democrats that I do not believe that any energy policy for this country can be serious without a nuclear base load. Unless that is included, it is not a serious climate change policy.</p>
	<p pid="a.185.3/3">We need a nuclear base load, but as it is a base load, it does not provide a high level of flexibility. We need renewables because they are no-carbon. We also need to ensure that we have enough flexibility to deal with varying demand, and that flexibility comes, at the moment, from coal. It also comes to some extent from gas, which also emits carbon, although not as much as coal.</p>
	<p pid="a.185.3/4">We need coal for the long term, which is why we need to ensure that we put the case for coal. Those extremists from the green lobby who say that we should have no coal are proposing a recipe for turning the lights off. That is an unacceptable position. However, we also need to ensure that our coal industry does not damage the environment. Getting that balance right is essential.</p>
	<p pid="a.185.3/5">My hon. Friend the Member for Blaydon rightly pointed out that deaths occur in coal production in a number of other countries. The destruction of the UK coal industry in the 1980s and early 1990s has made us overly dependent on coal imports, often from countries where health and safety standards are poor. He is right to raise the point that we need to ask ourselves questions about that. We have vast coal reserves in this country. If we can get carbon capture and storage going properly on a commercial level, we can exploit the domestic resources in mines in our own country.</p>
	<p pid="a.185.3/6">We must be aware of the destruction. The Baddesley, Coventry and Birch Coppice pits in my constituency all closed between 1987 and 1992. That was greatly destructive&mdash;thousands of jobs were lost in my area&mdash;and will be long remembered. We need to ensure that coal is included in the mix for our energy supply, but we must also ensure greater expansion of domestic coal production in this country.</p>
	<p pid="a.185.3/7">My hon. Friend the Member for Sherwood raised points about Harworth in particular. I am watching closely the developments in UK Coal's wish to expand there. I am keeping in close contact with sources from UK Coal, and we have offered to do what we can to encourage and support the work there. There are limits to what we can do, but UK Coal is aware of them and of our broad support.</p>
	<p pid="a.185.3/8">There are opportunities for clean coal technologies. The Government accept that coal-fired generation must become cleaner. Although facilities exist in some areas, we need to improve the efficiency of coal extraction. CCS is the key deployment. We will shortly publish our response to the consultation &quot;Towards Carbon Capture and Storage&quot;. It will set out details of the implementation of our proposed carbon capture readiness policy, as well as further information about proposed measures for regulating the geological storage of carbon dioxide. We will also consult on what further regulation is required for us to keep coal as an option in our long-term future generation mix while meeting our long-term climate change targets. A decision on the application for a replacement coal-fired unit at Kingsnorth will follow the conclusion of both the carbon capture readiness consultation and the planned new consultation on a new framework for coal-fired power stations.</p>
	<p pid="a.185.3/9">The UK has been lobbying for and has secured funding from the EU. I heard reference earlier in the debate to an MEP, whom I am afraid I had not heard of, who seemed to be claiming that he had secured it. I must tell hon. Members that&mdash;</p>

	<p pid="a.187.1/1">This debate proves to be slightly more timely than I had anticipated&mdash;I must thank Mr. Speaker for selecting it for today&mdash;as a major report on dementia has been in the national papers this morning. In addition, Prince Charles will this afternoon address a debate on that subject, which will be one of the issues that I discuss in relation to residential and nursing care homes.</p>
	<p pid="a.187.1/2">Care homes have not had a particularly popular image among the general public in the past. The view in the 1970s and 1980s was that they were places that one sent people to as a last resort. They were basically designed to bring profit rather than to provide proper care and services for elderly people. Indeed, my earliest experience of anyone running a care home was in the early 1970s, when I worked for a firm of architects in London, and one of the partners declared that he and his wife were buying a care home. His views about why they were doing it would not have given me any confidence that anyone I knew should reside there. I never spoke to his wife&mdash;I am sure that she had a rather different view&mdash;but he thought that it was going to be easy money.</p>
	<p pid="a.187.1/3">In the 1980s, there was a vast expansion of care home provision. As in any industry in which there is vast expansion, not everyone who goes into it does so for the right reasons. By the end of the 1980s and early 1990s, the transition of hotels due to the decline of the tourism industry in the south-west led to the small port and fishing town of Teignmouth, where I live, having the highest number of care beds per head of population anywhere in Europe and therefore, I suspect, in the world.</p>
	<p pid="a.187.1/4">Times have changed dramatically since then. The Governments of the 1980s and 1990s regulated harder, and we moved away from the easy option of moving people into care homes to a policy of caring for them in their own homes. The quality of care homes has increased dramatically. Those that might have been a little on the dodgy side in the past have struggled, so I am sure that few exist today. However, that does not mean that the care home sector gets an easy press&mdash;one has only to read the sort of headlines that are written about care homes in the newspapers: &quot;Nurse who ran care home accused of murder after seven suspicious deaths&quot;; &quot;Illness kills half the residents at nursing home&quot;. And, of course, <i>The Times</i> has run a care home campaign.</p>
	<p pid="a.187.1/5">Most of the care homes that I visit in my constituency are not like that at all. They provide personal care of a high quality, and they care about the residents. The Minister shakes his head; I am not sure whether he disagrees or wants to intervene. Those care homes care about the people who reside in them, but that does not mean that there are no issues to address. They are concerned about how they can provide the high level of care that they seek to achieve.</p>
	<p pid="a.187.1/6">The Government are pressing ahead with improvements. I am sure that the Minister will regale us later, given the opportunity, with all the improvements that have occurred in the past 10 years. I do not wish to steal his thunder, but let me give a few statistics. According to the 2007-08 report of the Commission for Social Care Inspection, in the past six years,</p>
	<p pid="a.187.1/7" class="indent">&quot;there has been steady improvement in the overall performance of councils in addressing current policy requirements and in regulated care services meeting national minimum standards.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.187.1/8">It goes on to say:</p>
	<p pid="a.187.1/9" class="indent">&quot;There have been some tentative steps to address the new personalisation agenda which have meant more people are able to control and choose their support through, for example, Direct Payments, Individual Budgets and good person-centred assistance...There are some outstanding examples of people's lives being radically improved where they have been able to direct their own support, including those people with multiple and complex needs... However, councils are at an early stage in transforming social care and developments are patchy and vary between different groups of people.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.187.1/10">It continues:</p>
	<p pid="a.187.1/11" class="indent">&quot;People, whether they pay for their care or are publicly funded, are not always getting the individualised help that they need to make decisions about their support which in the long term can be costly to individuals, family carers, councils and the NHS.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.187.1/12">I know that a significant number of people do not like direct payment because they find it difficult, but that a number do when the services are there to be accessed. Like other MPs, I am sure, I have people coming to me saying, &quot;Yes, I have the money, but there is no one I can buy the service from,&quot; so giving them money is largely a waste of time, because there is nothing for them to spend it on to provide the relevant service.</p>

	<p pid="a.188.1/1">It is not sustainable, and the situation is going to get worse, as I shall discuss later. It is very much a growing problem in our ageing population. The lack of specialist nurses comes out in Laing and Buisson's report, which I shall discuss in a moment.</p>
	<p pid="a.188.1/2">CSCI points out that in 2007-08, 1.75 million older people and people of working age used different social care services, and that &pound;16.5 billion was spent on social care for adults. Other moneys provided through private expenditure and top-ups added up to a further &pound;5.9 billion, so we are talking about fairly large sums of money, and even the Government projections predict higher figures. The university of Kent's personal social services research unit says:</p>
	<p pid="a.188.1/3" class="indent">&quot;The numbers of functionally disabled older people in England are projected to&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.188.1/4">double</p>
	<p pid="a.188.1/5" class="indent">&quot;from approximately 2.3 million in 2002 to approximately 4.6 million in 2041&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.188.1/6">It says:</p>
	<p pid="a.188.1/7" class="indent">&quot;To keep pace with demographic pressures over the next 40 years, assuming unchanged rates of functional disability&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.188.1/8">that is a big if&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.188.1/9" class="indent">&quot;residential and nursing home places would need to expand by around 115 per cent. and numbers of hours of home care by around 100 per cent. The numbers of staff working in social care for older people would need to increase by around 110 per cent. between 2002 and 2041&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.188.1/10">Also, expenditure for the same period</p>
	<p pid="a.188.1/11" class="indent">&quot;would need to rise by around 325 per cent. in real terms...to meet demographic pressures and allow for real rises in care costs of 2 per cent. per year for both social care and health care.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.188.1/12">In the long term, that means that care expenditure would need to increase</p>
	<p pid="a.188.1/13" class="indent">&quot;from 1.4 per cent. of gross domestic product in 2002...to 2.6 per cent. in 2041.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.188.1/14">I hope that the Minister has his crystal ball and will say what the Government are doing to lay the foundations for that necessary growth in residential care. If the Government are not certain that they want to believe university of Kent figures, Age Concern says that significant funding is required to meet our obligations to older people and that expenditure of &pound;7 billion to &pound;8 billion now should rise to &pound;14 billion to &pound;16 billion in 2026. That is a shorter time span, but it is still virtually a doubling of the figure of about 1 per cent. of GDP.</p>
	<p pid="a.188.1/15">Not to miss out on the matter, the Joseph Rowntree Foundation has had its own research done, again by William Laing of Laing and Buisson. Laing states that about &pound;540 million of extra funding is still needed in the system for local authorities to fund a modernised care home sector. Since that report, the Minister has announced &pound;520 million of funding, but that is for different expenditure and is not the same expenditure that Laing and Buisson said was missing last September.</p>
	<p pid="a.188.1/16">The care sector faces problems across the board. Before I get into the detail of private care homes and the problems that they face, I will mention charitable care homes. The Charity Commission wrote to me about this debate. It said that there are a number of issues, but that the key issues identified in its survey,</p>
	<p pid="a.188.1/17" class="indent">&quot;which would affect care homes, were funding (whether full costs were paid by the public body and whether contracts were short term), independence (whether the charities felt that they could still take decisions independently), and mission drift, (whether the charities were being led by available funding, rather than their charitable objectives).&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.188.1/18">Lack of funding is a key issue in relation to that.</p>
	<p pid="a.188.1/19">I particularly thank the Local Government Association, which provided the most extensive brief for the debate, for its work on the matter. It has pointed out that there are currently 448,000 care home places in England and that 231,000 of those adults are financially supported by councils. If we consider how councils are paid, we will see that some of the 217,000 remaining places were the subject of a contract between councils and care homes to provide intermediate, respite care or other temporary placements. However, as I said, the majority of people arranged to pay for their own care.</p>
	<p pid="a.188.1/20">Between 2006-07 and 2007-08, the unit cost paid by councils to care homes increased by an average of 7 per cent. However, there is a wide variation between councils and the type of care purchased. The greatest increase in unit cost was between 11 and 14 per cent., which went to care homes providing nursing care for those with physical or learning disabilities. Contracts and fees are a matter for local negotiation and councils with limited budgets&mdash;increasing by 1.2 per cent. in real terms over that period&mdash;need to negotiate fee levels carefully in relation to quality of care.</p>
	<p pid="a.188.1/21">The Minister might wish to address how the rising fee levels and costs of care homes are not matched by Government grants to local authorities. That situation puts stress on social services departments. The Minister might say that that is new, but I can take him back to one of my earliest questions in the House when I asked the then Health Minister, who is now Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, about a statement from the 15 social services departments in the south-west.</p>
	<p pid="a.188.1/22">The directors of those 15 social services departments said that there was pressure on elderly care and that the budget constraints were such that their obligatory, legal duty to provide services for children meant that they were having to divert funding from elderly care to child care. That led to a lack of funding. At that point, I think that the estimate was &pound;1 billion of underfunding. As I mentioned, the Joseph Rowntree Foundation has said that the figure has been reduced to about &pound;500 million of underfunding, but there is still a big hole. That means that people are not necessarily getting the level of care that they feel they deserve, having worked all their lives.</p>
	<p pid="a.188.1/23">We might not necessarily have much sympathy with care homes when we say that we want to improve standards and we expect them to improve the services that they offer, but care homes have their own problems. Some care homes improve services willingly and some do so while pointing out that having the additional funding to improve standards would be beneficial and appreciated. However, some care homes say that other problems have been created for them&mdash;for example, the bureaucracy that is put in their way and problems relating to employment issues. When the Government decided to crack down on immigration and change the rules, I doubt whether there was an MP with a care home in his constituency who did not find a care home worker on his doorstep saying that their work permit would not be renewed and that they would be sent back home to the Philippines or wherever.</p>
	<p pid="a.188.1/24">Migrant workers comprise a significant proportion of the social care work force. The Association of Directors of Adult Social Services estimates that one in two care staff in London is a non-EU citizen. The Government published the shortage occupation list for tier 2 of the points-based immigration system in November 2008. The list contains skilled occupations where vacancies can be filled by migrant workers from outside the European economic area. The LGA welcome the fact that skilled senior care workers are included in the tier 2 list, but to be &quot;skilled&quot; requires that the individual must earn at least &pound;8.80 an hour after deductions for accommodation, meals and so on. There is also a requirement for a national qualifications framework level 3 or above.</p>
	<p pid="a.188.1/25">Martin Green, the chief executive of the English Community Care Association, has said:</p>
	<p pid="a.188.1/26" class="indent">&quot;We cannot understand why skilled work riders and frozen fish cutters are deemed to be skilled workers without an attached required salary while senior care workers will in essence be prevented from entering the country to undertake the valued work that those currently here already do.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.188.1/27">Although people might say, &quot;Yes, we recognise that this is a skill and accept that the qualifications are necessary,&quot; the salary level being put with such jobs is causing problems in the care sector.</p>
	<p pid="a.188.1/28">I ask the Minister to consider that if &pound;8.80 is the requirement and that is based on the industry, why is it that those who run care homes&mdash;certainly those in my constituency and I believe those in other constituencies&mdash;will say that that figure is more than they are currently paying their European qualified staff for work? The amount seems to be set at an arbitrary level that is designed purely as a cut-off point to stop people coming into the UK or to be used as an excuse at a later date to remove care workers from the UK. I will come on to dementia in a moment because it is particularly important that there is not a continual change in care home staff who work in that area.</p>
	<p pid="a.188.1/29">The LGA has questions about funding. It says that</p>
	<p pid="a.188.1/30" class="indent">&quot;adult social care services are funded through a combination of central and local government funding&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.188.1/31">and that total adult social care spending for 2008-09 was &pound;13.78 billion. Of that figure, central Government general grant funding was &pound;6.29 billion, specific grant funding was &pound;2.15 billion and the contribution from local government &pound;5.33 billion, which is approximately 20 per cent. of total council tax receipts. The Government are applying greater pressure and saying to councils, &quot;You must limit your council tax increases.&quot; However, as I said, council tax funds a service that increases in cost, in real terms, by 7 per cent. a year. That is rather more than the amount by which local authorities are being told that they are allowed to increase council tax and by which they are trying to increase it. Even greater pressures are being applied to local authorities. They are being told that they cannot raise the level of council tax&mdash;they are not allowed to increase the element that they control&mdash;but that the Government will not adequately increase funding for care. The people who will lose out are those in care, because, at the end of the day, we are squeezing the care homes.</p>
	<p pid="a.188.1/32">The surveys clearly say that where there is poor care, the residents blame the low wages that some of the care homes have to pay because they are not funded to pay adequate wages. It is still true that people can earn more money at night stacking shelves in large supermarkets in my constituency than they can earn during the day caring for people in homes. Many young people will opt for the easy job in the evening rather than the job during the day.</p>
	<p pid="a.188.1/33">I wish briefly to discuss Laing and Buisson's report. I have not been able to see the detailed brief. Someone in my office went online to see whether the full report was available and found that apparently we have to pay &pound;100 to see it. I assume that a copy will be available for Members in the Library and that we will be able at some point to read it without having to spend that money. It did not seem practical to pay &pound;100 to read a thick wodge of a report all the way through this morning.</p>
	<p pid="a.188.1/34">Some quotes from the report were put on the website, and there was also a stimulating discussion of the issue on Radio 4. The most telling point was that there is not enough training in the sector. A statistic from the radio programme&mdash;I have this as close as I could get it&mdash;is that only one third of the homes that are designated to care for Alzheimer's patients are providing staff with the necessary specialist training. That is a severe condemnation of our current system.</p>
	<p pid="a.188.1/35">As I said earlier, when discussing other issues, there is improvement, but the Government need to grasp the report that will be published today, listen to the Alzheimer's Research Trust debate this afternoon and come up with answers about how we can make further improvements. The Minister has already stated in his response to the report:</p>
	<p pid="a.188.1/36" class="indent">&quot;The national dementia strategy will improve the quality of care in care homes.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.188.1/37">That quote was on a website this morning. That is fine. The strategy is there, and the 17 points are vital. We buy into them&mdash;no problem at all&mdash;but my purpose in going through all the funding arguments that I raised earlier is to say that, unless funding follows, the strategy is not worth the paper it is written on.</p>
	<p pid="a.188.1/38">I beg the Minister to step up his argument with the Treasury that this issue should not be forgotten. Alzheimer's is probably the disease that most of us fear getting. To most people, cancer is a big fear, but the idea that we could slowly lose our mental capacity puts dread into the hearts of most people. The issue must be fully and properly addressed.</p>
	<p pid="a.188.1/39">The majority of care is done in the community&mdash;people are looked after in their home&mdash;but a significant number of people are in care homes, and there will be a substantial increase in the number who will need to go into them. Unless we start saying that the money will follow, those people will lose out.</p>
	<p pid="a.188.1/40">I mentioned immigration policies. The Alzheimer's Society website gives three principles for good-quality care. The third states:</p>
	<p pid="a.188.1/41" class="indent">&quot;Staff caring for people with dementia should be trained in supporting people with dementia.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.188.1/42">As I said, that is not happening adequately at present. It goes on to state:</p>
	<p pid="a.188.1/43" class="indent">&quot;Continuity of care, which allows relationships and trust to build up between the person with dementia and care staff, is also important.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.188.1/44">I would ask the Minister to come to south Devon to visit the care homes in my constituency, to look at the bonding between care workers and residents, and then to go back to the Home Office and ask the immigration officials whether it is really right, for the sake of the figures, to send those care workers home because care homes will not be able to pay them &pound;8.80, and his colleagues in the Treasury will not provide the funding.</p>
	<p pid="a.188.1/45">I would ask the Minister to think about the family who have grown reliant on and developed friendships with care workers, to look them in the eye and say, &quot;Terribly sorry,&quot; and then tell them that the person whom their mother or father has grown to depend on and with whom they have developed a relationship, the person who engages with their mother or father every day, who speaks to them and encourages them so that they are not left to rot&mdash;the worst that we could do for people with dementia&mdash;or left on the shelf but can have a reasonable quality of life, will be sent back to the Philippines, China or wherever. I ask the Minister to visit the care homes, speak to the people and then tell the Treasury and the Home Office that that is not good enough.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-03-17a.198.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1861" speakername="Paul Burstow" colnum="198"  time="011:45:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090317/halltext/90317h0006.htm#09031745000565">
	<p pid="a.198.1/1">My hon. Friend earlier drew attention to what Laing and Buisson identified&mdash;namely, fragmented training at specialist units in this country&mdash;and also rightly identified from that research the fact that many of those homes do not have formal training programmes. I hope that the Minister will say something reassuring about how the new inspection regime will ensure that that finding does not become a long-term trend.</p>
	<p pid="a.198.1/2">The Minister knows that for some years, I have raised questions about the appropriateness of using anti-psychotic medication in care homes, and I was pleased last year when his predecessor, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1467" name="Ivan Lewis">the hon. Member for Bury, South (Mr. Lewis)</phrase>, announced a review of their use in the draft dementia strategy. The terms of the review, as I understood them at the time, were not so much to ask whether change was needed, but to plan for change. Although the review was and is long overdue, it was and is welcome, because those drugs reduce people's quality of life, increase costs due to the need to treat side effects and cut lives short.</p>
	<p pid="a.198.1/3">It is surprising that we tolerate the continued use of drugs off licence for a purpose that a growing body of evidence suggests is not appropriate in the long term. We know, however, that 100,000 people are routinely prescribed them and, from academic studies, that perhaps as many as 23,000 people die prematurely because of their excessive and inappropriate use. I hope the Minister will state when we might see a light at the end of that tunnel&mdash;when we will see the action plan that will produce the necessary change to practice.</p>
	<p pid="a.198.1/4">That brings us to the wider issue of dementia, its care management and the study that Laing and Buisson published today, identifying the training issues that we have already talked about. I want to ask the Minister about the dementia strategy, because it is not a national strategy. It is not a national must-do: it is not in the Department's strategy framework as something that must be done; it is on the framework's next tier as something to be decided locally. Local decision is generally a good thing, but, on the national strategy that the Minister has rightly advanced, I should like some clarity about timelines, because that is what my constituents expect.</p>
	<p pid="a.198.1/5">I want to ask about the implementation programme board, which I understand has not met yet. I assume that it will have a monitoring role, even if it will not provide an overly disciplined and prescriptive framework, because that is not the Government's intention. When will its terms of reference and membership be finalised? There is a meeting on <phrase class="date" code="2009-03-31">31 March</phrase> of the other body that is responsible for such matters That must mean that the implementation programme board will not meet this month, and that yet another month will have gone by without the monitoring framework to drive the strategy forward having been published. It would be good to hear what the Minister has in mind.</p>
	<p pid="a.198.1/6">[Mr. Edward O'Hara <i>i</i><i>n the Chai</i><i>r</i> ]</p>
	<p pid="a.198.1/7">I shall touch briefly on nutrition. A couple of weeks ago, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1567" name="Stephen O'Brien">the hon. Member for Eddisbury (Mr. O'Brien)</phrase>, the official Opposition spokesperson, and I addressed a meeting organised by the British Association for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition, which has conducted some very good research, demonstrating malnutrition's burden on our taxes. The group has created a nutrition action plan, which the Minister is considering. Until he has done so, however, he is unable to confirm whether that group will be able to continue tackling malnutrition in a multi-agency way, so it would useful if he said whether he believes that it has done a good job and whether he will allow it to continue.</p>
	<p pid="a.198.1/8">From written parliamentary answers, I am surprised that malnutrition data are not routinely reported to Ministers or senior officials, and that there is no regular auditing of the adequacy of data that are collected. It seems extraordinary that while we focus on obesity, we know that there is a &pound;13 billion cost associated with malnutrition. Surely, that should be addressed.</p>

	<p pid="a.199.1/1">The hon. Gentleman is right to challenge the Minister. I am sure that the Minister will respond by demonstrating that his head is not in the sand, and that he is as anxious as all of us to ensure that we use the data that we have to deliver a strategy that bears down on the problem of malnutrition. I hope that he says that.</p>
	<p pid="a.199.1/2">On the personal expense allowance, I asked a written parliamentary question of the Minister's predecessor in January 2008 about whether he would undertake a consultation on the level and adequacy of the personal expense allowance, which is paid to people in care homes, who are in receipt of a pension that they must forgo because of the rules for determining state support. They are left with &pound;21.15 a week&mdash;just &pound;3 a day&mdash;to cover the costs of toiletries and food, which are the little things that make the difference between being alive and having a life.</p>
	<p pid="a.199.1/3">The question is whether the proposed 75p a week increase is sufficient to meet the needs and dignity of 250,000 vulnerable and frail adults who live in care homes throughout the country. I do not think that it is, and Age Concern and many others in the movement campaigning on this issue agree with me. Such groups feel a sense of betrayal, because they were offered a clear undertaking by the previous Minister, which was reaffirmed in June last year, as reported in <i>Hansard</i>, that there would be such a consultation, only to see that snatched away by the Minister who is here today.</p>
	<p pid="a.199.1/4">The opportunity for the Minister to learn more about the views, experiences and feelings of those who have to live on &pound;21.15 has been denied. I hope that, although it may be too late to address the increase from <phrase class="date" code="2009-04-01">1 April</phrase>, the Minister might use the opportunity in the coming months to embark on that dialogue with people who have been lobbying him on this issue, so that we can have a more meaningful debate, a more meaningful consideration and a proper review of the personal expense allowance.</p>
	<p pid="a.199.1/5">It is not only me and Age Concern who are concerned. In a report published on <phrase class="date" code="2009-03-04">4 March</phrase>, the Joseph Rowntree Foundation identified the doubling of the personal expenses allowance as a way of giving more dignity to people in care homes supported by local authorities. That is right&mdash;it is a small price to pay for dignity. This is an important thing that we should be doing, and it is a great shame that the Minister has not done it. I hope that he will respond positively to that point and the others raised in this debate.</p>

	<p pid="a.205.1/1">She has written to say that there are big concerns about the change in the funding formula for care homes, which I think we all agree causes grave difficulty for people in care homes, because so often the service user must pick up the bill.</p>
	<p pid="a.205.1/2">The hon. Member for Teignbridge talked about quality, which causes deep concern with the demise of the Commission for Social Care Inspection. One could rehearse the various arguments about what will happen to CSCI, but we all believe that the challenge for the future will be to ensure that the CQC continues to build on the good work of CSCI and does not let social care and social care inspection become a second-order issue within its overall work.</p>
	<p pid="a.205.1/3">The hon. Gentleman rightly mentioned immigration and training pressures, the high turnover of staff&mdash;that was highlighted in the e-mail&mdash;and that the quality of the work force is vital. I hope that Dame Denise Platt's recommendations, not least from her 2007 review of the status of social care, which have yet to be implemented by the Government, will be a deep influence for action by the Minister in the coming months. The litmus test for him will be to give as much of a clue as he can, in addressing the issues raised by the hon. Member for Teignbridge, about what the Green Paper is intended to cover and whether it will include costed options, so that we can at last have a conversation with the British public on this live and crucial issue.</p>

	<p pid="a.205.2/1">First, I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1870" name="Richard Younger-Ross">the hon. Member for Teignbridge (Richard Younger-Ross)</phrase> on securing the debate. I thank him for raising a very important issue and for putting it on record at the beginning of his speech that external bodies have recognised that the Government are pressing forward with improvements across the board on support and the quality of care. I shall say more about that in a moment. I also thank hon. Members on both sides of the Chamber who have contributed to the debate. Hon. Members come to these debates with a lot of passion, because the subject often affects them, their families and, of course, their constituents. Those experiences inform our desire to do more and go further.</p>
	<p pid="a.205.2/2">I shall take this opportunity to applaud the great efforts by regulators, such as CSCI, by care home providers, by nursing home providers, by people who provide domiciliary care and by staff, who have done a huge amount to raise standards in social care. I agree that there are still areas that are in need of improvement, but there has been continuous improvement in the quality of care since we introduced new regulatory arrangements in 2002.</p>
	<p pid="a.205.2/3">By the way, today is world social work day. I mention that in case hon. Members were not aware of it. It is a good opportunity for all of us to recognise the central role that social workers play in supporting individuals, families and communities. They do a very difficult job. The values that underpin the role of social work are central to the values that underpin our society. That applies not least to our desire to pursue personalisation&mdash;ensuring that services, whether in a care home, nursing home or out in the community, are tailored to meet the needs of individuals.</p>
	<p pid="a.205.2/4">This issue applies to adults of working age as well as older people. Sometimes debates about care focus only on older people. We know the pressures in that respect, the demographics and so on, but I want also to emphasise&mdash;this relates particularly to the social care Green Paper&mdash;that we need a social care system for the 21st century that meets the care needs of working age adults with learning disabilities, physical disabilities and so on, as well as of older people who have retired.</p>
	<p pid="a.205.2/5">Those challenges will not arise at some distant point in the future; they are with us now. The ageing population is one of the most profound social changes of our time. It is fantastic that we are all living longer&mdash;11 years longer on average than we were many years ago&mdash;but that makes demands of and puts pressure on our system, not least in respect of funding and quality of care. Building a consensus about the future of the care and support system presents a significant policy challenge not only for the UK Government but for every nation in the world that is grappling with it.</p>
	<p pid="a.205.2/6">I agree with <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1861" name="Paul Burstow">the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam (Mr. Burstow)</phrase> that an ageing society is not a decaying society. He is right to emphasise the positive aspects of becoming older. The fact that we are living healthier and more active lives, as well as longer lives, should be celebrated. I am talking about older people as active citizens, having more choice and control. However, when care needs arise, care needs to be provided in a way that supports people to maintain that independence and to have that choice and control.</p>
	<p pid="a.205.2/7">Before I talk about the detail, I want to emphasise, in relation to the social care Green Paper, that because of the pressures, the changing expectations and the transformation of social care that is going on today, we need a radical rethink of the care and support system. The Green Paper is the vehicle for that debate, and it will be published soon. That will be an opportunity for us to have these debates in the way in which <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1567" name="Stephen O'Brien">the hon. Member for Eddisbury (Mr. O'Brien)</phrase> has requested.</p>
	<p pid="a.205.2/8">I want to put on record again the deferred payment scheme. People can go to their council and ask that they do not have to sell their home in their lifetime to pay for their residential care. They can defer that payment, if they approach their local authorities. That is an important point that the hon. Gentleman often misses out in his contributions.</p>
	<p pid="a.205.2/9">Standards have been a key theme throughout the debate. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1672" name="Greg Mulholland">The hon. Member for Leeds, North-West (Greg Mulholland)</phrase> reminded us of the 169 homes that failed the inspection by CSCI. No one should have to have the experience that was described in a home. I agree with him about that. I will add, though, that although those 169 homes failing the inspection is unacceptable, it is good that 10,208 other care homes are not providing a service of that kind; they are providing a service that does meet the standard that we would expect.</p>
	<p pid="a.205.2/10">The performance of care homes measured against all national minimum standards has shown improvements each year since those standards were introduced. In 2007-08, care homes for older people met on average 82 per cent. of the standards, compared with 72 per cent. in 2004-05, which is a big improvement. Care homes for younger adults met on average 85 per cent. of the national minimum standards, compared with 76 per cent. in 2004-05. We all recognise the work of CSCI and providers in bringing about those improvements. I am confident that the new Care Quality Commission, which the hon. Member for Teignbridge mentioned, will continue where CSCI left off.</p>
	<p pid="a.205.2/11">I understood the point that my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1850" name="David Drew">the Member for Stroud (Mr. Drew)</phrase> made about inspection and the inspection process, but it is vital that we continue to drive forward and improve standards in our care system. In 2008, 82 per cent. of homes for older people met or exceeded the national minimum standard for hygiene and infection control, compared with 77 per cent. in 2006 and 66 per cent. in 2004, so work is going on and improvements are being made.</p>
	<p pid="a.205.2/12">Current regulations require care homes to ensure that staff are adequately trained. Hon. Members have mentioned the key issue of training. The regulations and the registration requirements being prepared now will include similar provisions. The CQC, as a regulator, will have a role in inspecting against those, as well as enforcing compliance.</p>
	<p pid="a.205.2/13">The hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam has mentioned the nutrition action plan. Nutrition is another element of care quality in homes. I have seen examples of excellent practice on nutrition, such as printing menus in pictures so that people can easily identify the food and then want to eat the food that they can see, but clearly more needs to be done. The nutrition action plan delivery board was launched by my predecessor, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1467" name="Ivan Lewis">the Member for Bury, South (Mr. Lewis)</phrase>. Its chair is Gordon Lishman. It has been meeting for the past year, and it is due to give me a full report in about a month's time. I shall examine the report and make decisions on its findings.</p>
	<p pid="a.205.2/14">Staffing issues have been raised. I appreciate the concerns about immigration, but I do not think that the new points-based system will mean that care home providers cannot recruit enough care workers. Our policy objective is to be more reliant on the domestic labour market.</p>

	<p pid="a.208.1/1">I do not have time to give way; I apologise to the hon. Gentleman.</p>
	<p pid="a.208.1/2">It will take time to improve local supply, so we are planning to produce a work force strategy for adult social care this spring. Part of the remit of that strategy will be to set out what the sector needs to do to attract, develop and retain a suitably shaped, skilled and qualified work force in order to fulfil our policy objectives on delivering personalised care. Much of that will mean recruiting from relatively untapped employment markets across existing communities. Delivery depends on activity at the local employer level, which will take time to work through the sector, but I assure the hon. Gentleman that we are on the case. As he will know, most care homes are private businesses, and they agree their terms and conditions of service with their staff, subject to national employment legislation. Of course, it was the current Government who introduced some of those national minimum standards, including the minimum wage and working time directives.</p>
	<p pid="a.208.1/3">The hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam raised the question of the personal expenses allowance, which was a difficult decision. The question was where we should put our resources. The estimated cost of raising the allowance to &pound;40 a week is &pound;250 million a year. We chose to put &pound;520 million a year into local authorities over the next three years. If we had reduced that by &pound;250 million, it would have meant less money for local authorities to improve the quality of care in their areas, and they would not have had the resources to undertake the essential transformation of social care. The allowance is increased in line with average earnings, but that issue will form part of the debate on the social care Green Paper, because it is a fundamental part of the system that is in place to provide financial care and support for people in our communities.</p>
	<p pid="a.208.1/4">The dementia strategy was mentioned. I do not have time to&mdash;</p>

	<p pid="a.209.1/1">I am pleased to have secured this debate on St. Helena and its transport links with the rest of the world. I welcome colleagues from different political parties who have come along to show their support for the people of the island.</p>
	<p pid="a.209.1/2">When I put in for the debate, my intention was to press the Department for International Development to make a decision on building an airport on the island and to go ahead with this vital project. We now know that DFID has once again decided not to make a decision, but to put the issue out for yet more consultation, engage yet more consultants and spin things out until the turn of the year. No doubt the Minister will try to put a positive gloss on that, but, in reality, these events have more to do with trying to avoid a judicial review of the Department's handling of the scheme.</p>
	<p pid="a.209.1/3">DFID's history on this project is shameful. It has used delaying tactics and done anything it can to avoid settling the issue of St. Helena's transport links with the outside world&mdash;links that could mean life or death for any one of the thousands of British citizens on the island. Those people are British citizens because St. Helena is a UK overseas territory. Just because it is situated in the south Atlantic does not make those people less British, although it perhaps makes them more forgettable for DFID.</p>
	<p pid="a.209.1/4">St. Helena is one of the most isolated places in the world. It is approximately 1,400 miles west of Namibia, 1,800 miles east of Brazil and 700 miles south of Ascension Island. The only way to get there is by ship, with the island being served by RMS St. Helena, the last Royal Mail ship still in service. This purpose-built ship was constructed in 1989 and is obviously towards the end of its operational life, rather than the start.</p>
	<p pid="a.209.1/5">That raises the question of how to ensure that the islanders have reliable transport links in the future. Replacing the ship with another purpose-built vessel is possible, but expensive. The jetty at St. Helena would also require remedial work, but that, too, is expensive. In addition, the islanders are concerned about that option because they remember what happened in 1999 when the current ship broke down, leaving them stranded until repairs had been made.</p>
	<p pid="a.209.1/6">Let us be clear: if the supply ship breaks down, people and supplies, including vital medical drugs and equipment, cannot get to the island. It also means that islanders cannot leave, including those requiring urgent medical attention that is not available on the island. Even as I speak, the ship is on its way to the UK and will not return to the island until <phrase class="date" code="2009-04-11">11 April</phrase>, but the shops have run out of potatoes.</p>
	<p pid="a.209.1/7">The obvious answer&mdash;it has been obvious for a number of years&mdash;is to build an airport. Of course, there is the cost. Building an airport anywhere is an expensive undertaking, and building one on an island in the middle of the south Atlantic, with all the problems of supply, would not be cheap. Until recently, however, the Government supported building an airport. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office supported the project, and we can take it that the Ministry of Defence would welcome an additional landing strip for its air bridge to the Falkland Islands. Incidentally, those islands have fewer residents than St. Helena, but they have flourished thanks to British Government support.</p>
	<p pid="a.209.1/8">No doubt the Minister will say that the recession provides a new context for delaying the airport project. Taken on its own, that argument might appear to have some worth, but this is at least the ninth year that DFID has appeared unwilling to give the project the go-ahead. Although the Government have continued to give British citizens at home commitments about infrastructure projects, this vital project for British citizens abroad is once more being delayed. Given the positive support, or acquiescence, elsewhere in the Government, it is not surprising that minds begin to wonder why DFID is the one Department of State that prefers to park the scheme. It will not say yes, but will not say no either.</p>
	<p pid="a.209.1/9">The Government have accepted that overseas territories should be self-governing as far as possible, that they can remain UK overseas territory as long as they wish and that Britain will continue to fulfil its responsibilities to each territory, as set out in each constitution. Citizens of the overseas territories have also all been granted British citizenship and the rights that come with it. When DFID was set up, it was also recognised that the overseas territories would have first call on its funds. To my knowledge, no one in the Government has suggested that the relationship between the UK and the overseas territories should change or that the right of such territories to have first call on DFID funds has been rescinded.</p>
	<p pid="a.209.1/10">St. Helena is an overseas territory and the islanders are British citizens. The island's economy is weak and deteriorating, and life is becoming increasingly desperate for the population. The infrastructure is poor and not sufficient to realise the island's potential or to sustain the population without subsidy. In 2007-08, the Government's bilateral aid to the island was &pound;17.5 million. In addition, the RMS St. Helena requires an annual subsidy of at least &pound;3 million. The average salary is &pound;4,500, with goods and food being more expensive than in the UK because of freight charges. Many people are forced to leave families and work abroad.</p>

	<p pid="a.211.1/1">I entirely agree with my hon. Friend, who has had the opportunity to visit St. Helena, although many of us have not, because of the time it takes to get there. By contrast, the scanner in the hospital on the Falkland Islands, which I have visited, is state of the art. The hospital can scan patients and send the scans to Brazil for advice on what treatment to use. The fact that the scanner on St. Helena cannot be used is an indictment of the current situation.</p>
	<p pid="a.211.1/2">Discussions about building an airport first took place in 1947, but the current project goes back nine years to 2000. Over those years, there have been many twists and turns, feasibility studies and consultants' reports. I will not spend time discussing all that; suffice it to say that it does not reflect well on DFID's ability to develop and implement projects.</p>
	<p pid="a.211.1/3">The Government have already earmarked &pound;234 million for the airport and associated infrastructure improvements. DFID has selected an airport contractor via competitive procurement and spent substantial amounts of taxpayers' money in the process. The contractor&mdash;Impregilo&mdash;has already invested significantly and has a team on the island ready to start work. Significant inward investment is ready to go as soon as the airport scheme is given the go-ahead.</p>
	<p pid="a.211.1/4">Shelco&mdash;the St. Helena Leisure Company&mdash;has been set up specifically to develop the leisure facilities to support the development of St. Helena's economy. It has substantial investors in place to underwrite between &pound;80 million and &pound;100 million of investment. Shelco has acquired options on an area of St. Helena and the Oberoi group is its hotel partner. They propose creating low-volume, high-value tourism, including a six-star eco hotel. That is the local preference, and it was recommended in a UN report and supported by two DFID-commissioned reports. That would create jobs and future income for the island.</p>
	<p pid="a.211.1/5">Developing St. Helena and building an airport would be in the UK's strategic interests in the south Atlantic. It would substantially help the economies of other British overseas territories&mdash;the dependencies of Tristan da Cunha, Ascension and the Falkland Islands. Opening the island to low-volume, high-value tourism would create opportunities for new local business ventures.</p>
	<p pid="a.211.1/6">The infrastructure and economy needed to support the influx of tourists would provide the many islanders working abroad with the opportunity to return to the island, which would help to generate a self-sustaining economy. That would enable the island gradually to reduce its financial dependence on the UK. We understand that the modelling undertaken by DFID economists shows that the airport is the best-value option to achieve the Government's policy of creating a sustainable economy. I would be grateful if the Minister confirmed that that is the case.</p>
	<p pid="a.211.1/7">It is not an overstatement to say that DFID's recent decisions threaten the viability of the airport project. They also threaten the regeneration project put forward by Shelco. Impregilo, the preferred airport contractor, needs certainty. If that does not happen, DFID will lose the company, and the lengthy and expensive airport tendering process will have to start again. It is most unlikely, given its history, that other parties will come forward. The delay will exacerbate the difficulties faced by the islanders, who are already dealing, month by month, with economic decline.</p>
	<p pid="a.211.1/8">Building an airport is the choice supported by the people of the island. In a 2001 public referendum, 72 per cent. of the islanders voted in favour. Without an airport, there are no positive prospects for St. Helena&mdash;nothing except continued, steady economic and social decline. At the same time, the UK taxpayers' subsidy will be steadily climbing, but the people of St. Helena do not want UK handouts. As British citizens, they deserve&mdash;and need&mdash;the Government to take them seriously, and to support them in a way that will open up possibilities for developing their economy and securing their future.</p>
	<p pid="a.211.1/9">The airport option would do that, and do so immediately. The stimulus to the economy once the project started would be substantial. These are dark economic days for most of the world. By keeping the long-standing promise to build an airport, we would stimulate recovery and hope in one of the poorest British areas of the world, and we would do so in a manner that created growth and self-sufficiency. The recession provides an additional reason to get on with the project, not a lame excuse to delay it further. At this late stage, I urge DFID to support St. Helena, agree to the building of the airport and invest in the future of the island.</p>

	<p pid="a.212.0/1">I speak as chairman of the all-party group on St. Helena. If the Minister is not aware of the fact, I advise him that last week hon. Members and many of the Saints living in the United Kingdom presented a petition to 10 Downing street. We await a response with great interest. What we did not expect was the shameful ministerial statement, made yesterday and published this morning, to which <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1813" name="Meg Munn">the hon. Member for Sheffield, Heeley (Meg Munn)</phrase> referred. I congratulate her on her measured speech, but this is not the first time that we have had an Adjournment debate about the island of St. Helena. The sense of betrayal cannot be understood, but if the Minister had been present last week, he would have witnessed it.</p>
	<p pid="a.212.0/2">I offer the Minister an invitation. No Minister has ever visited the island. Royalty have been there, but no Ministers. If the Minister, or a member of his ministerial team, were to visit St. Helena, things could be seen at first hand. Perhaps the dead hand of the Treasury, rather than DFID, is involved. However, the only future for the island and its residents is the airfield, as was well set out by the hon. Lady. Such a betrayal&mdash;after all these years and when the contract was about to be let&mdash;is inexcusable.</p>
	<p pid="a.212.0/3">There are Saints living here, and some keep Ascension Island and the Falklands going. Why are the Falklands and St. Helena treated so differently by Her Majesty's Government? It is time that the airfield was built. Yesterday's shameful act must quickly be rescinded. The Government should get on with the contract. The builders are ready to go in. They should be able to get on and do the job now.</p>

	<p pid="a.213.0/1">My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1813" name="Meg Munn">the Member for Sheffield, Heeley (Meg Munn)</phrase> has instigated a timely debate on the important matter of air access to St. Helena.</p>
	<p pid="a.213.0/2">I use my remarks today to present a wider perspective on the issues that have been raised and to elaborate a little on the statement that the Government made yesterday on how we wish to proceed. Although I have not had the experience of visiting the island myself, my immersion in the subject over recent months makes me feel almost as if I had been there. Because of the interest shown in the project, and expressed on both sides of the House, I feel rather as Napoleon must have at one time&mdash;that there is no getting away from St. Helena.</p>
	<p pid="a.213.0/3">I want to reassure my hon. Friend that, at root, there is no difference between us on a long-term commitment to St. Helena. However, in facing the challenges before us today, the Government must be responsible and take stock if circumstances change to the extent that they have. That is what we are doing. That is why we announced the consultation exercise yesterday; we want to ensure that all views will have been heard when we come to decide on the way forward. I shall speak on that in more detail in a moment.</p>
	<p pid="a.213.0/4">Hon. Members will be aware that on <phrase class="date" code="2009-12-08">8 December</phrase> last year we announced that there would be a pause in negotiations over the St. Helena airport contract. We decided that it was necessary in the light of the changed economic climate, which has been changing for the worse for many months but which intensified quite dramatically in the autumn. The Government had a responsibility to take a step back and to review whether it was right to proceed with the project in such circumstances.</p>
	<p pid="a.213.0/5">I hope that all hon. Members will agree that present circumstances present a very different setting from those of 2007, when the project was tendered for, and even more different from when the initial announcement was made in 2005. We have a responsibility to be absolutely sure that levels of expenditure that the project could incur remain appropriate. I met the Governor of St. Helena on his recent visit to the United Kingdom, to explain how matters stand and to hear his views. I have also met Impregilo, the bidding company, to explain our position. I am, of course, aware of its decision to maintain the validity of its bid until the end of April. It is for the company to judge its response in the light of yesterday's announcement, which presents a longer timeline before a final decision is made.</p>
	<p pid="a.213.0/6">As my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State said recently, the present economic conditions are unlike any that we have seen for generations. The medium and long-term consequences are uncertain at present. However, those conditions significantly affect the Government's ability to achieve all their international development objectives. Therefore, the reality is that we must revisit the choices before us, although we recognise the special place that our overseas territories have in our aid programme.</p>
	<p pid="a.213.0/7">At this point, I should correct my hon. Friend&mdash;the overseas territories do not have first call on DFID's funds per se, but first call for reasonable development needs. It must be seen in that wider context. Inevitably, part of the consideration is what is reasonable in the present circumstances. Other overseas territories are also experiencing difficulties in the current climate, and we must recognise those new pressures too when coming to a decision.</p>
	<p pid="a.213.0/8">The impact of the crisis is being felt in the developing world already. Aid and private finance flows are already falling, remittances are dropping and demand for trade exports is slowing. It is estimated that by December 2010 about 90 million more people will be living on less than $1.25 a day, because of the financial crisis. Progress towards delivering the millennium development goals will slow significantly, and there is already evidence from Ethiopia, Bangladesh, India and Pakistan suggesting that the poor are taking their children out of school to save money.</p>
	<p pid="a.213.0/9">Developing countries are being hit, and in different ways. The volume of our aid has been adversely affected by the sharp depreciation of sterling against most other currencies. Our UK aid pound is not going as far as it used to. Export markets are reducing and the level of world trade is falling for the first time in 25 years. Remittances sent by individuals back to developing countries are expected to fall by up to 6 per cent. this year alone. Capital flows to emerging economies are predicted to fall by 80 per cent. in 2009, compared with 2007 levels. The prospects, therefore, for millions of people in developing countries are changing rapidly for the worse.</p>

	<p pid="a.217.2/1">My hon. Friend started off by saying that not only the residents of Richmond and of my constituency have made representations on the matter and her point about access to the park is extremely important. There is a perception that the ability to enjoy the park of people from a slightly wider area will be stifled while local people, who may be walking from a much closer area, will not be affected. The park is an amenity for people from a much wider area than the immediate locality.</p>

	<p pid="a.219.1/2">It has been left to me, for example, to leaflet my local area to let residents know what is happening. When I was out leafleting in Roehampton a couple of weekends ago, I bumped into a local resident and explained what we were doing. She was unaware of the proposals under consultation. Is it right to do a consultation when the people who will be most affected by the car parking charges have not been contacted personally by the Royal Parks Agency? The communication process has been left to other people and local authorities. That does not seem to be a good way to ensure a broad-based response to a consultation.</p>
	<p pid="a.219.1/3">I am concerned about two impacts. First, people will be affected&mdash;in particular, a lot of my constituents&mdash;because there is no good public transport to the park from Roehampton and Putney and because we do not have as many pedestrian entrances as other sides of the park. The plans will be unaffordable for frequent users. Ironically, the people who care most about the park will be the ones who have to pay the most for it. Dog walkers will be particularly hard hit, as will low-income families. At a time when families might be looking for free and affordable leisure options, they will find that the one option right on their doorstep, which we should be reaching out to encourage them to use, has suddenly become unaffordable.</p>
	<p pid="a.219.1/4">The proposals will discourage families from using the park. Many families, especially young families, simply cannot all get on bikes and cycle there. I am sure that the Minister understands that travelling by car is often something that people do not want to do but must do to enjoy a family outing together. As I have said, the proposals will also hit the elderly and less mobile, many of whom do not qualify for a blue badge, but are not as fully mobile as the rest of us, who can simply get on a bike and cycle there.</p>
	<p pid="a.219.1/5">My concern is that if we are not careful, Richmond park, the wonderful park on our doorstep, will end up being the preserve of the rich and the middle classes, and lower-income families and the elderly will simply be priced out. That is surely wrong. Surely, for the next generation, we must reduce the barriers to using fantastic parks such as Richmond park. Many of my constituents in Roehampton, including children, live in flats. They do not have gardens. The park is their outside space. There is a danger that if we introduce car park charging, they will get the message, &quot;You can look, but you can't touch. You can't experience the park.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.219.1/6">One reason why I was so pleased to secure agreement to a pedestrian gate into the park from the Alton estate is that we should be doing everything we can for communities such as that to remove barriers to using the park. The more we can reach out to encourage all parts of our community to use the park, the better. Car park charging in Richmond park can go only in the reverse direction. I cannot see how that stacks up with the Government's approach to museums, for example. They have been proactive in saying that we should remove charges that might prevent people from using museums because they cannot afford to do so.</p>
	<p pid="a.219.1/7">Surely, in these days of caring about the environment, wanting people to understand how to care for it and trying to drive up recycling rates, ensuring that people can use the environment right there on their doorstep and encouraging them to do so has never been more important. I wait with interest to hear the Minister's response. I know that I am not the only Member concerned about the issue. We all appreciate taking care of the parks environment, but clearly we need to find a balance, and I am concerned that that balance is not being struck.</p>
	<p pid="a.219.1/8">I am grateful to the Minister for confirming that she is happy to meet with me after the consultation and before she takes any final decision. That is much appreciated. I will certainly take her up on that offer.</p>

	<p pid="a.223.0/1">On that point, is the Minister aware that one of the worst-affected areas in my constituency would be Roehampton, where the Alton estate is located? People on that estate would find it very difficult to pay for controlled parking in any form because of their income levels. I make the point again that, if charges are introduced, the policy can only be successful if it prices people out of the park, because we do not have good transport infrastructure. Surely it would be better to spend time working on improving transport infrastructure and routes to the park before charging people for behaviour that, in many cases, they will probably not be able to change.</p>

	<p pid="a.224.0/1">I hope that they will be able to change some of it, but no decision has been taken yet, and that is the main issue that we will consider. We want to ensure that access to the park is not compromised and that people on low incomes continue to use it and to get its benefits, as they have in Greenwich, where there are parking charges, but where there has not been a drop in the park's usage. If charges are introduced, we will be able to put in new, green parking surfaces with petrol interceptor drainage. That will help, because, currently, pollutants from cars are entering the soil.</p>
	<p pid="a.224.0/2">Some people have suggested that this measure is being forced on the Royal Parks Agency by cuts in grants and aid, and demands that it raises more of its own revenue. It is true that it has been very successful in raising its income from about &pound;3 million in 1997-98 to nearly &pound;11 million some 10 years later. That has reduced its dependency on the public purse, which is a good thing, and has allowed it to invest in some of the wonderful aspects of the parks. I thank the hon. Lady for raising this issue and assure her that officials and I will take into account all the points that she has raised today.</p>

	<p pid="a.225.1/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2009-04-02">2 April</phrase>, leaders of Governments from around the world will gather in London. Between them, those leaders represent 85 per cent. of the world's economic output, and they have rightly given themselves a bold agenda for the meeting. They have set themselves the tasks of stabilising financial markets, agreeing on how to support citizens through the recession, reforming and strengthening the global financial and economic system, putting the world economy back on track to growth, and addressing the needs of the world's poorest countries. That is more than a day's work, but, of course, work behind the summit has been going on for some time and will continue beyond it.</p>
	<p pid="a.225.1/2">I suspect that the <phrase class="date" code="2009-04-02">2 April</phrase> summit will be something of an audit on progress to date and will include a further push to deliver across a broad range of important priorities. The test of <phrase class="date" code="2009-04-02">2 April</phrase> is not whether the fine detail will be signed up to in each of the five objectives that I have mentioned; it is whether there is agreement on, first, what needs to change; secondly, on the broad principles for how that change is to be met; and, finally, on the delivery mechanisms for ensuring that that change happens. Of course, a consensus across all of those points needs to be secured.</p>
	<p pid="a.225.1/3">Out of the broad agenda that has been set for <phrase class="date" code="2009-04-02">2 April</phrase>, I shall concentrate on international regulation. I welcome what the Chancellor said to the House yesterday in his statement on the Finance Ministers' meeting, which will be held ahead of the <phrase class="date" code="2009-04-02">2 April</phrase> meeting. He said that &quot;there is significant consensus&quot; that financial supervisory and regulatory regimes need to be strengthened both nationally and internationally. He went on to give some insight into the detailed areas beneath that. For example, he mentioned the need to address the issue of capital and liquidity rules and to devise countercyclical devices. He also mentioned the need to address the issue of capital adequacy. In fact, the list of the work that needs to be addressed under that broad heading is much longer. I rehearsed the full list in a previous Westminster Hall debate, and I do not intend to repeat it again today.</p>
	<p pid="a.225.1/4">I make no apology for returning to my criticism of the Basel accords, which currently cover international banking regulation, and the philosophy that underpins them. I do not think that that philosophy has yet been abandoned, but it is now highly questionable. As the Minister knows, the Basel accords took years to write, but it has taken only a few months to demonstrate their woeful inadequacy. There are two main problems with them. First, they are reliant on internal risk basing, which means that the banks effectively define and measure their own exposure to risk. The banks also decide the extent to which the risk that they themselves have defined needs to be covered. That is first problem with the Basel accords, and it has been exposed by what has happened in the past six months or so.</p>
	<p pid="a.225.1/5">The second problem is that the system applies to banks that are huge global institutions. It is worth pointing out that the capitalisation of some of the world's largest banks will exceed the size of some of the countries represented around the G20 table. The system applies to global banks that are subject only to various national regulatory regimes. That is a serious imbalance, and it means that those individual national regimes cannot move far away from each other for fear of creating capital flight, whereby banks move to a more relaxed regulatory regime. The minimum guidelines necessary are therefore set to ensure that capital flight does not take place and yet the measures and definitions of risk that are used are in fact written by the banks themselves.</p>
	<p pid="a.225.1/6">Although many years of labour were spent in trying to bring about the Basel agreement, it was dead on arrival. The agreement has now been overtaken by events, and it proved irrelevant due to the search for yield on the part of the banks. That led to the innovation that we have seen and the emergence of extremely complex forms of securitisation. The search for yield decreased the degree of transparency across the banking system and increased the amount of off-balance sheet activity. Ultimately, it led to a loss of control on the part of the boards, because, frankly, they did not understand what the people running the banks were doing with those fancy instruments. There has also been a loss of control on the part of the regulators, because they could not keep up with the degree and complexity of change that was taking place.</p>
	<p pid="a.225.1/7">I am sure that the Minister is aware of the extent of the problem and I hope that he will agree that confidence in the Basel approach has, in fact, collapsed and that there is evidence that many individual country regulators are already abandoning the Basel guidelines and substituting rules of their own. That leaves a supervisory vacuum that must be filled by internationally agreed core standards for banking regulation. As I have said, I think that the Chancellor hinted strongly at that in his statement to the House yesterday, and I would welcome the Minister adding more insight into the Chancellor's thinking.</p>
	<p pid="a.225.1/8">It seems that there is a consensus that something needs to be done, but, ahead of <phrase class="date" code="2009-04-02">2 April</phrase>, an argument is emerging about how it is to be done. I would be interested to know where the Government stand on that argument, which I shall now outline. Some people are now saying that Glass-Steagall legislation needs to be revived. That legislation was introduced in the United States in 1933 following the Wall street crash and the emergence of the great depression. It was introduced by the Roosevelt Administration to impose a separation between retail and investment banking, and it was designed to break up the extraordinary power of J. P. Morgan and to restore the power of federal government in terms of setting economic policy. However, the crucial technical change that the legislation made was to impose a clean break between retail banking on the one hand and investment banking on the other.</p>
	<p pid="a.225.1/9">Since the repeal of Glass-Steagall legislation in the 1990s, some people are now saying, &quot;Well, all we need to do is go back to that and that will solve the regulator problem.&quot; I was astonished to read yesterday that Nigel Lawson has joined the camp of those suggesting that we revert to Glass-Steagall. In his article in the <i>Financial Times </i>he said:</p>
	<p pid="a.225.1/10" class="indent">&quot;It is folly to allow core banks to be in a position where they can be brought down by exciting but highly risky investment banking activities.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.225.1/11">I find that a bizarre statement from the man who was Chancellor of the Exchequer in 1986. He presided over the big bang in the City of London, which allowed US investment banks effectively to take over the City and pollute the traditional banking structures, which had rested heavily on that previous separation. He is a strange convert to the cause.</p>
	<p pid="a.225.1/12">As I have said, Glass-Steagall was repealed in the United States in the 1990s, just as we abolished all credit controls in the big bang of the 1980s. Although there are those who call for a full return to the original Glass-Steagall divide, in reality we cannot just turn the clock back. The infrastructure of the global banking system has become far too complex to revert to a divide that was designed in the 1930s. I do not think that such a divide could be designed now.</p>
	<p pid="a.225.1/13">The question is what should we do. I am aware that Lord Turner has been asked by the Government to look at what can be done here in respect of the Financial Services Authority's approach to banking regulation. I believe that he will make recommendations this week on an array of issues that are clearly central to this debate. I understand that he will have things to say about bank capital adequacy, the need to evolve countercyclical mechanisms, liquidity risk management, prudential regulation, the rating agencies, the originate-to-distribute model and the use of market-to-market accounting. All those issues should be on the agenda, and I look forward to what Lord Turner has to say when he reports later this week. The problem is that Lord Turner's report and recommendations will be targeted at just one regulator&mdash;ours, the FSA&mdash;whereas the Government's document, &quot;The Road to the London Summit&quot;, states that we need</p>
	<p pid="a.225.1/14" class="indent">&quot;greater surveillance of the financial system as a whole. It is essential that the cross-border co-operation between national authorities is enhanced and that the international regulatory architecture is strengthened.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.225.1/15">There is consensus on the aspiration to tackle international regulation, which is, of course, fine, but is consensus on how that is to be achieved emerging? There is probably agreement on what not to do; that is, try to write one supervisory rulebook for all the world's banks, governed by and applied by a new world bank regulator. I do not think that that is achievable or even desirable, but nor do I think that today's balkanised system of regulation&mdash;hundreds of different regulators trying to deal with a handful of global banks&mdash;can be allowed to continue.</p>
	<p pid="a.225.1/16">The question as we move towards <phrase class="date" code="2009-04-02">2 April</phrase> and the gathering in London&mdash;I would welcome the Minister's comments on this&mdash;is how we will try to bring together, from our position in the chair of the conference, a desire to draft tougher banking regulation, which I believe all European Union states agree on, with a reluctance on the part of the United States to go down that route and some hesitation among G20 members with emerging banking and financial sectors that have an interest in offering bargain-basement regulation to banks that they suspect may be looking to move away from the tougher regimes that might emerge in Europe and possibly North America. I hope that <phrase class="date" code="2009-04-02">2 April</phrase> will be able to resolve those basic points.</p>
	<p pid="a.225.1/17">I am seeking from the Minister some insight into the Government's thinking on those questions, but I always try not to pose questions without hinting at some possible answers, so I shall conclude with three ingredients that I think are necessary to ensure the kind of progress on <phrase class="date" code="2009-04-02">2 April</phrase> that I would like to see.</p>
	<p pid="a.225.1/18">First, we need agreement that the Basel system's philosophy must be abandoned, and that the underlying principles of that approach just will not work in the post-2009 world. Secondly, there must be agreement to reintroduce Glass-Steagall-style regulation, but not Glass-Steagall itself. Glass-Steagall cannot be resurrected, but what could be achieved is agreement on where the worlds of retail and investment banking should stand separately from each other, so that we can limit future taxpayer exposure, remove some of the conflicts of interest and reduce complexity in the banking system. That should offer us an opportunity to create meaningful and effective banking regulation.</p>
	<p pid="a.225.1/19">The third and final thing that needs to emerge from <phrase class="date" code="2009-04-02">2 April</phrase> is a system for designing appropriate international regulation. As I have said, we cannot possibly imagine that there will be one super-regulator covering all the world's banks&mdash;that is not realistic&mdash;but we might try to work towards something that replicates the general agreement on tariffs and trade. Perhaps we should aim for a general agreement on banking regulation which would have the same kind of recognition, authority and stature as the general agreement on tariffs and trade. That would leave it to individual countries to write the fine details of their banking regulatory codes in ways that suit their own markets, but it would also establish a common core set of minimum regulatory standards, which is missing from the context at the moment.</p>
	<p pid="a.225.1/20">It would be a terrible thing to waste this crisis. I hope that my right hon. Friend can reassure us that our Government and the other 19 who get together around that table in a couple of weeks' time understand that, so that when we look back on this crisis in international banking, we will see it as a turning point, not a lost opportunity.</p>

	<p pid="a.228.0/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1909" name="James Plaskitt">the Member for Warwick and Leamington (Mr. Plaskitt)</phrase> on securing this important and timely debate, and I welcome the opportunity to consider with him and the House the important matters that he raised.</p>
	<p pid="a.228.0/2">I was at the meeting of G20 Finance Ministers and central bank governors on Saturday. It is certainly the case that discussions with our international counterparts and partners have never been more important or more urgent, but we have made some good progress.</p>
	<p pid="a.228.0/3">We have seen that the crisis in the financial system has spread into the real economy and that every country is now affected. I visited several G20 countries to prepare for the <phrase class="date" code="2009-04-02">2 April</phrase> summit. Last month, I went to Argentina, where I was told that, for some time, people had expected that they would be decoupled from the crisis. They did not have any sub-prime mortgages and their banks did not have much exposure to US banks. It seemed that the crisis would pass them by, but then, suddenly, their exports fell off a cliff late last year. By the time of my visit, it was clear that Argentina, too, was facing serious problems.</p>
	<p pid="a.228.0/4">A group of African leaders was in the UK yesterday to meet the Prime Minister ahead of the G20 to underline their deep concern about how poverty in their countries will be impacted by the crisis, and the importance to them of the G20's response. At the weekend meeting, evidence was provided by the International Monetary Fund that showed continuing uncertainty and weakness in confidence around the world.</p>
	<p pid="a.228.0/5">At the weekend meeting, I was struck by the high degree of agreement among that disparate group of countries about the concerns that we all face. I believe that consensus is emerging on how we can act together. It is framed by the commitments in last year's Washington declaration, which have been developed subsequently through intensive joint working by finance ministries, regulators and central banks. That now provides the basis for leaders at the summit on <phrase class="date" code="2009-04-02">2 April</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.228.0/6">As my hon. Friend said, there is a firm, shared commitment to doing whatever is needed to return the world economy to growth. It emerged from the discussion that the highest priority is to stabilise the financial system. There is recognition that sustaining lending is fundamental to economic recovery. That very much highlights the concern that he paid most attention to: G20 Finance Ministers are committed to tackling the problems in the financial system head on, and they agreed at the weekend to a common set of principles for dealing with so-called impaired assets.</p>
	<p pid="a.228.0/7">We agreed that the resources of the international financial institutions need to be substantially increased to safeguard capital flows to emerging markets and developing economies. Finance Ministers made an important commitment not to repeat the mistakes of the past and turn to protectionism as we act with determination to restore growth across all those areas. Instead, we reaffirmed our commitment to open trade and investment, which are essential if we are to end rather than worsen the global crisis.</p>
	<p pid="a.228.0/8">My hon. Friend raised particularly important issues about regulation of the banking system. As he would expect, much of the weekend's discussions focused on the question of financial stability, as we cannot fix the economy until we have fixed the banks. It is essential that, in the future, the boundaries of regulation capture all institutions, markets and instruments that could pose a risk to the economy. Over the weekend, we agreed recommendations on how that could be achieved. For example, the G20 committed that all hedge funds or their managers will need to be registered, and that regulation should guard not just against risks to the health of individual firms, but against threats to the stability of the system as a whole. My hon. Friend acknowledged that my right hon. Friend the Chancellor highlighted that in the House yesterday.</p>
	<p pid="a.228.0/9">My hon. Friend has focused on questions of banks' capital adequacy, and I agree that we need fundamental steps to strengthen bank capital adequacy, risk management and supervision. That means strengthening the internationally agreed Basel II regulatory capital framework.</p>
	<p pid="a.228.0/10">In a number of respects, Basel II marks a significant improvement in prudential regulation of banks compared with what preceded it. In particular, it aims to assess more precisely regulatory capital charges in relation to risks. It has only recently been implemented and I do not think it is right to say that it is the cause of the current crisis; it is not even in place yet in the United States. I do not think that the answer is to abolish it. I accept that it needs to be significantly improved in the light of recent events. In particular, as agreed at the meeting of G20 Finance Ministers at the weekend, we must ensure that regulations dampen rather than amplify economic cycles, including by requiring banks to build buffers of resources during the good times, so that they are prepared for more difficult times.</p>

	<p pid="a.230.0/1">I hear my right hon. Friend say that the Basel system should be improved, but, as I said, my main concern is that, between Basel I and Basel II, although the second was an improvement on the first, there was no departure from the underlying principle, common to both&mdash;the internal risk-basing approach. That means, as far as I can find out, that there is no independent, objective body assessing the riskiness of any instruments in the banks, and no one independently assessing the degree to which that risk is covered off.</p>
	<p pid="a.230.0/2">The banks, even in Basel II, are still making their own definition of risk and writing their own risk profiles. They are still measuring risk on their own. That is what got banks into a serious mess and there is nothing in Basel II that will help to overcome it. Unless that principle is departed from, the Basel system will not deliver the kind of regulatory supervision that is essential.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-03-17a.230.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1563" speakername="Stephen Timms" colnum="230"  time="013:44:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090317/halltext/90317h0011.htm#09031745000622">
	<p pid="a.230.3/1">My hon. Friend was right to make the point earlier that Lord Turner will be reporting&mdash;I think that will happen tomorrow, and it will be interesting to hear what he has to say&mdash;but as my hon. Friend also said, rightly, the matter also needs to be considered at international level.</p>
	<p pid="a.230.3/2">Among the topics that we talked about on Saturday, on which we were supported, was the development of supervisory colleges, bringing together regulators in a number of countries dealing with major international banks. The development of that system has much to offer us. Another important step that was taken just before the weekend was the expansion of the Financial Stability Forum to include all the members of the G20. I hope that, internationally, we shall have much better mechanisms for handling the relevant issues than we had in the past. I hope, too, that that will mean that we are in a stronger position. That is certainly the intention of everyone who was present on Saturday.</p>
	<p pid="a.230.3/3">It is also important that we ensure that regulatory regimes do not act procyclically&mdash;a big concern in relation to Basel II&mdash;to exacerbate the current downturn, and that they manage the transition to a strengthened regulatory regime accordingly. Capital requirements should remain unchanged until recovery is assured. Finance Ministers agreed to set out proposals to strengthen international co-operation, with supervisory colleges and an early warning system comprising the IMF and the Financial Stability Forum.</p>
	<p pid="a.230.3/4">I have mentioned the expansion of the forum, and many countries&mdash;Brazil, Korea and South Africa&mdash;had been calling for that for some time. It means that a critical international institution now encompasses a much wider range of interests and provides a better basis for crucial decisions on financial stability.</p>
	<p pid="a.230.3/5">I hope my hon. Friend will feel that, at least institutionally, we are moving in the right direction and making sure that we have the institutional arrangements we need. It is essential, as we reform our regulatory arrangements, that we do not leave loopholes&mdash;several loopholes were exposed by what has happened in the past couple of years&mdash;and that our work to provide effective regulation, combat money laundering and prevent tax evasion should not be circumvented.</p>
	<p pid="a.230.3/6">Finance Ministers agreed that the relevant international institutions should identify which jurisdictions are not complying with international standards on those matters and provide toolboxes of actions that can be taken in response. As I know my hon. Friend is aware, we have been building up pressure on that over recent weeks. The UK, alongside the US, France and Germany, has been very clear that we will not tolerate tax evasion and that we want to seize the London summit as an opportunity to enhance global co-operation on that.</p>
	<p pid="a.230.3/7">There was, in the days leading up to Saturday's meeting, a series of major announcements from countries that have not in the past been willing to comply with international standards on tax information exchange&mdash;Hong Kong, Singapore and Liechtenstein&mdash;culminating in the dramatic announcement by Switzerland last Friday. At the end of Saturday's meeting at Horsham, the President of Switzerland confirmed in person to my right hon. Friend the Chancellor and to me that his Government had indeed taken that historic decision. I think we can be confident that that will lead to the provision of tax information that has not been available in the past.</p>
	<p pid="a.230.3/8">Finally, I want to make the point that international financial institutions, which are vital to ensuring that the global economy works well, need to be reformed too, to bring them into line with a changing world. The G20 agreed that emerging and developing economies should have a greater voice. The reform of IMF quotas needs to be concluded by 2011, the heads of the international financial institutions should be appointed on an open, meritocratic basis, and there needs to be reform of the instruments through which the IMF can lend. In those ways, we want to overcome the problem of stigma that has been attached to IMF programmes in the past, to the extent that some countries feel it is politically impossible to contemplate approaching the fund.</p>
	<p pid="a.230.3/9">I think that the conclusions I have outlined provide a comprehensive framework for getting the global economy back on track, including addressing the issues that my hon. Friend rightly raised.</p>
	<p pid="a.230.3/10">2 pm</p>
	<p pid="a.230.3/11" class="italic">Sitting adjourned without Question put (<phrase class="standing-order" code="10(11)">Standing Order No. 10(11)</phrase>).</p>
