	<p pid=".1.4/1">I am very grateful for the opportunity to start a debate on disability benefits. It is an issue of great importance not only to the 10 million disabled people in this country, but to their families, friends and all of us who, in the words of the Disability Rights Commission, want a society where disabled people can participate fully as equal citizens.</p>
	<p pid=".1.4/2">I want to raise three issues. We could spend hours discussing disability benefits&mdash;there is a range of incredibly important issues&mdash;but the three issues that I   want to focus on are the current debates about incapacity benefit, the recent report by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation on the additional costs of disability, and age discrimination in the system of disability benefits with particular reference to the disability living allowance. It will not be the first time that that issue has been raised in the House; I hope that it might be the last, but we shall find that out when the Minister makes her winding-up speech. I am delighted that the Minister is here to speak on behalf of the Government today. She is an outstanding Minister for   disabled people, and is widely respected inside the    House and out, particularly among disability organisations.</p>
	<p pid=".1.4/3">In recent weeks there has been a spate of hostile media stories about incapacity benefit, which have taken many forms. One group of them has suggested that consideration was being given to cuts in the level of incapacity benefit, or restrictions on eligibility. I was delighted when the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions gave an assurance in the House on <phrase class="date" code="2004-10-11">11 October</phrase>, and I should like to place it on the record again so everyone is clear about it. On <phrase class="date" code="2004-10-11">11 October</phrase>, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/733" name="Harold Best">the Member for Leeds, North-West (Mr. Best)</phrase> asked the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions for an assurance that the Government had no plans to cut incapacity benefit or rights to it. The Secretary of State replied:</p>
	<p pid=".1.4/4" class="indent">&quot;I assure my hon. Friend that we have no such plans.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".1.4/5">Later he said:</p>
	<p pid=".1.4/6" class="indent">&quot;I saw some of those press reports on the first weekend that I took on the job. None of them is based on fact.&quot;&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2004-10-11.2"><i>Official Report</i>, 11 October 2004; Vol. 425, c. 2&ndash;3</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid=".1.4/7">I was delighted when my right hon. Friend made that statement, and I am delighted that that remains the policy of the Government.</p>
	<p pid=".1.4/8">There have been other media stories that have not referred to speculation about the future of IB. Those stories have suggested that incapacity benefit is out of control in some sense. A well-known tabloid had the front-page headline, &quot;Sicknote Britain&quot;. I will not name the publication because I do not want to give it any publicity. The &quot;Sicknote Britain&quot; story implied that people can simply pop along to their GP, get signed off and claim incapacity benefit. Every Member knows that they have constituents for whom that description of getting incapacity benefit has no basis in reality. It could not be further from the truth. Many of my constituents&mdash;I am sure that this is the case for all hon. and right hon. Members&mdash;have enormous difficulty in trying to satisfy a Department for Work and Pensions-approved doctor that they are unable to work because of disability or illness. The most striking thing about the system is that an alarming number of people who are   rejected when they make an incapacity benefit application miraculously find that on appeal they get it back. That does not suggest that those who are assessing people for incapacity benefit are doing so in a way that makes life easy for those people. Indeed, I know from personal experience of my constituents that the system makes it incredibly difficult for many deserving applicants for incapacity benefit.</p>
	<p pid=".1.4/9">At Prime Minister's questions, the Leader of the Opposition also asserted that</p>
	<p pid=".1.4/10" class="indent">&quot;incapacity benefit is out of control&quot;.&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2004-09-15.1262"><i>Official Report</i>, 15 September 2004; Vol. 424, c. 1262</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid=".1.4/11">I obviously had the courtesy to drop him a note to say that I would refer to that. To say that incapacity benefit is out of control is not only nonsense, but arrant nonsense. The number of people in receipt of incapacity benefit has been falling for a decade. It is not only nonsense to support fallacious stories of that kind, but deeply offensive to people who rely on incapacity benefit and who, as I have said, in many cases have to fight very hard to secure that to which they are entitled.</p>

	<p pid=".2.0/1">Has the hon. Gentleman discovered that medical examiners are not listening carefully to the clients that they are examining and are ticking off boxes wrongly, and that that is one of the reasons why appeals have been so successful?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2004-11-02.2.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/732" speakername="Roger Berry" colnum="2"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200304/cmhansrd/vo041102/halltext/41102h01.htm#41102h01_spnew3">
	<p pid=".2.1/1">The hon. Gentleman raises an important point. That is certainly the allegation that has been repeatedly made to me. The fact that such a large proportion of incapacity benefit claimants who have their initial application rejected win on appeal&mdash;I think that the figure is close to 50 per cent.&mdash;is suggestive to me. But it is not just what I believe is happening; it is what those in the appeal system believe is happening. I would be interested to hear from the Minister how the Department for Work and Pensions plans to address that problem.</p>
	<p pid=".2.1/2">The facts are simple. The number of people in receipt of incapacity benefit has fallen by 20 per cent. since 1995. The current number of beneficiaries is fewer than 1.5 million; 10 years ago it was more than 1.8 million. At the same time, as we all appreciate, there has been a huge increase in the number of women entering the labour market, paying national insurance contributions and, therefore, should they be sufficiently ill or disabled not to be able to work, having an entitlement to claim. So, there has been a significant and sustained reduction in the number of people in receipt of incapacity benefit at the same time as a growing number of people are entitled to it.</p>
	<p pid=".2.1/3">Anybody who believes that incapacity benefit is out of control is more attracted to soundbites and slogans than to the reality of what is going on in our community. People may say that numbers do not matter and that we should be looking at the proportion of the working-age population. That is fine. The proportion of the working-age population in this country in receipt of incapacity benefit has fallen over the past 10 years. Why? It is because, as the Government rightly point out, the number of people flowing into incapacity benefit is falling. It has gone down by about 40 per cent. over the past 10 years, from 1 million on an annual basis to about 600,000. I repeat: let us have no more, please, of this nonsense that incapacity benefit is out of control. Nothing could be further from the truth.</p>
	<p pid=".2.1/4">I shall make two final comments about incapacity benefit before I move on. First, fraud is virtually non-existent. People have a legitimate concern that our social security system should be fraud-free. We have a responsibility to chase up people who want fraudulently to claim benefits to which they are not entitled. However, the Office for National Statistics has found that evidence of fraud is virtually insignificant, statistically. The margin of error is less than half of 1 per cent. That is trivial compared with other forms of fraud that occur in our society. Fraud is virtually non-existent, so incapacity benefit is not out of control in that sense either.</p>
	<p pid=".2.1/5">Finally, the benefit is not a generous one. On average, it comes to &pound;84.51 a week. I do not know how many hon. or right hon. Members would, if they were sufficiently ill or disabled as to be unable to work, find it easy to survive on &pound;84.51 a week. The benefit is not getting any more generous compared with average earnings. The incapacity benefit payable to a single person qualifying for the long-term rate fell from 17.4 per cent. of average earnings in 1995 to 15.2 per cent. of average earnings in 2003.</p>

	<p pid=".3.0/1">Will my hon. Friend say a word about those people who receive incapacity benefit who would like to get into work but who face real difficulties in doing so? First, the reorganisation of the Department for Work and Pensions has taken services away. The second real disadvantage is that some people fear that, if they went to work, they would lose their benefits.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2004-11-02.3.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/732" speakername="Roger Berry" colnum="3"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200304/cmhansrd/vo041102/halltext/41102h01.htm#41102h01_spnew5">
	<p pid=".3.1/1">My hon. Friend must be psychic. I was about to say that, having demonstrated that incapacity benefit is not the problem that some suggest, there is a problem: many disabled people who are in receipt of incapacity benefit because they are unable to or cannot get work, would like to work. Therefore, I    warmly welcome the Government's initiatives to enable disabled people to get into work. The new deal for disabled people, access to work, and the pathways to work pilots are making real progress.</p>
	<p pid=".3.1/2">As the Department for Work and Pensions announced on <phrase class="date" code="2004-10-11">11 October</phrase>, the results of the pathways to work pilots demonstrate that twice as many incapacity benefit claimants in those areas are finding jobs as are those in other areas. It is a success story. My hon. Friend is right to suggest that the focus on reducing the number of people in receipt of incapacity benefit recognises that many people do not wish to be in receipt of incapacity benefit; they wish to work. The focus on reducing the number of people in receipt of incapacity benefit intends to give support to enable them to do precisely that.</p>
	<p pid=".3.1/3">When I think of pathways to work, I think of my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1230" name="Andrew Smith">the Member for Oxford, East (Mr. Smith)</phrase>, the previous Secretary of State for Work and Pensions. I place on record my thanks to him for all that he, together with the Minister, did in promoting the pathways to work pilots. It is the right direction in which to go in enabling disabled people to access the labour market. That is the success that we need to build on. There is, therefore, a powerful case for labour market programmes of that kind.</p>
	<p pid=".3.1/4">In the UK, we are spending more on labour market programmes, but compared with the rest of the European Union we spend little. The European Commission says that UK spending on labour market programmes for disabled people is about 0.02 per cent. of GDP. That is less than one fifth of the average for the European Union and way behind the support given in Scandinavian countries.</p>
	<p pid=".3.1/5">So, the problem with incapacity benefit is not that it is out of control. One problem is that the amount it pays those who are unable to work is far too low. The other problem is that many people on incapacity benefit      could secure work if the obstacles to employment were removed. We should, therefore, support the Government's efforts to remove those obstacles.</p>
	<p pid=".3.1/6">I turn briefly to a report published a couple of weeks ago by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation on the additional costs of disability. The report was based on a survey of disabled people who were living in different circumstances and had different types of impairment. To my knowledge it is, to date, the only research of that kind. The report demonstrates beyond doubt that disability benefits are substantially below the income required to ensure a decent standard of living.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2004-11-02.4.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1282" speakername="Paddy Tipping" colnum="4"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200304/cmhansrd/vo041102/halltext/41102h01.htm#41102h01_spnew6">
	<p pid=".4.0/1">I am grateful to my hon. Friend for giving way again. The Joseph Rowntree Foundation report is strong on the extra cost faced by people with a disability. Does he, like me and the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, find it rather odd that winter heating allowances are made available to elderly people, but not to people with real and additional needs, such as many people with disabilities? They do not qualify, although their needs are clear.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2004-11-02.4.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/732" speakername="Roger Berry" colnum="4"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200304/cmhansrd/vo041102/halltext/41102h01.htm#41102h01_spnew7">
	<p pid=".4.1/1">My hon. Friend is absolutely right. One additional cost that the Rowntree report identified was heating. It estimated that heating bills are up to one third higher for disabled people than for non-disabled people. I share my hon. Friend's view that it is not fair that the 1.3 million severely disabled people under the age of 60 and not entitled to winter fuel allowances do   not receive support to cover that extra cost. The allowance recognises the problem that particular families may have in meeting heating costs. Why it should be people over 60 only who have that problem, I do not know.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2004-11-02.5.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1357" speakername="Martin Smyth" colnum="5"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200304/cmhansrd/vo041102/halltext/41102h01.htm#41102h01_spnew8">
	<p pid=".5.0/1">I appreciate the hon. Gentleman's giving way. I appreciate also that he is dealing with disability benefits. When we talk about the cost of disability and of those under pensionable age, however, does he acknowledge that England in particular needs to come into line with Northern Ireland and abolish the means-testing of homes fit for children who are disabled?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2004-11-02.5.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/732" speakername="Roger Berry" colnum="5"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200304/cmhansrd/vo041102/halltext/41102h01.htm#41102h01_spnew9">
	<p pid=".5.1/1">I very much agree. I have long supported the campaign for England to follow Northern Ireland in that respect, and I warmly welcome the intervention.</p>
	<p pid=".5.1/2">Early-day motion 108, which I tabled last November, relates to winter fuel payments for severely disabled people. It has 153 cross-party signatures and reflects the views of my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1282" name="Paddy Tipping">the Member for Sherwood (Paddy Tipping)</phrase> and myself. I hope that the Minister in her winding-up speech will respond positively to the suggestion that the allowance should be extended to severely disabled people. In terms of a definition, those people on the middle or higher rate of the disability living allowance care component and those on the higher rate of the mobility component fit the bill as those people who need significant additional resources to meet the heating costs arising from their disability.</p>
	<p pid=".5.1/3">Overall, the Rowntree report identified that for many disabled people personal assistance was the greatest cost. That includes interpreters for deaf people, support for personal care and so on. Even if that largest cost is left out of consideration and we simply look at other costs, such as food, clothing, transport and housing, according to the report disabled people on benefits are at least &pound;800 a month short of being able to enjoy an acceptable quality of life. Many press reports said that the Rowntree report stated that disabled people are &pound;800 a month short, but that is after the substantial cost of personal assistance has been taken out. If it is included, the figure is much higher.</p>
	<p pid=".5.1/4">The shortfall in income has many implications. It must be addressed through environmental improvement, with better access to transport and buildings, and it must be addressed through enhanced service provision, better wages for people who have jobs and improved benefits for those who are unable to work. The first implication of the Rowntree report is that disability benefits are too low. The second conclusion is that current statistics seriously underestimate poverty among disabled people and their families. Government statistics show that 29 per cent.&mdash;almost one third&mdash;of households with a disabled person are poor, compared with only 17 per cent. of households without a disabled person. The Rowntree report shows that those statistics seriously underestimate the true extent of poverty among disabled people simply because they do not take into account the additional costs of disability.</p>
	<p pid=".5.1/5">Therefore, one factor that contributes to poverty and the isolation of disabled people is an ungenerous benefits system. Another is that older disabled people face age discrimination within the benefits system. A few days ago, on <phrase class="date" code="2004-10-20">20 October</phrase>, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/788" name="Martin Caton">the Member for Gower (Mr. Caton)</phrase> briefly raised this issue in his Adjournment debate on disability living allowance, although he focused mainly on the lower age limit for eligibility for the mobility component. He expressed concern, which many hon. Members share, about the inherent age discrimination in our system of disability benefits, particularly disability living allowance, which cannot be claimed after the age of 65 unless an entitlement has already been established before that age. It is a curious system. People who claim and are awarded DLA before their 65th birthday&mdash;for example, on their 64th birthday&mdash;can carry it forward beyond the age of 65. However, someone who claims and is awarded DLA on the day after their 65th birthday does not get it and is told to rely on the much more limited attendance allowance.</p>
	<p pid=".5.1/6">That is a curious feature of a social security system, not least because attendance allowance is, as we all know, an inadequate alternative for many reasons. It does not contain a mobility component, so those aged 65 and over cannot receive help with mobility costs. Many of my constituents, family and friends over the age of 65 have mobility problems that incur significant additional costs, but, unless they have claimed before their 65th birthday, DLA cannot be used to help out. In addition, the DLA mobility component is the gateway to the Motability scheme to provide adapted cars, powered wheelchairs and so on. The age bar on DLA means that the vast majority of disabled older people are denied access to the scheme. In addition, the attendance allowance has no equivalent of the lower rate of care component of DLA, so again the situation is perverse and older people must have greater care needs than younger people to receive help with care costs.</p>
	<p pid=".5.1/7">In summary, I believe that the benefits system should be available to provide support on the basis of need, not of age. The current system devalues the role of older people in society. It does not enable them to participate in society to the full and is clearly age-discriminatory. It is hardly surprising that there is a growing campaign to do something about that.</p>
	<p pid=".5.1/8">Hon. Members will be aware of the &quot;Mobilise&quot; campaign to end age discrimination in disability benefits. It was launched earlier this year by more than 20 of the most influential organisations in the field of disability and ageing. Those who support this campaign include the Disability Rights Commission, which was set up by the Government to advise them on how to ensure equal opportunities for disabled people, Age Concern, Carers UK, Citizens Advice, Help the Aged, the Royal British Legion, the Royal National Institute of the Blind, and so on.</p>
	<p pid=".5.1/9">In March I tabled early-day motion 953 urging the Government to support the aims of the campaign and to end age discrimination in disability benefits. When I logged on at 9 o'clock this morning, I discovered that 234 right hon. and hon. Members have now signed that early-day motion. Of the 2,040-odd early-day motions on the Order Paper, only 16 have more signatures, and this one is moving up the list. I acknowledge and celebrate the fact that the Government are spending an extra &pound;10 billion every year on pensioners in comparison with 1997. I celebrate the fact that almost half that extra money is going to help some of the poorest pensioners. I acknowledge that, inside and outside the House. However, the fact of the matter is that we still have a benefit for disabled people that is age-discriminatory and has the bizarre implication that if someone gets their application in a few hours before they are 65, they are all right, but if they do so a few hours afterwards, they are not.</p>
	<p pid=".5.1/10">That policy of age discrimination is in stark contrast to the Government's commendable commitment to equality and diversity. They plan to abolish age discrimination at work by 2006, and I say well done to that&mdash;great stuff. The national service framework for older people includes a strong statement against age discrimination in health and social care, but if that is wrong in social care, why is it right in the social security system? I simply do not understand that. All disabled people, regardless of age, should receive financial assistance based on their need to participate equally in society.</p>
	<p pid=".5.1/11">The Government have an outstanding record on disability issues. We have a Disability Rights Commission and we passed the Special Educational Needs and Disability Act 2001. Loopholes in the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 have been plugged, and a new disability discrimination Bill is to be introduced any minute&mdash;the Minister will tell us at the end of the debate when that will be. We have the new deal for disabled people, more money for access to work and the pathways to work pilots, and, yes, we have had a number of significant improvements in disability benefits. That is a record of which the Government should be proud, but we need to challenge the nonsense that some people still put forward about incapacity benefit, we need to recognise that disability benefits are too low and we need to tackle age discrimination that denies older disabled people the opportunity fully to participate in society.</p>

	<p pid=".7.4/1">I support <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/732" name="Roger Berry">the hon. Member for Kingswood (Mr. Berry)</phrase>, with whom I have worked on these issues over the years, and I, too, pay tribute to successive Governments who have improved care and provision for people with disability. However, I learned many years ago that the biggest room in the world is the room for improvement. In that context, I agree with the    arguments on age discrimination, particularly the tendency to minimise the opportunity for elderly people to get out and about. That is one reason why I      wholeheartedly support the hon. Gentleman's argument that those over 65 should also be entitled to mobility allowance.</p>
	<p pid=".7.4/2">However, I want particularly to deal with another aspect of discrimination: in education. This was recently brought to my attention by a family in my constituency. As hon. Members know, we do not have the same opportunity at present to debate such issues in Northern Ireland, so it is important that we raise them in this place.</p>
	<p pid=".7.4/3">A young girl with a medical condition that could eventually lead to complete blindness was preparing for further education at the special school in Jordanstown. The education authority was aware of her needs through the reports that were made each year. This year, she moved to the national school for the blind in order to equip herself for her future life. Unfortunately, it seems that the education authority in Belfast did not follow through the reports that were sent to it. As a result, the young girl was turned down for an education grant.</p>
	<p pid=".7.4/4">What disturbed me even more was that when I took the matter up with the board and the Minister I was told that no grants were available because the girl was doing an academic course rather than a vocational one. There is discrimination on the grounds of disability and also in respect of future prospects. It is short-sighted to be prepared to equip someone for a vocational job but not in an academic capacity.</p>
	<p pid=".7.4/5">I raise the matter in the hope that perhaps somewhere in the labyrinthine pathways of government there will be another examination to determine whether such obstacles to young people who have the potential to develop might be removed, so that they may be enabled to develop and so that eventually young and old might be treated equally in law and in the benefits system.</p>

	<p pid=".8.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/732" name="Roger Berry">the hon. Member for Kingswood (Mr. Berry)</phrase> on securing the debate. It is far from the first time that he and I have taken part in such a debate, whether in Westminster Hall, the main Chamber or elsewhere. He made a powerful case on behalf of disabled people, as he has on every occasion on which I have heard him speak. As always, I agree with almost the entirety of his comments.</p>
	<p pid=".8.0/2">The hon. Gentleman began by referring to the recent media hype about pushing people off incapacity benefit. According to some newspapers&mdash;and, indeed, some politicians&mdash;too many people are claiming benefits who do not deserve them and, who are swinging the lead. The Prime Minister has said that many IB claimants were pushed from unemployment into incapacity benefit in the 1980s and early 1990s in order to massage the unemployment figures. That comment has been repeated several times in recent years, and there have been many comments in the media and from politicians about the perceived problem of the number of IB claimants being out of control. In his opening comments, the hon. Gentleman did a good job of demolishing many such arguments and revealing them to be based on nonsense.</p>
	<p pid=".8.0/3">I said that I could agree with almost everything that the hon. Gentleman said in his speech, but of course one has to step back briefly from some of his points. I was a little alarmed to hear that he was reassured by the new Secretary of State, who assured Parliament that there were no plans to crack down on IB claimants. I wonder just how much reassurance we can take from the wording, &quot;there are no such plans.&quot; I remember the 1997   general election, when the then Leader of the Opposition, who was about to become Prime Minister, told the London <i>Evening Standard</i> that he had no plans to introduce tuition fees.</p>

	<p pid=".9.0/1"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/732" name="Roger Berry">The hon. Member for Kingswood (Mr. Berry)</phrase> was quite right about the exchange in which <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/733" name="Harold Best">the hon. Member for Leeds, North-West (Mr. Best)</phrase> was involved. He no doubt inadvertently did not go on to read the further exchange between the Minister and I, later in the same series of questions. I asked the Minister specifically whether he would rule out putting time limits on incapacity benefit during this Parliament. The Minister said&mdash;I think I am quoting him more or less accurately&mdash;that he was not ruling anything in or out at this stage.</p>

	<p pid=".9.1/1">I agree entirely with that point, which reinforces what I was saying. When the words are, &quot;We have no such plans&quot; we have to consider whether, metaphorically or literally, the rider &quot;at the moment&quot; is there. In 1997 we were told that there were &quot;no such plans&quot; to introduce tuition fees, but four months later we discovered that they were going to be introduced and that free grants for poorer students were to be scrapped. We need to consider the context in which things are said.</p>
	<p pid=".9.1/2">Given the amount of coverage that this issue has had, we must have a little sceptical doubt about whether the threats will materialise, or whether they will just be part of election media hype, in which the Prime Minister unfortunately seems to want to play to that particular audience, perhaps to keep a certain newspaper proprietor on side.</p>

	<p pid=".9.3/1">I am in the unusual position of so far being able to agree with everyone, from both sides, although I am sure that that will not last. The Leader of the official Opposition has indeed made rather out-of-control statements about how IB is out of control. We have already heard a very good demolition of that argument, with some good statistics to prove that the underlying facts do not back it up. We have heard the Prime Minister, many in the press and many from the official Opposition recently saying that we need to do something about the runaway problem of IB claimants. I agree with the hon. Member for Kingswood that the problem is not quite as it has been portrayed in the press, and I shall return to that later.</p>
	<p pid=".9.3/2">We have heard comments about the difficulty that people seeking to go on to IB have in passing through the necessary gateways. One of those, which several hon. Members have mentioned in previous debates, is the problem that people have in getting past the doctors appointed by the Department for Work and Pensions, or by the privatised contractor that runs part of that system, and in getting those doctors to accept that they are genuinely incapacitated or disabled.</p>
	<p pid=".9.3/3">I have previously mentioned examples from Chesterfield, which is a coal-mining area&mdash;although there are no pits now&mdash;with a long legacy of former miners. Many people there have, over many years, gone through the difficult medical process of proving that because of their work in the mines, they suffer from lung disease, vibration white finger and other related illnesses. They have gone through lengthy processes established by the former mineworkers union, the medical system and the Government, including visiting expert medical centres based in Nottingham, and they have established that they are indeed incapacitated. They then go for a quick 20-minute interview with a Government-appointed doctor, who casually ticks off the appropriate boxes on the forms and says, &quot;Oh no, you're fit&quot;, or, &quot;You're only 50 per cent. disabled, not 80 per cent.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".9.3/4">People come to my surgeries absolutely furious that, having taken two, three or four years to prove their disability with medical experts who specialise in that field, they can then be casually dismissed as all right in 20 minutes, and perhaps have their benefit cut by half because they are told that they are only partially incapacitated. That is often not really a medical assessment at all. A constituent of mine on IB, not a miner this time, was visited by the doctor at home, rather than having to go to an appointment. When the report was submitted, it said that he was not entitled to IB because he had a heavy garage door that was manually operated, which clearly proved that he was able because the car was not parked on the front drive, so it must be inside the garage, whose door the man must be opening and shutting every day. The doctor never asked about or commented on that to the man. In fact, the car was not on the drive because it was an automatic and permanently parked on the road&mdash;it was not in the garage, but the doctor had just jumped to an assumption that was nothing to do with medical grounds.</p>

	<p pid=".10.0/1">I hope that the hon. Gentleman will report any such incidents that he comes across to the Department, because we now have much more rigorous ways of dealing with inappropriate quality in medical services reports. I advise all hon. Members to ensure that they tell us of such incidents that they come across.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2004-11-02.10.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/968" speakername="Paul Holmes" colnum="10"  time="010:02:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200304/cmhansrd/vo041102/halltext/41102h01.htm#41102h01_spnew20">
	<p pid=".10.1/1">I accept the Minister's point. In fact, the case has been dealt with and solved.</p>
	<p pid=".10.1/2">To finish the story: that was one of the points that the doctor made as part of a so-called medical assessment. A second point was that the claimant's garden was in immaculate condition so clearly he was not so disabled that he could not go out and do the garden every day. Those two observations had no basis in medical fact. They were not discussed with the claimant at all. The doctor simply went away and wrote them up. When I took the case up, both through the Department and the complaints procedures, we got an apology and the total reversal of the finding.</p>
	<p pid=".10.1/3">In that instance, a reversal did occur. However, these are not just isolated cases. They are widespread across the country; they do not just occur in my constituency. The number of successful appeals against rulings by Department for Work and Pensions-appointed doctors has been increasing year on year over the past few years. Depending on the category, the success rate for appeals ranges from something like 46 per cent. to 53 or 54 per cent. The average is about 50 per cent. That figure has been increasing year by year, as questions that I and other hon. Members have tabled in Parliament have shown. There is clearly a problem, and it is not down to one or two rogue doctors, but down to the whole process, which seems to be designed to trick people and to exclude them from benefits because the problem is seen to be out of control. As a result, people are getting unfair treatment.</p>
	<p pid=".10.1/4">We heard about the long-running campaign on winter fuel payments for disabled people. We have debated that a number of times over the past few years and hon. Members were debating it long before I entered Parliament in 2001. This year, there is a motion in Parliament, which many MPs have signed and which was tabled by the hon. Member for Kingswood. Last year, I tabled a similar motion and the year before that it was the hon. Gentleman again. This is a cross-party programme that also gets widespread support across all the disability organisations. <i>Disability Now</i>, in particular, deserves a lot of credit for the way in which it has spearheaded the campaign over the years.</p>
	<p pid=".10.1/5">However, every time that Ministers respond we hear nothing of comfort. It is argued that disabled people get various benefits already so those should cover any extra fuel costs that they have. That seems disingenuous. Pensioners, who might be very well off because they have good private pensions&mdash;perhaps they are retired MPs, for example&mdash;automatically get the winter fuel payment because they have reached the age of 65, whether they need it or not. They receive the payment whether or not they are able-bodied, poor or particularly suffer from the cold. They may well live in an extremely well appointed and centrally heated house and not need the payment at all.</p>
	<p pid=".10.1/6">There are other people, below the age of 65, who are disabled and who, because of the nature of that disability, feel the cold much more than many pensioners, yet they are excluded from the extra payment. A disabled person will not be going out to a   place of work, so they have to heat their house 24 hours a day. People at work, in places such as the overheated&mdash;in more senses than one&mdash;House of Commons, do not need to pay fuel bills for that part of the working week, but a disabled person does not have that advantage. They have to heat their house 24 hours a day, seven days a week and, because of the nature of various disabilities, they will feel the cold much more than other people, including quite a number of pensioners&mdash;although the older and frailer pensioners get, the more they need the payment as well.</p>
	<p pid=".10.1/7">It seems illogical that although we provide the winter fuel payment to all pensioners automatically&mdash;I would not argue against that&mdash;we exclude disabled people who might be only 60, 61 or 62, or 30, but who feel the cold in winter to a far greater extent because of their medical condition. This is a long-running campaign. We have debated the issue a number of times and we have still never heard the appropriate Minister give any ground or offer any hope that there will be movement on it. Perhaps, in 30 or 40 minutes' time, we shall all be relieved to hear that the Government are going to move on the issue.</p>
	<p pid=".10.1/8">We heard an eloquent description of the problems that age barriers present to older disabled people when trying to access certain things that are available to younger disabled people. That is the reverse of the winter fuel situation. Older disabled people may not be able to get carer's allowance or Motability money because they are pensioners and therefore do not qualify. That seems ludicrous. While campaigning, one of the disability organisations pointed out: &quot;If you are going to have a serious motor accident and become disabled, make sure you do it when you are 64, before your 65th birthday, because a few days before your 65th birthday you will qualify for all sorts of assistance for mobility, care and support. Five days after your 65th birthday, you won't qualify because you don't need that support any more because you are an old-age pensioner.&quot; There is no logic whatever to that approach.</p>
	<p pid=".10.1/9">We need to step back and carry out some more independent assessments of the purpose of the benefit system in relation to a whole range of benefits. I have pointed out that we have not had an up-to-date definition of poverty since William Beveridge produced one in the 1940s. That is 60 years out of date now. When assessing poverty levels in relation to what is required of benefits, and what is to be achieved through them, we need proper, up-to-date assessment of those levels and of the purpose of the benefit. That particularly applies to disabled people who have become pensioners but can no longer get access to things like Motability. There is no logic to that.</p>
	<p pid=".10.1/10">Why are we providing care, attendance allowance and Motability allowances to disabled people? It is because they need it due to their condition. Why would they no longer need it when they pass a certain age limit and become classed as a pensioner?</p>

	<p pid=".12.1/1">I accept the correction on that point.</p>
	<p pid=".12.1/2">The opening speech touched on one or two points relating to helping people with disability who were claiming IB to get into work. We shall hear from the Minister in half an hour or so a litany of success and good things that the Government have done, and undoubtedly it is true that the Government have a good record of improving the situation of disabled people, as I have acknowledged a number of times before. However, as we heard in the opening comments, although that record is good by European standards and is much better than what happened prior to 1997, there is an awful lot more ground to cover.</p>
	<p pid=".12.1/3">For example, we have a new deal programme to help people into work, which covers a range of people from the young to the elderly, disabled and so on. Just 3 per cent. of the new deal budget of three quarters of a billion pounds per year helps one of the groups that needs help most in order to overcome all sorts of barriers to get into work: the disabled. Only 3 per cent. of the total goes to the group that needs help more than any other.</p>

	<p pid=".13.0/1">Is the hon. Gentleman suggesting that disabled people cannot benefit from all the new deals? The figures show that 180,000 have been helped back to work by all the new deals and only 45,000 by the new deal for disabled people.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2004-11-02.13.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/968" speakername="Paul Holmes" colnum="13"  time="010:02:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200304/cmhansrd/vo041102/halltext/41102h01.htm#41102h01_spnew24">
	<p pid=".13.1/1">I am going to develop the point that disabled people often experience a particular range of circumstances that make it hard for them to get back into work. The standard new deal processes applied with short-term targets lead to a rush to get people into work quickly. Personal advisers meet the targets set for them, and there is a strong tendency&mdash;well documented by reports from the Department for Work and Pensions, the National Audit Office and the Public Accounts Committee&mdash;to go for the superficial opportunities for people who would find work anyway and to ignore the more difficult cases.</p>
	<p pid=".13.1/2">We are talking about disabled people, but I have made the same point in other debates about people coming off drugs and alcohol. There are progress2work programmes for those coming off drugs, one of which is being piloted in the Chesterfield area, and I have been to visit it. That pilot is proving quite successful, but it is a limited one. People with low educational attainment, rather than learning disabilities, would be another category to consider. There are various such categories, of which the disabled is probably the largest, where people experience particular problems in getting into work&mdash;much more so than the average jobseeker.</p>
	<p pid=".13.1/3">Before staff can even consider helping such people to seek work, they have to start further back with personal confidence, life skills and communication skills. I have talked before about a pilot project set up three years ago by the chamber of commerce in Chesterfield. There are many Government replicas of it throughout the country now. The project began working with people who were disabled and may never have worked in their lives. Before it could even think of trying to get those people into a work experience programme or job placement, it had to spend weeks and months on people's life skills and self-confidence, or on tasks such as showing them a computer and how to use it, which is a huge obstacle in the modern labour market for someone aged 50 who has never worked, let alone someone aged 50 from an old manual industry such as mining. Large groups of people, particularly disabled people, face specific problems that the superficial quick-fix approach of the new deal in general has not dealt with. We should target much more of the new deal money to the particularly hard-to-place groups instead of to the groups that, as reports by the Department for Work and Pensions, the   National Audit Office and the Public Account Committee have said repeatedly over the past seven years, will get jobs anyway. The money has not been as well spent as it might have been and there are many examples of that among disabled people.</p>
	<p pid=".13.1/4">During the opening speech, we heard some good examples of Government experiments, and all credit to them. The pathways to work experiment is being piloted in half a dozen areas throughout the country, including the Chesterfield and north Derbyshire area. I have talked to the personal advisers who are delivering the scheme, which is not even a year old&mdash;it was six months old when I talked to them&mdash;and they were full of praise for it. It is an excellent scheme to help disabled people to go back to work. There were problems; one was the Government's obsession with imposing sanctions on vulnerable people, such as writing to every disabled person and telling them to come in for a compulsory interview or else. That had a hugely frightening effect on people. The personal advisers that I spoke to said that they know when the letter will arrive, so they ring the recipient the day before and the day after to tell them not to panic or worry about it and that all they have to do is to come in and have a chat. The personal advisers waste a lot of time trying to undo the harm that is done by the standard letter that threatens sanctions if the recipients do not go in for an interview. We have discussed previously the Government's obsession with sanctions, and an increasing number of reports from the Department for Work and Pensions document the problem of sanctions driving people back to crime, drugs and the black economy, and off benefits.</p>
	<p pid=".13.1/5">The pathways to work pilot to help disabled people is excellent. It is less than a year old, but is proving to be extremely successful so far and very innovative. However, it is more intensive and the tick-box targets for putting people into sustained jobs quickly cannot be hit because there are so many initial obstacles to overcome. There are particular problems with benefits. The Liberal Democrats have long argued that there should be a partial benefit that recognises that some disabled people will not be able to return to full-time work. Some disabilities come and go, such as multiple sclerosis, and sufferers may be able to work one week but not the next. There should be a partial benefit that recognises that some disabled people want to work&mdash;1 million of them say that they do&mdash;but want help to enable them to do so. A partial benefits system would allow such a balance.</p>
	<p pid=".13.1/6">One obstacle that all the surveys showed was that when disabled people want to return to work they are scared that, having spent so long getting access to benefits, which are not especially generous, they will lose them if they try a job and find that after a month they cannot keep up with it because of their disability, and will again face the problem of trying to get back on to benefits. The Government are making improvements, but that problem is still a major one for disabled people. The pathways to work experiment is helping in some ways and provides support for people going into work, but only for a year. The pilots are not even a year old yet, so we do not know what happens at the end of a year. What will happen to those who lose the temporary support of payments and benefits and must rely entirely on a wage? Experiments in the right direction are paving the way, but there are not enough of them.</p>
	<p pid=".13.1/7">If the Government believe in evidence-based policies&mdash;they so often say that, but we do not see them materialise&mdash;they should look at the success of their own pilots for disabled people and to help ex-drug addicts and so on.</p>
	<p pid=".13.1/8">To return to a comment made during the opening speech, there is progress and there are good experiments, but the expenditure on helping people in those categories to get into work could be increased by 500 per cent. and that would only bring us to the European average. We have started down the path and are making improvements, but we are well behind good examples in this area.</p>
	<p pid=".13.1/9">The Shaw Trust is another success story. I have visited two of its projects, and it is the biggest job broker for the   Department for Work and Pensions. It is very successful, dealing with 30,000 people out of 1 million who want work this year alone. That is progress but still a drop in the ocean.</p>
	<p pid=".13.1/10">Many projects are being told this year that they are too successful and that they must stop placing disabled people in work. The Shaw Trust has talked to me about that, as has the Groundwork Trust, and the press have documented a whole series of incidents where trusts that are too successful and are outstripping the resources available are being told that they must cut back for the rest of the year and not place any more people. That is so short-sighted, because every disabled person who goes to work saves the Government money in benefits and taxes. Every success story saves the taxpayer money, and it boosts the self-esteem and lifestyle of the person getting back into work. I urge the Minister to look again at what many disabled organisations working in that area are saying. Their budgets are being cut this year because they are too successful at placing people in work.</p>

	<p pid=".15.1/1">If that is what I said, I will correct it. The trusts are not having their budgets cut; they are having them frozen, because they are outstripping the available money. One can see the short-term logic of that. The Papworth Trust is another, along with the Shaw Trust and the Groundwork Trust, which says that budgets are being frozen, and they cannot all be wrong. I was a head of department in a school, and in any organisation in any year, one has a certain budget that one cannot exceed. In this particular instance, I ask the Minister to look again, because every person who gets into work through such schemes saves the taxpayer money in benefits and taxation. The trusts are a good investment, which saves money over many years. Pilots that are becoming too successful are being told that they will have to lay off staff for the rest of the financial year because they have got too many people into work.</p>

My recollection is that the Government have a commitment to eradicate child poverty, and there has been considerable debate about what eradication might mean. They have three targets for eradicating child poverty. I am not entirely convinced of the merits of one of them, but it is inaccurate to say that the Government have no targets.</p>

I prepared for the debate by going back to mug up on the gospel according to Berry. I re-read his speech from <phrase class="date" code="2003-05-21">21 May 2003</phrase> during the debate on the European year of disabled people. It was one of the first that I read when I took up my appointment as shadow Minister for disabled people. I also re-read his speech on Second Reading of the Carers (Equal Opportunities) Bill on <phrase class="date" code="2004-05-06">6 May</phrase>, which was introduced by his hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/900" name="Hywel Francis">the hon. Member for Aberavon (Dr. Francis)</phrase> and which with all-party support was passed and became the 2004 Act. During that debate, the Under-Secretary of State for Health, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1029" name="Stephen Ladyman">the hon. Member for South Thanet (Dr. Ladyman)</phrase>, argued that the carer's allowance stops when pensioners start to claim the retirement pension because that pension, like the carer's allowance, exists to replace lost income. The hon. Member for Kingswood argued in reply:</p>
	<p pid=".16.1/3" class="indent">&quot;The issue is whether or not carers over 65 should get increased support for their caring activities, not least because if they did not undertake them it would be far more expensive for the Government to fund them.&quot;&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2004-02-06.1068"><i>Official Report</i>, 6 February 2004; Vol. 417, c. 1068</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid=".16.1/4">When challenged by the hon. Member for Kingswood to name a resource that funds such support, the Minister cited&mdash;you might not be surprised to hear this, Mr. Deputy Speaker&mdash;attendance allowance. I suspect that neither the hon. Member for Kingswood nor I would be surprised if the Minister advances similar arguments today.</p>
	<p pid=".16.1/5">I cited that exchange because it touches on some of   the main points raised by the hon. Member for Kingswood.

	<p pid=".16.3/1">I will say 1997 if the Minister likes. In fact, the 1997 figure would be even more helpful to my case. The number of IB claimants in 1997 was roughly 2,370,000. The figure is now 2,404,000. So I am glad that the Minister brought me from 1995 to 1997.</p>

	<p pid=".16.4/1">I was not referring to the number of claimants. I was referring to the number of people who benefit from and receive&mdash;beneficiaries. According to   the Department for Work and Pensions, in 1995 the number of incapacity benefit beneficiaries was 1.8   million. The hon. Gentleman, like some of his hon. Friends, should make a clear distinction between claimants, some of whom do not get the benefit, and beneficiaries.

	<p pid=".17.6/1">I think that the hon. Member for Kingswood knows that this is a matter for debate. I was not accusing him of misquoting figures. I merely pointed out that he quoted some figures and not others.</p>
	<p pid=".17.6/2">I want to step back from that exchange to consider both the problems and the possibilities that the debate on disability benefits opens up. At one end of the life cycle, more disabled children are surviving. At the other end, more people are living for longer and incurring disabilities as they do so. In between, there is greater consciousness of disability than there was. I will give one striking example of that, which relates directly to disability benefits and was, I believe, the point that my right hon. and learned Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/974" name="Michael Howard">the Member for Folkestone and Hythe (Mr. Howard)</phrase> made in the remarks that the hon. Member for Kingswood quoted.</p>
	<p pid=".17.6/3">I discovered by tabling parliamentary questions that, since 1997, the number claiming incapacity benefit on mental health grounds has risen to 718,000. That is a rise of 38 per cent. It is also one quarter of all incapacity benefit claims. Conditions such as stress and depression account for 65 per cent. of all mental health cases. I   believe that there is some element of fraud in the system, although I have no doubt that, as the hon. Gentleman said, it is small. The focus on fraud as part of the debate about incapacity benefit is, to some degree, a red herring. If one studies the figures closely, it seems that what is actually happening as part of the tale of incapacity benefit is that there is a rise in mental health claims, which do appear to be out of control. That tells us not that large numbers of people are engaged in fraud but that large numbers of people are enduring mental health problems.</p>

	<p pid=".18.1/1">The hon. Gentleman was not listening to me. It is the rise that is clearly out of control, and it was that to which my right hon. and learned Friend referred. I shall return to incapacity benefit later.</p>
	<p pid=".18.1/2">The example in the figures that I gave makes an important point: benefits that are paid to people with disabilities, whether on the objective basis of age or on the more subjective basis of individual assessment, become controversial&mdash;perhaps inevitably&mdash;as social change gathers pace.</p>
	<p pid=".18.1/3">Another example is the current &quot;Mobilise&quot; campaign. I was confident that the hon. Member for Kingswood would refer to it and he duly did so. It is supported by Help the Aged, among others, and aims to remove the upper age limit of 65 for claiming disability living allowance. The campaigners say that older people can now work longer&mdash;they are right about that&mdash;and that, given social change, the age limit of 65 is outdated as well as discriminatory. In response, Ministers usually say that many benefits contain age rules&mdash;child benefit is paid for children, pensions are paid to older people and so on&mdash;and that there is no intrinsic reason why the disability living allowance should not have an upper age limit. I anticipate that the Minister may deploy some of those arguments when she speaks in a few moments. Ministers usually do not say that a commitment to remove the upper age limit would have a cost to the public purse and that the Treasury simply would not wear it, at least at present.</p>
	<p pid=".18.1/4">I confess to having some sympathy for the dilemma in which Ministers are placed. My party recently launched its largest ever consultation on disability policy. In doing so, we pointed out that 50 per cent. of disabled people have incomes below the poverty line and that there are particular complaints&mdash;I have the list here&mdash;about non-access to winter fuel payments, which the hon. Member for Kingswood mentioned, the lack of a mobility payment for attendance allowance, the downrating of benefits while disabled people are in hospital and the withdrawal of benefits if they earn income.</p>
	<p pid=".18.1/5">Personally, I find the argument about access to winter fuel payments absolutely compelling. It seems curious, to say the least, that a non-disabled person on a relatively high income can obtain the winter fuel payment while a severely disabled person on a low income cannot. This is where my sympathy for the dilemma of Ministers comes in. There is a cost to the taxpayer in meeting human needs and satisfying the demands of the lobbies, but Ministers are aware that there are always more human needs to meet and that the lobbies are never entirely satisfied. Therefore, although I am personally sympathetic to the argument, I cannot make a commitment that my right hon. Friend the shadow Chancellor has not cleared, any more than the Minister can make a commitment today that her right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer has not cleared&mdash;news that I suspect will come as no surprise to the hon. Member for Kingswood. However, before I am accused of being soft on Ministers, I should make the following points, without in any way anticipating the response to my party's consultation.</p>
	<p pid=".18.1/6">First, the benefits system is too complex. My party is committed to keeping the winter fuel payment, but that payment provides an illustration of how creating a more complex system, sometimes in response to the very demands of lobby groups, which have been mentioned today, creates inconsistencies and injustices.</p>
	<p pid=".18.1/7">Secondly, a complex system does not just create systematic inconsistencies. It also intensifies human problems. Disabled people often find it difficult, if not impossible, to fill in long, complex forms and undergo long, complex assessments, even if&mdash;as is often not the case&mdash;they have family or professional support in claiming. Let me give as an example an elderly Kashmiri woman in my constituency for whom English is not a first language, or who might not speak English at all. Such a person will have immense difficulty accessing the system, and the more complex the system becomes, the more difficult she will find it.</p>
	<p pid=".18.1/8">Thirdly, a complex system not only intensifies human problems but is felt by many of those who use it to insult human dignity. We all know from our correspondence that older people feel that they have earned the benefits that they receive, and that means-testing, in particular, insults their dignity. That explains the high non take-up rate of pension credit&mdash;the Government themselves anticipate a non take-up rate of a quarter even in 2008.</p>
	<p pid=".18.1/9">Finally, I return to incapacity benefit. There is a problem on incapacity benefit in particular that is also a   problem for the Government more generally: the question of who is actually driving policy. When the hon. Member for Kingswood quoted the new Secretary of State, it sounded to me as though he was not saying that the Government had now entirely satisfied him on that point, but that he was still worried that there might be a question of time-limiting future incapacity benefit claimants. The Prime Minister has recently explicitly linked the payment of higher pensions with reducing the incapacity benefit bill. Having ruled out raising taxes to pay for larger pensions, he has said that it is important to reduce the number of people on incapacity benefit because:</p>
	<p pid=".18.1/10" class="indent">&quot;It is particularly important as we have got to spend more money on pensions. It is a question of reconfiguring the welfare system.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".18.1/11">The Prime Minister did not directly say that the rules that govern IB will be tightened, or that it might be time-limited in the future, but recent reports have suggested that, and the hon. Member for Kingswood is clearly well aware of it. If I read those reports rightly, I rather think that they have come not from the Minister's Department but, as journalists say in the trade, from sources close to No. 10.</p>
	<p pid=".18.1/12">When the Minister replies to the debate, will she say whether the Government have ruled out time-limiting IB and, in particular, ruled out doing so before the next election? The hon. Gentleman can then go away entirely satisfied. It would also help him and me if she would say whether the Government have finally ruled out accepting recommendation 17 of the report of the Joint Committee on the draft Disability Bill. We agreed unanimously, even including such well-known drippy   wets as Lord Tebbit, that the Government should consider&mdash;I emphasise, only consider&mdash;whether eligibility for certain disability benefits should automatically provide coverage for a disabled person under the Disability Discrimination Act 1995. That point was agreed by the Committee, on which the hon. Member for Kingswood and I served and on which the Labour party had a majority.</p>
	<p pid=".18.1/13">I look forward to the Minister's reply on that and other points.</p>

	<p pid=".20.0/1">May I first compliment everyone who has taken part in the debate? It has been superb, and quite sharp for so early in the morning. I almost feel as though I do not have to get involved in some of the arguments going on between my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/732" name="Roger Berry">the Member for Kingswood (Mr. Berry)</phrase> and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/918" name="Paul Goodman">the hon. Member for Wycombe (Mr. Goodman)</phrase>, who seem to be quite capable of having a pretty good argument without my intervention. That is enjoyable for me as a Minister to sit and watch, instead of necessarily having to participate.</p>
	<p pid=".20.0/2">I pay tribute to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1357" name="Martin Smyth">the hon. Member for Belfast, South (Rev. Martin Smyth)</phrase>, who takes whatever opportunities he can to raise issues that matter a great deal to his constituents, particularly his constituents who are people with disabilities, to use the Northern Ireland phrase. I have noticed that he quite rightly finds every opportunity to do that in the House. He made a point about discrimination in education and referred to a particular constituent. If he wants to provide me with the details, I am happy to take the matter up with my colleagues, the Northern Ireland Ministers, and ensure that they are fully aware of the situation.</p>
	<p pid=".20.0/3">I pay tribute to the work of my hon. Friend the Member for Kingswood in this field, in which he has an excellent background. He has raised, laser-like, three issues. We could spend all day discussing them, but we have only 15 minutes remaining. I fear that I might not be able to deal with every point raised, but I will do my best to take the most important and I undertake to contact hon. Members by letter about any points that I have inadvertently missed out or have not had time to deal with.</p>
	<p pid=".20.0/4">My hon. Friend started his speech with media stories about incapacity benefits. They have been referred to by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/968" name="Paul Holmes">the hon. Member for Chesterfield (Paul Holmes)</phrase>, who was a little less churlish than he usually is. He must have got out of bed on the right side, and I recommend it to him because it made for a much less tense debate and a friendlier occasion. Those stories have also been mentioned by the hon. Member for Wycombe.</p>
	<p pid=".20.0/5">There has been much quotation of the new Secretary of State, which he will be glad to see. I will provide the quotation that people could not quite remember and which the hon. Member for Wycombe raised in an intervention. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State said when challenged further on <phrase class="date" code="2004-10-11">11 October</phrase> that he could not formally rule anything in or out for all time. That is obvious. He went on to say:</p>
	<p pid=".20.0/6" class="indent">&quot;However, I stress that any longer-term reform to incapacity benefit has to build on our existing approach in pathways to work&quot;.&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2004-10-11.3"><i>Official Report</i>, 11 October 2004; Vol. 425, c. 3</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid=".20.0/7">That is an important qualification, which I hope provides proper reassurance.</p>
	<p pid=".20.0/8">Much as we would like to be in charge of various newspapers, none of us are. I caution hon. Members not to believe too much of what they read in the newspapers. There is often wild speculation that does not necessarily come from any source close to anybody apart from the nearest journalist in the nearest bar. I do not wish to impugn the integrity of journalists, however; they have their job to do as well.</p>
	<p pid=".20.0/9">There has been an interesting debate about whether the number of people on incapacity benefit is out of control. I enjoyed hearing the little spat between my hon. Friend the Member for Kingswood and the hon. Member for Wycombe, who was valiantly trying to defend the words of the leader of his party. He obviously must do so, but he put a slightly different interpretation on the numbers by talking about the number of people coming on to incapacity benefit who report stress or low-level mental illness. It was an intriguing and valiant attempt to support his leader, because, having looked at the figures, he clearly does not believe that the number of people on incapacity benefit is out of control.</p>
	<p pid=".20.0/10">The number of people in work is higher than ever before. We have our highest employment level for 30   years&mdash;75 per cent. of the working age population are in work. We have our lowest level of unemployment for the same period and there are 2 million more jobs in the economy. The inflows on to incapacity benefit have gone down by 25 per cent., and more than 90 per cent. of the increase in the number of people on incapacity benefit between 1979 and this year happened between 1979 and 1997. The hon. Gentleman was not in Parliament at the time, but many of his hon. and right   hon. Friends, including his leader, were and they had important jobs, such as running Government employment policy. I hope that puts across my point.</p>
	<p pid=".20.0/11">The idea that incapacity benefit is out of control is complete nonsense; I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Kingswood on that point. However, that does not take away from the fact that we must help those who wish to get back to work and leave the incapacity benefit roll. We must provide proper, targeted help. In that regard, I was pleased to hear from those who have spoken the widespread support for pathways to work and the initiatives that we are piloting. Even the hon. Member for Chesterfield, who usually looks on the dark side of such things, admitted that some good was coming out of the programme. I was glad to hear that.</p>
	<p pid=".20.0/12">Of course, these are early days. Three of the pilots have been going for a year, but the other four have been going for only nine months, so we cannot say what the sustained outcomes will be. The pilot programme costs about &pound;100 million in additional resources. It is very exciting to see from the early results that twice as many people are leaving the incapacity benefit rolls in the pilot areas.</p>

	<p pid=".22.1/1">I will in a moment, when I have spat out this statistic. I may not have all the statistics, but here is one. In the pilot areas, six times more people are taking up the help that is being offered, and that has to be good.</p>

	<p pid=".22.2/1">With reference to the statistics, some of which the Minister recently provided in a written answer to me, when will she be able to tell us how many of the people who have gone into work as a result of   pathways to work have stayed in for longer than 13 weeks?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2004-11-02.22.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/872" speakername="Maria Eagle" colnum="22"  time="010:44:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200304/cmhansrd/vo041102/halltext/41102h01.htm#41102h01_spnew46">
	<p pid=".22.3/1">The hon. Gentleman could use his calculator to work out that 13 weeks after they have gone into work we might be able to say whether they are still in work. We need another half year. The hon. Gentleman must remember that for the first three months work-focused interviews were just starting. The help that is then given can vary; for example, eight weeks for the condition management programme. Some people may move into work only after that. Of course, with the return-to-work credit and not as much help, some people go straight into work.</p>
	<p pid=".22.3/2">We need at least a year. The pilot programmes are two or two and a half years long. Only at the end of that time will we be able properly to evaluate sustained job outcomes, although we will produce information about how the pilots are working as we go. Qualitative and quantitative evaluations will be produced during the life of the pilots, but only at the end of the period will we be able to evaluate the pilots fully and determine how people do, particularly in respect of sustained job outcomes. Obviously, statistics will be made available as they become available to the Department.</p>
	<p pid=".22.3/3">We are certainly excited thus far about the early indications, which appear to be good. We must ensure that we build on this approach in order to help people who get stuck on this benefit. Of the people who come on to it, 90 per cent. wish and expect to go back to work but find that after a year the average length of stay on it is eight years. Clearly, there is a problem that must be tackled, and it is fallacious to argue about whether it involves fraud or some kind of psychological effect.</p>
	<p pid=".22.3/4">The hon. Member for Chesterfield said that his constituents have to prove that they are incapacitated and that they cannot do this, that or the other. There is a psychology surrounding this benefit that is not helpful. People have to prove what they cannot do; they have to show others that they really are incapacitated. That is not helpful. We want to tackle those issues because, rather than fraud, that is what keeps people on benefit and prevents them from getting into work.</p>
	<p pid=".22.3/5">As hon. Members can tell, I could talk about the issue for some time if induced to do so. However, I should move on, as my hon. Friend the Member for Kingswood raised three issues and I want to say something about all of them. He would expect me to do so. Let us move on to age discrimination, which is how his early-day motion refers to it, in the disability living allowance. I believe that he said that the rules were &quot;curious&quot;, and the hon. Member for Chesterfield also gave some examples of inconsistencies. Since I became a Social Security Minister, I have discovered that benefit rules always have curious aspects to them. One can consider an individual benefit in itself and think how curious it is, but one should also consider how it fits into the rest of the benefits system and what the rationale is for it. When the disability living allowance was established in 1992, the rationale was to ensure that those who were severely disabled earlier in life received additional help. The research that underlay the work that was done to establish the benefit indicated that people who are disabled earlier in life have tougher outcomes, have more extra costs and find it more difficult to get income. The rationale of the benefit was to try to provide targeted extra help to those who are severely disabled earlier in life.</p>
	<p pid=".22.3/6">As my hon. Friend the Member for Kingswood and others in the House know, the care and mobility components act as proxies for the extra costs that a disabled person might face in dealing with their disability. I do not think that anybody has ever suggested that the care and mobility components can capture or attempt to capture all those extra costs. I will come on to the Joseph Rowntree Foundation report shortly. It is another attempt to capture those costs. The care and mobility components are proxies for the extra costs that severely disabled people face.</p>
	<p pid=".22.3/7">Care and mobility are, I argue, good proxies to capture those extra costs. That is certainly the rationale of the benefit. The aim was to provide extra help to people disabled at a younger age because they would&mdash;at that time and now, although the situation is improving&mdash;have had less chance to work, less chance to save and, therefore, less income available to them. So, the idea was to focus help on people who are disabled at an earlier age. That is why the mobility components are available in DLA but not in attendance allowance.</p>
	<p pid=".22.3/8">I acknowledge that, under DLA run-on, those who qualify for DLA aged under 64 may keep the mobility component after they become 65, and that, under DLA cut-off, those who qualify for extra cost-benefit after the age of 65 cannot take advantage of the mobility component. Both of those rules can, I accept, seem curious if considered in isolation, without having in the back of one's mind the rationale of the benefit. Of course it is possible to change the rationale of a benefit, but that is something that ought to be done when considering how the entire benefit operates. It is not something that can be done piecemeal or easily, or something that should be undertaken lightly.</p>
	<p pid=".22.3/9">The hon. Member for Wycombe suggested that I might make some arguments that I have not made, but would have made had he not done so, about the rationale of the benefit. It is not as easy to make these changes as one might think. The hon. Gentleman referred to costs. Of course there would be a huge extra cost if we were to extend the mobility components of DLA into attendance allowance and eligibility for those who qualified after age 65.</p>
	<p pid=".22.3/10">We do not have a precise figure about those costs. The figure that was given in parliamentary answers is old and is based on old research. The newer figures must be based on assumptions because, as I have often said to the hon. Member for Chesterfield, it is difficult to know what the take-up of an extra cost benefit such as attendance allowance or disability living allowance will be. One cannot tell. The allowance considers the effect of a disability or condition on the care and mobility needs of an individual. It is difficult to work out what take-up should be. It is easy to work out what take-up of pension credit should be because we know how many pensioners there are and what the income distribution is. It is not so easy to work out what take-up of an extra cost benefit should be. So newer assessments of cost must be based on assumptions rather than on the old research, which is out of date.</p>

	<p pid=".24.0/1">The argument is that people who require DLA earlier in life should get more support.

Is that not the same principle?</p>

	<p pid=".24.1/1">I am obviously failing to convince my hon. Friend and I am not surprised by that. The rationale of the benefit, when it was formed and now, is to provide extra help to those who are disabled earlier in life in recognition of the fact that it is harder for them to get income in any other way. The mobility components are used as a proxy for that income. That is why the cut-off came about. I do not think that my hon. Friend will be convinced by that argument, but I am trying to explain the rationale, which has not changed. It is difficult to change the rationale of benefits in a piecemeal fashion without causing chaos.</p>
	<p pid=".24.1/2">I am running out of time. That measure certainly has a high cost. I acknowledge that. The hon. Member for Wycombe said that, for the same reason, he could not make any promises.

	Defence Aviation Repair Agency
</major-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2004-11-02.25.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1235" speakername="John Smith" colnum="25"  time="011:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200304/cmhansrd/vo041102/halltext/41102h02.htm#41102h02_spnew0">
	<p pid=".25.1/1">I am grateful for this opportunity, however brief, to draw hon. Members' attention to the important matter of the future of the Defence Aviation Repair Agency at RAF St. Athan and, in my opinion, the future of the whole Defence Aviation Repair Agency. This is the first opportunity to debate the subject since the Minister announced his preferred option&mdash;I stress &quot;preferred&quot;&mdash;on <phrase class="date" code="2004-09-16">16 September 2004</phrase>, effectively to remove the deep repair and maintenance of virtually the entire front-line Royal Air Force fleet of fast jets, the Tornado GR4, from St. Athan to RAF Marham in the east of England. That follows his decision earlier this year to remove repair and maintenance of the Harrier GR9 from RAF St. Athan to RAF Cottesmore in Leicestershire.</p>
	<p pid=".25.1/2">The work has been carried out at St. Athan for nearly 50 years. Generations of workers and RAF personnel have successfully carried out repair, deep repair, major repair and overhaul of our front-line fighter fleet at St. Athan for many years. I hope that my right hon. Friend will take my comment in the spirit in which it is intended by a friend and long-standing supporter of the Government's defence policy, which has been brave, radical, and until now, very successful, but I must place it on the record that the decision is wrong in principle and in practice. It will turn out to be bad news for the military and particularly for the RAF, because it will   undermine front-line capability, and for British taxpayers, because the cost of the work will spiral out of control, as it did in the past, which was the very reason for creating DARA.</p>
	<p pid=".25.1/3">I recognise that the decision is not entirely my right hon. Friend's responsibility, but it will have a devastating effect on the south Wales aviation industry.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2004-11-02.25.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1143" speakername="Lembit pik" colnum="25"  time="011:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200304/cmhansrd/vo041102/halltext/41102h02.htm#41102h02_spnew1">
	<p pid=".25.2/1">I agree that the decision is bad news for the Welsh aviation industry as a whole, because we are becoming a global centre of excellence in just the areas that the hon. Gentleman is describing.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2004-11-02.25.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1235" speakername="John Smith" colnum="25"  time="011:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200304/cmhansrd/vo041102/halltext/41102h02.htm#41102h02_spnew2">
	<p pid=".25.3/1">The hon. Gentleman is right, because the success of the south Wales aviation industry has been predicated on the existence of that centre of excellence for military aircraft repair for many years. Many of the industries that now exist have been a spin-off from that. Future plans for the aviation industry in south Wales, most notably the centre of excellence, the aviation business park, will be fundamentally undermined by the decision, because the only way of making it a centre of excellence is to build on the skills and expertise of the people who already operate from the site.</p>
	<p pid=".25.3/2">I want to explain why the decision is so wrong and why it is such bad news. However, I had better spend a minute or two explaining what DARA is, because it has not been with us for long. Her Majesty's Government formed the agency as a trading fund as recently as April 2001, with a specific strategic role in supporting our front-line forces: to provide&mdash;I shall say this slowly&mdash;a competitive alternative to sources of repair in the commercial sector in Britain.</p>
	<p pid=".25.3/3">A review carried out by the Ministry of Defence in 2003 came up with three clever options. We either move the work forward to military operational bases, or we move all the work&mdash;that is deep support for military aircraft&mdash;back to DARA at St. Athan and other locations. Alternatively, we come up with a hybrid solution, which the Minister has done. However, that end-to-end review of logistics undertaken by private consultants and the RAF is fundamentally flawed, because it completely ignores the strategic role of DARA, which was created by the Government as recently as three years ago. DARA became a full trading agency just a few months ago, on <phrase class="date" code="2004-04-01">1 April 2004</phrase>. Within a few months, the role of the agency created by the Government is being ignored and Government policy is being completely reversed.</p>
	<p pid=".25.3/4">In the past, there have been four lines of support for the British Air Force and our military aircraft: front-line reinforcement, second-line reinforcement at military operational bases, third-line at DARA and fourth-line within industry and the private sector. Quite rightly, a review of logistics needed to take place to ensure a smaller logistic footprint and a tri-service provision for all our forces&mdash;Army, Navy and Air Force&mdash;for all aircraft, to stop duplication and waste. There has been a post-cold war consensus by Governments of both persuasions that that is necessary. Of course we support that, but nobody expected that during the end-to-end review the new, critical role given to DARA would be ignored in the way that it has been.</p>
	<p pid=".25.3/5">The creation of DARA was based on the post-cold war consensus that there is no longer any military case whatever for servicemen and women to carry out factory repair of aircraft. Clearly, there is a military case for carrying out servicing and immediate repairs&mdash;kicking tyres, filling up with petrol and keeping the things in the air&mdash;but there is no military case for service personnel acting as factory workers and carrying out major overhauls of aircraft. There used to be such a case during the cold war because of the threat of a direct invasion of this country, and the possibility of a long, high-intensity military engagement in the central plains of Europe and of having to move forward deep repair to support our air-to-air fighter aircraft in the sky. That scenario no longer exists and nobody in government, in opposition or in any other NATO country in the alliance believes that that work should be carried out by military personnel.</p>
	<p pid=".25.3/6">The move is a disaster for the military, because if they go back&mdash;I stress go back&mdash;to carrying out deep repair of military aircraft, which they have not carried out since the origins of DARA in 1991, that will have to be paid for, and the only way to pay for it is to take away capability from the front line.</p>
	<p pid=".25.3/7">Everybody knows that the military are not cut out for that sort of work. That is another fundamental mistake made by the review: it makes no proper distinction between military personnel&mdash;I speak as an ex-serviceman and member of the Royal Air Force&mdash;carrying out their work in the committed and loyal way that they do, under a military code and Queen's regulations, and skilled factory workers, who are civilians operating in a commercial environment, which is what we have at DARA. That is why it took more than 4,000 military personnel just five years ago to undertake the work currently done by 1,450 civilians. Is the Minister honestly suggesting that it makes economic sense to move that work back to the military? Of course it does not. It is the economics of the madhouse if we are to expect military personnel to do that work either efficiently or cost-effectively. It will undermine military front-line capability. Members of the services will not be able to carry out the work, which is already happening with the Harriers that have been moved to Cottesmore, where there is a reliance on private contractors being brought in to bail them out. Six aircraft have already been returned to DARA St. Athan, which has been asked to bail out the Royal Air Force. In the past, the RAF has had to turn to the private sector to bail it out with blank cheques, and it will have to do that again in the future.</p>
	<p pid=".25.3/8">I recently met representatives of a major defence contractor&mdash;I am sure that my right hon. Friend will not have difficulty working out which one&mdash;and their smiles went from ear to ear because they knew the consequences of this decision, if implemented: a reliance on contractors to help out the RAF with all its work at military operational bases, or to act as a semi-permanent support. The policy is wrong for the RAF, and in its heart of hearts, the RAF knows that it is wrong. It marks a step change in the strategic defence review, which until now has attempted to introduce smart procurement in many fields. One element of that is the outsourcing of unnecessary tasks that the military has no need to carry out on either economic or military grounds.</p>
	<p pid=".25.3/9">The policy is a complete reversal: it is a form of renationalisation through the back door. We have not seen such nationalisation since the Government of Ted Heath and the overnight nationalisation of Rolls-Royce. The previous Conservative Government were going to privatise part of the work&mdash;the part of the agency made up by Magda&mdash;through &quot;Competing for Quality&quot;. The Labour Government said that the work should be outsourced because there is no military case for keeping it, but privatising it carries security risks&mdash;there may be no surge capacity in a crisis&mdash;so they created DARA at RAF St. Athan to operate in a purely commercial environment for profit, showing a return on investment and with flexibility of labour practices. In the Minister's own words, it was to become a &quot;world-beating centre of excellence&quot; in military aviation.</p>
	<p pid=".25.3/10">The policy will be a disaster for the taxpayer, because I confidently predict that he or she will pay through the nose for the work to be undertaken initially by the RAF, and when it fails, through a partnership with the private sector, but with the RAF dependent on the private sector for support. There is no competitive element whatever in the formula&mdash;it is a recipe for disaster. That is very sad, because other strategic defence reviews in other NATO countries, and even statements by the former Supreme Allied Commander Europe, General Wesley Clark, used the British example for other countries to follow in relation to outsourcing non-essential work. We did that, and we have done it successfully, and now those countries are contemplating introducing it.</p>
	<p pid=".25.3/11">During the past year, &pound;18 million of taxpayers' money has been invested to build a state-of-the-art military hangar at RAF St. Athan. It is the size of six football pitches and is purpose-built to repair 47 fast jets at any time&mdash;the entire fleet. We have massive capacity, a work force who have broken all the records for productivity and efficiency gains, and a brand new hangar. Before the hangar was finished, and on the spurious notion that the RAF had all of a sudden invented a need for a deep repair capability in their services to move forward&mdash;God knows in what scenario&mdash;at times of crisis, the Minister announced that he would split up all the work. The work will now be handed back.</p>
	<p pid=".25.3/12">The Minister and the Department are in danger of making the biggest mistake they have made since this Government took on responsibility for defence. Until now, they have been more or less on the right course. I    asked the Auditor General to investigate the expenditure, as I believed that it was my duty as a Member of this House to do so, and I am delighted that the Defence Committee will investigate the matter as a result of the letter that I wrote to it.</p>
	<p pid=".25.3/13">The decision is bad news for the south Wales economy. It will devastate our aerospace industry for the reasons that I have already given, and it will destroy the training base. The provision for the training colleges sector to train apprentices at the facility will end, as it is dependent on RAF St. Athan and DARA to supply the mainstay of apprentices, and companies such as British Airways Maintenance Cardiff, which carries out major repair and overhaul of private wide-bodied jets for British Airways, the British Airways avionics centre, and General Electric, which repairs engines in south Wales, will all be affected by the decision.</p>
	<p pid=".25.3/14">The chances are slim indeed that Red Dragon, which is a joint project of the Ministry and the Welsh Development Agency, will be a success. Red Dragon is in grave danger of becoming a white elephant. We could well see in the six football pitches inside the new hangar just one Hawk training jet. God knows how that can be considered an efficient use of defence expenditure.</p>
	<p pid=".25.3/15">I have not had much time to develop many of the arguments, but I hope that I have been able to give hon. Members a flavour of the grave mistake that the Government are about to make. Such a mistake could rub off on other services and provision in the military. Traditionally, the mistakes made in strategic defence reviews have not been the big visions. By and large, &quot;Options for Change&quot;, &quot;Front Line First&quot;, the strategic defence review and &quot;A New Chapter&quot; have been good visions and have garnered a consensus on where we ought to be going vis-&agrave;-vis our defence policy. Where they have fallen down is in the detail, the application and the failure to implement reconfiguration of regiments, organisations and resources. The resulting horse-trading ends up in death by a thousand cuts and huge gaps in military capability.</p>
	<p pid=".25.3/16">The decision smacks exactly of horse-trading. I know that my right hon. Friend has had a difficult job persuading the RAF to rationalise, given its new front-line objectives. We will have fewer aircrew and fast jets. We hope that we will have a bigger capability. I must tell him that this is not the way to go about delivering the capability. People in blue uniform would never have joined the RAF if they had known that they would become factory workers. Speak to the workers&mdash;the civilians&mdash;at St. Athan, almost half of whom are ex-RAF. They did not join the RAF to become garage mechanics permanently based in factories. They will not operate in a commercial environment, and we will pay dearly for this decision.</p>
	<p pid=".25.3/17">The trade unions know that the decision is wrong. I understand that for the first time the national unions have come out and failed to agree with the policy. Under the partnership, the Ministry has previously had the support of the unions on every DARA proposition. The local work force and other NATO countries know that the decision is wrong. Deep down, the RAF knows that it is a mistake. I ask my right hon. Friend to think again, and if he is unable in principle to change his preferred option, for goodness' sake, if he intends to implement this strategy he should do it gradually, step by step, and ensure that at each step we see it working, with capability being maintained. We do not want another Airworks debacle&mdash;he will be familiar with that because it affected the Tornado.</p>
	<p pid=".25.3/18">I hope that I have been able to put some of my arguments across.</p>

He is to be congratulated on that, but I do not agree with the fundamental thrust of his arguments, although I recognise some of the graphic scenarios that he painted.</p>
	<p pid=".29.0/2">The background to the issue is straightforward. In 2002&ndash;03 we undertook a comprehensive end-to-end review of how logistic support was provided to our air and land forces. It looked across the whole logistics process to maximise the opportunities for improving logistic support to our forces. Its clear, fundamental aim was to achieve our target of reducing the &pound;15.4 billion cost of logistics support by &pound;1.4 billion by 2008 so that those savings could be invested directly in the front line. That was the overriding driver.</p>
	<p pid=".29.0/3">On support for military aircraft, the review concluded that there was both need and substantial scope for improvement in all areas: in industry, in the Defence Logistics Organisation and in all three services. That reflected the duplication of facilities across the services and in other parts of the MOD such as the Defence Aviation Repair Agency. It also reflected the fact that, with some notable exceptions, the Department and the services were not using industry modern best practice&mdash;a given fact&mdash;to drive down the cost of supporting military aircraft. The case for significant change was unarguable. It is wrong to ignore those essential features.</p>
	<p pid=".29.0/4">The review concluded that aircraft support, which comprises deep repair, scheduled maintenance and modification of aircraft&mdash;not garage work, as my hon. Friend suggested, but important technical work, whoever carries it out&mdash;could best be rationalised by concentrating facilities at existing military main operating bases.</p>
	<p pid=".29.0/5">My hon. Friend set out the background and asked whether the programme should roll forward or back, or whether a hybrid solution can be found. We tested that by having an investment appraisal. There was no predetermined outcome; we decided to examine the matter in the cold light of the information and facts in front of us. We put in place a demonstration phase, launched in September 2003, to test the end-to-end review principles and reduce risk. We also put in place at that time a formal, transparent process to evaluate the    options for support infrastructure in the air environment. That was not under the counter; it was all up-front, open examination.</p>
	<p pid=".29.0/6">The investment appraisal was led and overseen by head office at the Ministry of Defence, and was conducted under the direction of the Department's senior economic adviser. All interested parties, including DARA and the services, were engaged in the investment appraisal, and there was trade union consultation throughout. As I have said, there was no predetermined outcome. The process was designed to establish the best result for defence in terms of operational effectiveness&mdash;that is what the RAF is for, not saving jobs or economic regeneration. The key platforms of Tornado GR4 and F3, Harrier GR9, and the Lynx and Sea King helicopters were addressed in detail in that examination. As my hon. Friend said, it came out with three options: forward, back or the hybrid solution.</p>
	<p pid=".29.0/7">That investment appraisal was supplemented by a subsequent affordability analysis, which identified the investment needed for each of the three options. There is no point in conceiving a new way forward if we cannot afford it. However, in order not to prejudice the required in-service date of 2006 for the upgraded Harrier GR9, the investment appraisal focused first on the options for its future depth support. I announced in March that Harrier support will concentrate forward to RAF Cottesmore. My hon. Friend is wrong about the work that is being carried out there. The first Harrier major maintenance there was completed in June 2004. No unexpected issues were experienced and the turn-round time was as planned. It was similar to a minor maintenance undertaken at the base and shorter than that experienced at DARA.</p>
	<p pid=".29.0/8">We had budgeted for the major repair to require an additional 500 man hours compared with a minor repair, but in the event only 340 additional man hours were required. No additional skills were needed, so we did not have to undertake any additional training and the Harrier pulse line team and a new joint repair organisation based at Cottesmore undertook all the necessary structural repair work. If my hon. Friend has different information&mdash;he keeps raising the matter&mdash;I need to see the facts, because as far as I am concerned, they are not as he presented them.</p>
	<p pid=".29.0/9">The completed investment appraisal and affordability analysis demonstrated that concentrating support of the Tornado GR4 aircraft forward at RAF Marham would provide best value for money compared with the alternative of concentrating backward at DARA St. Athan. In essence, the choice was either to move the aircraft to an existing main operating base for depth support or to move RAF personnel to DARA St. Athan. The latter would have meant significant up-front infrastructure costs, but either option would have meant a significant reduction in civilian posts. That was the reality. The investment appraisal and affordability analysis also showed that it would not be cost-effective to concentrate the Tornado F3 aircraft either forward or back, given that it will soon be replaced by the Typhoon.</p>
	<p pid=".29.0/10">For rotary wing aircraft, helicopters, the investment appraisal and analysis demonstrated that it would provide better value for money to concentrate depth support for the Lynx, Sea King and Chinook back to DARA Fleetlands, a civilian base, not a military base.</p>
	<p pid=".29.0/11">On <phrase class="date" code="2004-09-16">16 September</phrase>, I announced my preferred way ahead, which was subject to full trade union consultation. The consultation period ended on <phrase class="date" code="2004-10-27">27 October</phrase>, and I have received a formal response from the trade unions which is now under consideration. I hope to make a final decision shortly and am only a matter of days away from doing so.</p>
	<p pid=".29.0/12">I am well aware that my preferred way ahead has substantial adverse implications for DARA St. Athan and its work force, and it would be wrong to pretend otherwise. However, my hon. Friend should be in no doubt that the streamlining of our support functions is    not simply an option for defence. We must move    forward to streamline that support because transforming logistics through more efficient ways of working is vital if the Ministry of Defence is to make the best use of its resources.</p>
	<p pid=".29.0/13">The impact of what we are doing goes wider than DARA St. Athan. We are not sacrificing civilian jobs to protect RAF personnel. Implementation of the end-to-end review will lead to a reduction of some 1,600 RAF personnel, which forms part of the overall reduction of 7,500 set out by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Defence on <phrase class="date" code="2004-07-21">21 July</phrase> when he announced force structure changes and defence change programmes. We are not protecting the light blue at the cost of civilian workers. We are making a complete examination of the way in which we deliver that support.</p>
	<p pid=".29.0/14">I am conscious that that is a hard message, and of the fact that when my father joined the RAF in 1938 the first place he went to was DARA St. Athan, because he wanted a trade and that was the best way to obtain one. He would not like to have been called a garage hand, because of the technical work that he did, although the aircraft were much simpler in those days.</p>
	<p pid=".29.0/15">To mitigate the effect, we are working with the Wales Office and the Welsh Assembly Government to consider all the options for sustaining DARA St. Athan after 2009. The Department of Trade and Industry, the Department for Transport and other Departments are working alongside us.</p>
	<p pid=".29.0/16">I am sure that my hon. Friend understands that the Ministry of Defence is obliged to deliver maximum front-line capability and to make best use of taxpayers' money. Those have been the key drivers in my preferred way ahead for air depth support. I do not believe that we have achieved one at the expense of the other. Instead, we have achieved the right balance, which will deliver the right outcome and maximum front-line capability for the RAF, the Royal Navy and the Army.</p>

	<p pid=".32.1/1">I warmly welcome the Secretary of State for International Development to Westminster Hall. It is not often that we benefit from the highest Minister in a Department, and I think that this indicates the seriousness with which he takes his job and this subject.</p>

	<p pid=".32.2/1">I am very grateful to the House for this opportunity to highlight an appalling situation, particularly in the presence of the Secretary of State, and to highlight again&mdash;I think for the second time in as many months&mdash;Africa's difficulties in its struggle to combat AIDS. The horrors that this relentless disease inflicts on Africa's people in so many ways&mdash;socially, demographically, economically, politically and culturally&mdash;are well known, and I do not wish to dwell on that aspect of the crisis just now.</p>
	<p pid=".32.2/2">I should like to point out recent figures provided by a 2004 United Nations AIDS report that show the scale of the crisis that Africa still faces. Many people are by now aware that AIDS has been acknowledged as the biggest threat to Africa's development and the No. 1 overall cause of death in Africa, but fewer realise that, on top of that, rates of HIV infection continue to rise in sub-Saharan Africa. Last year alone, an estimated 3 million people in the region became newly infected. The figures are worrying, and all the more so since they come after a decade of international efforts to highlight the devastating effect of AIDS, particularly in Africa.</p>
	<p pid=".32.2/3">We must ask ourselves why, after 10 years of campaigning and effort to focus world attention on the issue, only 50,000 of the 4.1 million Africans suffering from AIDS are currently receiving any treatment. That   figure is so minimal that it cannot but call into    question the entire premise on which the international community's efforts have hitherto been based. Worldwide efforts to generate more publicity for the AIDS pandemic have sadly failed to translate into increased drugs availability for those who need it most: those on the African continent. I want to focus on the best way of tackling that problem to ensure that victims of this terrible disease are provided with the best possible treatment in the 21st century.</p>
	<p pid=".32.2/4">The importance of anti-retroviral therapy cannot be stressed enough. Of course, that treatment is not a cure, and it presents new challenges with side effects and drug resistance, but it has dramatically reduced rates of mortality, revitalised communities and significantly improved the quality of life of people with AIDS. Most importantly, because of those drugs, AIDS is now perceived as a manageable chronic illness, rather than as a plague. Sadly, very few African countries can share in that vastly improved prognosis. Currently, the number of people receiving anti-retroviral treatment is minimal. The World Health Organisation estimates that nine out of 10 people who urgently need HIV treatment are simply not being reached. Around 5 million to 6 million people in developing countries will die in the next two years if they do not receive anti-retroviral drugs.</p>
	<p pid=".32.2/5">The greatest examples of the production of generic anti-retroviral drugs are in India and Brazil, where the cost of drugs has been successfully reduced. Mumbai in India launched the first generic anti-retroviral drug in 1994 and since then, India has had great success in developing combinations of that original drug. Brazil, meanwhile, is now home to up to a third of all people being treated for AIDS and has successfully reduced its HIV/AIDS related deaths by more than 85 per cent.&mdash;a laudable figure.</p>
	<p pid=".32.2/6">Furthermore, the Brazilian Government have estimated that anti-retroviral drugs have made savings of about $2.2 billion in hospital care that would otherwise have been needed by people living with HIV. The other major advantage of that treatment is the opportunity it creates to help prevent HIV transmission by encouraging many more people to learn their HIV status. Those countries with success stories are proof that many more people are willing to learn their HIV status when there is the promise of treatment at the end of it.</p>
	<p pid=".32.2/7">Above all, the abiding lesson to take away from countries such as Brazil is the vital importance of the production of generic drugs. It lowers the cost of anti-retroviral therapy and, in doing so, increases the numbers of people able to participate in treatment. I concede that there has been movement in the right direction. However, sadly, the prices that multinational pharmaceutical companies charge for those drugs remains way beyond the affordability of those in developing countries. Africa is all too familiar with that situation, and it must change.</p>
	<p pid=".32.2/8">A non-profitable drugs solution to the AIDS crisis in Africa is urgently needed&mdash;a solution that has nothing to do with self-interest and everything to do with improving the lives of Africa's AIDS victims. The three-by-five initiative, which was launched by the World Health Organisation and UNAIDS in September 2003, is a perfect example of that. The aim is to provide anti-retrovirals to 3 million people in developing countries by the end of 2005, and the initiative is part of a global movement to mobilise support for AIDS treatment. It is crucial that Africa is made a primary focus of such campaigns, and I would welcome the Secretary of State's support for and comments on that.</p>
	<p pid=".32.2/9">With the help of non-governmental organisations, such as the World Health Organisation, African nations can really start to advance their management of the disease. One hopeful advantage for Africa, arising from the successful use of generic drugs in Brazil, is the big advance in co-operation between continents. The 2004 UNAIDS report states:</p>
	<p pid=".32.2/10" class="indent">&quot;Co-operation continues to increase between those countries with anti-retroviral manufacturing capacity and those in Africa wishing to set up local production facilities.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".32.2/11">It is vital to exploit that attitude of preparedness among Africans, to allow them to move on to the next phase in tackling AIDS.</p>
	<p pid=".32.2/12">Some African countries have already made significant advances in tackling AIDS&mdash;for example, Uganda. The success of that nation highlights the crucial importance of generic competition. In that country, despite the fact that the big five pharmaceutical companies had agreed under the accelerated access initiative to reduce the price   of anti-retrovirals, the introduction of generic equivalents from India in October 2000 led to a dramatic fall in the price of the brand-name medicines.</p>
	<p pid=".32.2/13">The conclusions of an Oxfam survey report reinforce the need for generic competition. The report discovered that, when generic medicines entered the market, the price of patented medicines fell dramatically. Competition will therefore provide an enormous boost to the accessibility of anti-retrovirals. The report also drew attention to the urgent need to fund health services to deliver treatment. The Secretary of State is nodding&mdash;I hope in agreement&mdash;because that is an absolutely key part of the argument. The funding of those essential services should go hand-in-hand with massive cuts in prices. The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria provides opportunities for countries such as Uganda to deliver comprehensive programmes, which include treatments using anti-retrovirals. Those health services must be introduced into many more African nations if progress is really to take place.</p>
	<p pid=".32.2/14">Naturally, it would be naive to imagine that every African nation is at the same stage of readiness to begin drug production. Some face huge internal obstacles, as one <i>New Scientist </i>report pointed out:</p>
	<p pid=".32.2/15" class="indent">&quot;Some developing countries do not even have the commitment to mobilise national funds to fight the problem.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".32.2/16">The South African political system is an example of exactly that kind of difficulty. We all know that, largely because of the personal effects of AIDS on close members of his family, Chief Buthelezi is much more open than President Mbeki, who seems to live in a world of his own on the question of AIDS. Some of his pronouncements on South Africa's AIDS problem beggar belief.</p>
	<p pid=".32.2/17">Such political reticence to stand up and confront the truth about AIDS too often translates into a lack of practical support to put in place vital infrastructure components. Unless Governments are committed to providing efficient distribution systems, the benefits of increased drug production will be unattainable to those most in need in isolated communities. The international community and the WHO must therefore remember the need to focus on a political evolution in some places, as well as on a technological one. Attitudes must change before the advances of drug production can begin to take real effect.</p>
	<p pid=".32.2/18">My final thought is an extension of that last point. In a speech to the Commission for Africa on <phrase class="date" code="2004-10-07">7 October 2004</phrase>, Bob Geldof spoke about the importance of addressing local cultures. While that may seem unconnected, there is a valuable point to make. Whereas westerners are more likely to seek a medical or a biological explanation of a problem, Africans tend to seek one that is spiritual or politically related. Strategies that do not address local culture will fail. For example, one large AIDS-testing scheme among pregnant women found that only 30 per cent. returned after the birth of their child to get the results. The test did not seem relevant to their needs, nor did it offer sufficient incentive to return, in the form of treatment, to those who tested positive. The answer to that is, naturally, to provide people with an incentive to return through proper drug production and availability. Alongside that, we must ensure that people want to receive treatment. Otherwise, all our efforts will be in vain.</p>

	<p pid=".34.0/1">I   congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1265" name="Hugo Swire">the hon. Member for East Devon (Mr. Swire)</phrase> on securing this debate on a critical issue. I am pleased that we have the opportunity to return to the issue of HIV/AIDS in Africa on so many occasions.</p>
	<p pid=".34.0/2">I shall focus on the report produced by African AIDS Action, with which I know the Secretary of State is familiar. I commend African AIDS Action for the persistence&mdash;in a positive sense&mdash;with which it has pushed the idea and for obtaining responses from the Government, including a clear statement of where they stand on the issue.</p>
	<p pid=".34.0/3">African AIDS Action helpfully set out at the beginning of its report some of the statistics, which it is worth repeating to remind us of the scale of the problem. Last year, AIDS killed 10 times more Africans than did all the armed conflicts in Africa combined. It is now the leading cause of death among Africans of all ages. Africa is home to 70 per cent. of adults and 80 per cent. of children living with HIV worldwide. In African countries, between one fifth and one third of children have already lost one or both parents to AIDS.</p>
	<p pid=".34.0/4">Some 40 million children in Africa are expected to be orphaned by the disease. In 2001, 3.4 million new infections occurred in sub-Saharan Africa. A total of 28.5 million Africans are living with HIV/AIDS in the region. Fewer than 30,000 of them&mdash;0.1 per cent. or one in a thousand&mdash;are getting treated with anti-retroviral drugs. Those statistics clearly illustrate why African AIDS Action and other organisations are pressing as hard as they can to ensure that a much larger volume of ARVs is made available in Africa for HIV/AIDS sufferers.</p>
	<p pid=".34.0/5">African AIDS Action&mdash;I shall call it AAA from now on, to avoid repeating myself&mdash;aims to produce large quantities of essential anti-AIDS drugs and to price them at an affordable level so that Africans, assisted by the international community, can have universal free access to HIV treatment. It considers itself an humanitarian, not-for-profit mission. It has no intention of seeking profits as conventional pharmaceutical manufacturers do, and it believes that it will be able to make significant cuts to the price and to reduce it to an historical low. We can all agree with those objectives. I thank the Secretary of State for his very detailed reply to my letter to him on this subject. I accept that there may be questions about whether AAA's aims can be achieved on this scale and within the proposed time frame, but I think that the objectives are sound.</p>
	<p pid=".34.0/6">The AAA document clearly sets out where it sees its target market, which it has identified in theory as the 28.5 million HIV-positive Africans. Given the number of countries that AAA believes to be in a position to acquire the drugs, however, the scale will be much smaller. It will initially focus its efforts on a core group of countries that it has identified as having a very high level of political commitment to tackling the HIV/AIDS problem, without which there is no point in trying to get drugs to those markets, but it will also focus on countries where the per capita income is more than $500 a year and there is therefore the potential to pay for the drugs.</p>
	<p pid=".34.0/7">Clearly, there are doubts, which I am sure the Secretary of State will set out when he responds. To a certain extent, however, AAA's aims have already been achieved, although perhaps not on the same scale, in Thailand and Brazil. In Thailand, the Government Pharmaceutical Organisation produces seven ARV preparations that are two to 25 times cheaper than the cheapest brand equivalents. The use of generic drugs has also allowed the treatment programme to expand more than eightfold in the past three years, with only a 40 per cent. increase in the budget.</p>
	<p pid=".34.0/8">M&eacute;decins sans Fronti&egrave;res has identified several assets that Thailand has in its favour: a public health system that works well and that has trained doctors&mdash;an area that the Government and other organisations believe to be a priority; strong political resolve to combat the AIDS problem; and capability of producing its own ARV medication at a reasonable cost.</p>
	<p pid=".34.0/9">Similar things have been achieved in Brazil, where manufacturing laboratories have developed generic ARV drugs. Incidentally, Brazil is promoting the transfer of technology, and I will be interested to hear from the Secretary of State whether he has had any contact with Brazil about the offer that it has made; I    understand that it has signed undertakings or agreements with a number of English-speaking countries in Africa, such as Namibia, Zimbabwe, South Africa and Kenya. Brazil has seen one of the most significant drops in the price of drugs produced domestically by private national companies and especially by public manufacturing bodies, and elements of its success story may be relevant to producing drugs in Africa.</p>
	<p pid=".34.0/10">I wrote to the Secretary of State about this matter on <phrase class="date" code="2004-09-08">8 September</phrase> and received a detailed reply, for which I   thank him, on <phrase class="date" code="2004-10-13">13 October</phrase>. I apologise if I have incorrectly given the impression that AAA met a Minister of State. I understand that that is not the case, although it has met officials from the Department for International Development. I thought that I should correct that point on the record. In his letter, the Secretary of State sets out his concerns about the AAA proposal. The Government have concerns about potential intellectual property challenges, the AAA market forecasts and its six-month production target for producing ARVs for 7.7 million people.</p>
	<p pid=".34.0/11">A separate study initiated by the Department also identified problems associated with achieving international quality standards, with a dependence on imported active pharmaceutical ingredients and with the manufacturing capacity that exists in most developing countries, although, as I said, in Thailand and Brazil there seems to be an indigenous manufacturing capacity that is delivering a substantial quantity of drugs to their own domestic markets. I would be interested to know whether the Department has been able to analyse whether there are ways in which Brazil and Thailand have gone about the production of ARVs that would be relevant to Africa and might be relevant to AAA's proposal.</p>
	<p pid=".34.0/12">The Secretary of State also refers in his letter to AAA being provided with additional information about alternative funding sources. I hope that he will expand a little on what alternative funding sources might be available for such initiatives.</p>
	<p pid=".34.0/13">I also received a briefing from GlaxoSmithKline, and I want to highlight something that I anticipate that the Secretary of State will also emphasise: the importance of health care infrastructure and resources. If there are no medical staff on the ground to deliver ARVs, simply producing them will not be of assistance. One would expect GSK to highlight that issue, but surely those two things can be progressed in parallel and we can work with the health care infrastructure in a country at the    same time as trying to introduce some locally produced   ARVs that could be distributed through that strengthened health care infrastructure. AAA needs to respond to that issue and to say how it sees ARVs being delivered, even in the limited number of countries that have been identified, if the health care infrastructure is not there to support the distribution.</p>
	<p pid=".34.0/14">In conclusion, I want to ask the Secretary of State a couple of questions. First, what further dialogue does his Department intend to have with AAA on its proposal? Secondly, will his Department be able to work with AAA to address the genuine concerns that he has set out, such as achieving international quality standards? I am sure that, working with the Department, those are the sort of issues that could be satisfactorily addressed.</p>
	<p pid=".34.0/15">The scale of the HIV/AIDS pandemic requires the international community to investigate all possible avenues. The production of ARVs in Africa, as set out by AAA, may have the potential to deliver significant quantities of cheap ARVs. I hope that the Secretary of State will make it clear that he does not consider that option a dead end.</p>

	<p pid=".37.1/1">Thank you for your guidance, Mr. Deputy Speaker. It looks as though I shall be cut off in my prime, but the timing may work in such a way that we can all say what we want to say. I thank my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1265" name="Hugo Swire">the Member for East Devon (Mr. Swire)</phrase> for initiating the debate. The issue is enormously important; it affects tens of millions of people. As you point out, Mr. Deputy Speaker, it is a pity that more hon. Members are not present to discuss it, but what we lack in quantity we certainly have in quality this afternoon.</p>
	<p pid=".37.1/2">The issue of AIDS and HIV in sub-Saharan Africa is   central to our attempts to lift that continent out of   poverty, and it rightly forms a central plank of the      millennium development goals. Millennium development goal 6 aims:</p>
	<p pid=".37.1/3" class="indent">&quot;To combat HIV/AIDS, malaria and other diseases.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".37.1/4">Target 7 of that goal is even more explicit:</p>
	<p pid=".37.1/5" class="indent">&quot;To have halted and begun to reverse the spread of HIV/AIDS by 2015.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".37.1/6">That is a sensible and necessary goal, but sadly&mdash;let us face the truth&mdash;there appears to be no chance of meeting it at the moment on current trends. That shows the scale of the problem that we face.</p>
	<p pid=".37.1/7">The worldwide epidemic is worsening. In sub-Saharan Africa, AIDS is the leading cause of death, as my hon. Friend the Member for East Devon said. A total of 25 million people there have it, 2.2 million people died from it last year and a further 3 million became infected with it. By any yardstick those are horrifying figures, but they become even more so when one examines the sort of people affected. They are often the most productive people, the ones who are embarking on their working life or who are already employed and are the breadwinners for their families. The destructive effect of the disease on both family life and the economic life of many African countries is such that it undermines any attempt to build economic growth and to lift those countries out of poverty.</p>
	<p pid=".37.1/8">Sadly, while progress is being made in some countries&mdash;for example, Uganda&mdash;progress in tackling the disease globally is pathetically patchy. Despite the very good intentions of those involved&mdash;I fully respect the sincerity of the Secretary of State in all that he is doing&mdash;I fear that we are hardly scratching the surface of the problem. Often, at international community level, we are engaging in piecemeal schemes on a scale that is utterly inadequate. Whatever the opposite is of using a sledgehammer to crack a nut, that is it.</p>
	<p pid=".37.1/9">I read on page 3 of the Department for International Development factsheet on AIDS that drugs to treat AIDS&mdash;they get a one-line mention&mdash;are</p>
	<p pid=".37.1/10" class="indent">&quot;far beyond the means of most sufferers&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".37.1/11">Although undeniably true, that is a stark statement. I am afraid that the international community will fall   woefully short of achieving the target of treating 3 million people by 2005.</p>
	<p pid=".37.1/12">Any comprehensive policy will entail education, treatment and cure. Much that has been said and much that I say today will, I hope, enjoy support on both sides of the House. We all recognise the complexity of the problem that we face and its many facets. Today, we are concentrating on treatment, which, in itself, is a hugely complex area of debate with important differences of opinion about patented or generic drug production. It is also true that not all infected people require anti-retroviral drugs, but most do.</p>
	<p pid=".37.1/13">Most of those who do need ARVs, if they get them, can convert their death sentence into a lifelong illness. It    is probably an exaggeration to say that even 100,000 people in Africa are being treated with ARVs, and most of those are in South Africa, so hardly 0.1 per cent. are receiving treatment. We are not watching failure; we have a ringside seat at an unfolding catastrophe. DFID's factsheet speaks of a</p>
	<p pid=".37.1/14" class="indent">&quot;lack of action and funding&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".37.1/15">at international level, which is what we are trying to overcome.</p>
	<p pid=".37.1/16">The agreement signed in 2001 as part of the Doha round of WTO talks&mdash;the declaration on trade-related aspects of intellectual property rights and public health, which is known as TRIPS&mdash;stated that public health takes priority over private patents, which is an important landmark in respect of ARV production and the use of generics.</p>

	<p pid=".39.0/1">Since 2001, various countries have taken advantage of the clause that allows Governments to use compulsory licences to override patents on public health grounds.</p>
	<p pid=".39.0/2">Both the Government and the EU supported the implementation of the declaration. While I appreciate the sensitivities of this subject and the complexities of    the issue, I think it right that we recognise the   possibilities offered by the declaration. The key issue    remaining, however, was that TRIPS still restricted drug-producing countries from producing and exporting generic medicines to countries that do not have the domestic capacity to produce them, even if their Governments were to make use of compulsory licences. An agreement was reached in 2003, but it is fair   to say that it is complex, requiring importing and exporting countries to issue compulsory licences. However, that solution for dealing with the competing rights and arguments is the best that has been reached so far, and it is surely right that we explore how it works in practice and whether it delivers the improvements in public health that we all seek.</p>
	<p pid=".39.0/3">Let us first consider the costs. The cost of treatment for AIDS used to be a prohibitive $10,000 a year. It is now anything from $200 to $400. That is only $1 a day, but it is $1 a day for those who have only $1 a day. Various options and theses are advanced about how best to address the issue and overcome the financial constraints under which many African economies labour. For instance, given the background that I have outlined, can they not simply import from existing producers, using the compulsory licensing scheme? It is certainly right to test that option, which may yet work. Simplification of the compulsory licensing rules may offer the best way forward. I would appreciate hearing the Secretary of State's views on that, but perhaps it is also right that we consider some other alternatives.</p>
	<p pid=".39.0/4">My hon. Friend the Member for East Devon pointed out that Brazil has achieved an 85 per cent. reduction in AIDS-related deaths by establishing local production of ARV drugs. I do not presume to offer a comprehensive solution today&mdash;that has eluded everyone for a long time&mdash;but I hope that we can consider some options today and widen the debate on the subject.</p>
	<p pid=".39.0/5">One option that was forcefully expressed to me recently was also detailed today by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/750" name="Tom Brake">the hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington (Tom Brake)</phrase>. It has been promoted by the charity African AIDS Action, which plans to focus on locally produced ARVs in Africa. The logic of the case, as it was put to me, is to ring-fence a production capability for the area of greatest need, thereby avoiding all the inherent problems of cross-border trade. The plan&mdash;the objective&mdash;is to make ARVs locally, for local use.</p>
	<p pid=".39.0/6">Conventional wisdom says that 50 million people and a gross domestic product of $100 million are necessary for such a production facility to be viable, but I would argue that that is not applicable in this case. We must apply some unconventional wisdom to abnormal economic circumstances. What is needed is not-for-profit production combined with international funding, so that those on $1 a day can win access to the drugs that they so desperately need.</p>
	<p pid=".39.0/7">At present, ARVs can be produced at a far lower cost than ever before and there is massive need, but the extreme demand is not accompanied by the necessary purchasing power among the needy. A key policy option would be to bridge that gap by combining the most economic production of ARVs with a dramatic extension of the ability of patients to pay for them.</p>
	<p pid=".39.0/8">Like other hon. Members, I find African AIDS Action's case interesting. I look forward to the Secretary of State's response. I fully appreciate the problems inherent in such a proposal; but, equally, I can understand the need for some original thought if we are to address this massive problem. We should explore every option, and that seems a cogent one.</p>
	<p pid=".39.0/9">I also fully appreciate that drugs must be distributed once they are made and that patients need proper instruction in how to take them and proper diagnosis in the first place to determine which drugs they need. One of the greatest problems with focusing on generic production in Africa is that not many African countries have the necessary health infrastructure to carry out diagnoses, advise patients and deliver the medicines to the people who need them. However, such problems do not negate the basic concept of producing ARVs locally in Africa. We must be willing to invest, in parallel, in the production of the necessary drugs to treat AIDS and in the infrastructure needed to deliver them to patients.</p>
	<p pid=".39.0/10">The call for an African-based production facility puts the spotlight on the efficacy of the Department's entire AIDS assistance strategy. I hope that the Secretary of State will be able to comment not just on the specific suggestions that we have made today, but in broader terms on his Department's strategy for tackling AIDS and the ways in which our forthcoming presidencies of both the EU and the G8 might best be used to drive forward the fight against this dreadful disease.</p>
	<p pid=".39.0/11">I well remember that we debated this important subject a little over a month ago, but I am sure that the Secretary of State would agree that we must continue to debate it whenever the opportunity arises and that we must deliver results by taking effective action on the ground. How we approach that dreadful challenge will have a profound effect on how our world develops over the coming decades. The volume production of ARV drugs that can be delivered to the people in the numbers in which they are needed could make an enormous difference to the future health and prosperity of the world.</p>

	<p pid=".40.0/1">I echo the remarks of the hon. Members for Carshalton and Wallington (Tom Brake) and for Rutland and Melton (Mr. Duncan) in congratulating <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1265" name="Hugo Swire">the hon. Member for East Devon (Mr. Swire)</phrase> on having picked this subject and secured this debate. It is his second contribution on this subject in the past month, and I congratulate him also on an extremely clear and cogent speech about what is literally a matter of life and death.</p>
	<p pid=".40.0/2">The hon. Member for East Devon asked the right question: why have we not made more progress, given that AIDS is&mdash;I agree with him completely on this&mdash;the single biggest threat to development? That is certainly true in sub-Saharan Africa, not only because of what AIDS is doing, but because it is the part of the world where we are making least progress towards achieving the millennium development goals. Doing something about AIDS in Africa is essential to enabling that continent to progress.</p>
	<p pid=".40.0/3">I do not agree with the hon. Gentleman that a lack of progress calls into question everything that we have done until now, because many of the things that we have done hold true. He is right to say that we must ask ourselves what more we can do and how we can do it better. That is why I welcome the debate, which is a chance for us collectively to explore the nature of the challenges that we face and the most effective measures to take, while acknowledging that the problem is complex and requires action on several fronts.</p>
	<p pid=".40.0/4">That is the framework within which I want to set my replies. If it were a question merely of doing one thing, as if development as a whole were just a question of aid, the problem would be very easy to fix if one could raise the cash. It is not just a question doing that; it is about action on a number of fronts.</p>
	<p pid=".40.0/5">Like other hon. Members, I do not propose to go over the statistics on the scale of the challenge, because we did so fully in the debate in the main Chamber not that long ago. I begin by reminding Members of the steps that the   Government have taken. On World Aids Day&mdash;<phrase class="date" code="2004-12-01">1 December</phrase> last year&mdash;we published the &quot;Call for Action on HIV/AIDS&quot;, a deliberate call to us and to others to do more, and an invitation to people who are interested in the subject to send us their views and comments on what we should do.</p>
	<p pid=".40.0/6">When we published the UK strategy in July, with its commitment to spend &pound;1.5 billion on the fight against AIDS over the next three years, one commitment was to set aside &pound;150 million to support orphans and vulnerable children. I advance that as an example of the Government listening, because one point that came across very clearly from the consultation was that people did not think that enough was being done for orphans and vulnerable children. I hope that that illustrates the willingness of the Department and myself to listen and to respond.</p>
	<p pid=".40.0/7">The hon. Member for Rutland and Melton rightly made a point about our G8 presidency. The UK cannot make Africa one of the two centrepieces of its G8 presidency without putting AIDS at the heart of that effort. We are talking about a human tragedy and the impact on the economy of a whole productive generation being in the process of dying. With the older generation looking after the younger generation, they are deprived twice over.</p>
	<p pid=".40.0/8">It is a huge task getting the increased effort, energy, money and willingness from the international community to work together in the way that is most effective. I see that as the biggest single challenge that we have, not just for the G8 presidency, but in the context of what will come out of the Sachs report, the Commission for Africa report and the UN millennium summit, and it will form the main opportunity for making 2005 a development year.</p>
	<p pid=".40.0/9">No one will argue with the fact that AIDS is a global emergency that requires an emergency response. At the same time, we have to ensure that our schemes to support developing countries themselves in tackling the epidemic are efficient and sustainable over the long term, and that they manage to combine the effort, interest, enthusiasm and money of the international community with building the structures to make the schemes work. That is why we bat on endlessly about harmonisation. We must find the most effective way of bringing all the effort together, which is why the UK has been such a strong supporter of the &quot;three ones&quot;&mdash;one plan, one body with responsibility in any country and one way of monitoring progress.</p>
	<p pid=".40.0/10">We offer, and will offer in future, substantial support to the fight against AIDS in Africa, and I now turn specifically to anti-retrovirals. We are committed to increasing access to medicines for people in poor countries. One change that I made shortly after becoming Secretary of State for International Development was to make it absolutely clear that DFID was a strong supporter of treatment. We should acknowledge that there has always been debate about the fact that, although there must be treatment, there must also be a mechanism for delivering it. One will not work without the other, and we must make progress on both fronts.</p>
	<p pid=".40.0/11">We have been working with pharmaceutical companies and others to try to make medicines more affordable and accessible. At the end of June, we published our paper, &quot;Increasing Access to Essential Medicines in the Developing World: UK Government Policy and Plans&quot;, which hon. Members will no doubt have seen. Several hon. Members have referred to the decisions taken through TRIPS, and in particular the agreement last August to allow countries with no capacity or insufficient capacity in their own pharmaceutical industry to import copies of patented medicines. The European Union has now published the draft regulation needed to take that forward. The TRIPS agreements are important in saying that there should not be an intellectual property bar on enabling countries that have their own production capacity and those that do not&mdash;this is what the second agreement was about&mdash;to import from elsewhere to deal with this public health emergency.</p>
	<p pid=".40.0/12">We have seen some progress on the price of drugs, and I agree with the figures given by the hon. Member for Rutland and Melton. I was going to give a figure of about $300 for generic drugs, and he gave a figure of between $200 and $400. That is the average cost that we are talking about for generic medicines, but the cost remains higher for patented medicines: more like $700. However, we still see only a very small number of people having treatment, and I acknowledge the figures that the hon. Member for East Devon gave in that regard.</p>
	<p pid=".40.0/13">I turn now to local production of ARVs. Let us be straight: I welcome any steps to increase production of ARVs from all sources, including domestic companies in Africa. As has been said, competition will help to bring down the price of ARVs further, and together with others in the international community, we will then be better placed to work with developing countries to ensure that there is enough financing to support countries in buying medicines. It might be helpful for me to draw hon. Members' attention to some of the activities that are already under way or being planned, although I recognise that the process is quite complex. I shall come to that point when I talk about the specific proposal that we have received from African AIDS Action, to which the hon. Members for Carshalton and Wallington and for Rutland and Melton referred.</p>
	<p pid=".40.0/14">In South Africa, Aspen Pharmacare is already producing under voluntary licences from GlaxoSmithKline and Bristol Myers Squibb. In Ethiopia, Bethlehem Pharmaceuticals is preparing production under licence, working with an African NGO, the Initiative for Pharmaceutical Technology Transfer. The current state of play is that it has submitted all the necessary applications and is awaiting    authorisations. Another company, Addis Pharmaceuticals, is trying to do the same in Ethiopia. In Kenya, the company Cosmos now has a voluntary licence and is looking to produce, and there are other examples in countries such as Tanzania and Nigeria. In the Democratic Republic of the Congo, there is a public-private partnership between Pharmakina, a German-French company, and the German technical development agency GTZ. In Ghana, Zimbabwe and   Zambia, there is a partnership with the Thai Government pharmaceutical organisation, to which reference has been made. I understand that in the case of      Zambia, it is hoping eventually to sell to 13 neighbouring countries.</p>
	<p pid=".40.0/15">There are also the partnerships with the Brazilian Government to which the hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington referred. My understanding is that Brazil is giving $100,000 in technology transfer grants to countries in Africa to help them to develop that generic capacity. It is important to acknowledge that there are several examples on the stocks of people trying to do exactly what the hon. Member for East Devon asked for when raising these issues for debate. Reference has also been made to the substantial generic production taking place in other parts of the world. India and Brazil were mentioned, and there are also China and Thailand. In   some of those cases, work is being done with pharmaceutical companies based in Europe, the United States and Japan to try to make sure that the medicines have greater availability worldwide.</p>
	<p pid=".40.0/16">On the African AIDS Action proposal, I congratulate the organisation on its enthusiasm and ambition, but as I said in my letter to the hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington, ambition needs to be achievable and practical. My first point, which is very frank, is that DFID is not in the business of pharmaceutical manufacture. Although we have done our best with our expertise and with what we have been able to call upon to offer an opinion to AAA about the proposals that it has put forward, this is not a field of particular speciality.</p>
	<p pid=".40.0/17">I make that point before I refer to what needs to happen, because we have reservations about the credibility of the proposal that has been made. Any proposal has to have a credible business plan, and pharmaceutical production is a complex business that takes quite some time. It has been suggested that the proposal can take place very quickly, and I raise this question: is it achievable in the time suggested? How quickly could production be up and running, given all the other projects that are in train, involving organisations that are trying to achieve exactly the same objectives of increasing production, helping to increase competition and helping to bring down the price to ensure that ARVs are made available much more widely than currently?</p>
	<p pid=".40.0/18">We have pointed out that there are several other sources of funding for a credible plan that is likely to work. They include national Governments. To what extent has AAA been able to talk to national Governments and to some of the big pharmaceutical and generic producers? There are also social investors,    the European Community's accelerated action programme on AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria, the World Bank, the African Development Bank and the Initiative for Pharmaceutical Technology Transfer, which is an African-owned initiative under the New Partnership for Africa's Development. Our officials have asked African AIDS Action about those potential alternative sources of finance.</p>

	<p pid=".44.0/1">On the crucial point of the concept that is being proposed, what would happen if we were to set ourselves the objective, unrealistic though it may be at the moment, of getting treatment to every sufferer of HIV who needs it? Is the global problem at the moment a limit on the productive capacity of the pharmaceutical companies or the absence of funding to pay for people to get the drugs, or both?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2004-11-02.44.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/727" speakername="Hilary Benn" colnum="44"  time="015:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200304/cmhansrd/vo041102/halltext/41102h03.htm#41102h03_spnew7">
	<p pid=".44.1/1">The hon. Gentleman asks an important question. It anticipates neatly the question that I was coming to: what are the obstacles to making further progress on treatment? In part, they are the two things to which he alluded in his question. I shall put them in the following order, which is not an order of priority.</p>
	<p pid=".44.1/2">First, we need more nurses, more doctors and more of a health care service that has the capacity to administer the drugs. As part of that, we need testing. That point was acknowledged earlier. Unless there is testing and people know their HIV status, we will not be in a position to make an effective decision about whether they need treatment. Treatment must also be available. If it is available, people are more likely to come forward to be tested, because there is the possibility of getting something as a result, as opposed to knowing that they are HIV-positive but not being able to do much about it. That is not a great incentive to come forward.</p>
	<p pid=".44.1/3">Secondly, the capacity to monitor people's CD4 status is also needed. There are two ways of approaching that issue. In making this point, I hasten to point out that I am not a medical expert. I understand that syndromic management means looking at the patient and saying, &quot;You look pretty ill. We think this is what you've got, but we'll give you some anti-retrovirals.&quot; There is also management based on CD4 monitoring, which makes a medical assessment of whether somebody is at the point in their illness where ARVs would be appropriate. That looks at the effective operation or otherwise of the immune system. The danger of the first approach is that it may involve giving drugs to people at a point when they do not need them. There is also always concern about drug resistance developing. In other words, even if we had all the drugs that we needed tomorrow, we would need doctors, nurses, testing and monitoring to make sure that those drugs were used effectively to manage the disease in individuals. There is a need to ensure that people adhere to the drug regime.</p>
	<p pid=".44.1/4">Much progress has been made in producing combined therapies. There has been real progress on that front to make things easier for people. One combined pill that people take once a day is much better than many different pills that they must take at different times of day, which was the treatment regime when anti-retroviral treatment was first developed. We have come a long way in that respect.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2004-11-02.45.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1265" speakername="Hugo Swire" colnum="45"  time="015:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200304/cmhansrd/vo041102/halltext/41102h03.htm#41102h03_spnew8">
	<p pid=".45.0/1">The Secretary of State cites the example of people not being in a regime in which they take the drug every day as part of their treatment. Is he not also concerned at reports that some people who have been put on a course of drugs suddenly have them withdrawn because the drugs simply do not exist?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2004-11-02.45.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/727" speakername="Hilary Benn" colnum="45"  time="015:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200304/cmhansrd/vo041102/halltext/41102h03.htm#41102h03_spnew9">
	<p pid=".45.1/1">Of course I am concerned about that problem, which undermines the purpose of identifying that people have a need and of ensuring continuity of supply. A break in supply recently occurred in Nigeria, for example. Such a problem is extremely dangerous and damaging. That is why there has been movement in bringing prices down. I congratulate those who have worked hard to make that happen, including those in the pharmaceutical companies who have given a lead&mdash;we encourage as many others to follow that lead as    possible&mdash;and the Global Fund, the Clinton Foundation, the Gates Foundation and others.</p>
	<p pid=".45.1/2">We need a system to ensure that, even if all the drugs were available, they could go to people where they live, at the time that they need them, with continuity of supply. That is the very point that the hon. Member for East Devon made. A system must be in place to make that work. Otherwise, drugs might sit in a warehouse, people might pinch them from the warehouse or other practical difficulties might arise. That is the difficulty that we face.</p>
	<p pid=".45.1/3">I want to deal with two other points. First, I agree completely with the point that the hon. Gentleman made about local culture in the conclusion of his speech. That is an important point. It is the reason why we are and should collectively be strong advocates of the development of policies and approaches that countries and communities themselves design for dealing with the situation. To use the terrible jargon, I am talking about country ownership. But what is country ownership about? I try hard to avoid terrible jargon wherever possible, and I am sure that the Opposition spokespeople who are present will make common cause with me on that subject, because the problem is to explain these issues in ways that people can understand.</p>
	<p pid=".45.1/4">When we say that we want to support developing countries in developing their own plans it is precisely because that is one of the ways in which we can respond to the point that the hon. Gentleman made&mdash;the fact that, in the end, the countries themselves have to deal with the epidemic. They have to design their solutions, and we have a responsibility to support them.</p>
	<p pid=".45.1/5">The first African country that I ever visited was Malawi; I did so in 2001, when I was first a junior Minister in DFID. Malawi was a desperately poor country and Justin Malewezi, the then vice-president, who had responsibility for dealing with the AIDS crisis, was debating with his advisers at that point how they might use anti-retrovirals to keep some of their population alive. Those involved were faced with an impossible choice: to whom would they give the anti-retrovirals if they did not have enough drugs and enough capacity in the system to provide them to everyone? That experience had a profound effect on me, and it is why I changed and made clear DFID's approach to treatment. It seemed odd that there was a perception that, in dealing with the crisis, we were somehow behind developing countries in Africa themselves. It is now clear that we support prevention, treatment and care in those circumstances.</p>
	<p pid=".45.1/6">My final point is that we must continue to support African countries in finding solutions and to work with them. We are giving substantial funding to the Global Fund, as well as through our own bilateral programmes. We are the second largest provider of funding over a    period of long-term commitment: the figure is &pound;250   million up to 2008. We are supporting national Governments in building capacity so that they can scale up the treatment that they are offering, for example in Ethiopia and Malawi. We will continue to work with pharmaceutical supply and distribution companies on the issues that have been raised in this extremely important debate. We will increase our AIDS spending, as we have committed ourselves to do, and we will continue to support the Global Fund and to work to ensure that the new TRIPS agreement is effectively implemented.</p>
	<p pid=".45.1/7">I give one other assurance: we will continue to reflect on what we do and how we do it, because we have one common interest in this debate. We need to ensure that the resources, effort, capacity and will of this country are put to best effect in fighting the AIDS crisis, and we have a moral obligation across the world to ensure that the collective will, money, resources and effort are used to best effect to help the largest number of people in tackling this dreadful epidemic.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2004-11-02.47.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/942" speakername="Nick Harvey" colnum="47"  time="015:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200304/cmhansrd/vo041102/halltext/41102h04.htm#41102h04_spnew0">
	<p pid=".47.1/1">My constituent, James Miller, was 34 when he was killed. During a 14-year career, he had already achieved more than many film-makers would achieve in a lifetime. Documentaries that he had shot had won three Emmys, a BAFTA, five Royal Television Society awards and a Golden Nymph. Had he lived, there is no doubt that he would have gone   on to be one of the pre-eminent directors of his generation. He worked in some of the world's most hostile environments, including Algeria, Bosnia, Lebanon, Sierra Leone, Sudan and Iraq. In 2001, he shot &quot;Beneath the Veil&quot; about the repression, terror and war of Taliban-controlled Afghanistan. That film received an Emmy, and he has just won another award at the international film festival in Los Angeles for filming and directing &quot;Armenia: the Betrayed&quot;, with Fergal Keane, about the Armenian genocide in 1915. It was screened by the BBC last year. &quot;Death in Gaza&quot;, the film he was making when he was killed, has been seen on Channel 4, in the USA and at film festivals around the world, where it has collected several awards and is a candidate for more.</p>
	<p pid=".47.1/2">James Miller was shot by the Israel Defence Forces in Rafah, Gaza in the occupied territories on <phrase class="date" code="2003-05-02">Friday 2 May 2003</phrase>, exactly 18 months ago today. To date, no one has been charged with his killing and no admissions have been made as to civil liability.</p>
	<p pid=".47.1/3">James Miller arrived in Rafah on <phrase class="date" code="2003-04-16">16 April 2003</phrase>. His crew included Saira Shah, his producer, Dan Edge, and others who had worked with him before. They were making a film about the lives of children in the occupied territories. Those who worked with James, often in very dangerous conditions, can testify that he always took a precautionary approach to the crew's security. Given his background and his experience on the ground during the three weeks before his death, the team, although they were working in dangerous territory, approached security in their customary manner. They spent the evening of <phrase class="date" code="2003-05-02">2 May 2003</phrase> filming in the home of the Al Shaer family. The area where the house is located had been largely bulldozed by the Israeli army during the previous months to clear a security zone between the Palestinian houses and the Egyptian border.</p>
	<p pid=".47.1/4">During the evening of <phrase class="date" code="2004-05-02">2 May</phrase>, the crew were recording the response of Najla Al Shaer to the bulldozing of neighbouring houses by the IDF. In front of the house, two bulldozers were operating with two armoured personnel carriers providing security cover for the work. During the evening, the APC soldiers were well aware that the crew were filming at the house. The soldiers shouted over to them, often in a jocular fashion, on a number of occasions. Throughout the evening a light on the veranda of the Al Shaer house remained on, so that those observing could see a film crew there. At about 9 pm, the crew were joined by a cameraman from Associated Press Television News. Not far away, a group of peace activists had been shouting at the bulldozers through a megaphone. At around 9 pm, shots were fired in the direction of the activists, and at around 10 pm there was a small explosion in a nearby building and one of the armoured personnel carriers went briefly to investigate. Thereafter, both of them switched their lights off.</p>
	<p pid=".47.1/5">By 11 pm, there having been no activity for an hour, the crew made plans to leave. They ruled out retracing their steps across the road, knowing of the danger of being shot at from an Israeli watchtower. Attracting the attention of the APCs was judged to be the safest way to leave, given that the APC crew knew that the television crew were there and had previously allowed the family to move around as long as they displayed a white flag.</p>
	<p pid=".47.1/6">James, with a torch, his colleague, Saira, and interpreter, Aboud, stepped off the veranda wearing press flak jackets and helmets with &quot;TV&quot; emblazoned on the front in fluorescent strips. They held a white flag with James's torch shining on it. The group was entirely visible to onlookers because of the light on the veranda behind them, and they shouted out to the APC soldiers that they were the British journalists. There were no other sounds at the time to drown their words. As they approached the APC, a single shot was fired. The crew froze so that they could be clearly identified, and continued to shout that they were British journalists.</p>
	<p pid=".47.1/7">The second, fatal shot was fired a full 13 seconds later. The pinpoint shot struck James in the only vulnerable area of his neck, between his helmet and his flak jacket. It is vital to stress that there was no fighting with Palestinians, no commotion, no noise, and really very little scope for confusion. As James Miller's mother described it to me last night:</p>
	<p pid=".47.1/8" class="indent">&quot;This was in no sense the heat of a battle. It took the soldier 13 seconds to decide to kill James.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".47.1/9">He was pronounced dead at some point shortly after arrival at a military hospital, and according to Saira Shah, pressure was put on her to say, falsely, that at the time of the shooting there had been Palestinian gunfire.</p>
	<p pid=".47.1/10">The subsequent sequence of events is important. The next day, <phrase class="date" code="2004-05-03">3 May</phrase>, the army issued a statement that they had been dealing with an arms smuggling ring in the locality, that they had come under fire, and that James had probably been shot by Palestinians. On <phrase class="date" code="2003-05-04">4 May 2003</phrase>, the army issued a further statement that James had been hit in the back of the right shoulder when he was facing an Israeli tank. However, the pathologist, Yehuda Hiss, who conducted the post mortem a few days later, concluded that James had been shot in the front of his neck.</p>
	<p pid=".47.1/11">In the days that followed, a British expert, Chris Cobb Smith, flew to Gaza and conducted a preliminary forensic investigation on behalf of the family. This included, as far as he was able to do so, gathering photographic, ballistic and diagrammatic evidence, and staging a reconstruction of events. He passed the material to the Israeli authorities. However, the investigations carried out by the Israeli military had grave shortcomings. Not only was no forensic scene analysis conducted but the area in question was shortly afterwards reduced to rubble.</p>
	<p pid=".47.1/12">It is not known when and in what circumstances soldiers from the APCs were interviewed, if at all. The rifles used by the relevant soldiers were not immediately impounded for analysis. As a result of a ballistics examination, conducted on behalf of the family on <phrase class="date" code="2003-06-02">2 June 2003</phrase>, it was established that the bullet came from an M-16 rifle of the kind issued to Israeli army personnel. Under pressure from the family, the Israeli authorities were forced to take steps to secure the rifles for analysis, but this was nine weeks after the killing and it took a further two weeks for the rifles to be produced. The family were informed that 15 rifles were to be produced, but only nine were.</p>
	<p pid=".47.1/13">It is worth noting that when a soldier joins the Israel Defence Forces, he is issued with a rifle that he retains throughout his service, but the butts of the nine rifles bore consecutive serial numbers. It seems inconceivable that nine soldiers who joined the army at exactly the same time were on duty in the same unit on the night in question. As a consequence, there is a real likelihood that the military investigation into the use of firearms on <phrase class="date" code="2004-05-02">2 May</phrase> will not identify who was responsible for the fatal shot.</p>
	<p pid=".47.1/14">In November 2003, the Israeli authorities completed a general command inquiry report. Although the family were led to believe that they might be given disclosure of at least some of this document, none has been forthcoming. Somewhat inexplicably, the Israelis said that the various investigation materials previously compiled by the family's experts were not used by the army investigators.</p>
	<p pid=".47.1/15">By December 2003, the family were informed that a full conclusion would be sent imminently to the judge   advocate, and that he would consider possible prosecutions. In April they were told that the investigation was near completion, and in July they were told by Baroness Symons that a General Eiland had suggested a new line of inquiry which would take a few months. It is now November, but the family have still not been given an indication of the conclusions of the military police investigation, let alone access to it or to its underlying documentation. The Israeli Advocate-General has not so far co-operated with the British coroner, who is also investigating the incident.</p>
	<p pid=".47.1/16">James Miller's family have never sought to politicise the issues relating to his death, but we must understand the context. A month or so before, in much the same area, an unarmed British peace activist, Tom Hurndall, was shot by members of an IDF unit operating a security watchtower. It is to the credit of the Israeli authorities that the officer responsible for Mr. Hurndall's death has been charged with the equivalent of manslaughter. Perhaps the charge should have been murder, but charging him is, at least, progress. He and other officers have been charged with perverting the course of justice, having initially claimed that they were fighting with Palestinians.</p>
	<p pid=".47.1/17">In the view of many observers, the Israeli military is overstretched, has morale and discipline problems and is in some respects out of control. Some of the biggest problems are with Bedouin soldiers, who were those involved in James Miller's case. They are sometimes the least disciplined and some say that they are not infrequent users of hashish.</p>
	<p pid=".47.1/18">As recently as <phrase class="date" code="2004-10-21">21 October 2004</phrase>, <i>The Guardian</i> reported that a 13-year-old schoolgirl wearing her school uniform while walking into Israel's forbidden zone at the bottom of her street carrying her satchel was shot. The schoolgirl was several hundred metres from the Israeli watchtower. Two shots caught her in the leg. She dropped her bag, tried to hobble away and fell. Even   some Israeli soldiers described the platoon commander moving in closer to put two bullets in the child's head. An Israeli soldier told the newspaper:</p>
	<p pid=".47.1/19" class="indent">&quot;The company commander approached her, shot two bullets into her, walked back towards the force, turned back to her, switched his weapon to automatic and emptied his entire magazine into her. We were in shock. We couldn't believe what he was doing. Our hearts ached for her. Just a girl of 13&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".47.1/20">Other soldiers said that they would not serve unless the officer was dismissed. That shows that, in some units, Israeli army commanders are out of control.</p>
	<p pid=".47.1/21">In May 2003, our Foreign Secretary pledged to push the Israelis for a full, thorough and transparent investigation. What progress can the Government report into the investigation of the murder of James Miller? Has the Foreign and Commonwealth Office been given any tangible assurance from the Israelis that a full, thorough and transparent investigation is under way? Are the Government committed to assisting the Miller family and the coroner in achieving a thorough and exhaustive inquiry into the murder of James Miller?</p>
	<p pid=".47.1/22">We understand that the Israeli authorities have a prime suspect, whom they have interviewed six times. Does the Minister know whether that suspect and the other soldiers under suspicion are still serving in that troublesome area of Gaza or are suspended from duty? Can he give us any indication of when that investigation will be concluded and, specifically, whether it will be concluded within the two-year limit in which the Miller family must institute private legal proceedings, if that is the only course left to them?</p>
	<p pid=".47.1/23">It is 18 months to the day since the killing of this fine young journalist. The initial response of the Israeli authorities&mdash;first issuing misleading accounts of the cause of James's death, then failing to collect or secure evidence while it still existed&mdash;left the family, me and many others in a state of deep despair. Since then, one must acknowledge that some progress has been made. At least investigations of some sort have taken place.</p>
	<p pid=".47.1/24">This has gone on for too long. The findings of the investigations have not been disclosed and time is running out. The prosecution in Tom Hurndall's case has given hope&mdash;in my case, at least, unexpected hope&mdash;and a renewed belief that Israel listens to international opinion. However, for more than 18 months, James Miller's family have put their faith in Israel to pursue justice on their behalf. They continue to do so. Justice needs to be done and it needs to be seen to be done. Time is ticking on&mdash;particularly, as I said, in terms of that two-year deadline for a private prosecution. We all understand the difficulties and the horror of the situation in Gaza and understand that there are two sides to that question, but if Israel is to maintain any sort of international reputation or any credibility, it simply must investigate and deal with these issues of grave misconduct. I look to the Minister for an assurance that the Foreign Office, having entered into dialogue with the family over a considerable period, continues to do all that it possibly can to ensure that the Israelis come to a conclusion in a timely fashion.</p>

	<p pid=".50.0/1">I am grateful to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/942" name="Nick Harvey">the hon. Member for North Devon (Nick Harvey)</phrase> for securing this debate. James Miller's death was a terrible tragedy, not least because, as the hon. Gentleman said, he was a brave and talented journalist.</p>
	<p pid=".50.0/2">The hon. Gentleman graphically described the events surrounding the shooting on <phrase class="date" code="2004-05-02">2 May</phrase> last year, so I shall not go over them again. I share his view that justice must not only be done but be seen to be done, and I know how important it is to Mr. Miller's family and friends that the Israeli authorities carry out a full and transparent investigation into the shooting, and that the family be given access to the evidence in that investigation.</p>
	<p pid=".50.0/3">The Government have repeatedly made it clear to the Israelis that we expect them to conduct a full inquiry into the events surrounding Mr. Miller's death and to share the results with the family and us. We continue to press them on that. My right hon. Friends the Prime Minister and the Foreign Secretary, and other Foreign Office Ministers have raised the case on numerous occasions with senior Israeli Ministers, officials and members of the Israel Defence Forces. My right hon. and learned Friend the Attorney-General is currently visiting Israel. Earlier today, he raised the cases of James Miller and Tom Hurndall in detail with the Israeli military Advocate-General. He pressed for a rapid and thorough conclusion and stressed the need for accountability and co-operation with the British coroner.</p>
	<p pid=".50.0/4">Our ambassador in Tel Aviv and other Foreign Office officials have also continued to put pressure on the Israeli authorities. I will send the hon. Gentleman a summary of all those contacts, and place copies in the Libraries of both Houses. I hope that he will agree that we have left no stone unturned in this unhappy case. By my reckoning, the matter has been raised with the Israelis on more than 25 occasions, the latest occasion being today, and at all levels in the Government from the Prime Minister downwards.</p>
	<p pid=".50.0/5">The Israeli Government have assured us that they take seriously the investigation into the shooting. As the hon. Gentleman is aware, the military general command inquiry into the tragedy was completed in autumn last year, but the Israel Defence Forces have authorised a fuller, more detailed investigation by the military police. That investigation is still under way, and we are pressing for an indication of when it might be concluded.</p>
	<p pid=".50.0/6">As the hon. Gentleman said, the Miller family have made available to the Israeli authorities all the evidence that they themselves have collected, including ballistics   and pathology reports. The Government have continued to press the Israeli authorities to ensure that the military police investigation is full and thorough, and we also continue to press for access by the Miller family to the evidence considered by the inquiry.</p>
	<p pid=".50.0/7">The Government have striven at every stage to keep James Miller's family fully informed of our efforts. Our embassy in Tel Aviv facilitated two visits by family members to Israel. During their most recent visit this April, officials from our embassy joined them in meetings with an adviser to the Israeli Prime Minister and with officials from the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Israel Defence Forces. The family have used their visits to press the Israeli authorities again for a full investigation.</p>
	<p pid=".50.0/8">My right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary met the Miller family in June last year to discuss the Israeli investigation and followed up that meeting with a letter to his Israeli counterpart urging further progress. My colleague Baroness Symons has also spoken regularly to the family to update them on progress and to discuss other possible avenues for urging the Israelis to bring the investigation to a proper conclusion. I discussed the case with her last night, and she asked me to pass on her assurance that she will not let the matter drop.</p>
	<p pid=".50.0/9">The hon. Gentleman raised several points. On the Israeli soldiers who have been interviewed in the course of the investigation, the conduct of the investigation is a matter for the Israeli authorities and they remain unwilling to divulge details until it is concluded. We have not had any recent indication of when the investigation will be concluded. Last autumn, the Israelis said that the investigation would be concluded by the end of 2003. Nearly a year on, we share the hon. Gentleman's disappointment at the apparent lack of progress.</p>
	<p pid=".50.0/10">I appreciate the Miller family's concern that they are running out of time to bring a private prosecution under Israeli law. I know that the family have taken Israeli and UK legal advice on the matter. We shall continue to press the Israeli Government at every opportunity and at the most senior levels for an early conclusion. I am not in a position to comment on the coroner's process, but I understand that the coroner will likely want to wait for the outcome of the military police investigation.</p>

	<p pid=".52.0/1">The coroner in this country has been somewhat frustrated in his efforts to conduct any investigation on his own account, because inquiries that he has made of the authorities in Israel have not been answered, and indeed have been given short shrift. Is there anything that the Government can do, perhaps through the Minister's office or any other office, to encourage the Israeli authorities to co-operate with him? He has every right, and indeed a duty in international law, to conduct an investigation into the death of a British subject, and it would be wrong for the Israelis to stand in the way of such an investigation and not afford him full co-operation.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2004-11-02.52.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1127" speakername="Chris Mullin" colnum="52"  time="015:45:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200304/cmhansrd/vo041102/halltext/41102h04.htm#41102h04_spnew2">
	<p pid=".52.1/1">I certainly accept that. It is likely that the coroner will be able to proceed once the results of the inquiry are available. I am sure that he would want to wait for the results of the inquiry, frustrating though that is. I understand that Lord Goldsmith, who, as I mentioned, is in Israel today, raised precisely that question of co-operation with the UK coroner with his Israeli opposite number. It remains to be seen, of course, with what result.</p>
	<p pid=".52.1/2">Let me conclude by paying tribute to the dignified way in which the Miller family have coped with James's tragic death. I appreciate that this has been a most difficult 18 months for them. Despite their loss, they have worked with courage and determination to secure from the Israeli authorities a full and transparent investigation, and access to the evidence. The Government will continue to work with them to that end.</p>

	<p pid=".53.2/1">I am grateful to have the opportunity to begin to make a contribution on this important subject.</p>
	<p pid=".53.2/2">It is important to start by paying tribute to the national child care strategy and what has been achieved since 1997 with its contribution to the improvement of   educational attainment and the reduction of child   poverty. Those achievements are visible in my constituency, where we have four Sure Start programmes, several children's centres moving forward with the first approval of their implementation plans, two new neighbourhood nurseries opening in March next year and a number of neighbourhood nurseries initiative-funded places.</p>
	<p pid=".53.2/3">Those developments did not happen by accident, and we have had to confront Conservative-controlled councils and, in other areas, Liberal Democrat-controlled councils, which, by attempting to close nurseries, cutting voluntary service provision and reducing subsidies, have undermined what we have tried to do with Government money. It has left the Government, the London Development Agency and the Greater London authority having to plug gaps in local authority provision, and we have not been able to concentrate on building additional services.</p>
	<p pid=".53.2/4">Despite those hindrances, we stand on the brink of a new era for child care. The Government are doing nothing less than constructing a new plank of the welfare state, and we are doing so with hard evidence to support the value of the investment, whether in educational terms, as set out in the effectiveness of pre-school education study, or in economic terms, as costed by the latest PricewaterhouseCoopers study.</p>
	<p pid=".53.2/5">As well as Government investment, we are fortunate, too, in having the solid support of the Mayor of London and the Greater London authority, the London Development Agency and Association of London Government, for which child care is a priority. However, despite the achievements, vision and investment, very welcome though they are, we must recognise that the whole child care strategy is not delivering in London to the same extent as in other parts of the country. Unless we make some fundamental variations in the 10-year strategy, we will continue to lag behind in the delivery of all the benefits that child care investment can bring.</p>
	<p pid=".53.2/6">The key points are in the figures. London has the highest rate of child poverty in the country, with 38 per cent. of children living in poverty; and the figure is 53 per cent., after housing costs, in inner London. Women with children in London face a more severe employment penalty than those elsewhere. The employment rate for women without children is only slightly lower in London than elsewhere in the United Kingdom, but for women with dependent children, employment rates are substantially different. There is a 12 per cent. difference, with 53 per cent. in employment outside London, compared with 65 per cent. in London.</p>
	<p pid=".53.2/7">Many parents would prefer to work part-time while their children are very young, but opportunities for this are more limited in London than elsewhere. Nationally, 37 per cent. of women with children are working part-time; in London the figure is only 26 per cent. Parents in London are paying more for child care and they need to pay for more hours of child care, because part-time provision is less likely to be available. The average cost of a full-time day nursery place in London for a child over two years old is &pound;148 a week&mdash;20 per cent. higher than the English average. Less than half of London's nurseries have fees for children aged two or over that fit in with the &pound;135 ceiling for the child care element of working tax credit.</p>
	<p pid=".53.2/8">The Government explicitly recognise that problem in the Cabinet Office strategy unit report on London. The report, published in July, says that:</p>
	<p pid=".53.2/9" class="indent">&quot;a lack of accessible and affordable childcare is an important barrier to work&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".53.2/10">in London, with the higher cost of child care not being reflected in the tax credit system. The report calculates that a London parent with full tax credit entitlement would have to meet &pound;73 a week of their child care costs.</p>

	<p pid=".54.0/1">I was referring to the Government's Cabinet Office strategy unit report on London and the fact that it had made it clear that the higher costs of child care in the capital are not reflected in the tax credit system. It calculates that a London parent with full tax credit entitlement would have to meet &pound;73 a week of their child care needs themselves, compared with &pound;36 a week elsewhere in the country.</p>
	<p pid=".54.0/2">The report also acknowledges that tax credits do not provide support for more than two children and that that disproportionately affects some minority ethnic groups, along with others who have larger families. Figures cited in the report show that 28 per cent. of lone parents in London declare themselves unable to afford child care at all and a further 13 per cent. are unable to find suitable child care.</p>
	<p pid=".54.0/3">Research by a new deal for lone parents pilot identified what it called the added logistics problem of organising child care. The report stated that</p>
	<p pid=".54.0/4" class="indent">&quot;the biggest issue for working mothers was planning and organising the triangular journey involved in leaving home, dropping off children at childcare providers and travelling to work at another location&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".54.0/5">It added that that was</p>
	<p pid=".54.0/6" class="indent">&quot;even more difficult in areas like London&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".54.0/7">Underpinning those conclusions is the reality of unmet need for child care provision. The latest Ofsted figures appear to show child care provision in London falling behind the national average in terms of new places. The number of child minders is lower in London: 8.6 per cent. of under-fives have access to a child minder compared with 11.2 per cent. across England.</p>
	<p pid=".54.0/8">The problem of sustainability emerges in London in particular. The issue is at the heart of the affordability and cost dilemma and has been raised by people ranging from those involved with the neighbourhood nurseries initiative right through to those involved with voluntary organisations such as the Pre-School Learning Alliance.</p>
	<p pid=".54.0/9">The 10-year child care plan provides an opportunity to develop a vision of what we would like to see in London in 2015 in the key areas of child care and early years, and the related areas of employment and child poverty. We can and should congratulate the Government on what has been achieved so far, but it is precisely because of those achievements that we should not be afraid to look afresh at the scale of the challenge. The strategy must deal with the on-the-ground realities of London, offer a vision of the future and set out the steps that must be taken to turn the vision into reality.</p>
	<p pid=".54.0/10">First, the 10-year strategy needs to accommodate the reality of what will happen whatever we do. The most important example is population increase. The Greater London authority population projections show that London will have 87,000 more children under the age of five by 2015, compared with a 2001 base. London will account for the great bulk of growth in that age group at national level. We are therefore in real danger of being behind the curve in such areas as housing provision and pre-school place development. That must not be allowed to happen when it comes to working out the investment for additional child care places. In addition, London's child population will continue to become even more diverse over the period. Diversity need not correlate with poverty and unemployment, but it can easily do so if the right policy responses are not made.</p>
	<p pid=".54.0/11">Secondly, the strategy needs to accommodate our aspirations. Clearly, we hope that in 2015 London will be a much less unequal city for children, as the Government's child poverty strategy reduces income disparities. Child poverty in London will probably remain above the national average, but the national average could be far lower and the gaps could have narrowed considerably. Part of the process will involve a significant reduction in the scale of economic disparities between ethnic groups. Female employment rates in London will be far closer to the national average, if we get things right, as the employment outcomes of women with dependent children improve. The gender pay gap in London will have begun to reduce as women with children find it easier to maintain their career paths.</p>
	<p pid=".54.0/12">On the pressures that mobility and diversity can put on a city's social fabric, if we are ambitious and imaginative, it will be through children and parents, who all have in common a desire for the best for their children, that we can strengthen neighbourhoods and build social cohesion. However, for that vision to become reality we will need more parents in London to be in employment and the number of children in workless households to have fallen significantly. That will mean that the choices available to parents of young children will need to have improved. There will need to be greater flexibility in employment, improved parental leave and expanded child care and early-years provision. Benefits for those unable to work will also need to increase faster than median incomes, but increased employment will continue to be the main driver of poverty reduction.</p>
	<p pid=".54.0/13">Children's centres will also need to be sufficiently real    and comprehensive to provide a focus for neighbourhoods. The specific development in child care from the 10-year strategy for which we will be looking in London to help us to ensure that vision becomes reality are that every child under school age will have access to a children's centre, providing high-quality, flexible care and early-years education, and acting as a hub for high-quality child-minding services. The existing universal entitlement is 12 and a half hours' nursery education a week for three and four-year-olds. One option for children's centres will be to expand that universal entitlement and extend it to other age groups under five, to provide at least 20 hours of free care a week for all children, regardless of whether their parents are working. Parents who are working would then be able to purchase additional hours of care with fees based on ability to pay, meaning that parents could purchase the package of care that best suits their requirements in terms of hours and mix of provision in their area of residence.</p>
	<p pid=".54.0/14">The cost of providing child care services will have increased by 2015, but quality improvements will mean that that represents an improvement in value for money. However, the funding system will have to be reformed to ensure that large families are no longer penalised in   terms of child care support. Funding should increasingly shift towards a subsidy to providers, given the inherent difficulties of varying a national flat-rate tax credit scheme to accommodate sharp regional variation. Alternatively, an expanded and more generous child care tax credit would ensure access for those on all income levels. There are various options for refining the tax credit, which I shall not go into in detail; they are thoroughly developed in representations that the Association of London Government, the Greater London authority and I have previously made to the Government. We have never been able to convince the Government of the need for a regional variation in the tax credit as a fundamental principle, so we will almost certainly need to focus predominantly on increasing the supply side for affordability.</p>
	<p pid=".54.0/15">We will expect providers to be part-funded to offer flexible services for younger children. Funding will be required to support the work force model, as labour costs will otherwise push costs above affordability thresholds. We look for funding recognition to be given to support providers, so that affordable options can be given to parents of under-threes who, whether through choice or as a result of unemployment, are out of the work force. Although it is reasonable not to provide full-time day care for such groups, it is not in the interests of the parent or the child, especially among more vulnerable parents and communities such as black and minority ethnic communities, to make child care so dependent on entry into the labour market that it is, to all intents and purposes, a cliff edge, and those not in work are unable to access any meaningful provision until their child turns three.</p>
	<p pid=".54.0/16">We will expect child care and early-years education increasingly to be delivered by highly qualified staff. The introduction of stable career progression will lead to far lower rates of staff turnover, and those entering the profession with no qualifications should have access to clear career progression paths. Rates of pay will increase in recognition of the improved skills base, and a London weighting system will ensure that children's centres are a viable career option for parents in the capital.</p>
	<p pid=".54.0/17">The expansion of the child care and early years work force will itself lead to a step change in the availability of flexible, locally based employment in London. If we get that right, the knock-on effect will be the gradual emergence of improvements in local economies, especially in some of our more deprived communities. A   comprehensive programme of training provision through the learning and skills councils and the London Development Agency, coupled with an active local recruitment policy on the part of providers, will ensure that new opportunities are overwhelmingly taken up by local residents, many of whom will have previously been out of the labour market. New residential developments in London will incorporate child care and early-years facilities as essential social infrastructure as a matter of course.</p>
	<p pid=".54.0/18">There should be no embarrassment, and no defensiveness, on the part of the Departments&mdash;the Department for Education and Skills or the Treasury&mdash;as they have achieved so much, starting from such a low base in 1997. However, I fear that defensiveness might prevent us from accepting the fact that there is a substantial regional shortfall in the provision, and the scale of affordability, of child care. That is having a distinct effect in holding back employment opportunities for parents as a whole, and for lone parents and the most deprived in particular.</p>
	<p pid=".54.0/19">I hope that the 10-year strategy will not disappoint Londoners. Although we face a real challenge, if we do not meet it we will not meet our lone parent employment targets or our child poverty reduction targets across the country as a whole. Much will ride on the strategy. I hope that the Minister will respond as far as he can this afternoon, but I hope primarily for an assurance that my points will be taken seriously and that the 10-year strategy will give us a chance to deliver on some of them.</p>

	<p pid=".57.0/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/762" name="Karen Buck">the Member for Regent's Park and Kensington, North (Ms Buck)</phrase>, not just on securing the debate but on the one-woman campaign that she has waged during the past seven years to ensure that the needs of Londoners in respect of child care, housing and employment are recognised in a suitable way. I congratulate her on the passion with which she addresses the issues and the facts and research that she uses to back up many of her arguments.</p>
	<p pid=".57.0/2">I hope that, on one score, I can disabuse my hon. Friend and the watching millions of the notion that there is any defensiveness on the part of the Government. My appearance testifies to the confidence with which the whole Department wants to address the issues. She will know that my right hon. Friend the Minister for Children, Young People and Families would have been here but for the fact that, as we speak, she is appearing on the Floor of the House. I hope that my hon. Friend does not take the presence of such a junior Minister as myself as a reflection of the issue's not being made a priority. Instead, I hope that she sees it as an example of joined-up government that the Minister for School Standards takes the issue seriously.</p>
	<p pid=".57.0/3">I agree with my hon. Friend that the progress that has been made in developing a serious child care offer for children and parents is significant. I was struck, when examining the extensive research that was carried out for this debate, to see the investment that has gone on in London. To consider just one aspect of the child care offer, of 524 Sure Start programmes throughout the country, 96 are in London boroughs, with more than half of all London boroughs having more than three programmes.</p>
	<p pid=".57.0/4">The revenue grant for local programmes working with children under four and their families in the most disadvantaged areas in London alone totals nearly &pound;150 million between 2004 and 2006. London Sure Start local programmes have been allocated higher levels of capital, perhaps reflecting some of the costing issues alluded to by my hon. Friend. More than &pound;165 million of capital has been allocated through local programmes in children's centres, with a further &pound;22.5 million allocated to neighbourhood nurseries in London. I    agree with her that such investment, and the seriousness with which staffing and related issues have been taken in respect of under-fives and child care for youngsters over five but not yet independent adults is really significant.</p>
	<p pid=".57.0/5">My hon. Friend said that this is a new frontier for the welfare state, which is a good way of considering the challenge that faces us. The relationship between local and central Government, and our interventions to support families and the choices that they make about how to bring up their children, is an issue that has not been addressed in a holistic and serious way by the welfare state since 1945. She is right to say that that challenges the ingenuity and innovation of central and local government. If we are to extend security and opportunity, the child care offer should be at the heart of the welfare state.</p>
	<p pid=".57.0/6">In that context, the Chancellor's announcements in the Budget concerning the long-term commitment to funding for Sure Start&mdash;an extra &pound;769 million between now and 2007&ndash;08&mdash;is significant and is a demonstration of the commitment the Government have and the voices we have listened to. Before I deal with my hon. Friend's point about the importance of recognising the regional dimension to the child care strategy, it is worth dwelling for a moment on two aspects of the 10-year strategy that she highlighted. First, there is a need to balance choice and investment&mdash;without investment, there is no choice. Although we have been proud of the fact that the pledge to deliver a nursery place for all three and four-year-olds has been delivered, it is up to parents whether they take account of that. She made the point that we have to deliver a range of provision in a range of settings if we are to meet the aspirations of all families. That is an important starting point.</p>
	<p pid=".57.0/7">My hon. Friend stressed the need to balance the demand and supply sides of the equation. Our investment has to go in on both sides. We must ensure that the investment is in the hands of families so that they are able to make their choices. That is the purpose of the tax credit system. Equally, we must ensure that the supply side&mdash;the range of provision and the staffing of that provision&mdash;is of sufficient quality that parents have the confidence to proceed.</p>
	<p pid=".57.0/8">The whole Government are working on the 10-year child care strategy that provides the focus for this debate, and it might help my hon. Friend if I make a couple of points about how we are proceeding. We see four key principles at the heart of the strategy. First, the principle of early intervention is essential if we are to obtain the sort of change that we need&mdash;a radically improving universal and specialist service for those at risk. Secondly, parenting support needs to be allied to statutory services if we are to obtain the necessary provision. Thirdly, schools should be resources for a child care strategy, not somehow enemies of the strategy, operating separately from it. Fourthly, the range of professional expertise that exists in local government and in the voluntary sector needs to be deployed in the sort of multidisciplinary teams that my hon. Friend referred to. Those four principles will underlie the 10-year strategy as it is developed.</p>
	<p pid=".57.0/9">I do not want to repeat what some of my right hon. and hon. Friends have said about the development of the strategy, the commitment to use primary schools for 8 am to 6 pm child care, and the use of secondary schools as the basis for study support activities, because my hon. Friend will know about all that. However, she stressed the need to take account of regional and local variation in the development of the strategy. The important point that I want to make to her is that we are absolutely committed to doing that, and her contribution today will help us to do so. I hope that she takes some confidence&mdash;I was going to say solace, but confidence is more appropriate&mdash;from the fact that the Government have recognised the need to address some of the specific issues in London by setting up a specific project via the Prime Minister's strategy unit, which has tried to look at some of the issues.</p>
	<p pid=".57.0/10">We recognise that there are arguments about a &quot;London effect&quot; in a range of employment and other issues&mdash;notably cost, but also in other areas. It would be wrong for me to say that there is an easy answer, but the Government are clear that children and parents in London have as much right as children and parents anywhere else to a child care offer that lives up to their aspirations. The debate that my hon. Friend has helped to promote is certainly one that we want to engage in. On a previous occasion, she talked about the power of Sure Start in her constituency. I know of the North West Kensington and Golborne Sure Start programmes, and I am sure there are others. She has talked powerfully about the impact of those programmes on the life chances of young people, not just before the age of five but as they go through primary and secondary school.</p>
	<p pid=".57.0/11">The Government are as inspired as my hon. Friend about the progress that can be made by such strategic investment. We recognise that some of the challenges in London represent a significant hurdle for statutory and voluntary services and we want to deal with them. I assure her that I shall take the message of this debate to my right hon. Friend the Minister for Children, Young People and Families.</p>
	<p pid=".57.0/12" class="italic">Question put and agreed to.</p>
	<p pid=".57.0/13" class="indent">Adjourned accordingly at sixteen minutes to Five o'clock.</p>
