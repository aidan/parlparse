	<p>I am grateful for the opportunity to raise the expected impact of water charging in Northern Ireland. In the absence of devolved government, there is unquestionably a democratic deficit, and people feel it most acutely on issues such as this. Few issues in recent years have generated more interest and concern among the people of Northern Ireland than the proposal to introduce water charging. The public reaction, as reflected at public meetings, in the press and in the attitude of people throughout the community, has been universally critical&mdash;albeit to varying degrees&mdash;of the Government's approach and the way in which they intend to move forward. No one will be more aware of that than the Minister. As I shall show later, I have some sympathy for him in one respect, in that he picked up a ball that was left for him by the pro-agreement parties in the Executive. However, he did run with it with great enthusiasm.</p>
	<p>For all sides in the debate, it is important that the subject is debated openly and honestly. I fear that the Government are in too much of a hurry, and many will accuse Northern Ireland Office Ministers of allowing themselves to be bullied by the Chancellor of the Exchequer and, as a result, of not approaching the consultation process with as open a mind as they should have done. Tangentially may I say, Mr. Cook, that the Minister, as he presses ahead with his wider water reform agenda, should perhaps learn the lesson of that? I strongly advise him not to rush ahead with the project. The issue is not remotely close to having been sufficiently ventilated in public. The debate should continue and further debate and discussion will bring about a better outcome.</p>
	<p>It is important that water charging is placed in its proper context: the under-investment in infrastructure over the past 30 years and the approach taken by the last Executive. My party has sought over many years to warn people of the consequences of the course that the Government have followed and to educate people in the evolving debate. We have published policy papers and proposals. In &quot;Water Charging: Exposing the Government's tax-raising agenda&mdash;An alternative way forward&quot; and our &quot;Triple Tax Threat&quot; policy document, we set out our position on those matters. We have dealt with the issue responsibly and constructively.</p>
	<p>The Government, however, seem intent on proceeding with their plans regardless of the views of the people of Northern Ireland. A return to devolution will not necessarily result in any easy answers or solutions, but at least we would have an opportunity to make our own decisions and take responsibility for the choices that we make. At the moment, Mr. Cook, the debate&mdash;</p>

	<p>Thank you, Mr. Deputy Speaker.</p>
	<p>I was saying that the debate is characterised on one hand by a Government who are free to propose as they please, without fear of any electoral consequences, and on the other by local parties that can oppose as they please without the fear of having to take any responsibility. That is not a healthy situation in a democracy, and nor is it likely to lead to the best debate or the best decisions.</p>
	<p>I have no doubt that the best way to deal with the situation is an early return to devolution to allow locally elected politicians to sort it out. Some have suggested that parties in Northern Ireland are happy to see direct-rule Ministers taking such difficult decisions so that if and when devolution returns, we can claim that our hands are clean. Let me make it clear, at least on behalf of my party, that that is not the case.</p>
	<p>If I were in government today, I would take the same approach that I advocated publicly and privately when I dealt with the issue as a Minister in the Department for Regional Development. I say that because it is interesting to see how some parties are now taking a rather different approach from the one that they took during devolution. Revisionism has been taken to a new level and transformed into an art form by some of them, but I shall come back to that point.</p>
	<p>Whatever the nature of the debate about water charging, there can be no doubt&mdash;nor, I suggest, any argument&mdash;about the need for significant investment in water services. Investment is vital for both the provision of water and the treatment of waste water. When I became a Minister, I was appalled by the state of the infrastructure, which was a consequence of it having been starved of funds for decades. Without the necessary investment, serious health issues will arise and environmental damage will inevitably be caused.</p>
	<p>Investment is required to meet European directives and prevent massive fines for the UK, although I rather suspect that the Treasury would remove such money from the Northern Ireland block. Northern Ireland Ministers would probably then reduce DRD spending, so the cycle would continue. We also require investment for the developments that must proceed. We have already heard discussion in the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs about curbs on development as a result of the waste water problems in the Province. The consequences of that would be massive for jobs in the construction industry, so the matter must be tackled with a view to the massive investment needed.</p>
	<p>We should also remember the circumstances that brought about the infrastructure deficit in Northern Ireland. There were 30 years of terrorism&mdash;you need not concern yourself, Mr. Deputy Speaker, because I am not going down that road. However, it needs to be said that much-needed resources were directed to the fight against terrorism and away from vital infrastructure. Given the responsibility of direct-rule Administrations over that period, it is unreasonable to ask the people of Northern Ireland to make up the shortfall.</p>
	<p>A significant element of any water charge will go towards upgrading infrastructure, which is required because of the lack of investment in the past. People in Northern Ireland undoubtedly feel aggrieved at having to pay to put right a situation that others allowed to deteriorate. People especially resent having to pay twice for their water. People in Northern Ireland will recall that in the decade before 1999, water services were funded from the regional rate through an hypothecated charge. The pro-agreement parties in the Executive bear a significant responsibility for the position in which we now find ourselves. The Minister will be aware that the break in the linkage was contrary to the advice given by the Department when I was in charge of it&mdash;indeed, when I was performing his role in July 2000.</p>

	<p>The right hon. Member for Upper Bann (Mr. Trimble) is talking about the Belfast agreement. We were in the business of burying it, not changing it. He wants it to continue in its original form. However, I shall not be dragged in that direction.</p>
	<p>The Minister will be aware that in July 2000, my permanent secretary, Ronnie Spence, and I met the then Minister of Finance and Personnel, Mr. Mark Durkan. We argued that the linkage between water and the regional rate should be retained. The DFP Minister and pro-agreement members of the Executive did not take my advice, as a result of which there was no identifiable way to show that the householders of Northern Ireland were paying for their water, and of course the Chancellor pounced. If the link had been maintained, the Treasury could not have ambushed us.</p>
	<p>The short-term implication of the Treasury's decision was to remove any clear justification for an above-average increase in the rates, and the longer-term consequence was to allow the Chancellor to step in and press for water charging in Northern Ireland that was additional to the regional rate. At the meeting with Mark Durkan, I argued strongly against breaking the link for those reasons. I advanced such an argument on numerous occasions thereafter while I was in office, including directly with the then First Minister on 10 June 2002. I also put my views on the public record. My position today is the position that I took privately and publicly and advocated while in office.</p>
	<p>It is hardly surprising that people believe that they continue to pay for water through the regional rate, given that there was no reduction in the regional rate when the link was broken. That leads to the inescapable conclusion that, despite the visible link having been broken, people continue to pay for water services through their rates. Indeed, as there is no Barnett provision for water, the regional rate must bear the burden for water services.</p>
	<p>When I was a Minister at the DRD, my view was straightforward, as my position on taxation has been throughout my political career. I have been in favour of the lowest possible taxes in exchange for quality services. I have followed such a policy at local government level and in the Northern Ireland Assembly. Indeed, my record at Castlereagh borough council and the DRD speaks for itself. I was opposed to the break between the regional rate and the funding of water services. When the Treasury demanded that Northern Ireland should have a separate water charge and become self-financing, I argued that that could be done by identifying, reflecting and separating the contributions towards water services that were already paid within the existing rates bill and reducing the remaining segment accordingly. Any increase would be required only to fund additional investment, which could be offset by the savings that officials told me were possible in the Water Service and the introduction of a developer's contribution.</p>
	<p>It is interesting to see how some parties that took an opposing view at the time have repositioned themselves&mdash;resistance to higher taxation appears to be infectious for some when not in government, especially at election times. Only a few years ago, when wearing a different hat, someone who now voices opposition to higher taxation talked about</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;necessary substantial increases in locally based revenue in the next few years&quot;.</p>
	<p>That was a statement by Mark Durkan in 2001. Others pointed out that we would have no credibility with the Treasury</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;unless we accept that we have to address the level of local revenue.&quot;</p>
	<p>That is an Executive paper from the then First and Deputy First Ministers and the Minister of Finance and Personnel in 2002.</p>
	<p>In a policy document on the subject, the Ulster Unionist party stated:</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;It is widely recognised that Northern Ireland has the lowest household rates in the UK. Central Government is no longer prepared to sustain subvention at current 'Barnett' levels unless the Executive takes steps to address the rates imbalance with the rest of the United Kingdom. Water Charging is the largely accepted way of doing so.&quot;</p>
	<p>It will not be a surprise to note that that policy document seems to have been removed from the Ulster Unionist party website, for one reason or another.</p>
	<p>The Social Democratic and Labour party, whose members are going around the Province campaigning against water charges, took a very different approach when it was in office. The SDLP Minister of Finance and Personnel, Sean Farren, spelled out his position in April 2002 when he said:</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;while it may be unpalatable, we may also have to accept that if we want better public services here we will have to pay more for them . . . This will mean looking hard at the rates and at the financing of our water and sewerage services.&quot;</p>
	<p>There is some merit in putting on public record the advice that I offered the Executive on this matter in May 2002:</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;I am open to better suggestions arising through the consultation process but it is hard not to recognise the advantage of Water Service costs being isolated as part of the Regional Rate bill with only the new infrastructure being charged additionally to the Ratepayer and then only if needed after savings have been made, from amongst other things, bureaucratic extravagance. This alternative offers a desirable outcome which (1) clearly identifies the source of income for water services; (2) provides for much needed additional funding for water infrastructure; (3) avoids having to unnecessarily burden the Ratepayer; and (4 ) enables hypothecation of revenues raised to fund Water Service&quot;.</p>
	<p>In such circumstances, there would be no substantial increase in local taxes, and the existing arrangements would be appropriate for assessing water charges.</p>
	<p>Some local parties have been disingenuous about their approach, but I do not believe that the Government have been entirely straightforward on the issue, either. In support of the introduction of water charges, they put forward a number of arguments that, on examination, cannot be defended. The first is that people in Northern Ireland do not pay for their water. From my remarks earlier, it is clear that this argument cannot be sustained. Given that, to all intents and purposes, no money is given to fund water services in Northern Ireland by the Treasury, the only way that it can be paid for is by people in Northern Ireland through regional rates. The Government may argue that insufficient money is then spent on other public services in Northern Ireland, but they cannot argue that people do not pay for water.</p>
	<p>The second Government argument is that this measure is required by EU law. That contention does not withstand scrutiny if one looks at the relevant EU directive, the water framework directive of 2000, which states:</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;Member States shall ensure by 2010 that water-pricing policies provide adequate incentives for users to use water resources efficiently, and thereby contribute to the environmental objectives of this Directive.&quot;</p>
	<p>In the absence of compulsory metering, the Government's proposal does not provide adequate incentives to use water resources more efficiently. Indeed, if the water charge is based on the value of a person's home, there is no incentive whatever to use water efficiently, so it is clear that that cannot possibly be a real argument for bringing forward the type of charging suggested. I would ask the Government to reflect on the matter; the Republic of Ireland complies, or purports to deal, with the directive in a much more flexible way, as I think that the Minister would agree.</p>
	<p>The third argument that the Government put forward is that people in Northern Ireland do not pay enough in local taxes. In my opinion that contention entirely misses the point. The level of local taxes in Northern Ireland has no impact on the rest of the United Kingdom. Self-evidently, the higher the local taxes, the more local spending power is available. Different council tax levels and varying levels of service apply in neighbouring councils in Great Britain, so why should there be some over-riding reason for the Government to decide this matter for the people of Northern Ireland?</p>
	<p>Rate-capping may have been a feature in the past in Great Britain, but the notion of a minimum level seems somewhat novel; in fact, it is absurd. Where else would central Government be asking politicians to increase local taxes and shun efficiency? I have consistently argued, both in office and since then, that savings and efficiencies are a much better way to free-up resources for vital spending than unnecessarily raising rates and taxes.</p>
	<p>All the arguments advanced by the Government are fundamentally misconceived. The only argument for a separate water charge turns on the implications of the new system of resource accounting. That was highlighted in the letter from the Chief Secretary to the Treasury to the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland in July 2002. The implications of not signing up to self-financing water services are likely, due to technical rules, to be damaging to our spending power in Northern Ireland. However, that is not an argument for higher taxation overall; it is only an argument for dividing and administering the existing level of payments differently.</p>
	<p>Unless the Northern Ireland Executive makes a commitment to self-financing arrangements for water services, Northern Ireland will lose spending power, beginning with tens of millions of pounds each year and leading to hundreds of millions. I have always believed that it is important that the choices, and implications of those choices, should be put before the people of Northern Ireland. Indeed, as the Minister responsible I wrote as early as March 2002 to Sean Farron, the then Finance Minister, and stressed the importance of setting out the context and implications of the choice.</p>

	<p>I thank the hon. Gentleman for giving way. I am glad to hear him refer to the impact of resource assessment budgeting. He is right to say that that is a significant factor. However, as I understand it, he is arguing that one digs out the hitherto hypothecated water element in the rates and brings it to a level that will provide self-sufficiency in water services. Does he accept that the implication of that is that the money hitherto raised through the regional rate that went into other services will no longer be available and he will find himself with less money for other services, or having to raise more money through the regional rate to fill the shortfall?</p>

	<p>No, I certainly do not. That is a bogus argument. The right hon. Gentleman clearly does not have an accounting degree. If the money is already paying for water and sewerage services in Northern Ireland, it is not paying for other services. Identifying that amount of money, which is already being used for that purpose, does not take it away from any other service; it simply identifies and administers the process differently.</p>
	<p>Although the manner in which any water charge is applied is important for those who will have to pay it, the size of the overall burden is an even greater issue. These issues cannot be viewed in isolation from other changes in local taxation in Northern Ireland. Some in Northern Ireland are campaigning under the banner of &quot;Can't pay, won't pay.&quot; My slogan and my argument are different: I say that we are paying and should not pay twice. We should reclassify existing local taxes, identify the water charge element, uncouple it from the regional rate and present it as a separate charge, and reduce the regional rate accordingly.</p>
	<p>However, in the circumstance that the Government face us with, we can either keep our purity and opt out of discussing the new arrangements that they have suggested or we can take advantage of the legal practice of pleading in the alternative. Taking that position, I must conclude that defining the fairest method of payment to employ is not simple.</p>
	<p>My colleagues and I have suggested that people should have a choice between basing the charge on the value of their home or opting for voluntary metering. Contrary to some newspaper letters that are being mysteriously orchestrated at the present time, we put forward that position before, even, the Northern Ireland Assembly elections and it is contained in our policy document. That position allows householders to choose what is best for them in the circumstances in which they find themselves.</p>
	<p>The General Consumer Council for Northern Ireland has done a lot of good work assessing the impact of water charging and has produced statistics that have helped to inform this debate. To the Government argument that people in Northern Ireland pay less in local taxes than those in Great Britain, the GCC points out that householder expenditure already forms 12 per cent. more of gross household income than the UK average&mdash;without adding the expected higher rates and water charges.</p>

	<p>The hon. Gentleman was talking a few moments ago about &quot;Can't pay, won't pay.&quot; Does he distinguish between those who have been developing that campaign along the lines that they have done in the past and those who have been living in moderate housing that was bought when they were working in ordinary employment? The value of such houses has gone up tremendously. With the increase in rates and now their water rate such people would find it utterly impossible to pay.</p>

	<p>I am not being critical of those who campaign under the slogan &quot;Can't pay, won't pay,&quot; I just believe that it is misconceived and that they are already paying. As for people in deprived backgrounds, the statistics produced by the GCC strongly support the argument that the hon. Gentleman advances. Indeed, an average water charge of &pound;340 would increase weekly expenditure to &pound;389.34, which means that it would equate to 86.9 per cent. of gross household income and would widen the gap with the rest of the United Kingdom.</p>

	<p>My hon. Friend raises an extremely important point. Is it not a fact that the Government have referred to the increased expenditure on businesses in Northern Ireland in terms of energy and insurance costs, and so on, but have not paid any attention to the higher costs for domestic ratepayers and householders? That is one of the issues that he rightly highlights.</p>

	<p>Yes, of course, I agree with that. It is somewhat unusual, is it not, for a Labour Government to be championing the cause of business against the individual consumer? Perhaps the fact that there are no Labour candidates in Northern Ireland has some impact on that position.</p>
	<p>To return to the point I was making, essential weekly household expenditure would equate to 47.8 per cent., which would again widen the gap with the rest of the United Kingdom. The figures I have provided give a much more realistic sense of the impact of water charges than the bald comparisons of local tax levels. The GCC estimates that 169,926&mdash;or one in four households in Northern Ireland&mdash;are at risk of water-affordability and poverty problems. I hope that the Minister takes in that statistic and understands the hardship and anguish that it represents&mdash;one in four will suffer from water poverty.</p>
	<p>Of even greater concern is the fact that 27 per cent. of households that are on housing benefit and receive rate rebate, which are currently protected from the cost of water in their rate bill, will have to pay water charges, albeit at a slightly reduced level. Whereas those people could escape the water charge while it was included in the regional rate, they cannot escape it under the Minister's proposals. Before the Government go much further with their current plan, it is critical that they think again about the impact of water charges on householders in Northern Ireland. To fail to do so would have serious consequences for Northern Ireland householders as well as the workability of the proposals.</p>
	<p>Before Christmas, while the other parties posed and moaned about water charging and the threat of increased taxation, my colleagues and I attempted to do something about it. During the talks process leading to the Government's paper on a comprehensive agreement, we sought to address the issue on the basis that I set out earlier. Although the Government were not flexible on some aspects of our proposal, we were working towards an outcome that would have led to the Treasury agreeing to allow Northern Ireland to continue accessing the reinvestment and reform initiative borrowing facility while pegging the regional rate for the phasing-in period of the water charge.</p>
	<p>The deal, which was in the final stages of negotiation but not completed, would have saved householders hundreds of pounds over the next few years, and involved freezing the regional rate, reducing the district rate by applying Barnett consequentials, and leaving the new Executive to apply whatever level of a resource element they determined to reduce further the district rate. In addition, we sought to lengthen from three to five years the phasing in of water charging. That would have further reduced its impact. The matter was still under negotiation when Sinn Fein, unable to adapt to democratic politics, walked away from the table. That meant that the conditions in which the Government would have activated the proposal were not realised.</p>
	<p>Along with the proposal to set up a &pound;1 billion fund to tackle the ageing infrastructure, the Executive would have been well placed, after introducing efficiencies and developer contributions, to produce a much more acceptable way forward. It might not have been ideal in every respect, but within the constraints set by the Treasury, it represented a significantly better deal than the one presently being served up. I urge the Minister and the Government to pick up on those elements of our discussions, and I hope that rather than foisting this unbearable burden on the people of Northern Ireland, they might revise their existing plans.</p>

	<p>I look forward to taking part in this debate under your chairmanship, Mr. Deputy Speaker. I am sure that you and all hon. Members are looking forward to the Minister responding to some of the questions and points that will be raised in the debate, unlike his ministerial colleague, the Under-Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, the hon. Member for Brent, North (Mr. Gardiner), who appears to think that one does not have to answer questions raised in Adjournment debates.</p>
	<p>As the hon. Member for Belfast, East (Mr. Robinson) has already pointed out, there is great concern about the Government's proposals for the reform of water and sewerage charges. Unfair is not a word that I usually use in politics, but the proposal is unfair for the general population of Northern Ireland. If I may, I will open my remarks not with the words of right-wing David Burnside, Unionist Orange bigot from South Antrim, but with those of the equality impact assessment that was commissioned by the General Consumer Council for Northern Ireland. It stated that a property-based charge based on capital value will have a negative impact on Protestants, Unionists, married couples, the elderly and their carers. It continued that Protestants are likely to bear a disproportionately greater burden of the domestic and sewerage bill than their representation in the wider Northern Ireland community would indicate. Unionists are also likely to bear a disproportionately greater burden of the domestic and sewerage bill than their representation in the wider Northern Ireland community would indicate. There will be a negative impact on the elderly and those with elderly dependants. Perhaps the Minister would comment on that.</p>
	<p>No allowance has been made in the Government's proposals for the most vulnerable in our society. What about pensioners who survive on low incomes but remain in their family home? What about families in receipt of family tax credit? How will they afford to pay for water charges under the new proposals? The Government's proposed 25 per cent. discount for low-income households in Northern Ireland is inadequate to address affordability issues. Will the Minister acknowledge that it would cost &pound;40 million per year to provide full protection for the most vulnerable households? Will he therefore give an undertaking to go back to the drawing board and to come back with a fairer, more affordable suggestion that will not put additional pressure on already vulnerable ratepayers?</p>
	<p>We all realise that Northern Ireland's rates, with their different historical background, are considerably less than the equivalent in England, Scotland and Wales but, as the hon. Member for Belfast, East has already pointed out, the income and expenditure profile in Northern Ireland is entirely different. Our household expenditure forms 12 per cent. more of our gross household income than the UK average. If water charges were added, at an average of &pound;340, equating to &pound;6.54 per week, it would increase our weekly household expenditure to &pound;389.34. That would mean that household expenditure equated to 86.9 per cent. of gross household income, widening the gap with the rest of the UK.</p>
	<p>Moreover, ratepayers in Northern Ireland face an additional significant hike in their household bills over the next few years. The regional rate, currently at 55 per cent. of the rates bill, will increase by 9 per cent., 9 per cent. and 6 per cent. respectively over the next three years and district rates are also likely to increase with the impact of waste management costs on local councils. The Government must therefore take into account the question of affordability. It is widely recognised that there is growing customer debt. It is estimated that a quarter of county court judgments in England and Wales are for water companies pursuant to water arrears.</p>
	<p>Water arrears are currently at &pound;893 million in England and Wales. The cost of the debt burden adds an average &pound;10 to water bills, a further penalty for those who pay. There is something badly wrong with the system. If that were transferred to Northern Ireland on a pro rata basis, it would equate to arrears of at least &pound;29 million. That would have to be borne by higher bills for those customers who can afford to pay. Some 169,926 households&mdash;one in four&mdash;will be at risk of water poverty.</p>
	<p>What is the Government's current estimate of the administrative cost of recovering bad debt through the courts? These are questions that the Government seem never to have answered before. It is expected that many consumers will contest or appeal their new valuation. The Water Service will become the unofficial appeals mechanism for rates, imposing additional burden and costs on it, which, again, will inevitably be passed on to consumers. Who will pay for the administrative burden and delay in collecting water charges?</p>
	<p>The only time limit is from the EU directive, which stipulates 2010. Given the obvious implementation problems, why are the Government rushing these proposals through by 2006? No health impact assessment has been conducted, despite the obvious links between poverty, debt and poor health, including stress and mental health factors, which are clearly identified in the Government's own &quot;Investing for Health&quot; strategy. Why not?</p>
	<p>There are alternatives. As the General Consumer Council for Northern Ireland eloquently said, they must be &quot;fair, affordable and sustainable&quot;. The Treasury has refused to extend to Northern Ireland the so-called green dowry&mdash;I suppose that that is something given away on St. Patrick's day&mdash;that was given to water companies in Great Britain prior to privatisation. The Treasury should pay to bring Northern Ireland's water and sewerage infrastructure up to the standard of its modern equivalents, instead of the burden of the cost being passed on to local ratepayers. It should fill the gap where the necessary infrastructure and capital investment was not made in the past. The cost of road drainage should not be embedded in a domestic water charge; road users should assume the cost. Further developers could pick up the costs of additional development and infrastructure, instead of existing consumers.</p>
	<p>Metering is an open subject in this debate. What consideration have the Government given to it? It appears to have been all but ruled out before any assessment has been made about how it could affect local people. Further discussion is needed on the possibility of introducing a metering system with built-in protection of water allowances to protect those who cannot afford to pay.</p>
	<p>I own a farm in north Antrim, and I wish briefly to address how farmers will be affected. We already have meters on our agricultural land, and farmers are going to lose their domestic allowance. I would like the Minister to comment on that increased cost to them.</p>

	<p>In order to assist me in my reply, may I ask the hon. Gentleman whether he is proposing voluntary or universal metering? Also, what basis does he want there to be for the charging under metering? Is he proposing marginal cost or average cost for differentiating between those who are metered and those who are not?</p>

	<p>My personal view is that optional metering would be the fairest system. Provision could be made for metering to be possible in all new-build housing in Northern Ireland. However, allowances would have to apply, regardless of whether there is a metering system.</p>

	<p>May I press the hon. Gentleman? Should there be average costing, so that if someone uses 50 per cent. less water, they pay 50 per cent. less, or should the marginal cost of delivering the extra water be the measure?</p>

	<p>The costing would have to be pro rata. There is no way of rating other than to have a pro rata system.</p>
	<p>The water reform proposals currently under debate in the Province have not won either a consensus of political support, or support from consumer organisations or representative bodies. We are not time-limited. We need more debate, more information and more clarity, so that we can consider all the issues and try to come to an agreement as to the way forward. The matter was not agreed when the Executive were operational at Stormont; no progress was made then. I believe that it is sometimes right in politics not to rush ahead and make radical changes that will be regretted in years to come. We are limited by the EU directive to the year 2010. Let us have a longer and broader debate. There are options.</p>
	<p>The Government's current proposals will not provide a secure financial basis for future funding without imposing additional increases on consumers, and subsequently increasing the numbers of those who cannot afford to pay. The water reform programme mistakenly places costs only on consumers. It ignores the &quot;polluter pays&quot; principle, as well as the Government's social responsibility to provide adequate protection to those who are vulnerable, as they have done in the recent rating review relief proposals. The Government must go back to the drawing board and look again fundamentally at their proposals.</p>

	<p>I appreciate the opportunity to speak, and I am sorry that I was not here for the beginning of the debate but my flight from Belfast was delayed. I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Belfast, East (Mr. Robinson) on securing the debate on an issue that is very important to the Democratic Unionist party and, I know, to my constituents. As I have been going around in recent months talking to people, I have no doubt that there is widespread concern within the community about the introduction of water charges in Northern Ireland. We have debated the origins of that, but let me be absolutely clear in echoing what my hon. Friend said&mdash;that the DUP has consistently opposed the introduction of water charges in Northern Ireland. At no stage have we given our support to such a proposition, and we have very real concerns about the Government's proposals and the manner in which the Minister intends to implement the water charging system.</p>
	<p>I was interested in what the hon. Member for South Antrim (David Burnside) said about the introduction of pro rata charging. When he was pressed by the Minister, he said that it would be based primarily on cost. I would point out to the hon. Gentleman that 80 per cent. of the cost is on infrastructure, and only 20 per cent. of the cost is on actual usage. We should be careful about going down that particular route, because we would end up with most of the water charge being a fixed-rate charge based on infrastructure and a very minimal percentage of the charge based on householders' actual usage.</p>
	<p>As I talk to people about water charges, a number of concerns arise. I talk to pensioners living on their own, for example, who are very concerned about how they will be able to afford the additional levy. The Department has shown a degree of subterfuge in suggesting that it is time that Northern Ireland started paying for its water, like the rest of the United Kingdom. However, the reality is that we in the Province pay for our water through both the domestic and regional rate system. It is not correct to suggest that Northern Ireland does not pay for its water: we pay for actual usage by a distinct charge measured within the rates, and for the infrastructure through the regional rating system. Will there be a compensatory offset against the regional rate for the element that we already contribute for our water system in the Province if the Government proceed with the water charge against the will of the people of Northern Ireland and the wishes of Northern Ireland's political parties?</p>
	<p>I accept that there is a need to invest in the water distribution system; there is no doubt that, over the years, the system has been neglected. A figure that is often quoted is that some 40 per cent. of the water supply leaks out of the system. Something should be done about that, and there will be a cost for it. However, I and the DUP are far from convinced that the Government's proposals in the form of water charging are the best, most effective or efficient way of charging.</p>
	<p>Returning to the issue of householders, I mentioned pensioners living on their own. They are concerned that they will have to pay a water charge that will be equivalent, for example, to that paid by a family of three or four people living next door. There is a degree of unfairness about the Government's approach to water charging. Unless there is some means of measuring usage, it is very difficult to assess what individuals and households will actually use, and what a fair distribution of the cost will be. That is why water charges are not the best means of addressing the problem, if the problem is the need to invest in infrastructure, because it creates inequalities and a situation in which people feel that they are being treated unfairly.</p>

	<p>The hon. Gentleman rightly puts forward his party's opposition to the charges. Is his party also engaged in the consultation that is currently taking place to try to learn from the experience of the UK, where we have seen increases in water charges and the whole question of affordability has arisen? Is he engaged in that consultation with the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, Ofwat, Water Voice and Water UK to try to deal with the question of affordability? There is a window of time in which Northern Ireland can learn from the experience of the UK, where water affordability has become a serious problem.</p>

	<p>I thank the hon. Gentleman for his intervention. Unfortunately the Department in Northern Ireland is just pressing ahead; it is keen to impose the water charge on Northern Ireland as quickly as possible. There has been some consultation, but I do not believe that we have taken adequate time to learn from the experience of the rest of the UK. I believe that we could learn from that experience.</p>
	<p>Recently, Mr. Deputy Speaker, I had the opportunity under your chairmanship to raise an issue about education in an Adjournment debate. I made the point then that we could learn from the experience of England and Wales in terms of our education system. I believe that we could also learn from the experience of England and Wales in terms of the imposition of water charges.</p>
	<p>There is another good reason for delay. I believe that the issue is too important to be dealt with under direct rule, and that it should be put on hold until such time as the Assembly is reinstated. I hope that that will happen quickly, with a voluntary coalition comprising those democratic parties that are committed to peaceful means, and that that coalition can then address this issue, in a way that is more reflective of what people in Northern Ireland want and that is in the best interests of Northern Ireland. I urge the Minister to hold back rather than push the measure through and impose it on Northern Ireland against the wishes of the people. We should look at other examples, and at best practice, and we should examine situations where those measures have not worked and the costs have increased for the consumer.</p>

	<p>For many years, the Department has been looking at examples, such as Glas Cymru. In fact, during my time in office, we brought over the Scottish regulator. I am sure that the current Minister has continued with those contacts, all of which showed that significant savings could be made within the system in Northern Ireland. Is that not what should be done? The costs should be reduced by efficiencies rather than the Government forcing up the cost of local taxes in Northern Ireland.</p>

	<p>I thank my hon. Friend for his intervention. He will be aware that during the negotiations before Christmas we proposed the establishment of an efficiency commission in Northern Ireland that would look at public expenditure across the whole ambit of public services in the Province, identify where savings could be made, and then apply those savings in terms of infrastructure improvements. That is why I believe that the Government are putting the cart before the horse; they are spending the money before we have saved the money and, instead of looking for efficiencies, they are imposing another tax on ratepayers in Northern Ireland that people feel is unfair and unjust.</p>

	<p>The reason why I made my earlier point is that Water Voice and the other representative consumer organisations in the UK are not arguing against water charges per se, although there are questions about the rapid rises that have occurred, but for joined-up thinking to be rapidly developed between the Government and consumer organisations to address the question of affordability. Water UK makes the point that although we rightly focus on affordability:</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;Socioeconomic groups who can afford their water bills feature significantly in the companies debtor file. In addition a high proportion of debtors have moved in the last 4 years . . . Evidence suggests more people&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p>who can afford it&mdash;</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;are now de-prioritising water debt in preference to satellite TV and mobile phones.&quot;</p>
	<p>It is right that we focus on those who cannot afford to pay, but it is also right that we chase those who choose to escape payment. Does the hon. Gentleman agree?</p>

	<p>I thank the hon. Gentleman for that information. He will appreciate that we in Northern Ireland are coming at things from a different perspective. If we had 10 or 20 years' experience of water charges, we would be considering how to improve the system. Perhaps if the hon. Gentleman were in our position of not having water charges, he might look at the matter from our perspective, from which we are asking, &quot;Do we need these water charges? Is there not a more effective and efficient way to raise the funding required for infrastructure improvements, without creating a new tax and putting an extra burden on the ratepayer?&quot;</p>
	<p>The hon. Gentleman is right. I believe that the situation will lead to further debt, which is a huge problem in Northern Ireland, as it is in the rest of the United Kingdom. Do we really want people's tax burden and debt to increase yet again&mdash;particularly in respect of those on low incomes, the elderly, pensioners, and so on? Will the Government increase the old-age pension to take account of the increased water charge? I doubt it.</p>

	<p>On the issue of affordability and those who are least able to pay, will my hon. Friend comment on the fact that a disproportionate number of people on low incomes are in social housing? Those people find that a significant amount of their rent and rates&mdash;usually all of it&mdash;is paid through housing benefit. However, under the proposed water charge they will still have to pay 75 per cent., unlike the other charge. More people in the lower income bracket will be in debt as a result of the implementation of the water charge.</p>

	<p>I thank my hon. Friend for his helpful intervention.</p>
	<p>We are a party of low taxation. We do not believe that taxation is the best means, on every occasion, of raising money for investment in infrastructure. I urge the Minister to think again about the proposal, because there is not widespread support for it in Northern Ireland. The Minister, who wears another hat and has responsibility for political development, has always upheld the principle that if we are to have something in Northern Ireland&mdash;whether in the political realm, or otherwise&mdash;there should be widespread community support for it. However, this Government continually impose on Northern Ireland policy initiatives, commissions and all kinds of things that are not representative of the community, do not reflect its views and are against people's wishes.</p>
	<p>I urge the Minister to hold back, put the proposal on hold, allow the Assembly to consider the matter at greater length when it is reinstated, consider other areas where the water issue has been addressed, and see if greater efficiencies can be made in Government, leading to savings that could be invested in our infrastructure, including the water distribution network. It is wrong to proceed in this manner. I have no doubt that this issue will be prominent in Northern Ireland as we face a general election. The DUP's position is clear. We oppose the water charges and believe that the Minister should think again.</p>

	<p>It is a pleasure to follow my hon. Friend the Member for Lagan Valley (Mr. Donaldson). I endorse heartily what he said.</p>
	<p>I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Belfast, East (Mr. Robinson) on securing this debate on an important topic, which is the subject of considerable debate, anxiety and concern among many of our constituents. They face the prospect of higher regional and district rate bills and now the imposition of water charges, which will combine to bring about a massive increase in household taxation in the coming years. It is right that we should press the Minister again on these matters and raise the concerns of our constituents.</p>
	<p>My hon. Friend the Member for Lagan Valley made a general point about the Government's approach to such major issues in Northern Ireland. I am struck by the fact that time and again, when I meet direct-rule Ministers and take delegations to meet them, I am told that it is difficult to move things forward or take decisions about specific matters because they are awaiting the restoration of devolved institutions and the Assembly and because it is right and proper that elected representatives in Northern Ireland should take such decisions. In general, that is a rational and sensible approach, but on certain policy areas it completely goes out of the window. Instead of saying that it is right and proper for locally elected politicians to take some decisions, they impose decisions against the wishes of not just the majority of politicians, but politicians and elected representatives right across the community. We can cite several examples of that.</p>
	<p>Recently, a higher education order was rejected on a cross-party basis&mdash;all parties except Sinn Fein voted against it. It was defeated in the Northern Ireland Grand Committee, yet the Government continue to proceed with it.</p>
	<p>Another example is the matter before us today: there is large-scale, cross-party and cross-community opposition to, and concern about, the Government's proposed imposition of water charges. However, they are proceeding by setting aside that opposition and imposing the new regime. I entirely concur with my hon. Friend the Member for Lagan Valley that the headlong rush to introduce such charges should stop and that time should be taken to consider some of the proposals and ideas that have been put forward today by hon. Members, not least my hon. Friend the Member for Belfast, East. In his detailed and excellent speech, he outlined several options available to the Government.</p>
	<p>The General Consumer Council for Northern Ireland indicated in its submissions that it is right to take time to consider the matter. I urge the Minister to give a degree of hope to the hard-pressed ratepayers and householders of Northern Ireland that he will take time to study the matter further, rather than proceeding by ignoring the collective voice of Northern Ireland Members.</p>

	<p>Will the hon. Gentleman reflect on one aspect of the situation that is especially important in North Down, where there are a number of farmers? He referred to the General Consumer Council's submission to the Department for Regional Development on water metering, so he will know that the council highlighted the significant and damaging effect that water charging will have on rural communities, and especially farmers. They already have a low income and have been hard-pressed for many years. Does he agree with the Ulster Unionist party that farmers would be hit especially hard by water charging?</p>

	<p>Since most of those hard-pressed farmers are supporters of the Democratic Unionist party, I am more than delighted to hear that the hon. Lady agrees with us on the matter&mdash;on that basis, we can certainly agree to agree.</p>
	<p>Reference has been made to a number of sectors of the population that will be more hard-hit than others, but generally what struck me about the GCC report was the fact that there will be swingeing increases across the board in Northern Ireland when one takes into account not only the impact of higher water charges, but the increases in the regional rate and the fact that district rates will have to go up by a considerable amount to take account of the greater costs of waste management. Some of the figures given in the report indicate that by 2008&ndash;09, not taking into account the increase in district rates, the rates bill of a terraced house in the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Belfast, East could have increased by 88 per cent.. In south Belfast, rates for a semi-detached house could go up by 77 per cent. In Hollywood and Strabane, rates for terraced houses could go up by 263 per cent. and 127 per cent. respectively.</p>
	<p>It would be unacceptable to impose such increases on the people of Northern Ireland. I cannot believe that any hon. Member from any part of the United Kingdom would accept for one moment that their constituents should have to face that triple whammy: increases in the regional rate due to the review that is taking place; increases in the district rates due to increased charges for waste management; and the imposition of water charges.</p>
	<p>All that amounts to a looming financial crisis for many households in Northern Ireland, particularly if the valid point made by my hon. Friend the Member for East Londonderry (Mr. Campbell) is taken into account. He said that the most vulnerable households&mdash;those in the poorest category&mdash;will still have to pay 75 per cent. of the water charges under the Minister's proposals. Under current procedures and regulations, a large proportion of their rents and rates is taken care of, so such people do not face large bills for them. However, people in the poorest category will have to pay 75 per cent. of the water charges under the proposals, which will cause untold difficulties and hardship for many of them.</p>
	<p>Fuel poverty is a major problem in Northern Ireland. As the Minister has responsibility for social development, he is trying to address the problem, although I and many others believe that he should go a bit further and put more resources into it. It is incredible that although many people in Northern Ireland&mdash;far too large a proportion of our population&mdash;are in fuel poverty, if the Minister has his way, the Government will deliberately impose a regime that will result in many people being put into water poverty. That simply cannot be allowed to stand.</p>
	<p>In conclusion, I urge the Minister to delay, take stock of what has been said and come forward with proposals that will not lead to swingeing increases in domestic household bills that people will simply not be able to pay.</p>

	<p>I certainly shall, Mr. Deputy Speaker.</p>
	<p>I congratulate the hon. Member for Belfast, East (Mr. Robinson) on securing this debate and support the contributions made by the hon. Members for South Antrim (David Burnside), for Lagan Valley (Mr. Donaldson) and for Belfast, North (Mr. Dodds).</p>
	<p>It is ironic that the Government spend so much time seeking consensus in Northern Ireland and then ignore it when they find it. It is disgraceful, for example, that tuition fees are being imposed despite the unanimous opposition from Opposition parties and all right hon. and hon. Members from Northern Ireland. The fact that the Government lost the vote on that issue in the Northern Ireland Grand Committee but carried on forcing tuition fees on the Province, makes people feel that the Government are more interested in imposing their political dogma than in listening to the democratic wishes of politicians and the public in Northern Ireland.</p>
	<p>It seems that we are faced with exactly the same problem when it comes to water charging. Water privatisation in Northern Ireland is proving as iniquitous as the poll tax. As the Northern Ireland Assembly is suspended, Ministers in Westminster seem intent on introducing additional charges for water and sewerage services. As we have already heard, ratepayers in Northern Ireland already pay for water and sewerage services through their rates. The new charges would come on top of the payments made through the regional rate.</p>
	<p>For all the reasons already outlined, it is obviously grossly unfair to expect the people of Northern Ireland to pay twice for the same services. They are being asked to pay for the decades of under-investment in the infrastructure under direct rule. Ratepayers are not responsible for the diversion of funds and the under-investment in infrastructure for 30 years.</p>

	<p>There is consensus on the Opposition Benches&mdash;it is in opposing any charges on any one of their constituents, and I might do the same in Opposition.

	<p>While investment in water and sewerage services is crucial, the people in Northern Ireland are not responsible for the under-investment. The Government's consultation has been a charade&mdash;a farce&mdash;that had a predetermined outcome. I do not accept the hon. Gentleman's position, because nobody in Northern Ireland is happy with what one could call the tap tax. It is unfair and will lead to some of the most vulnerable in society being unable to afford a basic human necessity. In direct response to him, I would say that the Government have tried to make a false comparison between what households in Northern Ireland pay and what those in Great Britain pay.</p>
	<p>The Government tell people that the average English household pays a certain amount for its water, but they do not tell people that that is for privatised water and that the Government spent millions of pounds of taxpayers' funds to upgrade the system before selling it off. They ignore several facts. Household income in Northern Ireland is 19 per cent. below the UK average, nearly twice as many households there rely on benefit than in the rest of the UK&mdash;21 per cent. of households, compared with 12 per cent. of them&mdash;and Northern Ireland households also pay 26 per cent. more for fuel, light and power than the rest of the UK.</p>
	<p>There need to be built-in safeguards to protect people whose water consumption is necessarily high. Under the Water Act 2003, the Secretary of State has a duty to protect the consumer interest and specifically to have regard to disabled people, the chronically sick, the elderly, the poor and those residing in rural areas.</p>
	<p>I accept the need for improved water and sewerage services, but the ratepayers of Northern Ireland are not to blame for historic under-investment. Home owners have paid their rates. It would be a cruel injustice if they were expected to pay twice&mdash;first through their regional rate contribution and secondly through new charges&mdash;for those essential services. The present proposals are completely unfair, and the Liberal Democrats will resist any attempt by the Government to introduce them.</p>

	<p>I congratulate the hon. Member for Belfast, East (Mr. Robinson) on securing this debate. I agree very much with what he said about this matter being an illustration of the democratic deficit in Northern Ireland. As he pointed out, it would be to everyone's advantage if people directly elected by voters in Northern Ireland were in a position to take responsibility for the complex and difficult decisions that must be made about the future of the water industry in the Province.</p>
	<p>It seems as if there is unanimity in the Chamber about at least one point: there will have to be a great deal more capital expenditure on water provision in Northern Ireland. There are three drivers to that. The first is the decrepit nature of much of the current water network. The second is the forecast increase in demand as people become more prosperous, as lifestyles change and more water is consumed, and as we have a greater number of households in Northern Ireland for a largely static population. The third is the directives coming from the European Union that will force Northern Ireland, along with the rest of the United Kingdom, to improve the environmental quality of water discharges and the treatment of water through the sewerage system. The money must be found from somewhere.</p>
	<p>My questions to the Minister will follow up some of the points made by the hon. Gentleman about the nature of the reform proposed by the Government and the likely impact that it will have on particular parts of Northern Ireland society. Will the Minister comment on the Government's time scale? They have always said that they will start to introduce water charges from 2006. That is surely dependent on their having available a robust database of property values derived from the revaluation that has been going on. There have been various reports in the Northern Ireland media that the Government may be contemplating deferring the introduction of water charges. It would be helpful if the Minister would say whether that is the case.</p>
	<p>The hon. Gentleman put to the Minister an alternative model for funding the water service: in effect, a hypothecated taxation system. When I looked at page 21 of the Government's assessment of the proposals, it seemed to me that that option was ruled out primarily because they believed that it would lead to increased costs to customers, but that that conclusion depended on the existing budgetary rules from the Treasury remaining in place. We have seen in recent weeks that Treasury rules can suddenly become very flexible over the classification of road maintenance when that suits the Government's convenience, so I ask the Minister to spell out in more detail why the Government have rejected the alternative option.</p>
	<p>I go along with the hon. Gentleman and other Northern Ireland Members in saying that the more savings that one can find from the Water Service and elsewhere in Government to offset the costs of capital investment, the better. Some significant savings in the Water Service are built into the Government's plans, but could there be more? Similarly, as they are talking about a developers' charge through the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister and the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, are they contemplating that proposal for Northern Ireland too?</p>
	<p>On the level of charges, have the Government thought enough about certain groups? I am thinking of pensioners who are above the housing benefit level but on fixed incomes, and of large industrial users of water, such as the textile industry and food processors. They will be very vulnerable to foreign competition as a result of any increase in their costs. For them, the competitiveness test in the Government's assessment seems to be a bit of a joke, because it expressly rules out of the definition of competitiveness in any assessment of the impact of new charges on their competition with external competitors; it considers only whether there will be an effect on new entrants to the existing domestic market. In addition, what is the position of hospitals? The Government's assessment states that hospitals can expect significant increases in their bills, but I have seen no quantified estimate published anywhere. I hope that one will be published soon.</p>
	<p>I shall make two brief points in conclusion. First, how will charges be enforced against non-payers? There is an increasing problem of bad debt in Great Britain. I can think of some parts of Northern Ireland where enforcement will be difficult. How does the Minister propose to deal with that? Secondly, why is he not using either Ofwat or the Scottish regulator in his consideration of the regulation of Northern Ireland's water system, as it seems, on the basis of the Government's documentation, that it is only the matter of legislative time that stands in the way of applying that existing store of expertise to the Province?</p>

	<p>The hon. Member for Aylesbury (Mr. Lidington) raised a number of detailed points with which I shall try to deal, but I may have to reply to some in correspondence. I welcome the opportunity to respond to this Adjournment debate and I congratulate the hon. Member for Belfast, East (Mr. Robinson) on securing it.</p>
	<p>When devolution was suspended in October 2002, we made clear our determination to bring about an early return of devolved government to Northern Ireland. However, that has not, as yet, been possible. One of the most difficult issues that we inherited from the Executive was the need to find a better way to finance water and sewerage services&mdash;that is one thing on which I think everyone can agree. An incoming Assembly and Executive would be in a position to change their minds, but not the arithmetic, as I hope to show during my response.</p>
	<p>This year, water and sewerage services in Northern Ireland are costing more than &pound;380 million&mdash;more than &pound;1 million every day. I have not put much weight in my arguments over the last couple of years on the framework directive but, across Europe, higher standards are being introduced to improve the quality of the water that we drink and to reduce pollution in our rivers, on our beaches and in the sea. That imposes costs on the system while, at the same time, increasing demands are being placed on services in Northern Ireland. The modern lifestyle, as has already been mentioned, requires greater use of water. In addition, the welcome increase in demand for housing in Northern Ireland means that we have to cater for about an extra 200,000 homes that are expected to be built in Northern Ireland over the next 20 years.</p>
	<p>All of that is costly. In 2003, it was estimated that the water and sewerage infrastructure would need &pound;3 billion of investment over the 20 years until 2023. Some of that investment is already taking place. The spending proposals contained in the budget published by the Secretary of State in December 2004 allocated &pound;735 million for investment in the water and sewerage infrastructure between 2005&ndash;06 and 2007&ndash;08. That will mean that about &pound;1.1 billion will have been invested in the infrastructure in the five-year period up to 2007&ndash;08, and that more than a third of the &pound;3 billion investment that I identified will have been provided before domestic consumers are asked to pay the full water charge.</p>
	<p>It is worth re-emphasising the need to sustain investment. Water and sewerage services need sustained and reliable investment over long periods, which is difficult to achieve while the Water Service is within central Government and subject to the normal three-year financial planning periods. It has been accurately shown elsewhere in the UK that the water industry needs long-term planning and reliable revenue streams if it is to be efficient and effective.</p>
	<p>The problem in Northern Ireland has been that the Water Service has had to compete for public funds with health, education and transport, unlike the position in England, Scotland and Wales. That may explain why there has been a legacy of under-investment in water and sewerage infrastructure, as several hon. Members have noted. Let me address the suggestion that that legacy should be financed by the central Exchequer. It is true that there has been under-investment in infrastructure, but that has been a feature of all regions in England and Wales, and not only in the water industry. We have all been living off the Victorian legacy.</p>
	<p>It has also been mentioned that when English water companies were privatised in 1989&ndash;90 they received what was known as the green dowry. That was off-set in large part by the proceeds of privatisation&mdash;some &pound;6 billion&mdash;which provided a benefit to all UK taxpayers. The Northern Ireland Water Service was not privatised, so the green dowry arrangements did not apply. However, Northern Ireland's spending power was increased by some &pound;50 million a year to compensate for the fact that privatisation meant that water and sewerage services would, from that time on, be outside the scope of the Barnett regime.</p>
	<p>It is also true to say that although there may have been under-investment in the water and sewerage infrastructure throughout the 1990s and up to the present date, Northern Ireland's share of public expenditure has been higher per person than in England, Scotland and Wales.</p>

	<p>I find it curious that the Minister is defending the policies enacted during the privatisation of water, whereas I clearly remember the Labour party being fiercely opposed to those privatisation plans in exactly the same way expressed by Members representing Northern Ireland today.

	<p>I am in no way defending the situation; I am describing it and the position that we are in now. Hon. Members need to say why they believe that UK taxpayers should pay for Northern Ireland's under-investment, when the UK taxpayer did not pay for the legacy of under-investment in England and Wales. I almost detected the implication from the hon. Gentleman that he thought that the voters of Montgomeryshire should pay for that under-investment, or perhaps the voters of Scotland or England. I am not sure that that would be acceptable.</p>
	<p>That dilemma was recognised, if not by the hon. Gentleman, certainly by the Northern Ireland Executive before suspension in 2002. They reached the conclusion that there was no realistic prospect of the Treasury providing additional expenditure on the necessary scale. Indeed, it is worth quoting exactly what the Executive said in their rating policy review document, published in May 2002. They concluded that there was</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;no realistic prospect that this funding requirement will be met from the Executive's routine public expenditure budget, because that would imply unacceptable constraints on the funding of other public services such as health, education and transport&quot;.</p>
	<p>They went on to say that it was not</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;realistic to expect the Treasury to provide additional expenditure on this scale, as that would in effect mean that this large bill would be falling on UK taxpayers in a context where households&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p>in Northern Ireland&mdash;</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;are contributing much less than those in similar circumstances in England, Scotland and Wales.&quot;</p>
	<p>That was a recognition of the reality, so I give full marks to those who try to change that reality, but we cannot do so, and it has not changed.</p>
	<p>As an incentive to introduce self-financing arrangements, the Treasury offered to treat the non-cash costs of water services as fully additional to Northern Ireland's normal allocation of money for public services, thereby removing the responsibility for funding those costs from the Northern Ireland departmental expenditure limit, managed by the Executive. The Executive considered that before suspension, and it is worth noting that the draft budget for 2003&ndash;04 to 2005&ndash;06 that they presented to the Assembly in September 2002 did not make provision for the non-cash costs that would have been necessary had the Executive rejected the Treasury's offer. So, although it is true that the Executive had not made a firm commitment to introducing water charges, that was one of a number of signals that clearly showed the general direction in which they were heading.</p>
	<p>We have to give careful consideration to how we might best develop and maintain the water and sewerage services that Northern Ireland needs for the 21st century. Having examined the limited alternatives, we are satisfied that the Executive were on the right course, and that water and sewerage services should become self-financing.</p>
	<p>I am mindful of the time, so I shall move on quickly to the second issue: where should those costs fall? One question is in which area. In line with practice both in Scotland and in England and Wales&mdash;although there are variations between the two&mdash;we have taken the value of property to be the best indicator. That will mean that those who live where property is more valuable will end up paying more; that is the essence of any rateable system.</p>
	<p>Metering is important, too, because that also determines where costs fall. About 80 per cent. of the cost of delivering water to households is fixed, irrespective of how much water is delivered. Only 20 per cent. is variable, depending on the amount delivered. That is particularly the case in Northern Ireland because it does not have the situation that prevails in, say, parts of eastern England, where additional reservoirs and new facilities may need to be provided. If we have a pro rata reduction, as is suggested by the hon. Member for South Antrim (David Burnside), those in better-off households will effectively receive a subsidy from those in poorer households. However we cut the amount of money, we come to the point when someone has to pay, and it is really a case of where the costs fall.</p>
	<p>On the question asked about rateable value, we are clear that we will have in place the mechanism for sending out bills and collecting money by October 2006. The rateable values are due to be published. We will be working from the common database, so no one in the Northern Ireland Water Service will be in the firing line on appeals and so on. Those values will be published in April 2006. We will also have to get the necessary enabling legislation through, in order to ensure that the Government company and new framework are in place. We believe that we can do that in the timetable that I set out.</p>
	<p>We believe that we have taken the right decision. We are following the principles enunciated by the previous Assembly and Executive, and we believe that what we are doing is necessary for delivering a proper water service for Northern Ireland.</p>

	<p>I am grateful to have the opportunity to raise this subject with the Minister, although I am slightly disappointed that the Under-Secretary of State for Health, the hon. Member for South Thanet (Dr. Ladyman), who I was told would respond and who made pronouncements in the press on the subject over the weekend, is not here to answer questions. However, I am sure that the Minister is a more than adequate substitute.</p>
	<p>The request has been made simply because of the widespread consternation about the recent revised guidance from the National Institute for Clinical Excellence on the treatment of Alzheimer's. I raise that subject because I have been bombarded with letters from constituents and local health professionals. Some 52,000 people in the UK who currently benefit from these drugs are extremely concerned about the future availability of their treatments. Indeed, there is a lobby of Parliament today on the subject.</p>

	<p>I am sorry but I only have time for one intervention and that has been agreed beforehand.</p>
	<p>The reaction that I have received so far is that the decision by NICE smacks of ageism and that the mechanism for calculating cost-effectiveness is deeply flawed. As with most things, it is useful to take events in a logical sequence, so I want to start by reminding the Minister of the guidance produced by NICE in 2001. Technology appraisal guidance number 19 dealt with the use of donepezil, rivastigmine and galantamine for the treatment of Alzheimer's. At that stage, Nice said:</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;The three drugs . . . should be made available in the NHS as one component of the management of those people with mild and moderate Alzheimer's disease . . . as long as the patients conformed to certain criteria.&quot;</p>
	<p>Other conditions were laid down at the time and they included assessment and diagnosis in specialist clinics. Only specialists could initiate treatment, the carer's view of the condition should be sought, patients should be reassessed two to four months after reaching the maintenance dose of the drug and the drug should generally be continued only if there had been some improvement. Guidelines also covered when the drug should be discontinued.</p>
	<p>No one appeared to have any quarrel with that. It seemed that NICE came up with a system that should ensure that those in need received the drugs, which were not prescribed unnecessarily if there was no proven benefit. NICE deemed that the drugs were effective but acknowledged that they did not work for everyone. When it came to cost-effectiveness, NICE acknowledged in 2001 that some of the methodologies were subject to uncertainty and acknowledged that the estimates of the cost per QALY&mdash;quality-adjusted life year, which is impenetrable to most people&mdash;covered a wide range of values. This is an important point and I will return to the thorny subject of QALYs later. NICE also acknowledged in 2001 that</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;cost savings on later institutionalisation are not well established, and quality of life is not easily measured.&quot;</p>
	<p>Since then, more studies have taken place and the use of these drugs has been recently reviewed. Contrary to all expectations, the preliminary guidance now says:</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;Donepezil, rivastigmine and galantamine are not recommended for use in the treatment of mild to moderate AD.&quot;</p>
	<p>I believe that this is probably the first time that NICE has reversed a decision in such a dramatic way. It goes on to say that people currently on the drugs should be able to continue until it is considered appropriate to stop but it appears to have effectively halted the use of the drug in new patients.</p>
	<p>I have been bombarded with letters saying that these drugs could be withdrawn as early as July. We all know that once there is a diminishing number of patients on a drug, there comes a point when the drug company will find that it is not cost-effective to carry on manufacturing it. It is not immediately clear on reading the reports why things are so different now because, in parts of the report, NICE appears to be saying that the drugs are effective. Nor is it clear why the cost per QALY is now more important and the reasoning behind the costs is opaque.</p>
	<p>I should like to remind the Minister of the Select Committee on Health's 2001&ndash;02 report on NICE. One of its recommendations was that there should be greater clarity over criteria for evaluating clinical and cost-effectiveness. It recommended that</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;NICE should consider the wider societal costs and advantages of particular treatments and in particular the wider costs and benefits to the public purse of reduced benefit dependency and improved ability to work both for patients and their carers&quot;.</p>
	<p>The Government said that they agreed with the recommendation and that the Treasury would</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;be issuing new guidance on economic appraisal which will broadly meet the Committee's point&quot;</p>
	<p>and would be discussed with NICE. Our current argument about NICE suggests that that guidance might not have been issued, although I suspect that it was issued, but in a form that does not deal with the situation that we are faced with today.</p>

	<p>I am sure that, like me, my hon. Friend has received representations asking, &quot;What kind of society are we if we are not prepared to spend &pound;2.50 a day to give people with dementia and their carers a better quality of life?&quot; Does my hon. Friend agree that that qualitative aspect, and the preventative aspect with regard to delaying more expensive care, must be brought into the equation?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-03-16.94.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/912" speakername="Sandra Gidley" colnum="94"  time="10:59:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/cm050316/halltext/50316h02.htm#50316h02_spnew4">
	<p>My hon. Friend raises a good point, which was reflected in the press coverage over the weekend, when the Under-Secretary of State for Health, the hon. Member for South Thanet, seemed to cast some doubt on the criteria used. I will return to that.</p>
	<p>The cost issue becomes even more confusing. The estimates of the costs per QALY range from &pound;2,000 to &pound;139,000, depending on the length of treatment and which set of assumptions are made. For reasons that are far from clear, it also appears that more weight has been attached to some studies than others. For example, much weight appears to be attached to the AD2000 study. The logic behind that seems to be that that study must be more reliable than some others because it was not funded by a drug company. That is not a sensible conclusion. Some drug company trials are excellent and others are not so good, and that is also the case for more independent trials. Therefore, it is the science that must be looked at, rather than who sponsors it.</p>
	<p>I am concerned about this, because experts in the sector have questioned the methodology of the AD2000 trial, to which a lot of weight is given. I have been sent a copy of a submission to NICE from Dr. David Wilkinson, who is a consultant in old age psychiatry at Moorgreen hospital in Southampton. He was one of the clinical physicians on the inquiry panel. He raises a number of problems with the study. He states that the criteria were flawed because anybody who would benefit from the drug donepezil was automatically excluded from the trial and had to be treated elsewhere. Also, the recruitment was insufficient to provide detailed results; 3,000 people were supposed to be used, but only 565 were recruited, and only 20 remained at the end of the third year. He questions the implementation, too, because he says that he knows from direct experience that the measures were not carried out to ICH GCP&mdash;International Conference for Harmonisation good clinical practice&mdash;standards. He concludes by stating:</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;It was therefore a series of one-year studies with an ever-diminishing number of highly atypical patients infrequently tested by unskilled raters with consequently a great deal of missing data which by their own admission was just made up for the final analysis.&quot;</p>
	<p>That is quite damning. I am happy to send a copy of the submission to the Minister, so he can read it in more detail.</p>
	<p>Dr. Wilkinson also says:</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;Despite claims that no long term data were available the data from two robust one year placebo controlled studies showing significant benefit in cognition and function were rejected in favour of shorter term studies.&quot;</p>
	<p>He also claims that assumptions were based on improvements gained in six-month trials and extrapolated, but with no reference to those who were discontinued from treatment.</p>
	<p>It is interesting that Professor James Rafferty, the chair of the appraisal committee of the AD2000 study, was one of the authors of the study. He is hardly likely to criticise his own work. That raises questions about the impartiality of NICE with regard to this particular investigation.</p>
	<p>The reaction to the NICE preliminary guidance has been remarkable in its unanimity.</p>

	<p>I did not want to intervene, but may I ask a question? Is the hon. Lady alleging some impropriety on the part of NICE in the way it has conducted the appraisal? That was the gist of her last comment.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-03-16.95.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/912" speakername="Sandra Gidley" colnum="95"  time="10:59:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/cm050316/halltext/50316h02.htm#50316h02_spnew5">
	<p>My point is that, in the review, NICE should have taken into account the fact that one of the key authors of the study on which it placed so much weight was chairing the committee. There is a case for somebody else chairing the review, and I would be grateful if the Minister considered the points that I am making. I will send him a more detailed breakdown of my argument, which I do not have time to go through today. However, I was concerned when I read the comments. I believe that NICE is generally a good thing and feel worried if anything questions its impartiality or objectivity.</p>
	<p>The reactions to the guidance have been almost unanimous. The Alzheimer's Society refers to it as &quot;alarming reading&quot; and makes the point that it is worth spending &pound;2.50 a day on drug treatments for dementia. It also claims:</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;The models that NICE use do not allow a monetary value to be put on the things that mean the most to people receiving drug treatments, so they simply ignore them . . . Conventional pharmacoeconomics cannot be applied to drug therapies for dementia. QALYs inherently discriminate against older people and thus raise particular problems for calculating the costs of dementia.&quot;</p>
	<p>One reason for the discrimination is that the calculation of QALYs usually takes earnings into account, and because the drugs are most frequently prescribed for older people who are not earning, the figures are highly skewed. We definitely need a different model when we consider the position of older people.</p>
	<p>Help the Aged is</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;concerned that NICE have not taken into account the substantial gains in quality of life resulting from effective treatment with these drugs&quot;.</p>
	<p>The Royal College of Psychiatrists</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;strongly disagrees with the assumptions and methodology of the health economic analysis that led NICE to these conclusions&quot;.</p>
	<p>The college repeats some of the points already raised. It says that the economic modelling used by NICE is unrealistic and not based on the use of drugs in clinical practice, and that alternative treatments, such as anti-psychotics, will actively do harm. One feature of dementia and Alzheimer's, if untreated, is often an increase in aggressive behaviour, so we will end up using drugs that are regarded by most people as a last resort and that have been described as a chemical cosh.</p>
	<p>Three physicians from the Memory and Assessment Research Centre have written to me pointing out the possible long-term impact of withdrawing the drugs. They point out that the only proven treatment option will be lost and that there will be a two-tier health provision for Alzheimer's, because some patients will demand private prescriptions, meaning that only those with the ability to pay will benefit from them. There is a perception that AD patients are simply being abandoned by the NHS. More alarming, many think that memory clinics will close and services for people with AD will be decimated because managers will take the easy decision to close facilities as there will be no treatment options. NICE and the Government will be guilty of ageism and will lose international credibility, and an even larger burden will be placed on our already overstretched care services.</p>
	<p>I will admit that I was delighted to see the press coverage over the weekend&mdash;&quot;U-turn over Alzheimer's&quot;, for example. The Under-Secretary of State for Health, the hon. Member for South Thanet, is alleged to have said:</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;I can understand why the public are so worried. If you have someone in your family with dementia and you have drugs which do work then you are going to find this decision baffling. I want NICE to look at the methodology they have used, which a number of experts have called into question. It may be that once they have looked at extra evidence they will come to a different decision.&quot;</p>
	<p>A statement from the Department of Health seemed to confirm that, although it was in stark contrast to the defiant stance adopted by the Secretary of State for Health last week.</p>
	<p><i>The Observer</i> said:</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;Dr Stephen Ladyman made clear that he will ensure the proposals are overturned.&quot;</p>
	<p>Much as I want to see the proposals overturned, the statement rang alarm bells, because I always understood that NICE was an arm's-length body and was immune from ministerial interference. Today's debate is a useful opportunity for me to seek clarification from the Minister about what form the intervention will take. The press release said that the submission was to be published on the NICE website. I looked hard at that last night and could not find where submissions were published. Will the right hon. Gentleman commit himself to publishing the submission on the Department of Health website, so that everyone can access it?</p>
	<p>The Under-Secretary of State was also quoted as wanting NICE to examine the methodology that it used. It would be helpful if the Minister could inform the Chamber what advice has already been given or what advice is planned to be given about the methodology that should be used instead. If NICE adheres to the recommendation, as is its right, will he confirm that individual consultants should still be able to prescribe the drugs if they wish to, or will he devise alternative means of making drugs such as Beta Interferon available?</p>
	<p>I end my speech by referring to a letter from a specialist community nurse who works at a local memory clinic:</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;My work involves me exclusively in the initiation of these treatments and their follow up monitoring and review. I see first hand the hundreds of lives enhanced by their introduction. I see the sometimes remarkable improvements in a patient's cognitive and social abilities, the restoration of their former personalities and the return to some semblance of normal life for families disrupted by this tragic disease.&quot;</p>
	<p>To my mind, those words describe what must seem like hundreds of tiny miracles. That picture is repeated throughout the country. The Chamber and the public need to know what the Government will do to ensure that such miracles are allowed to continue.</p>

	<p>I am grateful to the hon. Member for Romsey (Sandra Gidley) for giving me the opportunity to respond to her debate. I am sorry that I am not the Under-Secretary of State for Health, my hon. Friend the Member for South Thanet (Dr. Ladyman), but I shall do my best to substitute for him.</p>
	<p>As Ministers, my hon. Friend and I understand the sensitivity and importance of such matters and the need to achieve the right decision at the end of the process in October. It is important to put on the record a couple of matters to which the hon. Lady did not refer. I have been in correspondence with constituents, as she will have been, about the importance of treatment and drugs. At present, about 290,000 patients could receive the drugs, but only one in six people actually receive such medication. She suggested that, if the drugs were not available, that would mean the wholesale dismemberment of Alzheimer's disease services in the national health service. She referred to the closure of clinics and the transfer of resources. I must say to her, with all respect&mdash;and I have a lot of respect for her&mdash;that that statement is a grotesque distortion of reality. I hope that, on reflection, she will reconsider her words.</p>
	<p>I turn to another important point. I did not detect from the hon. Lady's remarks that the document to which she referred is a draft for consultation. Throughout her speech, one would have gained the impression that the draft was a final decision by the National Institute for Clinical Excellence. That is a million miles away from the real position. She referred to several important and learned organisations that have expressed concerns about the draft guidance published by NICE. Those bodies should make sure that NICE has access to their views, and I am sure they will. As it has shown previously when a contested draft guidance paper has been produced for consultation, NICE is willing to revisit the basis of its initial proposal. It took such action with the proposed draft guidance on macular degeneration, with a view to making sure that its evidence is the best and reflects fully the available clinical, medical and scientific research. The hon. Lady assumed throughout her remarks that a decision has been made to withdraw the treatment that is provided. That is not the case. I am glad that she is acknowledging my remarks.</p>
	<p>The Government are committed to improving the standard of care for those with dementia. The national service framework for older people that we launched four years ago sought to promote good mental health in older people and high-quality treatment and support for those with dementia and depression. The national service framework aims to ensure that older people have access to integrated NHS and local authority mental health services, providing effective diagnosis, treatment and support for those with mental health difficulties and their carers. I believe that we are making real and solid progress in that sector.</p>
	<p>As Neil Hunt, chief executive of the Alzheimer's Disease Society, said in November last year:</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;The tide is turning&mdash;fewer people are told that dementia is just old age and more people are receiving the support and treatment that they need.&quot;</p>
	<p>I hope that the hon. Lady welcomes that positive comment from Mr. Hunt.</p>
	<p>In 2003, to support implementation of the national service framework, the Secretary of State for Health announced that, as part of the eighth wave of its work, NICE would produce a clinical guideline on the care of those with dementia, including the use of Alzheimer's drugs. NICE is scheduled to issue a consultation version of that clinical guideline in spring 2006.</p>
	<p>Hon. Members will be aware of NICE's recent review of guidance on the use of drugs for Alzheimer's disease and the publication of its draft guidance for consultation. The hon. Lady spent much time referring to that. NICE suggests that the use of the Alzheimer's drugs covered by its 2001 guidance can no longer be considered clinically effective or cost-effective, and that they should not be offered to new patients by the NHS. The draft technology appraisal produced by NICE and issued on 1 March is a consultation document. The consultation period closes on 22 March.</p>
	<p>The hon. Lady asked me on what basis NICE took the decision to issue that advice. NICE has said that the reason for the proposed change of advice is the availability of more recent evidence on clinical effectiveness. She has sought to challenge that, as she is entitled to do.</p>
	<p>NICE will carefully consider all the responses to the consultation&mdash;I am sure that the hon. Lady will make a response&mdash;before issuing its final guidance in October 2005. Until then, the original 2001 guidance from NICE should be adhered to and patients currently being prescribed Alzheimer's drugs should continue to receive them.</p>
	<p>I remind the Chamber of a point with which I hope that many hon. Members would agree: NICE has a strong track record and has built an international reputation for its work on clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness. Indeed, its methodologies have been commended by the World Health Organisation. Since NICE was established in 1999, it has issued 88 technology appraisals and 25 clinical guidelines, benefiting many thousands of patients.</p>
	<p>However, I know that questions have been asked about the methodologies that NICE has applied in preparing its revised appraisal for Alzheimer's. It is right that such issues should be aired and that they are logged formally with NICE during the consultation period, so that it can consider their implications for its final guidance. I hope that all those with an interest will share their views with NICE during the consultation. My hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State for Health has been communicating with lobby groups and expert bodies to ensure that they submit all the available evidence of efficacy and explain to NICE any reservations that they have. The Department of Health will respond to the consultation, as is its normal practice when NICE issues draft guidance.</p>
	<p>The Department of Health's response will touch on some specific areas that I know are of concern to the hon. Lady. It might help if I highlight some of those specifics. For example, we shall ask NICE whether it is content that the wider impact of those drugs, particularly on carers, is given appropriate weight and is adequately reflected in the guidance. We shall also ask NICE whether it believes that its appraisal fully captured the evidence on the effectiveness of those drugs in improving cognitive functioning, and the extent to which any such benefits may persist beyond the short term. In addition, we shall raise other issues, such as the potential costs and side-effects of alternative medications such as anti-psychotics, which might be prescribed for the behavioural and psychiatric symptoms of dementia should the existing Alzheimer's disease drugs be used far less extensively. Our response will also highlight the inter-relationship between those drugs and wider services for Alzheimer's disease such as memory clinics.</p>
	<p>That is not, of course, a comprehensive account of the Department of Health's response to the NICE consultation, but I wanted to assure the hon. Lady that we understand the issues that are being raised and that we will, as always, use our own consultation response to highlight issues that we believe to be important.</p>

	<p>I thank the Minister for the broad outline, but will he indicate how the public will be able to access that response? That does not seem to be clear at present and there is bound to be a lot of interest.</p>

	<p>I was just coming to that point. The hon. Lady asks if we are going to publish our response to the consultation. Yes, of course we will. It will be published on our website and we will put a copy in the Library, so that she and other hon. Members can see it. I do not feel that it is appropriate to go through every nook and cranny in my response, as we do not have enough time, but I wanted to give the hon. Lady the sense that we share some of her concerns. We intend fully to publish our response in the appropriate way.</p>
	<p>It is worth pointing out that, in doing so, we are not questioning NICE's processes or its track record in providing good-quality, evidence-based advice to the NHS. Nor do we seek, as some press reports suggest, to overrule the national institute or to direct it to reach a particular conclusion. The hon. Lady expressed concerns that we might be preparing to do that. I hope that she is reassured.</p>
	<p>I said that NICE is developing comprehensive guidance on the provision of dementia services in the form of a new clinical guideline. Clearly, it is important that the guideline links coherently with NICE'S final assessment of drugs for Alzheimer's disease. We will wish to discuss with NICE how the timing of those two pieces of work is best managed, so that patients, carers and clinicians have access to a single suite of advice covering the management of the condition.</p>
	<p>The hon. Lady rightly, and for good reason, confined her remarks primarily to the draft NICE guidance. In the two or three minutes left to me, I would like to widen the debate slightly. It is important that we look at other issues surrounding the care and treatment of people with Alzheimer's disease. In that context, we should not forget the role of families and carers supporting those with dementia. The majority of people with dementia are cared for at home, which can be an incredibly demanding and exhausting task for the carers.</p>
	<p>We were the first Government formally to recognise the contribution and concerns of carers. In 1999, with carers and the organisations that represent them, we developed the national carers strategy. We also introduced a carers grant to support councils when providing breaks and services for carers in England. The grant has been steadily increased every year, and it has provided an extra &pound;325 million over the past five years. It is worth &pound;125 million this year, it will be worth &pound;185 million next year and, in the last local government finance settlement, we confirmed our commitment to continue the carers grant until the end of financial year 2007&ndash;08. Local authorities have been able to use the money to give carers help with taking breaks from caring, and to give them ongoing support with caring. That was a hugely important step.</p>
	<p>There is another context to the debate, which was raised when the hon. Lady expressed concern about resources. In July 2002, the then Secretary of State for Health, my right hon. Friend for Darlington (Mr. Milburn), announced a wide-ranging package of measures radically to reform services for older people. By 2006, compared with the resources available today, another &pound;1 billion a year will be spent on social services for older people. The package focuses on six main themes&mdash;faster assessment, stabilising the care home sector, an expanded range of services, easier access to community equipment, increased choices for older people, and more support for carers. All those services are of relevance to older people with dementia.</p>

	<p>All those services are welcome, but will the Minister acknowledge that the biggest problem facing people with Alzheimer's may be the difficulty of obtaining continuing care funding? Their needs often involve a lot of personal care, which is not funded. As a result, people feel discriminated against because they believe that their needs are related to the health condition.</p>

	<p>Again, we have tried to address those issues. The hon. Lady will be aware of the ombudsman's ruling on the application of the rules on continuing care. We are working hard with the NHS to ensure that the outstanding cases are processed speedily and efficiently.</p>
	<p>It is worth bearing in mind that the NHS spends considerable sums every year on providing continuing care. In that context, continuing care does not cover personal and nursing care only. It covers the entire cost of accommodation, including the board and lodging of the person, and rightly so, because the NHS's responsibility is to provide the health care that people need. If a person's needs have been assessed as being predominantly health related, it is the NHS's job to fund that care. Meeting the concerns of the health ombudsman in dealing with the backlog of cases will cost the NHS about &pound;180 million&mdash;</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-03-16.102.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1271" speakername="David Taylor" colnum="102"  time="14:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/cm050316/halltext/50316h03.htm#50316h03_spnew0">
	<p>A little over 15 years ago, a local magistrate was selected as a prospective parliamentary candidate for an east midlands constituency. At that time, the prison population was somewhat under 40,000, and some of those prisoners had been sent down by him. During a long 30-month campaign as a loyal Labour activist, he was ultra-critical of the then Conservative Government, as Britain was imprisoning more people per head of population than any other country in the European Economic Community. If someone had told him that the prison population would double in a decade and a half, he would have been saddened. If he had been told that rapid growth would occur during two back-to-back Labour Governments, he could not and would not have believed it.</p>
	<p>The constituency was North-West Leicestershire, and the candidate, who is now the MP, was me. I am therefore particularly pleased to have secured this debate on the future of the prison and probation services. Both halves of the topic are of considerable interest and concern to me. I will deal in some detail with probation but speak more briefly about the Prison Service, as I believe that others wish to catch your eye, Mr. Deputy Speaker, on that matter.</p>
	<p>The Home Office announced in early 2004 that it was creating the National Offender Management Service. At first, it appeared that NOMS would merge the prison and probation services, but it is now clear that, rather than being merged, the probation service is to be dismantled in order to create an American-style corrections agency based on the 10 regions of England and Wales. That centrally driven change will erase local accountability, adversely affect crime prevention initiatives and undermine co-operative work with other criminal justice agencies. I believe, and am sad to say, that the drive behind the change is an ideological commitment by my Government to privatisation. There has been no prior consultation with stakeholders or parliamentarians about the proposals. No business case has been produced to justify the changes or the introduction of market forces. Scores of parliamentary questions asking for the details of the organisation remain unanswered, and the blueprint for NOMS changes weekly. An internal programme risk register says that the probability of the project running into real difficulties is high or very high.</p>
	<p>It is critical that probation work remains part of a single service. Research shows that case management, which is to be retitled &quot;offender management&quot;, is most effective when it is closely integrated with intervention. The proposal for NOMS splits those two basic functions, and in so doing it can only reduce the effectiveness of probation service work at a time when the service is performing better than ever before. The very existence of the probation service is based on the belief that prison sentences should be reserved for those who have committed the most serious offences and who pose the highest risk of harm, and that the majority can effectively be rehabilitated in the community. The creation of NOMS with its regional bureaucracy and its emphasis on punishment may put that basic philosophy at risk.</p>
	<p>The probation service provides the court with a range of community orders that reflect the seriousness of the offence, risk of harm, risk of further offending and individual need. Staff work with individuals to reduce their reoffending and to protect the public. A failure to comply with the supervision leads to breach action through the courts and can result in a prison sentence. All that work is underpinned by values of self-determination and the potential for change. The aim is to deal with people in constructive ways that do not degrade or damage them further. Providing support and advice on related problems such as the lack of basic skills, accommodation and unemployment is also key to the work of the service.</p>
	<p>The whole concept of NOMS and its design need rethinking. The Home Office has produced a blueprint for NOMS whose key elements are the separation of offender management activity from the provision of intervention and services&mdash;the two strands will be managed separately&mdash;a clear purchaser and provider split between regional offender managers as commissioners and a range of organisations as providers, and a central spine of accountability and responsibility on offender management. That statement is seriously flawed, and lacks any element of vision or values.</p>
	<p>A vision statement should clearly express the objectives of an organisation in a way that builds commitment and clearly reflects its values. In stark contrast to the current statement of purpose for the Prison Service and the current aims of the probation service, backed up by its values, the proposed vision for NOMS does not meet those criteria. It is silent on the objective of the rehabilitation of offenders; on core values and principles; on achieving diversity and treating people with humanity; on supporting staff; on the principle of openness and transparency; and on the need for an approach based on partnership and collaboration.</p>
	<p>Instead, the proposed vision is preoccupied with the establishment of a competitive market and the separation of commissioners and providers. There is an absence of sympathy with the current practice and historic development of the probation service. Aspects of the vision and its accompanying mission statement are, frankly, disingenuous. For example, the declared mission statement for NOMS refers to</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;working together to reduce reoffending&quot;,</p>
	<p>yet the NOMS vision dispenses with the principle of partnership working and introduces instead the concept of &quot;developing a competitive market&quot;. Rather than &quot;breaking down the silos&quot;, as referred to in Patrick Carter's report, new and deeper silos are to be constructed and introduced.</p>
	<p>Despite a reference in the principles to</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;prioritising work with offenders that clearly demonstrate effectiveness&quot;,</p>
	<p>there is a complete absence of a professional &quot;what works&quot; approach to the establishment of NOMS. Instead, it is being established on the basis of a set of unproven and undemonstrated assertions and dogmas, with no business case yet produced. The proposed vision for NOMS does nothing to address the uncertainty and low morale experienced by staff during its chaotic introduction. It only compounds further the lack of openness and transparency with which NOMS is being introduced: it has been the subject neither of proper parliamentary scrutiny nor any legislative process.</p>

	<p>Does my hon. Friend agree that some increased uncertainty is caused by the fact that the probation service has been so recently reorganised? In my area, a new probation service area was introduced as recently as 2001.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-03-16.104.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1271" speakername="David Taylor" colnum="104"  time="14:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/cm050316/halltext/50316h03.htm#50316h03_spnew2">
	<p>I fully accept that point. I am in regular contact with a number of probation officers in my area, and I know of the trauma that has been endured because of those changes. A further such change now, with a lack of consultation, is not to be desired. The NOMS statement also compounds the disregard for the interests, concerns and views of staff, which my hon. Friend mentioned. In the consultation exercises last year, many people opposed the dismantling of the probation service, and they have been ignored. That compounds the lack of principles and values underpinning NOMS to inspire commitment and pride from staff, as well as the lack of clarity about the future direction and governance of NOMS.</p>
	<p>There are alternatives that would deliver the Government's objectives, which I share&mdash;enhanced end-to-end sentence management, an increased role for community sentences in the sentencing process and, most importantly, a reduction in reoffending. The staff and their trade union representatives believe that such aims could be better met by developing models that enable structural reorganisation within the existing 42 boards, as my hon. Friend mentioned, which should continue to employ both offender case managers and intervention staff.</p>
	<p>Such reorganisation should enable the commissioning of further services and contestability to be done with a clarity of roles, building on the spirit of partnership rather than of competition. It should enable the probation service to remain as an integrated service with a continuing identity with its own director general, supported as appropriate by the NOMS structures of the Home Office and the national probation directorate. Finally, it should also build on the model of the youth offending teams and the model now being introduced in Scotland for prisons and local authorities to require criminal justice agencies to work together locally.</p>
	<p>I turn now to contestability, which used to be a two-word quality, highly prized by sportspeople, beauty queens and politicians. When it is welded into a one-word new Labour concept, however, it should be treated with scepticism. The Government say that they are not interested in using the private sector for its own sake, but there is not a scrap of evidence that the private sector can deliver public services more effectively or cheaply than the public sector; the very reverse is true. The community and voluntary sector, on the other hand, has an existing relationship with the probation service and operates with the same public sector ethos as the national probation service itself. A mixed economy involving the community and voluntary sector already exists, and it is by far a preferable option to privatisation.</p>
	<p>The weasel word &quot;contestability&quot; was introduced in the document &quot;Reducing Crime, Changing Lives&quot;. The Government are fighting shy of such terms as &quot;privatisation&quot; or &quot;outsourcing&quot;; in a separate context, I raised that point in Deputy Prime Minister's questions today. It is unsurprising that the Government are fighting shy of such terms, given privatisation's failure to deliver in the past. Contestability is a flawed model that will result in more expensive, poorer-quality services from non-accountable providers.</p>
	<p>The current NPS facilities management contracts are an example of how the use of the private sector has led to increased costs for poorer service standards. The service has discovered to its cost and detriment that private companies owe a first loyalty to their shareholders rather than to their public sector clients and the broader population. There is no evidence whatever that the private sector has been able, for example, to run prisons more cheaply than the public sector. I shall return to that point briefly later.</p>
	<p>Providing a cheaper service would have to be, as it always has been, at the expense of labour standards in a two-tier work force. The Government's failure to extend protection against the two-tier work force beyond best value authorities raises suspicions in my mind that NOMS may try to deliver cheaper privatised services by driving down employment standards on outsourced contracts.</p>
	<p>We should fight contestability as a route to privatisation on the following grounds. It would fragment integrated service delivery, because all public services use cross-subsidy and integration to share risks and the cost of delivery across diverse populations and communities. Moreover, the private sector is unlikely to bid for NOMS services that have higher than average supply costs, such as rural services, because without cross-subsidy, they cannot be made profitable.</p>
	<p>We should also fight contestability because public services such as probation are not commodities; they exist to support the social and economic well-being of communities. We should fight it because public-private partnerships cost more than conventionally funded projects; they borrow at higher rates than the public sector, demand higher rates of return&mdash;typically, the rate is 19 per cent. for one prison at Bridgend&mdash;and they have high set-up costs involving solicitors, accountants like me and others. Furthermore, they involve a convoluted procurement process and escalate in both scale and cost.</p>
	<p>We should fight contestability because the high cost of private finance initiative projects often leads to an affordability gap for the procuring authority, and that gap is often met by reductions in services and capacity. I shall quote briefly comments made by one member, whom I know well, who works in a hostel setting. He sets out his frustration at the abject failure of hostel arrangements to deliver a quality service:</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;It is clear from the way the facilities contract is not working, and the fact that it is not cost-effective, that privatisation is not the answer to our problems. But how can we make the powers-that-be see this?&quot;.</p>
	<p>Those powers-that-be include the Minister.</p>
	<p>If that is the future under contestability, quality of service is under real threat. The artificial split of the probation service into purchaser-provider functions is utterly irrational. The service should remain as a coherent whole and be given proper investment for growth&mdash;particularly for hostels and other interventions. The quality of service is under threat because the proposed purchaser-provider split will be expensive to set up and problematic and costly to manage, and it will lead to problems for communication, integration and risk management. We need a strong, efficient and effective probation service. The NOMS proposals do not provide a basis on which to achieve that. The consultation timetable has to be reset and the NOMS review's terms of reference widened to allow alternatives to be explored.</p>
	<p>I turn to the future of the Prison Service. The publication in January 2004 of the Government's response to Patrick Carter's review of correctional services has effectively thrown the prison service into limbo. More than 14 months later, the service and those working in it remain uncertain about what lies ahead. All those working in and around the criminal justice system continue to acknowledge the great improvement made in recent years by the Prison Service in standards, decency and performance. That has been done through partnership, not through the perpetual use of threats from Ministers&mdash;although not, I hasten to say, from the Minister present today&mdash;and senior civil servants. Those programmes facilitated improvements in the Prison Service, through partnerships and co-operation, not threats, to a level where there are no failing prisons in England and Wales. The threat of market-testing establishments is not necessary and is being used only to achieve a Prison Service-for-profit ethos.</p>
	<p>Let us consider prisons and the purchaser-provider model. A fundamental aim of the ideologically based concept of the National Offender Management Service experiment, on which its future success or failure is based, is the control of the prison population. In April 2004, the prison population reached an historical high of more than 75,000, which is just below its working operational capacity. On 11 March 2005, the population had returned to those historically high levels and stood at 75,479, although the capacity had increased to cover the predicted population increase. Nevertheless, as a magistrate, I have visited numerous prisons and I know that grossly overcrowded establishments remain.</p>
	<p>The most fundamental component of the accepted Carter recommendations is the introduction of a purchaser-provider model for the delivery of prison places. For that to be achieved, the purchaser must have an element of choice in deciding where to purchase the service that they require, otherwise there is not a genuine market. With the prison estate as overcrowded as it is, a purchaser-provider model cannot and should not be introduced, because the element of choice does not exist. It is widely acknowledged by everyone working in the criminal justice system that the prison population needs to be managed. For many people, the question is whether we need NOMS to achieve that, and for the vast majority of those people, the resounding answer is no.</p>
	<p>I turn to the future funding of Her Majesty's Prison Service. It is widely accepted that for a number of years the service has been overcrowded and under-resourced. Since the end of last year, the prison population has increased by more than 2,000. Despite the apparent failure of the chief executive of NOMS to achieve his primary aim of reducing the prison population, he has more than once outlined his intention to reduce growth in funding for the Prison Service in future. No organisation can achieve its goals if it is starved of the necessary funding. Martin Narey intends to freeze Prison Service funding. In that context, we should look at early-day motion 603, which was tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Walthamstow (Mr. Gerrard), who will no doubt refer to it himself.</p>

	<p>I am listening carefully to the case that the hon. Gentleman is making and I agree with a lot, if not all, of what he says. Does he agree that this is an unprecedented time of uncertainty in the Prison Service and that the Government are forcing it to freeze budgets and recruitment, to stop decorating and maintaining prison cells and to take cells out of operation when the prison population is still increasing?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-03-16.107.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1271" speakername="David Taylor" colnum="107"  time="14:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/cm050316/halltext/50316h03.htm#50316h03_spnew4">
	<p>The Prison Service would not fare well under the major public sector cuts that are anticipated should the hon. Lady's party be elected. However, to deal with her point directly, the Government see budget capping as an incentive for greater diversion to community sentences, which is worth while, as is reviewing the nature of the offences committed by people in prison.</p>
	<p>To deliberately and with forethought starve the public sector of the funds that it needs to deliver the service that is expected is unacceptable. This year, we have already seen mothballing of usable prison places and regimes and programmes curtailed due to a lack of resources. A continuation of Martin Narey's stated plans will inevitably lead to the Prison Service failing to achieve ministerial targets, through no fault of its own. To date, after almost 15 months, the chief executive of NOMS has not published the detailed business case to prove that the formation of the new service was necessary.</p>
	<p>In November 2004, the Home Office admitted that a detailed business case was being prepared and it was said that a draft was to be placed before the NOMS programme board on 22 November. Despite numerous calls by Members of Parliament for publication of the business case for the creation of NOMS, it has still not been made available. The NOMS programme accelerates into chaos with blithe disregard for events.</p>
	<p>In 2004&ndash;05, the cost of establishing the correctional service headquarters is in excess of &pound;105 million, which is a huge increase in non-front-line delivery costs. There will also be a requirement for more than 50 staff in each of the regional offender manager sites. The costs of those extra staff will further deplete the resources of front-line services. It is not surprising, when the estimates are considered, that NOMS declined to provide the business case, to which I referred, to justify the continuation of the project on value-for-money grounds.</p>
	<p>The glaring weaknesses of PFI seem apparent to all but Ministers. Public-private partners profit from people; the trend in PFI contracts has been to reduce the salaries of staff delivering public services and to cut jobs. Privatisation has led to a two-tier work force in which new starters on contracts receive much lower salaries and benefits than transferred staff. It has led to pensions that are not properly protected under TUPE. Unacceptably, equality suffers under privatisation: many public sector private contracts are delivered by a class of women workers who have no decent occupational pension scheme and who work on inferior terms and conditions. PFI has also led to private companies making unacceptable profits. A National Audit Office report showed that Group 4 and Carillion boosted their expected profit from the Fazakerley prison contract by 75 per cent. Refinancing produced &pound;10 million for them, of which only &pound;1 million was paid back to the Prison Service. That is another example of the private sector putting profits before public service.</p>
	<p>It may be apparent from some of my remarks that I do not have a great deal of confidence in the brave new world into which the Government are pitching the probation and prison services. I look forward to my hon. Friend the Minister telling me in detail why I am wrong next Tuesday at 1 o'clock in Room O in Portcullis House. In all seriousness, I have a great deal of confidence in, and respect for, the Minister answering today's debate. I know him reasonably well and his reputation is rightly high. In his earlier political life, he was dubious about high prison populations and the role of the private sector in the delivery of public services. As his route from Manchester and Sale to Marsham street clearly took in Damascus, he will no doubt explain to the Chamber the background to this second conversion of a man named Paul, albeit in the wrong direction.</p>

	<p>I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for North-West Leicestershire (David Taylor), who introduced the debate, for securing it and bringing this subject to our attention. I shall try not to repeat too much of what he said, because I agreed with virtually all of it. I had hoped that we might be having a similar debate at about this time on the Management of Offenders and Sentencing Bill, which was introduced in the other place, but so far it does not even have a date for Second Reading. It therefore looks highly likely that it will not be proceeded with this side of the general election, which puts the debate off even further.</p>
	<p>One of my major concerns, which I share with my hon. Friend, about the process that we are going through in establishing NOMS is the lack of debate in Parliament. I make no criticism of my hon. Friend the Minister for that. He has been generous with his time in meeting me and other hon. Members present. Through the justice unions parliamentary group, he has made every effort to meet and talk to us and we have been very grateful, but there has not been a wider debate in Parliament. The number of hon. Members who have signed the early-day motions on this subject shows that there is considerable concern, but there has not been an opportunity for a full debate.</p>
	<p>I am also concerned that, although we have not had a full debate, the reorganisation and restructuring and the setting up of NOMS are moving on. A chief executive was appointed some time ago. More recently, regional offender managers have been appointed, even though they have no regions to manage as yet. Some, I understand, are continuing to do other jobs and will do for the foreseeable future&mdash;perhaps for another year or two&mdash;as well as taking on the regional offender management role.</p>
	<p>Even though I have probably spent more time on this subject than most other subjects in the House in the last year or so, I am still confused about exactly what is happening to the structures, who is responsible for what, what the relationship really is between the regional offender managers and the probation boards, and the future of the boards themselves. In July last year, the Minister announced that, in the light of the consultation exercise that had taken place since January and the publication of the Carter report, he had decided not to do away the 42 existing probation boards, but that he was still going to bring in regional offender managers. In making the decision not to do away with those boards, he used the phrase &quot;at this stage&quot;. That seems to leave open the possibility, at the very least, that at some point in the future those probation boards will cease to exist.</p>

	<p>The Minister will know this because he kindly organised a meeting with the south-west appointment to NOMS where I raised the very point that my hon. Friend is talking about. Members of my board have written to me questioning what their role is now and what their future role will be. So, there is a real problem. I am sure that he would say that things are similar in his area.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-03-16.109.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/909" speakername="Neil Gerrard" colnum="109"  time="14:22:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/cm050316/halltext/50316h03.htm#50316h03_spnew7">
	<p>That is the case. I have certainly spoken to members of probation boards who find themselves in a situation of considerable confusion. They are not really sure yet quite what the relationship with the regional offender managers is supposed to be. If the ROMs are involved in making decisions about budgets, what does that imply? Who is actually the employer? Legally, as I understand it, the probation boards are the employers of the probation service, but if someone else starts to make decisions about budgets, performance and innovation, it is far from clear to me quite what that will mean for the boards in exercising their responsibility as employers. From talking to people who work in the probation service and the Prison Service, it is absolutely clear that there is a huge amount of uncertainty and worry among staff about what their future will be and where their services are going.</p>
	<p>My hon. Friend the Member for North-West Leicestershire pointed to the issue of contestability. I know that the Minister will tell us that contestability is not privatisation. We have had that conversation several times. However, I have to say to him that, from the point of view of the people out there who are working in the service, it feels very much like privatisation. There is no question but that that is what it feels like to staff. If the probation service is to be split into purchaser and provider, and work is to be put out to tender, that feels very much as if some of it will be privatised. There is no question but that the talk about market testing of prisons certainly implies the possibility&mdash;if not the probability&mdash;of private providers taking over.</p>
	<p>I recall being involved&mdash;I think in 1993&mdash;in the first debates in the House about the introduction of private prisons in the UK. I certainly recall the comments of the then shadow Home Secretary&mdash;I think that his constituency was Sedgefield&mdash;and the opposition that we put forward from the Labour Benches to privatisation. My hon. Friend pointed out what has been happening in the Prison Service.</p>

	<p>I am interested to hear the provenance of the remarks that my hon. Friend just mentioned. Another remark from the same source would be something along the lines of &quot;What matters is what works.&quot; One therefore draws the inference that if something does not work, it does not matter and we should revert to the normal model. Is that not a reasonable line of logic?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-03-16.110.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/909" speakername="Neil Gerrard" colnum="110"  time="14:22:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/cm050316/halltext/50316h03.htm#50316h03_spnew9">
	<p>That is logical. There is also a logic that says that if things are working and going well, why restructure them? If it is not broken, why try to fix it? Given that not a single prison in the public service is classified as a failing prison, why market test? In 2003, the National Audit Office reported on the operational performance of private prisons. It said that the experience of that performance had been mixed: some private prisons had delivered; some of the best private prisons compared with the best prisons in the public sector and that the worst prisons at the bottom were performing at least as badly as public sector prisons.</p>
	<p>The NAO acknowledged that private prisons had brought some innovation into the way in which they recruited and used their employees, but said that there was little difference in daily routine. It concluded that the use of private prisons was not a guarantee of success. I have seen no real evidence to back up the statement that the existence of private prisons has had an dramatic effect on how non-private prisons operate. It was said that private prisons have been one of the factors in driving up performance in the public sector. I cannot recall seeing reports of detailed research into such matters.</p>
	<p>My hon. Friend referred to prison numbers. That is clearly a huge problem and it is not unique to the United Kingdom. What is happening to prison numbers in many countries is interesting. I recently saw statistics that stated that, from November 1998 to June 2004, in countries where prison numbers could be counted with some reliability, numbers had increased from 8 million to 9 million. Between 1992 and 2004, there had been an increase in the prison population of more than 50 per cent. in 50 countries. The United Kingdom was one of those countries, but the other countries ranged from Argentina, Australia, Cambodia and Spain to Singapore.</p>

	<p>A subset of the large prison population that will be of importance and relevance to my hon. Friend's constituency is that there is a larger number of young black men in prison than there is at university. Should we not be trying much harder than we are as a society and a Government to work with non-custodial sentences and divert people from criminal and antisocial activity?</p>

	<p>That is absolutely right. There are disproportionalities in the prison population in respect of young black men. A worrying trend is the increasing number of young Asian men who are ending up in prison, often through drugs offences. We must be aware of the number of people who are in prison on remand. Recently, there has been a drop in the remand number, but it is still large and adds to the pressure inside prisons. As my hon. Friend said when referring to such pressures, it seems that money is being diverted into setting up the new centralised structures for NOMS, so we are ending up with prisons having unused accommodation. We have prisons with wings that are being refurbished, but the money is not there to bring them back into use with the result that other parts of the same prison are overcrowded. The number of overcrowded prisons is still large. How far does spending money on setting up new bureaucratic structures deal with such problems?</p>
	<p>We must consider what contestability or privatisation does to staff morale. There is no doubt that, when there has been privatisation, staff terms and conditions are affected. The research that was done on private prisons showed that prison officer pay was on average between 24 and 32 per cent. lower in the private sector than in the Prison Service, and that a Prison Service pension was between 10 and 13 per cent. more valuable than a pension available to someone employed in the private sector. We have already seen those effects in the prisons, so it is no wonder that prison officers are concerned about more market testing. It is also not surprising that people in the probation service, having seen what has happened in the Prison Service, have started to vent concern about what will happen to them if a purchaser-provider split and privatisation come into parts of that service.</p>
	<p>The Minister has said to us before that people should not be too worried because there will be a growing market with more work and that the Government want to do more through the probation service and services associated with it. No one whom I have spoken to in the probation service or Prison Service has any problem with the idea of co-operating more closely or working with drugs agencies that are not necessarily in the public sector. What they are worried about is that their jobs will be put out to tender, and there is no question but that that has an effect on staff morale. We have seen real improvements over recent years, and there are serious questions about what we are doing to staff morale at the moment.</p>
	<p>My hon. Friend mentioned the business case for NOMS, which we still have not seen, and we do not know when or if we will see it. That again raises some major questions about what is happening now, before the business case has been seen.</p>
	<p>We said at the beginning that the Minister has been extremely helpful to those of us who are interested in the issue. He has met us frequently, discussed what is happening and tried his best to keep us informed, and we are genuinely grateful for that. I suspect that he did not dream up some of the ideas that he is lumbered with and having to implement, and that we might be doing some different things if he was taking all the decisions. However, I hope that he will take on board the fact that there are still concerns and consider whether now is the time to be pressing ahead with the reorganisation. We do not know really where we are going or how we intend to get there, and we have not had either the legislation or the full debate in both Houses of Parliament that we should have had.</p>

	<p>My hon. Friend talked about the reduced pay and conditions of the staff in the private sector. Will he comment on the lack of training or poorer quality training that exists for those staff? The regimes for which they will be responsible will be lower quality purely because of that. Is that not a factor?</p>

	<p>That has certainly been an issue in some of the private prisons. The prisons that have been privatised tend to have been new buildings and at the easy end of the market. A lot of work has been done to improve the prison estate, but none of the old buildings that are more difficult to manage has been taken over by the private sector.</p>
	<p>To conclude, I think that we should step back and be careful about rushing ahead with something that has not had the full debate in this place that it should have had.</p>

	<p>I apologise for being late. I was trying to intervene in the Budget debate, but Mr. Speaker informed me that although I have prepared a detailed alternative Budget, the world will have to wait for it until later as I have spoken enough in the House recently.</p>
	<p>I want to make a few brief points. As hon. Members will know, last year a group of us came together to form an all-party justice unions group. Members who are in the Chamber&mdash;other than the Minister, obviously&mdash;are members of that group. We formed the group as a result of the NOMS proposals, to enable us to have a direct view from the staff&mdash;the people who are at the work face and who will have to implement the proposals if the House approves the legislation and the Government proceed with it after the general election.</p>
	<p>The consternation that has come from all sections of the professional staff has alerted us to the fact that, as my hon. Friend the Member for Walthamstow (Mr. Gerrard) said, we need time to think again about the proposals. I will not reiterate the anxieties that people have expressed about privatisation, except to say that we all know of examples of privatisation in the individual services. The problems in some areas, in particular with detention centres, have demonstrated people's concerns about private companies operating with staff who are often inadequately trained, paid and supervised. That is one of the lessons that we need to learn before we go forward with any further privatisations.</p>
	<p>I will give one other example. It is of a Ministry of Defence privatisation of the records office in my constituency. Last week, a parliamentary question was answered about agency staff who had been brought in by TNT and who were dismissed for having drugs on site. Drug usage on site has become a problem with agency staff as a result of privatising the service and laying off the staff who were employed by the MOD. That is one example, but many others could be cited.</p>
	<p>The second issue concerns why we are going down this road when Scotland is considering a different route. We could take two routes: one is the almost obsessional ideological commitment to market testing, contestability or compulsory competitive tendering, or whatever fashionable term one uses to describe it. That is one route that involves a purchaser-provider split. It tries to model public services on the supposed operation of private services in the private sector. In fact, most private sector operations do not work that way. There is not always a split between purchaser and provider. The rigorous tendering processes that we go through ad nauseam do not necessarily operate in the private sector. In the private sector, there is much more flexibility about continued usage of staff and bringing services in-house as companies expand to ensure that they can perform a multifaceted role in that individual company. So we are modelling privatisation&mdash;or contestability, or whatever one chooses to call it&mdash;on a myth that does not operate in the same form in the private sector.</p>
	<p>The alternative route is the multi-agency approach. For a long time, I thought that there was a political and professional consensus about the value of that approach, whereby different professional groups would come to the same table. They would exchange their professional judgments and develop systems of operation through which, working together, they could tackle the problems that their services needed to challenge.</p>

	<p>Does my hon. Friend agree that one example of multi-agency work introduced by our Government that has worked, is working and is an example to future reorganisations is that of the youth offender teams?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-03-16.113.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1067" speakername="John McDonnell" colnum="113"  time="14:39:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/cm050316/halltext/50316h03.htm#50316h03_spnew16">
	<p>Youth offender teams are an example, as are the drug action programmes, but there are such examples throughout virtually every public service. The local strategic partnerships that exist in all our authorities involve multi-agencies coming together to talk about common concerns and meet common challenges and to deploy their professional services in a way that adds value&mdash;I beg the Chamber's pardon for that expression&mdash;to all that the agencies are doing in their fields. There is example after example of multi-agency approaches. I repeat that, until a couple of years ago, I thought that there was cross-party and cross-professional consensus that the multi-agency approach was the way forward, considering the failures of compulsory competitive tendering and contestability elsewhere, particularly in local government and the localised services that we provide.</p>
	<p>Scotland has gone through that consultation. There has been extensive discussion at every level, and people's views have been taken into account. As a result, the overwhelming view from the professionals and the communities that they serve was that, rather than go down the contestability route, we should concentrate on the multi-agency approach. Because the new services will be playing such an important professional role, I would rather at least see what the Scottish experience is in the coming period before rushing into making any decisions about England in particular.</p>
	<p>There is a real problem, which has been cited by several hon. Members: we are demoralising the very people whom we rely on to deliver the service. What we will see in the coming period, particularly within the probation service, is a flight of staff from the service itself. We will lose the experience that has been built up over generations. We will lose it because people will not feel secure about their future. They will not know whether they have a job in the public or the private sector: they will not know what rates of pay or conditions they will be working under or even what role they will play.</p>
	<p>In addition, the staff's professionalism dictates that they want to succeed. They want to ensure that the service they deliver is effective. None of the staff we have spoken to from the all-party justice unions group has expressed confidence that this system will enable them to deliver. The importance of that for us as constituency MPs is that if they do not deliver and the system does not work we will be left not just with an escalating prison population but with large numbers of offenders coming out of prison on to the streets whose problems will not be addressed and who will continue to offend. That is a vista for the future that we need to take seriously.</p>
	<p>We need to step back a bit. Once we get past the general election, in May or whenever, there will be an opportunity to go out to consultation again. The Government could start listening to staff professionals and communities in a way that we perhaps did not before. The Government have to be more transparent. We have praised the current Minister&mdash;I apologise for using the word &quot;current&quot;&mdash;for being extensively involved with the all-party group and meeting as many organisations as he possibly can. That is excellent, but behind those discussions and consultations there needs to be some real material. Not publishing the business case is an indication of a lack of confidence in the proposals and a lack of confidence in the information that is supposed to justify the Government's proposals.</p>
	<p>It will need a bit of courage, but after the election the Government should announce a further round of consultation and discuss the proposals again, consider further options and engage in the dialogue that occurred in Scotland to see how those proposals were brought about in contradistinction to the Government's proposals.</p>
	<p>Issues have been raised today that need to be addressed. The stability of funding of the Prison Service and the probation service has been a problem for several years. It became almost an autumnal event for us to meet to try to resolve the London probation service budgetary crisis. This year that was not the case, but time and again, we found that as we moved towards the end of the financial year, there was a period of near panic within the probation service; then the Home Office found some way, using creative accountancy, to ensure that we got through that financial year and we lobbied the Treasury for more resources the following year. It would be useful to try to obtain some stability within the probation service in the long term for its overall budget.</p>
	<p>I emphasise the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Walthamstow. We have met prison governors who have told us what the budgetary implications have been towards the end of this financial year, with individual wings being mothballed and overcrowding occurring. Again, they have told us that they need stability so that they can plan their local budgets. There needs to be stability nationally, too, so that there can be a period in which they can plan, based not just on the prison numbers that we project&mdash;we should do that more adequately&mdash;but on the objectives that they are meant to achieve with the budget they are given.</p>
	<p>What we are doing at the moment is setting objectives for both the Prison Service and the probation service that are unrealistic in relation to the amount of investment that we are ploughing into the overall service. I can understand how that has come about. The demands of our community mean we have to achieve the goal and turn around the regime of offending. At the same time, those measures must be followed up with overall investment. On that basis, I hope that after the general election the Minister either retains his brief or goes on to higher things, because he deserves it. If he retains his brief, I urge him to take on board the fact that we need discussion, consultation and the courage to think again and think more radically than we have done.</p>

	<p>I add my congratulations to the hon. Member for North-West Leicestershire (David Taylor) on obtaining this debate. I also add my voice to those who have said kind things about the Minister and in particular how he has engaged with the all-party group on justice unions, of which I am vice-chairman. I should congratulate the hon. Member for North-West Leicestershire not only on securing the debate, but on the content of his speech. His analysis of the economics of PFI and PPP gladdened my heart. There was nothing that he said with which I would disagree. I await the day of reckoning that must surely come when all the wonderful projects proceeding under PFI and PPP have to be paid for. The next generation will basically buy public services and infrastructure on tick, and that cannot be allowed to continue indefinitely. That prospect does not fill me with much happiness, and when that day comes it will give me no satisfaction to say &quot;I told you so.&quot;</p>
	<p>The hon. Gentleman said several times that the proposals were ideologically driven, and I can well see why. I wonder whether there is a full and proper understanding of the ideology, whatever that happens to be. We have a set of proposals driven by a few slogans or mantras about the desirability of competition and choice in the provision of public services, without any proper understanding of why some people&mdash;they do not necessarily include me&mdash;would want that competition and choice. An awful lot of what has been included in NOMS has probably been dreamt up by people who do not know the stark reality of service provision at the sharp end. If they have had that experience, it must be somewhere in their dim and distant past, and they must have become isolated from the reality of it.</p>
	<p>I should declare an interest and a lack of interest in this debate. The lack of interest is due to the fact that, as the hon. Member for Hayes and Harlington (John McDonnell) said, the Scottish Executive have also considered the matter, and as I represent a Scottish seat, my constituency will not be directly affected by NOMS should it be introduced. However, I commend the Scottish Executive on how they considered the matter. They did so openly and transparently, and they engaged with criminal justice professionals in a way that I am afraid to say the consultation south of the border did not. Ultimately, having gone through the process openly and properly, the Executive decided not to proceed with NOMS.</p>

	<p>Is the hon. Gentleman familiar with the comment made by the Scottish Justice Minister, Cathy Jamieson, when she introduced the relevant legislation? She said:</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;We must do more to improve the integration of services for offenders so that they cannot fall between the gaps and services and the organisations that provide them. We must ensure that all agencies involved in the management of offenders work together effectively to tackle re-offending.&quot;</p>

	<p>That is absolutely the key issue, and I suspect that the Minister might say the same in introducing NOMS. There is the premise outlined by Cathy Jamieson, with which I agree, and the conclusion. The conclusion that she and the Scottish Executive reached was encouraged in large part by Liberal Democrat Back Benchers in the Scottish Parliament, who are also in the Scottish Executive reining in some of the worst excesses of new Labour. The premise that the Minister would come up with is that NOMS is necessary. If it is necessary, however, the case has to be made for it, and one of the most remarkable features of this debate so far&mdash;not just today's debate, but the wider debate that has taken place throughout the preceding months&mdash;is that no such case has been made.</p>
	<p>I am interested in this debate because I was a criminal court solicitor before I was elected to Parliament. I worked as both a defence agent and as a procurator fiscal deputy&mdash;a crown prosecutor&mdash;in Scotland, and I have strong views on this subject. I have worked a lot with criminal justice social workers, Prison Service staff and young offenders institution staff, and such experiences have given me a good insight into this topic. Hon. Members are right to deprecate the fact that we have not had a more substantial debate, because the matter under discussion is very important. The probation service and the Prison Service deal with some of the most vulnerable and damaged people in our society. The truth is that they have been failed time after time by the provision of public services; they have often been failed by the education service, by the social work service, and by care homes. I find distasteful the idea that at the end of all of that, they will be put into a system that, instead of addressing their needs, provides profit for private companies.</p>
	<p>My greatest concern about NOMS is that we have a highly centralising process that will lead to privatisation. The hon. Member for North-West Leicestershire spoke about contestability; I cannot but agree with what he said, because contestability is a good example of a new word for an old notion, where the old notion is unacceptable. It is like changing the name of Windscale to Sellafield. If it looks like a duck, walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it is a duck. If something looks like privatisation and sounds like privatisation, then in my book that is exactly what it is. That is unacceptable. The separation of commissioners and providers will create an entirely artificial market. The services in question are not normally provided in a marketplace, and the marketplace that will be created will be entirely artificial, and it will inevitably detract from the placing of resources at the front line, where they are most needed.</p>
	<p>Let me deal now with the impact of the changes on the probation and prison staff. Those services are often among the least attractive for workers in the sector. The work that we ask such people to do is often a thankless task. If we do not place any value on the professionalism that they can bring to the work they do, I worry that the quality of service that they provide will ultimately be diminished. I know from my own experience working as a prosecutor in the early 1990s, when the previous Conservative Government were severely underfunding the procurator fiscal service in Aberdeen and throughout Scotland, that the ability of those in my office to do our job properly was reduced simply because we did not have sufficient resources, we were constantly stretched and we felt that nobody cared about the work we did. If we go ahead with NOMS, we risk sending that signal to workers in the probation and prison services.</p>
	<p>As the hon. Member for Walthamstow (Mr. Gerrard) said, we risk creating a two-tier work force. The measure that is being introduced appears to be all about making savings. Ultimately, they will be made at the expense of the training and fringe benefits, such as pension provision, of the people who work in prisons. I have had some experience of private prisons; I have had clients who were placed in Kilmarnock prison in Scotland, which was Scotland's first private prison. When one enters the prison, the infrastructure seems very impressive. There are lots of shiny new tables&mdash;there certainly were when I visited&mdash;nice paintwork and all the rest of it, and it all looks very good for the visiting politicians. However, on talking to the inmates about the quality of service provided, I realised where the savings have been made. That prison was the subject of a recent documentary in Scotland and some worrying aspects of how it is run have come to light in the past few days. I know that it is not the Minister's responsibility, but he should look closely at the lessons that are being learned in that prison at the moment.</p>
	<p>I reiterate the comments made by the hon. Member for Hayes and Harlington in asking for more transparency and openness and for more answers to be given, particularly on the business case. If this process is about the creation of a marketplace, surely the business case should be central.</p>

	<p>I add my congratulations to the hon. Member for North-West Leicestershire (David Taylor) on securing the debate, and I extend my commiserations to the Minister. As was said earlier, it is like d&eacute;j&agrave; vu, as we have been in this Chamber before considering the future of the prison and probation services, and sadly, we do not appear to have made terrific progress.</p>
	<p>It is ironic that the title of this debate could cover so many things. It could cover the situation in our prisons and the quality of the work there as reflected in the work of the inspectorate, the work of the prisons ombudsman, the position on prison officers' pensions or the announced closing of the prison ship Weare, but the entire debate has been dominated by NOMS, which seems to have turned into a black hole that absorbs every other debate on the Prison Service, the probation service and what happens to people who offend in our society. Today's debate, which has repeated so many points put to the Minister before, is a rather sad indictment.</p>
	<p>I have several questions for the Minister that I hope he will have time to answer. First, what is happening with the Management of Offenders and Sentencing Bill? The Bill has been published, and it was introduced in the House of Lords on 12 January, but nothing has happened to it. It seems alarming that we are discussing something that has effectively been happening for more than a year, since last January's announcement, but we have still not had the chance to discuss the legislation on Second Reading or examine it in this House at all. It has been introduced in the Lords, and there it has stuck. I also ask the Minister to confirm the rumour that the Bill is to be withdrawn and redrafted because its provisions are in some difficulty. I would like him to address that point directly.</p>
	<p>Our Prison Service is a mixed bag. Anne Owers, the chief inspector, describes it as suffering from a struggle between progress and pressure. I have been to a lot of prisons during the past 12 months and talked to many prison officers, probation service officers, governors and others involved in the criminal justice system, and I stand second to none in my admiration for the work that they carry out. In the main, the people who work in the service are dedicated and do a lot of good work in our community.</p>
	<p>What do we expect of our prison and probation services&mdash;particularly the Prison Service? The ordinary man in the street expects that perpetrators of crime should be locked up to protect communities and in order to prove that if someone breaks the law they will be caught and punished. People also expect much more: they expect the redemptive and rehabilitative element to prevent reoffending, and they expect the services to address the enormous issues of poor education, drug and alcohol addiction and&mdash;this is now an overwhelming problem&mdash;mental illness among the prison population.</p>
	<p>The security, transparency and effectiveness of the system is paramount, and despite the best efforts of those working in the system, the Prison Service still faces enormous problems. The service is still 24 per cent. overcrowded; there are at least two self-inflicted deaths a week; and last year prison staff bravely resuscitated 228 prisoners. There were almost 18,000 incidents of self-harm in prisons.</p>

	<p>Will the hon. Lady include in her pantheon of desirable qualities for a Prison Service a requirement that the staff be well regarded, stable, well paid and well trained? That is not likely to happen under NOMS. Does she also agree that the service should be able to retain in its buildings those sent into custody? Under past Governments, particularly in their final years, were not early release schemes of an informal nature a daily occurrence?</p>

	<p>I am not seeking to score political points on that aspect of the debate. As I said, people expect perpetrators of crime to be locked up and, as I should have said, to remain locked up. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman and I would agree on that.</p>
	<p>To return to the statistics on the current state of our Prison Service, the female prison population has almost doubled under this Government. Sadly, women are twice as likely to kill themselves and 14 times as likely to carry out self-harm in that environment. The availability of drugs in our prisons is also an enormous problem. According to the inspector of prisons, that raises serious concerns. Drugs fuel abscondence from open prisons&mdash;something that the hon. Gentleman would obviously be concerned about&mdash;and in closed institutions, the advent of drugs is undermining safety and raising levels of debt, bullying and intimidation.</p>
	<p>Education and training in prison is also proving to be a weak link. In the last report from the inspector, 18 training prisons were inspected, and only 5 were found to provide sufficient work and training for their prisoners. I am sure that the Minister is familiar with that information, and I know that he is trying to address those problems. However, it is ironic that I have a letter sent to the Prison Officers Association by no other than his esteemed Prime Minister, who wrote to David Evans before taking up the mantle at No. 10 Downing street:</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;In our view, a modern and effective Public Prison Service requires a disciplined and challenging regime free from the problems of gross overcrowding and indiscipline that have undermined the Service in the past.&quot;</p>
	<p>Unfortunately, I do not think that there has been much progress in the Prison Service since the Prime Minister's words, which were spoken before 1997.</p>
	<p>Against that background, there is the continuing development of NOMS, but the way in which that development is taking place does not inspire observers with confidence in the Prison Service or probation service. That has been reflected in our debate. I could take some pleasure in seeing the Minister chided and upbraided by Labour Members, but I do not, because we have been working in quite a good, non-partisan way on the subject. Our ultimate aim is basically the same&mdash;to provide a modern prison and probation service for the 21st century. As the Minister knows, however, I cannot ignore the large quantity of paper that is starting to reach my desk concerning comments on the development of NOMS that require answers from him. I hope that he will address some of those matters today.</p>
	<p>The consultation process on the proposed NOMS headquarters has raised many issues. For example, the speed at which the proposals are implemented will present real challenges. The consultation process has been so sparse&mdash;it has also been rushed through&mdash;as to prevent the consultation with staff, and even with unions, that everybody has demanded in this debate. The new contractual arrangements and purchaser-provider relationships will require changes, particularly in relation to reskilling. What measures have been taken to clarify those arrangements? Will the Minister set out the decision processes, particularly on key areas such as information technology and property?</p>
	<p>Can the Minister say how any lack of the resources needed to deliver centrally set standards will be taken into account in the assessment of the public sector Prison Service in a market test or in other forms of contestability? Those issues need to be laid out. How is he dealing with clarifying responsibilities and overlap? For example, how is he solving the problems of the apparent separation of security policy from security standards? What will he do about the boundary issues between pure policy and operational policy? How will he handle the transfer of work between the Prison Service and NOMS? Can he confirm that there are anxieties about transferring complete areas, which may leave skills voids and will be dealt with only by extra costs or reduced effectiveness?</p>
	<p>What progress has the Minister made on the problems of the prison estate? As I understand it, the scope of responsibilities has not been clarified. How will he deal with the backlog of unfunded maintenance? That is an even more important aspect, because managers can be held personally liable under health and safety legislation. Managers are anxious to know the extent of the support available to them.</p>
	<p>Will the Minister comment on the safer custody group and say what he has done to deal with the fears of duplication? Likewise, has he addressed the issues that arise from moving the drug strategy unit as a whole into the health partnerships? I would also like to hear his view on the management of high-risk and high-profile cases, as well as on the policy on sex offenders, domestic abuse and child abuse. Has he established clear lines of accountability so that no serious business or public protection risks are associated with the transfers of responsibilities?</p>
	<p>Why is the Minister rushing forward with these proposals when I understand that both director generals do not wish him to proceed at such a pace. All the evidence suggests that the best way forward is for probation to be kept in the localities. In the past month, even the Local Government Association stated in its &quot;Going Straight&quot; report:</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;We do not believe that regional structures will help engage with local communities or are best suited to delivering tailored measures for offenders involving local services.&quot;</p>
	<p>The report added:</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;we are disappointed that no consideration seems to have been given to existing partnership arrangements at the local level&quot;.</p>
	<p>The LGA does not believe that a regional approach will secure the Government's objective of energising local communities.</p>
	<p>What is the justification for splitting the probation service into two sections&mdash;offender management and interventions&mdash;when all the research shows that the best way of working is to keep them together? I do not know whether the Minister is aware that on 10 February, in discussions involving probation board members, a senior NOMS staff member was asked why they were splitting the functions. He replied that there was no evidence that the offender management and interventions split would deliver anything, but said that it had to be done because of political diktat. Will the Minister confirm that that is the view among some officials? If that is the case, it is a worrying state of affairs.</p>
	<p>The Scottish route has been laid out well. I would like to know why the Minister has not taken it. We have been encouraging him for months to do so. I feel rather sorry for him, because I feel that he is not driving the process; I feel that it is being driven by other areas of his party and by other provisions. The good will towards him is understood in this Chamber. I understand that the Prime Minister has been involved, and I want to know, as far as No. 10 is concerned, what sort of timetable has been imposed on the Minister?</p>

	<p>The hon. Gentleman is appealing to my maternal instincts. Of course, I would always want to protect the Minister.</p>
	<p>Nevertheless, in the cold light of day, we have a mess on our hands, and it is exceedingly worrying. The Prison Officers Association, for which I have the greatest respect, has started lobbying on the issue and has produced an excellent pack. Once again, it asks a list of questions. It says that NOMS has so far failed to produce the business case and that the Minister has refused to publish the critical gateway review. We have asked for both those things. The POA says that &pound;90 million has so far been spent on this matter. That has taken place against the background of frozen budgets. I must say to the Minister that that is the case because Prison Service budgets were taken away to shore up other parts of the Home Office, which is an appalling situation. The Prison Officers Association also says that he is ignoring the Gershon report, and that there will be more civil service bureaucracy. It says that there has been wholesale closure of Prison Service accommodation owing to the lack of adequate resources and that NOMS has directly caused further overcrowding. I could go on, but the Minister has heard this before. It is a great shame.</p>
	<p>I have been very straight about my view of privatisation, but I refer once again to the Prime Minister's letter to the Prison Officers Association, written before he entered No. 10, in which he gave this assurance:</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;We would halt the extension of prison privatisation and ensure existing privatised prison contracts will be examined with a view to their non-renewal and their full integration into the public sector Prison Service.&quot;</p>
	<p>That promise has been totally and utterly broken by the Government and is living proof that they are not to be trusted.</p>
	<p>Over the year in which I have been covering my current brief and enjoying my exchanges with the Minister&mdash;I hope that he has found them as constructive as I have&mdash;I have seen that these two services, which provide a great service to our community, are being torn apart by a bureaucratic management process that is being handled incorrectly. If there is a general election shortly and I find myself in his position, I will not find decisions easy to make, but I will pause and consult. I will ensure that I take a grip of the management process, because that is as much as the services deserve. They do not deserve the current chaos and uncertainty.</p>

	<p>This has been an excellent debate conducted in a generous way. I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for North-West Leicestershire (David Taylor) on his passionate and well-informed speech, which was based on long experience of the issues, and thank him for the kind words that he offered me.</p>
	<p>Let me make it absolutely clear that there is uncertainty in our prisons and probation system. We are undertaking the biggest ever reform of those services, but I do not accept that the reform process is a mess. Let nobody be under any illusions about the fact that the Minister is driving that reform. Much as I accept the kind words and support&mdash;maternal and otherwise&mdash;from hon. Members, I assure them that the process is being driven forward, but that does not mean that we are not prepared to listen. Some of my previous actions demonstrate that I am prepared to listen, and I will continue to do so because it will be impossible to achieve what we have set out to achieve unless people work together. That requires all of us to work with the work force, management and those who drive policy to ensure that, wherever possible, we gain consensus or at least have a proper and full understanding.</p>
	<p>My hon. Friend spoke about the lack of vision and values, and it might be helpful if I begin by setting out what I regard as the vision and values that drive the development of the National Offender Management Service. A number of them emanate from the work done by Patrick Carter, now Lord Carter, in the report that he presented to the Home Office just over a year ago, which we fully accepted.</p>
	<p>The first issue is that of rebalancing the correctional system. My hon. Friend spoke about the days when the prison population numbered 40,000. I can be precise about the current numbers: there are 75,386 people in prison today, which is many more than all those years ago. What matters most is that the people in prison are those who need to be there. Serious, dangerous, violent or sexual offenders should be in prison for what they have done, and they should be there longer than has been the case in the past. The Criminal Justice Act 2003 and the Sexual Offences Act 2003 will ensure that that happens. However, prison places should not be wastefully taken up by people who are not dangerous. The less serious offenders could be given community sentences and thus put something back for the wrong that they have done. They would be paying the price but could remain at home, being in the community and engaging with the probation service.</p>
	<p>On Monday, I was in Wigston&mdash;it is an area that my hon. Friend will know&mdash;to launch the national clean-up week. Offenders doing community service, which is unpaid work in the community, were refurbishing a sports facility and removing graffiti. That is precisely the kind of punishment that is appropriate for such people. We want to rebalance sentencing so that people are not given short-term prison sentences when they could be doing that sort of pay-back work. We also need to reinvigorate fines to ensure that they are properly enforced.</p>
	<p>We will introduce proposals for a day fine in a management of offenders Bill, which I shall speak about in a moment. It is about rebalancing the system. It will also introduce offender management. At the moment, we have two systems&mdash;the Prison Service and the probation service. Yes, they work closer together than ever, but they are not sufficiently joined up when it comes to the management of individual offenders. We propose introducing a named offender manager for each offender. Each offender will have a sentence plan, and it will be the responsibility of the offender manager to ensure that the plan is fully carried out.</p>
	<p>The offender manager will be accountable. One of the problems with the current system is a lack of accountability for the reducing of reoffending. That accountability will be put in place: that responsibility will be made clear to the offender manager. What we seek is what my hon. Friend called a central spine&mdash;offender managers managing the sentence plan, which could involve a custodial sentence, or intervention in the community, or both&mdash;as it will have a much bigger impact on reoffending.</p>
	<p>The third element is that of contestability, which was mentioned by all Members who spoke this afternoon. As predicted, I will make it absolutely clear this afternoon that contestability is not privatisation. Privatisation means a service being given to the private sector&mdash;work for which the public sector is not permitted to compete. That is what privatisation means, whereas with contestability, all sectors are encouraged to compete for the work. I am actively encouraging the public sector Prison Service and those who run our probation services to gear up and be ready for contestability. I am confident that, with their professionalism, those services will win a great deal of the work. However, I also want the private sector to show us what it can do, and I want the voluntary and community sectors to show us what they can do, too.</p>
	<p>I hope that I am not misquoting my hon. Friend, but I think he said he wanted a mixed economy. I want a mixed economy, but I want it to be based on adding value to the money that we invest. It is not about old-fashioned market testing, or reducing the cost to a minimal level. It is about driving more value out of the money that is invested in our correctional system. In a system that is bigger and in which more money than ever is being invested, I believe that everybody has a part to play; and if we develop that partnership, we can drive more value out of it.</p>
	<p>Let be briefly describe the overall aim of the enterprise. We have to reduce the rates of reoffending. We spend &pound;4 billion a year on our prison and probation services. That is &pound;1 billion a year more than in 1997. Despite spending more, however, three of every five people who come out of prison are reconvicted within two years. We have to do better than that, which is why I seek reform.</p>

	<p>Does the Minister recognise that the real sticking point is the question of contestability? None of us is going to disagree with a great deal of what he said, and none of the professionals will disagree. Obviously, when one enters on the major restructuring of a service, one might have difficulties with negotiation and so on. The real problem comes when people think that their jobs are at risk.</p>

	<p>I am pleased to have been reasonably persuasive so far, but I accept what my hon. Friend says&mdash;that when people see changes that will impact on their jobs, they will clearly be fearful, uncertain and questioning. I acknowledge that it is my responsibility as the Minister and that it is the responsibility of all who are involved in the development of NOMS to ensure that the staff feel they are part of the whole enterprise and that their questions are answered. That remains my objective and&mdash;this has been acknowledged&mdash;I seek opportunities to listen and to engage in conversation. I have done that with the all-party justice unions group and accept that it has been a really important innovation. In order to develop better communication links and to get questions answered, I am considering the possibility of developing a new stakeholder forum with regular access to Ministers, in which trade unions, voluntary sector organisations and others could participate.</p>
	<p>Speaking of answering questions, perhaps I ought to move on quickly and try to deal with some of the points that have come up in the debate. First, on consultation, I hope that I have made it clear that consultation is fundamental to the proposal. There were two formal consultations last year&mdash;one on Patrick Carter's report and the other on our proposals for organisational change&mdash;but it is clear that we will need to have more consultation. I absolutely commit myself to that and, as I mentioned, I hope that we will be able to develop the stakeholder group.</p>
	<p>The business case was presented in outline form in Patrick Carter's report, but more is being done on it. The strategic outline business case and the full business case are under development. I say to my hon. Friend that it is not normal practice for the Government to publish the business case for their proposals. However, there has been an application under the Freedom of Information Act 2000 for information about it. That is being considered and, if we have to reveal the information as requested, I shall consider carefully whether in fact we publish the business case. I assure him that work on and consideration of the matter are ongoing. Clearly, there will be more to say on that in the future.</p>

	<p>I am sorry that the Government have to be dragged kicking and screaming, through an application under the 2000 Act, into publishing the business case. It is obvious that the Minister will not have time to deal with all the points that have been raised, so before he sits down I would like him to undertake to write, before the recess, to each and every Member who has taken part in the debate, with answers to all the questions. That is a perfectly reasonable request, and if he agrees he will be able to relax a little rather than trying to deal with everything in the final three minutes.</p>

	<p>That is a very helpful suggestion, and I am happy to undertake to do that, particularly as the hon. Lady asked many detailed questions which will need fuller answers.</p>
	<p>On investment in the prison and probation services, the Government have built 17,000 additional prison places since 1997, and 3,000 more that are in the pipeline will be delivered by this time next year. The probation service work force will be 50 per cent. larger: it had 14,000 staff in 1997 and will have 21,000 staff by this time next year. That is a substantial increase, and there could be nothing further from the truth than any suggestion that this Government lack confidence in the probation service and are not investing in it.</p>
	<p>I was grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Hayes and Harlington (John McDonnell) for making the point that in the past there has been a budgetary problem in London but that this year, for the first time, there has not been a crisis. That is because we have invested real, hard cash in the probation service. The performance of the London probation service speaks volumes for the way in which the staff have been able to use that investment to drive up their own performance and make a real difference.</p>
	<p>Yes, the Prison Service has taken some decisions in the very recent past to deal with overcrowding and to take out of use some prison cells that were to be refurbished earlier than planned, and, yes, we must keep costs under control, but nothing that has happened in the past few weeks and months in respect of taking out places has undermined the ability of the Prison Service to provide those whom it is charged with looking after with safe and secure accommodation.</p>
	<p>NOMS continues to develop. The 10 regional offender managers are now in place. In due course, each and every Member of Parliament will be invited to meet their regional offender manager. It is important that they have the opportunity to meet the managers, to find out who they are and how to contact them, and to ask them questions.</p>
	<p>The organisational structure is still under development. I withdrew the original proposal last July, but we continue to work on further development.</p>

</major-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-03-16.126.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/866" speakername="Julia Drown" colnum="126"  time="15:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/cm050316/halltext/50316h04.htm#50316h04_spnew0">
	<p>I rise to raise the case of the murders in November 2003 of Julia and William Pemberton by Alan Pemberton. After shooting his wife and 17-year-old son, Alan Pemberton took his own life. Those deaths followed a history of domestic violence to which the police were alerted 15 months before the tragedy.</p>
	<p>A number of the family and friends of Julia and William Pemberton are my constituents. I share their desire to understand the events leading up to that appalling tragedy and to stop similar events happening in future. We ask the Home Secretary, via the Minister, to call for a homicide review, to ask for the conduct of the coroner in the case, Peter Bedford, to be reviewed, and we seek a review of the granting of injunctions in domestic violence cases.</p>
	<p>Many people are familiar with the final moments of Julia Pemberton's life, after the transcript of her 999 call was read to the inquest in September 2004. People heard of Julia's desperate pleas for help, her saying that her husband was approaching, was in the room and then silence, because Alan had found her, hit her and shot her. What is not so well known is the list of police failings leading up to the murders. The family are in no doubt that those failings contributed significantly to the deaths. If the police had done their job properly, we could expect those three people to be alive today.</p>
	<p>The state has a positive duty to protect life. Home Office circular 19/2000 made that clear. It said that a force policy should be issued on domestic violence, making it clear that</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;the main duty is to protect the victims and, if applicable, any children from further abuse&quot;,</p>
	<p>that incidents should be investigated fully, and stressing</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;the importance of comprehensive record keeping.&quot;</p>
	<p>The Thames Valley police failed Julia and William Pemberton in all those areas. The chief executive of Refuge, Sandra Horley, said that, in her 28 years of experience working with women and children escaping from domestic violence, she has never come across such a tragic and preventable series of events.</p>
	<p>The family and I have had many meetings with Thames Valley police. Some have taken place with the hon. Member for Newbury (Mr. Rendel), where the murders were committed. I am grateful to the police for giving us many hours of their time at those meetings and for answering many questions in writing. However, the family and I remain hugely dissatisfied with their response.</p>
	<p>I have also discussed domestic violence issues with Swindon's police, who are part of the Wiltshire constabulary. They have a far more proactive approach to domestic violence. The difference in attitude is remarkable. I should like to record my appreciation of the commitment of Swindon's police to those issues.</p>
	<p>I share the family's scepticism of the commitment of Thames Valley police to policing domestic violence. We have seen incompetence, complacency and the failure to follow Home Office and Crown Prosecution Service guidelines. That is apparent in the details of the events, and can be seen in the police's refusal, despite many requests from the family, to initiate any sort of inquiry.</p>
	<p>I shall relate the events to the House. In September 2002, Julia informed her husband, Alan, that she wished for a divorce, following years of abuse. Alan threatened to kill Julia and commit suicide. To reinforce that threat, Alan left out in the study his and Julia's wills for Julia and their children to see, with instructions in the event of their deaths for their son William, then aged 15. Alan also scrawled numerous menacing messages in the study.</p>
	<p>A threat to kill is a serious crime, and Julia and her brother, my constituent Frank Mullane, reported those threats repeatedly and persistently to the police in Newbury and begged them to visit the house to see the corroborating evidence. The police promised to attend, but did not. The police recorded the incident as a domestic dispute and did not report it to CID. Instead, the police domestic violence file recorded that further calls from Julia's brother Frank did not need to be responded to fast-time, despite Julia saying that she was willing to make a statement and to press charges.</p>
	<p>After two days of relentless ringing of the police and getting no action, Julia and Frank visited Newbury police station, where they were referred to the domestic violence unit. Julia was advised to take civil action to secure an injunction preventing Alan from entering the family home or communicating with her, with a power of arrest, which she did. The domestic violence co-ordinator wrote a letter in support of that action, in which she stated, with reference to the wills being left out:</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;In all my experience as Domestic Violence Co-ordinator I have not come across such a cruel act. I have flagged Julia's address to the effect that&mdash;any incidents from or to the house are to be treated urgently.&quot;</p>
	<p>That did not happen. Julia was informed that, if she made a 999 call, even a silent one, the police would be with her within 10 minutes. Again, that did not happen. By failing to visit the house, Thames Valley police failed to witness evidence in situ, so failing to give Julia the protection that she needed. There was no attempt to establish possible escape routes for Julia if Alan tried to enter the house, or to provide her with a safety plan.</p>
	<p>Over the next several months, Julia and members of the family continued to receive numerous threats from Alan Pemberton. In April 2003, Julia and her son William returned from holiday and found the locks of the house superglued. She and her brother Frank reported that incident to the police, who promised that Alan Pemberton would be interviewed. He was not, despite the fact that, as the only likely suspect, he was clearly in breach of the injunction with the power of arrest. The police did not visit the property to collect any evidence. New locks had been fitted since the courts ordered Alan's exit from the house, so the presence of his fingerprints would have been incriminating.</p>
	<p>A month later, Julia was told by the police that the case would not be pursued for lack of evidence and that the crime file was closed. That incident was never linked to the domestic violence unit, although Julia and Frank had repeatedly told the police of the injunction with the power of arrest in place and the death threats. Thames Valley police have since admitted that their handling of that incident was a failing on their part.</p>
	<p>In May 2003, an envelope was hand-delivered to Julia's house addressed to William. Enclosed was a copy of the affidavit that Julia had sworn to secure the injunction. There were several menacing threats scrawled across the affidavit in Alan's handwriting, giving further evidence of his intentions. After seeking legal advice, Julia and her brother Frank delivered the affidavit to Newbury police station and explained the history of death threats, the glued locks and the injunction with the power of arrest in place. They made it very clear to the officer on duty how important that threatening document was, and Frank asked that it be reported to Sergeant Downing, to whom he had reported the original death threats.</p>
	<p>Frank phoned the police after they had left the station, but it fell on deaf ears. Yet again, the police failed to respond appropriately to that third piece of serious evidence. As it is highly likely that Alan had delivered the affidavit to the house, it was a likely further breach of the injunction. It was also evidence of the continuing threatening behaviour of Alan Pemberton, which itself breached the injunction. The family had understood that any breaking of the injunction had to result in an arrest. I should be grateful if the Minister could clarify that.</p>
	<p>Alan did not receive a response from the family, so he personally gave another copy of that document to William, who was aged 16. It is surprising that, as well as not addressing the abuse that Julia suffered, the police seemingly did not consider the seriousness of involving a child in the matter. The police have no record of having received the document, which, after the murders, was found in the closed glued-locks file. However, it took the family to tell the police of the existence of that evidence. Thames Valley police conceded that officers should have visited Alan Pemberton after seeking such evidence and that a lack of basic investigative skills existed. The police claim that they cannot identify the officer who took delivery of the document, despite a very particular description having been given by Frank Mullane.</p>
	<p>In June 2003, Julia met the domestic violence co-ordinator. A panic alarm was subsequently installed in her home. She told the co-ordinator about the ongoing situation, the incidents involving the locks and the affidavit but, yet again, no action was taken to tackle Alan. That was a failure by the police, who should have done more to protect Julia. In terms of preventing a crime in the case, there was a complete disregard of the repeat victimisation suffered by Julia Pemberton; inadequate monitoring of the case; appalling information handling; a lack of supervision of the domestic violence co-ordinator; no training given to domestic violence co-ordinators; and a failure to use any of the available legislation, including that on the breach of injunction and the Protection from Harassment Act 1997.</p>
	<p>More significant was the failure of Thames Valley police to recognise the seriousness of domestic violence and to implement an effective policy. That should have happened following Home Office guidelines issued in 1990&mdash;13 years earlier; surely enough time for them to be implemented, especially when they were reinforced by further guidelines in 2000. Instead, two sets of strong recommendations for a proactive approach to domestic violence incidents through arrest, investigation and recording, which were produced to protect the public, were ignored. Instead, for Thames Valley police, the co-ordinator's role was purely one of liaison, but it should have been more.</p>
	<p>Thames Valley police have tried partly to excuse the failure to investigate the crimes by saying that they have a highly inexperienced force. The family are rightly appalled that the obvious failure to educate and to train officers appropriately should be dismissed so easily. It is shocking that, pre-July 2003, the police authority did not have any domestic violence policy at all. Thames Valley police have told us that they are revising their domestic violence policy. I have seen evidence of that and I welcome it, but concerns remain.</p>
	<p>For example, the new policy will include a risk assessment. Although they have since changed their view, the police's first assessment to the family was that, even under the new policy, Alan Pemberton may not have been classified as high-risk. That statement is shocking, as a domestic violence co-ordinator had already marked the risk as having escalated, so that all incidents to and from the house would be treated urgently. If the new risk assessment model would not have unquestionably classified Alan Pemberton as high-risk, one questions the effectiveness of the entire policy.</p>
	<p>I share the family's concerns about the slowness with which lessons on domestic violence are being learned by Thames Valley police. The family and I have pushed the police to find out what went wrong and to learn lessons from these tragedies. We are concerned that domestic violence has not been taken seriously by past and present chief constables. Home Office research indicates that an apparent lack of direction and managerial commitment to domestic violence results in a marginalisation of domestic violence work. That was the case up to and including November 2003, and we have no confidence that the situation has changed.</p>
	<p>Julia Pemberton was thoroughly disillusioned with the police response. As a health visitor, she was a member of the local domestic violence forum, but she was shocked to find out first-hand the true nature of policing in this area. She was left to take out a private injunction, was advised to move&mdash;an impractical option for her at the time&mdash;and was told to have an aromatherapy bath and relax. One can imagine her feelings&mdash;that utterly trivialised a threat to kill. If what happened were not, literally, deadly serious, it would be farcical.</p>
	<p>Julia reported to her friend, comparing that with the police response to a stolen bike:</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;when my son's bike was stolen two police officers turned up at my door. When my husband threatened to kill me, no one was there to help.&quot;</p>
	<p>To add further insult to the family, 10 months after she died, Thames Valley police sent Julia a customer satisfaction survey.</p>
	<p>On 18 November 2003, Alan Pemberton arrived at Julia's house, ostensibly to take William for a driving lesson. When Julia heard sounds of commotion outside, she called the police. Her 16-minute 999 call described her fear for her and her son's lives. She reported several gun shots and pleaded for help. The transcript, read out at the inquest, left out crucial parts of the call. During the call, Julia was asked repeatedly to give her address. She sought advice on whether to run or stay, and was told to stay hidden. She questioned why it was taking the police so long to arrive, and was told that police were on their way &quot;now&quot;. Perhaps a minute before she died, she was even led to believe that they were outside the house. She was told to stop screaming and shouting.</p>
	<p>Julia was asked to give directions to her house. It took between 10 and 12 minutes before the property was identified, despite the fact that it was flagged on the police computer and that previously Julia had been told that even a silent 999 call would be responded to urgently. It is sickening to think of how Julia must have felt when it dawned on her&mdash;as it clearly did&mdash;that, despite repeated police promises of a fast response if she ever rang 999, they did not even know where she lived.</p>
	<p>Of course, Julia was not allowed to know that the firearms policy at the time appeared to exclude the option of immediate attendance to firearms incidents. We have heard differing police dispatch times. The first response was unarmed, and left 24 minutes&mdash;not, as she had been led to expect, 10 minutes&mdash;from the start of the call. It took 24 minutes for an unarmed team to be dispatched. By then, William had been shot five times, and Julia four times.</p>
	<p>That unarmed team dispatched to locate the property arrived to see William's body on the drive. In an incredible act of bravery, and contrary to Thames Valley police policy, the three officers&mdash;Hadley, Ainsley and Blackburn&mdash;attempted to help William. The family have thanked those officers and I join them. However, the irony is that the officers who stand out as having done everything, and more, that the family could have expected from the police, were the ones who breached the police's policy.</p>
	<p>What Julia needed was a firearms response, but it was more than one hour after she picked up the phone before the first armed response arrived outside the grounds. Armed units did not enter the house for almost seven hours, despite the fact that no sounds from it had been heard for more than six hours. Instead of going directly to the house, armed units were sent to a remote rendezvous point, and further problems were caused by poor communication among the police. The wrong silver commander was initially called, with the correct one not called for more than an hour after the start of the 999 call. When the silver commander finally arrived, he moved the rendezvous point and did not take command until three hours and 26 minutes after the call started.</p>
	<p>During that time, it was not known whether Julia was dead or alive. The police priority was to preserve the lives of officers rather than the lives of victims. The police justified their lack of action by saying that it was not known whether Alan was still in the house and therefore a danger to the police or the public, even though no noise had been heard by anybody after 7.40 pm, 13 minutes after Julia's call had ended.</p>
	<p>The police have now recognised that their firearms policy was over-cautious. The review of their firearms policy as a result of a similar tragedy at Highmoor means that they may now intervene more quickly and go directly to the house, which is what Julia needed. However, it is critical that future victims are given a true estimate of armed response arrival and, more importantly, whether the police will enter the house on arrival. It is not acceptable that a victim who is relying completely on the advice as they consider their options is told lies, leading them to make potentially fatal choices.</p>
	<p>I turn now to events subsequent to the murders. After the family had an initial meeting with the police, the police refused to meet them again until after the coroner's hearing. That gave the family no option but to put their lives and grieving on hold while they tried to comprehend what had happened. I had to wait months for even a reply to my first letter to the chief constable formally asking for a meeting.</p>
	<p>There are still lessons to be learned from the case, including on action in response to threats of violence and the advice on escape routes and police response times that is given to domestic violence victims. I hope that the Minister will see the necessity of a full homicide review, so that all the issues can be examined and learned from. I realise that he does not have the powers to insist on such a review, but I hope that he will be willing to raise it.</p>

	<p>I congratulate my hon. Friend on the conscientious way in which she has pursued the case and supported the family's quest for an inquiry. Has she had an opportunity to note section 9 of the Domestic Violence, Crime and Victims Act 2004, which allows the Secretary of State to order a review of any domestic violence killing? The interesting point is that the provision does not seem to say that that is applicable only to deaths after the passage of the Act. It may be that the Secretary of State has the power to order Thames Valley police to order an inquiry.</p>

	<p>I thank my hon. and learned Friend for that intervention, and I hope that the Minister can clarify that point for us. The other lessons may also need to be referred to the Department for Constitutional Affairs, and I hope that the Minister will do so.</p>
	<p>In July 2003, Julia returned to the Reading court to have an injunction with a power of arrest renewed. In addition to her original affidavit, she had sworn a further two, detailing the ongoing threats and breaches of the injunction. However, the injunction was reduced to an undertaking. Julia accepted that because it avoided her having to go through a full hearing and because the police were aware of her situation and had installed a panic button. She was led to believe that Alan could be arrested, even without the stronger injunction.</p>
	<p>We can see how the law lets such people down: to avoid a traumatic hearing, protections weaken for victims. Under the Family Law Act 1996, it is clear that the courts should not accept an undertaking when the respondent has used or threatened to use violence, as happened in this case. I hope that the Minister can clarify how that happened and say what could be done to give people better protection through the process&mdash;in particular, whether the police should apply for the injunction rather than the victim.</p>
	<p>On the inquest, the first coroner appointed to the case had legally unacceptable connections with Alan but failed to exclude himself until the family threatened judicial review. I hope that that can be investigated. Even with the actual coroner, there were problems. There are different sorts of coroners' inquests. One has a narrow remit and the other a wider one, which is used if the coroner wants an investigation under article 2 of the European convention on human rights to establish system failure. In such article 2 cases, it is possible for more extensive inquiries to be made. Even if article 2 is not invoked, the coroner has a duty to be alert to the evidence presented and to adjourn if he finds any indication of system failure by an organ of the state. Any scent of system failure that might have contributed to a death should lead to the coroner adjourning the case.</p>
	<p>Initially, the family decided not to pursue article 2, because they wanted to minimise their trauma and they did not have access to all the information. For example, Thames Valley police refused to produce the command and control logs for the family until after the inquest, which prevented them and their solicitor from discovering some of the facts and the extent of the system failure.</p>
	<p>At a preliminary hearing in May 2003, the police defended any moves by the coroner to include witnesses that might indicate that he was widening the interest parameters. The police's attitude can be summed by the words of the barrister at the inquest, who described the gluing of all external locks, which should have been taken seriously as a reason to question Alan Pemberton, as nothing more than &pound;150 worth of damage&mdash;in other words, an accounting entry.</p>
	<p>The family submitted to the coroner before the inquest a statement reminding him of his duty to consider article 2, but it was clear that he had no intention of pursuing that. Yet, as the inquest progressed, it was apparent that there were ample indications of system failure. The Highmoor case, which showed that police firearms policy was over-cautious, was well known to the police by the time of the inquest and should again have been a reason to look at system failure.</p>
	<p>The coroner accepted far too lightly the delays in the police response on the night, suggesting that, for the first dispatch, if one deducts the time of the call, the time delays were less serious. That is crazy, given that the police want victims to stay on the line. The comment that</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;The only way . . . Julia Pemberton's life could have been saved would have been if she had had armed police escort throughout the time that she believed she was at risk&quot;</p>
	<p>makes a mockery of the police's duty to protect and preserve life. The coroner failed to pick up glaring contradictions given by the Thames Valley police officers at the hearing, which revealed the further need to review the case. These inconsistencies should have given rise to serious questions as to what happened.</p>
	<p>The coroner showed a total lack of compassion and sensitivity towards the family of Julia and William Pemberton and in particular to Laura, the surviving daughter. He expressed no acknowledgement of the family's grief and offered no words of encouragement to Laura. Perhaps most revealing was when he remarked that William could not have done something to deserve being shot, implying that Julia did. In view of all those failings I hope that the Minister will agree to get that behaviour looked at, to consider a homicide review of the whole case and to look at how injunctions need to be dealt with in future.</p>
	<p>This is about the two people who are killed every week in this country from domestic violence. I hope that the Minister will also agree that an apology is due to the family from the police and the coroner. It would be a comfort to this grieving family to know that their unstinting work has achieved something for others who might otherwise face the trauma that Julia and William faced on that horrific night and in the months that led up to those fatal moments.</p>

	<p>My hon. Friend the Member for South Swindon (Ms Drown) will appreciate that by outlining the case in great detail she has not left me much time to respond, but I will do so as fully as I can. May I begin by congratulating her on bringing the tragic case of Julia and William Pemberton to the attention of the House this afternoon? I join with my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Redcar (Vera Baird) in paying tribute to the way she has pursued the issue and others in this place on behalf of her constituents. It is important when we develop policy that we do so in a way that is informed by cases such as this tragic one, so that we get our policies right and make them more effective.</p>
	<p>It was concern about precisely this kind of tragic case that gave the momentum to the legislation which my hon. and learned Friend mentioned, the Domestic Violence, Crime and Victims Act, which it was my privilege last year to take through the House. It received Royal Assent in November. There are some relevant measures within that Act which I hope will give my hon. Friend some reassurance.</p>
	<p>There are two main messages. The first is to victims of domestic violence: the Government and the law are on their side and they can expect that the law will move more swiftly to their aid. Just as important, the message to the perpetrators of domestic violence is that their behaviour will no longer be tolerated and that if they persist in that behaviour they will feel the full weight and force of the law as it bears down upon them.</p>
	<p>It might be helpful if I mentioned some specific measures in the Act that are relevant. First, it makes common assault an arrestable offence. That means that it will now be a police matter whether to arrest when called out to a domestic violence incident when there has been an assault. In other words, there will no longer be the burden on the victim to press charges. Secondly, it criminalises the breach of a non-molestation order and changes the law, so that the police can always arrest for breach. Where a non-molestation order has been issued, breaching it will always be a criminal offence and therefore will attract the power of arrest. Again, that shifts the burden of responsibility for enforcement from the victim to the criminal justice system.</p>
	<p>I hope that my hon. Friend is reassured that the new power addresses one of the key points that she raised. In other words, the power of arrest will automatically be attached to every breach of an order. She mentioned the specific case involving Julia. The problem seems to have been that the order was downgraded to an undertaking and that her understanding of what that undertaking meant in terms of the power of arrest was not actually what could happen. We must ensure as we go forward that everyone&mdash;the police and the courts&mdash;are clearer about the new powers that exist.</p>
	<p>We are extending the availability of restraining orders to cover all violent offences. Following any violent incident, courts will now have the power to issue a restraining order against a perpetrator or potential perpetrator. We are also introducing local multi-agency homicide reviews. During 2005, we shall commence the introduction of homicide reviews for all domestic violence-related homicides, so that local agencies can learn lessons and adjust their policies and procedures accordingly. I shall say a little more about that in a moment.</p>
	<p>I know that my hon. Friend has a specific concern about whether there could be a domestic homicide review in relation to this case. She acknowledged&mdash;indeed, my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Redcar made it clear&mdash;that there are new provisions for domestic homicide reviews to take place. We are developing guidance on that. The reviews will not be mandatory. We want them to be light-touch investigations that improve practice, so that local agencies can make the necessary changes, but there will be a reserve power for the Secretary of State to order such a review if there is a lack of willingness and it is considered necessary for that to take place.</p>
	<p>My understanding is that there is not a power for that to be operated retrospectively, but given that the issue has been raised this afternoon, it will need further clarification. My noble Friend Baroness Scotland will meet my hon. Friend and members of the family in the near future. I hope that, by the time that that meeting takes place, we can be clear on whether there is a retrospective power. I do not believe that there is that power, but I undertake to provide clarity on that. Having said that, there would be nothing to prevent the local agencies from deciding to conduct such a review themselves. Already in certain parts of the country and certainly in London on occasion, the agencies voluntarily agree to undertake a review. It is a deeply serious point that we should learn from every tragedy wherever we can.</p>
	<p>My hon. Friend will understand that, although we all look forward to the introduction of the important measures in the Domestic Violence, Crime and Victims Act, the question whether there is a retrospective power will need further clarification. She will also understand that, although I have responsibility for the law and policy in relation to coroners services, I do not carry the authority to discipline coroners or to take any view about their conduct. That is a matter for the Lord Chancellor and the Department for Constitutional Affairs, but I will draw to the Lord Chancellor's attention the comments that she has made this afternoon.</p>
	<p>The 2004 Act will give us new powers to ensure that the victim in cases of domestic violence is better protected, but in the end we are trying to change the culture&mdash;the custom and practice&mdash;so that all criminal justice agencies operate with the interests of victims of domestic violence at the heart of everything that they do. Domestic violence homicide reviews will help to change the culture, as will the more certain powers that we have, but we must make it clear that the victim is our top priority.</p>

	<p>I am grateful for the opportunity to debate this very serious issue, which will become an increasing problem when the Clean Neighbourhoods and Environment Bill is eventually passed. I am delighted to see that the Solicitor-General is present and I welcome her to the debate. We have had one or two exchanges across the Floor of the House, but this is our first opportunity to consider the issue in depth.</p>
	<p>My starting point is the excellent explanatory notes that the Government prepared in readiness for the debates on that Bill, which has been revised and is due to receive its Second Reading in the House of Lords. Paragraph 303 on page 43 of the explanatory notes states:</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;The Bill contains a number of new reverse burdens of proof (which means that, to take advantage of a defence provided, the accused is required to demonstrate his innocence once the prosecution has proved certain facts, rather than the prosecution being required to prove the accused's guilt on all issues). A reverse burden can be legal, where the burden is on the accused to prove that the defence applies to him on a balance of probabilities, or evidential, where the accused must bring sufficient evidence for the defence to be an issue, and then the prosecution must disprove the defence.&quot;</p>
	<p>I pause momentarily to remind you, Mr. Deputy Speaker, and the House that I am a Scottish advocate, albeit a non-practising one. My recollection of environmental crimes incurring a reverse burden of proof some 20 years ago is rather hazy, so studying the Bill, other legislation and some of the court cases has provided an opportunity to update my knowledge.</p>
	<p>My worst fears were confirmed during the remaining stages of the Clean Neighbourhoods and Environment Bill, including Third Reading, on 21 February this year. The Minister for Rural Affairs and Local Environmental Quality, who led for the Government at that stage and though all the stages of the Bill, intervened on me to clarify the position. He said:</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;If people do not like the fixed penalty notice, they do not have to pay the penalty, but they must then go to court and marshal their defence at that point.&quot;</p>
	<p>I understand from questions that the Solicitor-General has replied to that it will not be for the Crown Prosecution Service to prosecute environmental crimes under the Bill, or any other environmental crimes; it will be for the local authorities to do so. However, there was confirmation from the Minister for Rural Affairs and Local Environmental Quality that the accused will have to go to court to prove their innocence and incur considerable expense in the process. That alarmed not just me, but my right hon. Friend the Member for Suffolk, Coastal (Mr. Gummer), who said on that occasion:</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;The worry about fixed penalty notices is that, if they are issued willy-nilly, people are put in an extremely difficult position in deciding whether they should go through all the hassle of going to court and many people will therefore give way. We want to ensure that fixed penalty notices are not issued without due care, and I understand that that is what new clause 6 is supposed to do.&quot;&mdash;[<i>Official Report</i>, 21 February 2005; Vol. 431, c. 49.]</p>
	<p>Some concern about the reverse burden of proof was expressed in relation to other legislation. I refer in particular to the passage of the Criminal Justice and Police Bill in 2000&ndash;01. I do not have the <i>Official Report</i> reference, so I shall refer to an excellent note prepared for me by the House of Commons Library, quoting research paper number one of 10. It refers in particular to the concerns that the civil liberties pressure group, Liberty, expressed. Those concerns are as valid as the arguments that I present to the Solicitor-General this afternoon. Liberty is quoted as saying:</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;We are concerned that these provisions are a further manifestation of the trend to mix criminal and civil law procedures. This dilutes the principles and protections of criminal law in particular the presumption of innocence and the burden of proof. Although these procedures will not attract a criminal conviction, they relate to behaviour that is by definition criminal and can lead to a criminal conviction if a penalty is not accepted.&quot;</p>
	<p>The quotation continues:</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;We are particularly concerned that a penalty can be issued if an officer has reason to believe a penalty offence has been committed (Cl. 2(1)). This is a lesser standard than the criminal burden of proof.</p>
	<p class="indent">If a person provided with the notice goes to court to protest his or her innocence rather than pay the fine, the burden of proof the police will be expected to establish is beyond reasonable doubt. The practical implications of this are that there will undoubtedly be a large number of people challenging these notices, causing not only the administrative burden of issuing fixed penalty notices, but also upon the courts.&quot;</p>
	<p>I hope that the Solicitor-General will address some specific points in her response. The Library note on the reverse burden of proof prepared for me for today's debate has confirmed one point. We are all aware of the most recent court cases&mdash;namely, the House of Lords decision in Sheldrake in 2004 and R <i>v. </i>Johnson in 2003&mdash;and the Court of Appeal guidance on reverse burdens in the Attorney-General's reference No. 1 in 2004. Since the Human Rights Act 1998 was passed, we have seen an increasing commitment from this Government to reverse burdens of proof. According to the House of Commons Library note, as the use of reverse burdens grew, one difficulty was that draftsmen of parliamentary legislation did not always make clear whether defendants were to bear the legal burden of proof or an evidential burden. Since the Human Rights Act came into force, with section 3 requiring courts in so far as it is possible to interpret legislation in a way that is compatible with the convention rights, the new feature has seen the possibility of reading down legislation in cases where putting the legal burden on a defendant would be incompatible with convention rights, but putting the evidential burden on him might not be.</p>
	<p>Those people who do not wish to express or recognise any guilt for offences&mdash;quite serious environmental crimes, which we all agree must be routed out&mdash;will increasingly have no alternative if they wish to proclaim their innocence but to refuse to pay the fixed penalty notice and go to court. There is concern that that will put a lot of pressure on the court system and that it may not be able to cope.</p>
	<p>One aspect of the law that should have been addressed in the Clean Neighbourhoods and Environment Bill was not. I am referring to farmers or landowners who have vast tracts of land, often do not have the time to visit all of it, and who are the innocent recipients of waste that is dumped on their land. It could be hazardous waste, toxic waste, chemical waste or building waste. If the land is privately owned, the Environment Agency is charged with removing the waste at taxpayers' expense. However, the landowner is deemed guilty of an environmental crime. That will come into force under the Bill. It is currently before the House of Lords, so it could still be amended, except that it will be considered only on Second Reading, and not in Committee or on Report because of the timing of the general election.</p>
	<p>It seems that there is a huge imbalance. An environmental crime has been perpetrated wilfully by an individual, but the onus of removing the waste is placed on an innocent party. I think that the phrase used is that it will be their decision whether or not they remove that waste and, if they do, it will be at their expense.</p>
	<p>The only remedy that the innocent party will have under the new provisions in the Bill is that the police can catch and prosecute the perpetrator and then the cost to the landowner of removing the waste could be recovered. That was always our stance and we are delighted that the Government have adopted our position by making fly-tipping an arrestable offence. I welcome the opportunity to place on the record our worries and, hopefully, I shall receive a positive response from the Solicitor-General.</p>
	<p>I think that the Solicitor-General said that, over the past six years, there has not been much opportunity to count the number of cases. The House of Commons Library has said that it would take substantial research to go through all the legislation. We are told that, in 1996, 219 examples of legal burdens or presumptions operating against a defendant were found in 540 offences that were triable in the Crown court. It said that, since then, no proper research has been carried out into such matters. However, for the purposes of this afternoon's debate, the Solicitor-General might have undertaken such research. We regret the drift towards the reverse burden of proof. We envisage a situation in which we shall rely much more on a party proving his innocence through no other means than by his having to go to court.</p>
	<p>Let us consider the even more regrettable situation in which an innocent landowner is left with the task of removing waste that has been dumped on his land without his permission. Such serious environmental crimes are covered under the Clean Neighbourhoods and Environment Bill. I hope that that the Government will table amendments to clarify the position and to make sure that the situation that we envisage can be stopped in its tracks.</p>

	<p>I thank the hon. Member for Vale of York (Miss McIntosh) for choosing this matter for debate, giving me the opportunity to discuss in detail a subject that has gone backwards and forwards between us in both written and oral questions and answers. It is a good opportunity for the hon. Lady to identify the full extent of her worries and for me to set out our principles and try to reassure her about such matters.</p>
	<p>I wish to set out broadly the Government's approach and cite some examples, so that we can be clear about the starting point from which we are moving forward. The hon. Lady has obviously given the matter a great deal of close scrutiny, and I will look at the detailed points that she has raised. Obviously, I share her concern&mdash;I am sure that all Members would&mdash;about ensuring a presumption against reverse burden. It is in the DNA of us all to support the expectation that someone is innocent until proven guilty, and the responsibility should be on the prosecution, whether that is the local authority or the Crown Prosecution Service, to prove guilt.</p>
	<p>Of course there have been, and are, exceptions to that, but the question put was whether there are many of them. With respect, I am not sure that I approach the issue in the same way. I do not think that one can quantify unfairness; the question is whether each individual measure is unfair. There cannot be a general climate of unfairness. If there is a reverse burden in both an environmental Bill and a completely different Bill, that does not add together to make unfairness. One must be satisfied that each and every provision is not unfair. So I do not accept the quantity point.</p>
	<p>Also, I am not entirely sure whether there has been an increase or decrease at any stage. I think that the hon. Lady is saying that there is a trend of increased reverse burdens. Even if she is right about that, I do not think that it is necessarily a problem. However, I am not sure that she is right, because no one has counted, but I think that they will start counting after today's debate, as it is an interesting point.</p>
	<p>When we make law in the House, we need to be sure that it is right in principle, that it is intellectually coherent, and that it works in practice in dealing with the problem that the legislation attempts to address. We would expect that in every bit of legislation, whether primary or secondary.</p>
	<p>I am not at all as familiar with the Vale of York as the hon. Lady, but in my constituency issues of reverse burdens have not caused a problem. I know that she has a different relationship with environmental offences because of her constituency, and I will mention that later; but, generally speaking, I do not have a problem with constituents coming to see me&mdash;which they do in large numbers&mdash;feeling that somehow it is put on them to prove that they were not in the wrong and committing an offence. I do not see any constituency evidence that the issue causes a problem in the way that the hon. Lady identifies.</p>

	<p>Obviously I do not know a great deal about the right hon. and learned Lady's constituency either, but I would imagine that Camberwell and Peckham is deeply urban. My constituency is deeply rural. I have limited my remarks primarily to environmental crimes, but there are seven other examples of the trend in primary legislation that I would like to share with her after today for her further information. However, on these environmental crimes, the point is that the Government have signed up to EU directives, and now there is nowhere for the waste to go. That has made placing it on privately owned land too attractive.</p>

	<p>We do not have vast stretches of countryside in my constituency, but we have plenty of fly-tippers, and plenty of people with loads of tyres on the back of lorries that they want to dump somewhere. So we are familiar with some of the issues, although perhaps on a different scale. I will get to that point in a moment.</p>
	<p>I shall start with the general principle. The majority of criminal offences require the prosecution to prove all elements of the offence to the criminal standard&mdash;that is, beyond reasonable doubt. The principle that a person is innocent until proved guilty has always been a foundation of our common law; that principle is now reinforced by the direct application of article 6 of the European convention on human rights to the UK following the introduction of the Human Rights Act 1998. So, any unfairness that might otherwise have required people to wait to get all the way to Strasbourg can be judged right now in domestic court proceedings.</p>
	<p>However there are a number of offences, some of long standing, where the burden of proof relating to some issues may be transferred to the defendant. These typically arise where an exception is provided and the accused must demonstrate that he falls within it, or where there is some excusing circumstance of which only the accused has knowledge. Those are typically the two bases.</p>
	<p>Where the burden is transferred to the defendant, it may be a legal or an evidential burden, depending on the intention of the legislation. A reverse legal burden requires the defendant to discharge the burden but to the lower standard of the balance of probabilities. An evidential burden requires only that a defendant raise an issue in evidence, and once properly raised it falls back on to the prosecutor to disprove the matter beyond reasonable doubt.</p>
	<p>The Court of Appeal and the House of Lords have considered the circumstances in which reverse legal burdens will be found to be reasonable and proportionate on a number of occasions since the implementation of the Human Rights Act 1998. They have identified a number of principles to be applied in considering whether a reverse legal burden will be compatible with article 6(2), most recently, as the hon. Lady said, in the case of Sheldrake. In that case, the House of Lords confirmed that the European convention on human rights does not outlaw presumptions of fact or law but requires that they should be kept within reasonable limits and should not be arbitrary. That has to apply not in the generality but to each and every specific offence that we are considering. The effect of the court's decision is that the overall burden of proving the offence should remain on the prosecution and that the trial of the issue should be fair. A reverse burden will be deemed compatible only so long as it is in pursuit of a legitimate aim, it is justified and it is proportionate to the overall aim of the legislation.</p>
	<p>A simple example with which the hon. Lady will be familiar is the case of a defendant stopped in public while carrying a bladed article. Under the Criminal Justice Act 1988 he has a defence if he can show that he had it in a public place for a good reason: for example, he is a carpet fitter on his way to work. The courts have found that the reverse legal burden on the defendant to prove that good reason on the balance of probabilities is fair and proportionate. The defendant is in the best position in that sort of case to prove that he had a good reason, and the prosecution continues to bear the burden of proving all the other elements of the offence: the fact of possession, the fact that the defendant was in a public place and the fact that there was a bladed article.</p>
	<p>One environmental example, which has been found to be compatible with the ECHR, is the offence of fly-posting under the Town and Country Planning Act 1990. That offence is intended to tackle the problem of businesses fly-posting walls, advertising hoardings and other street furniture with posters advertising their event. The offence has a reverse burden in that a person is guilty of this offence if he is the owner of the land covered by the posters or if it is his business that is being advertised, unless he can prove that the posters were being displayed without his consent or knowledge.</p>
	<p>That reverse burden was supported by the courts recently in the case of Savvas. The Court of Appeal found that there was a reverse burden of proof in relation to knowledge and consent. To place a reverse burden of proof on persons whose business was promoted by fly-posting was determined to be reasonable and proportionate, as it was in the public interest, the exception was easy for the accused to prove, and of course, it was only on the balance of probabilities.</p>
	<p>I understand that the hon. Lady may have some concerns, which she has expressed, about the reverse burdens of proof in the Clean Neighbourhoods and Environment Bill, which she indeed raised on Report. The central purpose of the Bill is to improve the local environment that directly affects people's quality of life wherever they live. It provides enhanced powers for local authorities and the Environment Agency to tackle local environmental quality and antisocial behaviour. I mention that because those reverse burdens do not arise in a vacuum; they are about remedying a problem through legislation. As well as having to be fair, they must be proportionate to the problem that is to be addressed.</p>
	<p>The Bill contains reverse burdens of proof for a number of offences, and I will explain some of the reasons behind this in a minute. However, before I do, I should stress that this Bill has been, and will continue to be, subject to the usual checks and balances to ensure that it does not contravene the ECHR. The Bill has passed through the House of Commons and is currently waiting for its Second Reading in the Lords. The Joint Committee on Human Rights has published the results of its consideration of the Bill, stating that it accepted</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;the statement in the Explanatory Notes that the new reverse burdens in the Bill are compatible with the presumption of innocence in Article 6(2) ECHR&quot;.</p>
	<p>So, it has been given a clean bill of health by that Committee.</p>
	<p>My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs signed a statement confirming that the Bill is compatible with the European convention on human rights, as did Lord Whitty of Camberwell for the purposes of the Bill's introduction in the House of Lords. The Government consulted extensively for two years on many of the Bill's measures and no complaints about reverse burdens were registered with the Government by groups such as Liberty, with which there has been an exchange of correspondence. Indeed, the Minister for Rural Affairs and Local Environmental Quality offered Liberty a meeting if it had any concerns, and it did not take that offer up. If it has concerns&mdash;or if the hon. Lady's concerns are the same as its concerns&mdash;there is no reason why such a meeting should not take place. The Bill is not something that has not been examined and thought through.</p>
	<p>Some of the reverse burdens in the Clean Neighbourhoods and Environment Bill slightly amend or improve existing reverse burdens introduced by the then Government in the Environmental Protection Act 1990 and the Town and Country Planning Act 1990. Appropriate reverse burdens have been around in environment legislation in relation to fly-tipping, litter control notices and fly-posting for some time.</p>
	<p>I am aware, however, of two new examples of reverse burdens on nuisance vehicles in the Bill, which I understand the hon. lady queried on Report in the House of Commons. Clauses 3 and 4 of the Bill make it an offence to sell two or more cars on the same road as part of a business or to repair a vehicle on the road as part of a business. That is something we know about in Camberwell and Peckham&mdash;I say that with some feeling.</p>
	<p>A person cannot be found guilty by the courts of those two offences if the defence proves to the satisfaction of the court that he or she was not selling or repairing the vehicles as part of a business. Those two clauses therefore create a legal reverse burden of proof, as the defendant is required to prove something to avoid being found guilty. However, the prosecution first has to prove that the defendant had two cars on sale for the question of a defence to arise in the first place.</p>
	<p>The offences are targeting the rogue trader, not the private seller. Two or more vehicles being advertised for sale on the same road suggests the presence of a business venture. Local authorities have told us they have great difficulty in proving that an individual is acting in the course of a business when the transaction occurs in the street. In the unlikely case of a private seller selling two or more vehicles, it would be easy for them to prove through Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency documentation that the vehicles were registered in their own or their family's name and that it just so happened that the vehicles were being sold at the same time. It is easily proved through the DVLA that such vehicles are being sold and that such people are not traders trading on behalf of someone else.</p>
	<p>The burden of proof is not on the basis of beyond reasonable doubt but on the basis of the balance of probabilities. That is a common-sense approach, particularly when the alternative is considered. That would be far more invasive; to put the burden on the prosecution would require intrusive powers to be given, for example, to examine paperwork or bank accounts. It is more humane to the defendant to say, &quot;Well, you produce the information,&quot; rather than to say, &quot;We are coming in to get it&quot;. It makes it cheaper for local authorities.</p>
	<p>The hon. Lady might also be interested to know a cross-departmental group on ECHR issues in criminal law meets every two months. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, the Environment Agency and the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister are represented on that group. A sub-group examines reverse burdens. So, a machinery of Government incarnation addresses her preoccupations. It constantly examines what the courts are saying and seeks to ensure both that such things are being kept track of and that whenever the courts say something, we ensure that we comply with it.</p>
	<p>The hon. Lady talked briefly about mixing criminal and civil law procedures together. So long as we have the right safeguards, we should not be hung up about which jurisdiction is involved. We just want the law to make common sense for people, for it to be fair and for it to address the problem that presents itself. I am sure that it would be useful if she had a meeting with the Minister for Rural Affairs and Local Environmental Quality to discuss the issues further. I would also be happy to do so at any time.</p>
