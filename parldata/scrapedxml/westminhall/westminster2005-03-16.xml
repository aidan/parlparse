	<p pid=".71.1/1">Save the weather, probably not. I will look closely to see if there are any other issues. The agreement had a massive impact on the way in which the Government operated. That was why we made critical changes to structures, especially regarding accountability.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-03-16.71.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1195" speakername="Peter Robinson" colnum="71"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/cm050316/halltext/50316h01.htm#50316h01_spnew7">
	<p pid=".71.3/1"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1289" name="David Trimble">The right hon. Member for Upper Bann (Mr. Trimble)</phrase> is talking about the Belfast agreement. We were in the business of burying it, not changing it. He wants it to continue in its original form. However, I shall not be dragged in that direction.</p>
	<p pid=".71.3/2">The Minister will be aware that in July 2000, my permanent secretary, Ronnie Spence, and I met the then Minister of Finance and Personnel, Mr. Mark Durkan. We argued that the linkage between water and the regional rate should be retained. The DFP Minister and pro-agreement members of the Executive did not take my advice, as a result of which there was no identifiable way to show that the householders of Northern Ireland were paying for their water, and of course the Chancellor pounced. If the link had been maintained, the Treasury could not have ambushed us.</p>
	<p pid=".71.3/3">The short-term implication of the Treasury's decision was to remove any clear justification for an above-average increase in the rates, and the longer-term consequence was to allow the Chancellor to step in and press for water charging in Northern Ireland that was additional to the regional rate. At the meeting with Mark Durkan, I argued strongly against breaking the link for those reasons. I advanced such an argument on numerous occasions thereafter while I was in office, including directly with the then First Minister on <phrase class="date" code="2002-06-10">10 June 2002</phrase>. I also put my views on the public record. My position today is the position that I took privately and publicly and advocated while in office.</p>
	<p pid=".71.3/4">It is hardly surprising that people believe that they continue to pay for water through the regional rate, given that there was no reduction in the regional rate when the link was broken. That leads to the inescapable conclusion that, despite the visible link having been broken, people continue to pay for water services through their rates. Indeed, as there is no Barnett provision for water, the regional rate must bear the burden for water services.</p>
	<p pid=".71.3/5">When I was a Minister at the DRD, my view was straightforward, as my position on taxation has been throughout my political career. I have been in favour of the lowest possible taxes in exchange for quality services. I have followed such a policy at local government level and in the Northern Ireland Assembly. Indeed, my record at Castlereagh borough council and the DRD speaks for itself. I was opposed to the break between the regional rate and the funding of water services. When the Treasury demanded that Northern Ireland should have a separate water charge and become self-financing, I argued that that could be done by identifying, reflecting and separating the contributions towards water services that were already paid within the existing rates bill and reducing the remaining segment accordingly. Any increase would be required only to fund additional investment, which could be offset by the savings that officials told me were possible in the Water Service and the introduction of a developer's contribution.</p>
	<p pid=".71.3/6">It is interesting to see how some parties that took an opposing view at the time have repositioned themselves&mdash;resistance to higher taxation appears to be infectious for some when not in government, especially at election times. Only a few years ago, when wearing a different hat, someone who now voices opposition to higher taxation talked about</p>
	<p pid=".71.3/7" class="indent">&quot;necessary substantial increases in locally based revenue in the next few years&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".71.3/8">That was a statement by Mark Durkan in 2001. Others pointed out that we would have no credibility with the Treasury</p>
	<p pid=".71.3/9" class="indent">&quot;unless we accept that we have to address the level of local revenue.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".71.3/10">That is an Executive paper from the then First and Deputy First Ministers and the Minister of Finance and Personnel in 2002.</p>
	<p pid=".71.3/11">In a policy document on the subject, the Ulster Unionist party stated:</p>
	<p pid=".71.3/12" class="indent">&quot;It is widely recognised that Northern Ireland has the lowest household rates in the UK. Central Government is no longer prepared to sustain subvention at current 'Barnett' levels unless the Executive takes steps to address the rates imbalance with the rest of the United Kingdom. Water Charging is the largely accepted way of doing so.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".71.3/13">It will not be a surprise to note that that policy document seems to have been removed from the Ulster Unionist party website, for one reason or another.</p>
	<p pid=".71.3/14">The Social Democratic and Labour party, whose members are going around the Province campaigning against water charges, took a very different approach when it was in office. The SDLP Minister of Finance and Personnel, Sean Farren, spelled out his position in April 2002 when he said:</p>
	<p pid=".71.3/15" class="indent">&quot;while it may be unpalatable, we may also have to accept that if we want better public services here we will have to pay more for them . . . This will mean looking hard at the rates and at the financing of our water and sewerage services.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".71.3/16">There is some merit in putting on public record the advice that I offered the Executive on this matter in May 2002:</p>
	<p pid=".71.3/17" class="indent">&quot;I am open to better suggestions arising through the consultation process but it is hard not to recognise the advantage of Water Service costs being isolated as part of the Regional Rate bill with only the new infrastructure being charged additionally to the Ratepayer and then only if needed after savings have been made, from amongst other things, bureaucratic extravagance. This alternative offers a desirable outcome which (1) clearly identifies the source of income for water services; (2) provides for much needed additional funding for water infrastructure; (3) avoids having to unnecessarily burden the Ratepayer; and (4 ) enables hypothecation of revenues raised to fund Water Service&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".71.3/18">In such circumstances, there would be no substantial increase in local taxes, and the existing arrangements would be appropriate for assessing water charges.</p>
	<p pid=".71.3/19">Some local parties have been disingenuous about their approach, but I do not believe that the Government have been entirely straightforward on the issue, either. In support of the introduction of water charges, they put forward a number of arguments that, on examination, cannot be defended. The first is that people in Northern Ireland do not pay for their water. From my remarks earlier, it is clear that this argument cannot be sustained. Given that, to all intents and purposes, no money is given to fund water services in Northern Ireland by the Treasury, the only way that it can be paid for is by people in Northern Ireland through regional rates. The Government may argue that insufficient money is then spent on other public services in Northern Ireland, but they cannot argue that people do not pay for water.</p>
	<p pid=".71.3/20">The second Government argument is that this measure is required by EU law. That contention does not withstand scrutiny if one looks at the relevant EU directive, the water framework directive of 2000, which states:</p>
	<p pid=".71.3/21" class="indent">&quot;Member States shall ensure by 2010 that water-pricing policies provide adequate incentives for users to use water resources efficiently, and thereby contribute to the environmental objectives of this Directive.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".71.3/22">In the absence of compulsory metering, the Government's proposal does not provide adequate incentives to use water resources more efficiently. Indeed, if the water charge is based on the value of a person's home, there is no incentive whatever to use water efficiently, so it is clear that that cannot possibly be a real argument for bringing forward the type of charging suggested. I would ask the Government to reflect on the matter; the Republic of Ireland complies, or purports to deal, with the directive in a much more flexible way, as I think that the Minister would agree.</p>
	<p pid=".71.3/23">The third argument that the Government put forward is that people in Northern Ireland do not pay enough in local taxes. In my opinion that contention entirely misses the point. The level of local taxes in Northern Ireland has no impact on the rest of the United Kingdom. Self-evidently, the higher the local taxes, the more local spending power is available. Different council tax levels and varying levels of service apply in neighbouring councils in Great Britain, so why should there be some over-riding reason for the Government to decide this matter for the people of Northern Ireland?</p>
	<p pid=".71.3/24">Rate-capping may have been a feature in the past in Great Britain, but the notion of a minimum level seems somewhat novel; in fact, it is absurd. Where else would central Government be asking politicians to increase local taxes and shun efficiency? I have consistently argued, both in office and since then, that savings and efficiencies are a much better way to free-up resources for vital spending than unnecessarily raising rates and taxes.</p>
	<p pid=".71.3/25">All the arguments advanced by the Government are fundamentally misconceived. The only argument for a separate water charge turns on the implications of the new system of resource accounting. That was highlighted in the letter from the Chief Secretary to the Treasury to the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland in July 2002. The implications of not signing up to self-financing water services are likely, due to technical rules, to be damaging to our spending power in Northern Ireland. However, that is not an argument for higher taxation overall; it is only an argument for dividing and administering the existing level of payments differently.</p>
	<p pid=".71.3/26">Unless the Northern Ireland Executive makes a commitment to self-financing arrangements for water services, Northern Ireland will lose spending power, beginning with tens of millions of pounds each year and leading to hundreds of millions. I have always believed that it is important that the choices, and implications of those choices, should be put before the people of Northern Ireland. Indeed, as the Minister responsible I wrote as early as March 2002 to Sean Farron, the then Finance Minister, and stressed the importance of setting out the context and implications of the choice.</p>

	<p pid=".74.0/1">I thank the hon. Gentleman for giving way. I am glad to hear him refer to the impact of resource assessment budgeting. He is right to say that that is a significant factor. However, as I understand it, he is arguing that one digs out the hitherto hypothecated water element in the rates and brings it to a level that will provide self-sufficiency in water services. Does he accept that the implication of that is that the money hitherto raised through the regional rate that went into other services will no longer be available and he will find himself with less money for other services, or having to raise more money through the regional rate to fill the shortfall?</p>

	<p pid=".76.0/1">Yes, of course, I agree with that. It is somewhat unusual, is it not, for a Labour Government to be championing the cause of business against the individual consumer? Perhaps the fact that there are no Labour candidates in Northern Ireland has some impact on that position.</p>
	<p pid=".76.0/2">To return to the point I was making, essential weekly household expenditure would equate to 47.8 per cent., which would again widen the gap with the rest of the United Kingdom. The figures I have provided give a much more realistic sense of the impact of water charges than the bald comparisons of local tax levels. The GCC estimates that 169,926&mdash;or one in four households in Northern Ireland&mdash;are at risk of water-affordability and poverty problems. I hope that the Minister takes in that statistic and understands the hardship and anguish that it represents&mdash;one in four will suffer from water poverty.</p>
	<p pid=".76.0/3">Of even greater concern is the fact that 27 per cent. of households that are on housing benefit and receive rate rebate, which are currently protected from the cost of water in their rate bill, will have to pay water charges, albeit at a slightly reduced level. Whereas those people could escape the water charge while it was included in the regional rate, they cannot escape it under the Minister's proposals. Before the Government go much further with their current plan, it is critical that they think again about the impact of water charges on householders in Northern Ireland. To fail to do so would have serious consequences for Northern Ireland householders as well as the workability of the proposals.</p>
	<p pid=".76.0/4">Before Christmas, while the other parties posed and moaned about water charging and the threat of increased taxation, my colleagues and I attempted to do something about it. During the talks process leading to the Government's paper on a comprehensive agreement, we sought to address the issue on the basis that I set out earlier. Although the Government were not flexible on some aspects of our proposal, we were working towards an outcome that would have led to the Treasury agreeing to allow Northern Ireland to continue accessing the reinvestment and reform initiative borrowing facility while pegging the regional rate for the phasing-in period of the water charge.</p>
	<p pid=".76.0/5">The deal, which was in the final stages of negotiation but not completed, would have saved householders hundreds of pounds over the next few years, and involved freezing the regional rate, reducing the district rate by applying Barnett consequentials, and leaving the new Executive to apply whatever level of a resource element they determined to reduce further the district rate. In addition, we sought to lengthen from three to five years the phasing in of water charging. That would have further reduced its impact. The matter was still under negotiation when Sinn Fein, unable to adapt to democratic politics, walked away from the table. That meant that the conditions in which the Government would have activated the proposal were not realised.</p>
	<p pid=".76.0/6">Along with the proposal to set up a &pound;1 billion fund to tackle the ageing infrastructure, the Executive would have been well placed, after introducing efficiencies and developer contributions, to produce a much more acceptable way forward. It might not have been ideal in every respect, but within the constraints set by the Treasury, it represented a significantly better deal than the one presently being served up. I urge the Minister and the Government to pick up on those elements of our discussions, and I hope that rather than foisting this unbearable burden on the people of Northern Ireland, they might revise their existing plans.</p>

	<p pid=".79.3/1">The costing would have to be pro rata. There is no way of rating other than to have a pro rata system.</p>
	<p pid=".79.3/2">The water reform proposals currently under debate in the Province have not won either a consensus of political support, or support from consumer organisations or representative bodies. We are not time-limited. We need more debate, more information and more clarity, so that we can consider all the issues and try to come to an agreement as to the way forward. The matter was not agreed when the Executive were operational at Stormont; no progress was made then. I believe that it is sometimes right in politics not to rush ahead and make radical changes that will be regretted in years to come. We are limited by the EU directive to the year 2010. Let us have a longer and broader debate. There are options.</p>
	<p pid=".79.3/3">The Government's current proposals will not provide a secure financial basis for future funding without imposing additional increases on consumers, and subsequently increasing the numbers of those who cannot afford to pay. The water reform programme mistakenly places costs only on consumers. It ignores the &quot;polluter pays&quot; principle, as well as the Government's social responsibility to provide adequate protection to those who are vulnerable, as they have done in the recent rating review relief proposals. The Government must go back to the drawing board and look again fundamentally at their proposals.</p>

	<p pid=".80.2/1">I appreciate the opportunity to speak, and I am sorry that I was not here for the beginning of the debate but my flight from Belfast was delayed. I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1195" name="Peter Robinson">the Member for Belfast, East (Mr. Robinson)</phrase> on securing the debate on an issue that is very important to the Democratic Unionist party and, I know, to my constituents. As I have been going around in recent months talking to people, I have no doubt that there is widespread concern within the community about the introduction of water charges in Northern Ireland. We have debated the origins of that, but let me be absolutely clear in echoing what my hon. Friend said&mdash;that the DUP has consistently opposed the introduction of water charges in Northern Ireland. At no stage have we given our support to such a proposition, and we have very real concerns about the Government's proposals and the manner in which the Minister intends to implement the water charging system.</p>
	<p pid=".80.2/2">I was interested in what <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1356" name="David Burnside">the hon. Member for South Antrim (David Burnside)</phrase> said about the introduction of pro rata charging. When he was pressed by the Minister, he said that it would be based primarily on cost. I would point out to the hon. Gentleman that 80 per cent. of the cost is on infrastructure, and only 20 per cent. of the cost is on actual usage. We should be careful about going down that particular route, because we would end up with most of the water charge being a fixed-rate charge based on infrastructure and a very minimal percentage of the charge based on householders' actual usage.</p>
	<p pid=".80.2/3">As I talk to people about water charges, a number of concerns arise. I talk to pensioners living on their own, for example, who are very concerned about how they will be able to afford the additional levy. The Department has shown a degree of subterfuge in suggesting that it is time that Northern Ireland started paying for its water, like the rest of the United Kingdom. However, the reality is that we in the Province pay for our water through both the domestic and regional rate system. It is not correct to suggest that Northern Ireland does not pay for its water: we pay for actual usage by a distinct charge measured within the rates, and for the infrastructure through the regional rating system. Will there be a compensatory offset against the regional rate for the element that we already contribute for our water system in the Province if the Government proceed with the water charge against the will of the people of Northern Ireland and the wishes of Northern Ireland's political parties?</p>
	<p pid=".80.2/4">I accept that there is a need to invest in the water distribution system; there is no doubt that, over the years, the system has been neglected. A figure that is often quoted is that some 40 per cent. of the water supply leaks out of the system. Something should be done about that, and there will be a cost for it. However, I and the DUP are far from convinced that the Government's proposals in the form of water charging are the best, most effective or efficient way of charging.</p>
	<p pid=".80.2/5">Returning to the issue of householders, I mentioned pensioners living on their own. They are concerned that they will have to pay a water charge that will be equivalent, for example, to that paid by a family of three or four people living next door. There is a degree of unfairness about the Government's approach to water charging. Unless there is some means of measuring usage, it is very difficult to assess what individuals and households will actually use, and what a fair distribution of the cost will be. That is why water charges are not the best means of addressing the problem, if the problem is the need to invest in infrastructure, because it creates inequalities and a situation in which people feel that they are being treated unfairly.</p>

	<p pid=".82.1/1">I thank my hon. Friend for his intervention. He will be aware that during the negotiations before Christmas we proposed the establishment of an efficiency commission in Northern Ireland that would look at public expenditure across the whole ambit of public services in the Province, identify where savings could be made, and then apply those savings in terms of infrastructure improvements. That is why I believe that the Government are putting the cart before the horse; they are spending the money before we have saved the money and, instead of looking for efficiencies, they are imposing another tax on ratepayers in Northern Ireland that people feel is unfair and unjust.</p>

	<p pid=".82.2/1">The reason why I made my earlier point is that Water Voice and the other representative consumer organisations in the UK are not arguing against water charges per se, although there are questions about the rapid rises that have occurred, but for joined-up thinking to be rapidly developed between the Government and consumer organisations to address the question of affordability. Water UK makes the point that although we rightly focus on affordability:</p>

	<p pid=".83.1/1">I thank my hon. Friend for his helpful intervention.</p>
	<p pid=".83.1/2">We are a party of low taxation. We do not believe that taxation is the best means, on every occasion, of raising money for investment in infrastructure. I urge the Minister to think again about the proposal, because there is not widespread support for it in Northern Ireland. The Minister, who wears another hat and has responsibility for political development, has always upheld the principle that if we are to have something in Northern Ireland&mdash;whether in the political realm, or otherwise&mdash;there should be widespread community support for it. However, this Government continually impose on Northern Ireland policy initiatives, commissions and all kinds of things that are not representative of the community, do not reflect its views and are against people's wishes.</p>
	<p pid=".83.1/3">I urge the Minister to hold back, put the proposal on hold, allow the Assembly to consider the matter at greater length when it is reinstated, consider other areas where the water issue has been addressed, and see if greater efficiencies can be made in Government, leading to savings that could be invested in our infrastructure, including the water distribution network. It is wrong to proceed in this manner. I have no doubt that this issue will be prominent in Northern Ireland as we face a general election. The DUP's position is clear. We oppose the water charges and believe that the Minister should think again.</p>

	<p pid=".86.0/1">I certainly shall, Mr. Deputy Speaker.</p>
	<p pid=".86.0/2">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1195" name="Peter Robinson">the hon. Member for Belfast, East (Mr. Robinson)</phrase> on securing this debate and support the contributions made by the hon. Members for South Antrim (David Burnside), for Lagan Valley (Mr. Donaldson) and for Belfast, North (Mr. Dodds).</p>
	<p pid=".86.0/3">It is ironic that the Government spend so much time seeking consensus in Northern Ireland and then ignore it when they find it. It is disgraceful, for example, that tuition fees are being imposed despite the unanimous opposition from Opposition parties and all right hon. and hon. Members from Northern Ireland. The fact that the Government lost the vote on that issue in the Northern Ireland Grand Committee but carried on forcing tuition fees on the Province, makes people feel that the Government are more interested in imposing their political dogma than in listening to the democratic wishes of politicians and the public in Northern Ireland.</p>
	<p pid=".86.0/4">It seems that we are faced with exactly the same problem when it comes to water charging. Water privatisation in Northern Ireland is proving as iniquitous as the poll tax. As the Northern Ireland Assembly is suspended, Ministers in Westminster seem intent on introducing additional charges for water and sewerage services. As we have already heard, ratepayers in Northern Ireland already pay for water and sewerage services through their rates. The new charges would come on top of the payments made through the regional rate.</p>
	<p pid=".86.0/5">For all the reasons already outlined, it is obviously grossly unfair to expect the people of Northern Ireland to pay twice for the same services. They are being asked to pay for the decades of under-investment in the infrastructure under direct rule. Ratepayers are not responsible for the diversion of funds and the under-investment in infrastructure for 30 years.</p>

	<p pid=".86.5/1">There is consensus on the Opposition Benches&mdash;it is in opposing any charges on any one of their constituents, and I might do the same in Opposition. However, in other UK regions there has been massive investment in infrastructure and it has paid dividends. The question must be about affordability as opposed to the principle of where the charges should go, because people will have to pay them.</p>

	<p pid=".86.6/1">While investment in water and sewerage services is crucial, the people in Northern Ireland are not responsible for the under-investment. The Government's consultation has been a charade&mdash;a farce&mdash;that had a predetermined outcome. I do not accept the hon. Gentleman's position, because nobody in Northern Ireland is happy with what one could call the tap tax. It is unfair and will lead to some of the most vulnerable in society being unable to afford a basic human necessity. In direct response to him, I would say that the Government have tried to make a false comparison between what households in Northern Ireland pay and what those in Great Britain pay.</p>
	<p pid=".86.6/2">The Government tell people that the average English household pays a certain amount for its water, but they do not tell people that that is for privatised water and that the Government spent millions of pounds of taxpayers' funds to upgrade the system before selling it off. They ignore several facts. Household income in Northern Ireland is 19 per cent. below the UK average, nearly twice as many households there rely on benefit than in the rest of the UK&mdash;21 per cent. of households, compared with 12 per cent. of them&mdash;and Northern Ireland households also pay 26 per cent. more for fuel, light and power than the rest of the UK.</p>
	<p pid=".86.6/3">There need to be built-in safeguards to protect people whose water consumption is necessarily high. Under the Water Act 2003, the Secretary of State has a duty to protect the consumer interest and specifically to have regard to disabled people, the chronically sick, the elderly, the poor and those residing in rural areas.</p>
	<p pid=".86.6/4">I accept the need for improved water and sewerage services, but the ratepayers of Northern Ireland are not to blame for historic under-investment. Home owners have paid their rates. It would be a cruel injustice if they were expected to pay twice&mdash;first through their regional rate contribution and secondly through new charges&mdash;for those essential services. The present proposals are completely unfair, and the Liberal Democrats will resist any attempt by the Government to introduce them.</p>

	<p pid=".87.2/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1195" name="Peter Robinson">the hon. Member for Belfast, East (Mr. Robinson)</phrase> on securing this debate. I agree very much with what he said about this matter being an illustration of the democratic deficit in Northern Ireland. As he pointed out, it would be to everyone's advantage if people directly elected by voters in Northern Ireland were in a position to take responsibility for the complex and difficult decisions that must be made about the future of the water industry in the Province.</p>
	<p pid=".87.2/2">It seems as if there is unanimity in the Chamber about at least one point: there will have to be a great deal more capital expenditure on water provision in Northern Ireland. There are three drivers to that. The first is the decrepit nature of much of the current water network. The second is the forecast increase in demand as people become more prosperous, as lifestyles change and more water is consumed, and as we have a greater number of households in Northern Ireland for a largely static population. The third is the directives coming from the European Union that will force Northern Ireland, along with the rest of the United Kingdom, to improve the environmental quality of water discharges and the treatment of water through the sewerage system. The money must be found from somewhere.</p>
	<p pid=".87.2/3">My questions to the Minister will follow up some of the points made by the hon. Gentleman about the nature of the reform proposed by the Government and the likely impact that it will have on particular parts of Northern Ireland society. Will the Minister comment on the Government's time scale? They have always said that they will start to introduce water charges from 2006. That is surely dependent on their having available a robust database of property values derived from the revaluation that has been going on. There have been various reports in the Northern Ireland media that the Government may be contemplating deferring the introduction of water charges. It would be helpful if the Minister would say whether that is the case.</p>
	<p pid=".87.2/4">The hon. Gentleman put to the Minister an alternative model for funding the water service: in effect, a hypothecated taxation system. When I looked at page 21 of the Government's assessment of the proposals, it seemed to me that that option was ruled out primarily because they believed that it would lead to increased costs to customers, but that that conclusion depended on the existing budgetary rules from the Treasury remaining in place. We have seen in recent weeks that Treasury rules can suddenly become very flexible over the classification of road maintenance when that suits the Government's convenience, so I ask the Minister to spell out in more detail why the Government have rejected the alternative option.</p>
	<p pid=".87.2/5">I go along with the hon. Gentleman and other Northern Ireland Members in saying that the more savings that one can find from the Water Service and elsewhere in Government to offset the costs of capital investment, the better. Some significant savings in the Water Service are built into the Government's plans, but could there be more? Similarly, as they are talking about a developers' charge through the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister and the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, are they contemplating that proposal for Northern Ireland too?</p>
	<p pid=".87.2/6">On the level of charges, have the Government thought enough about certain groups? I am thinking of pensioners who are above the housing benefit level but on fixed incomes, and of large industrial users of water, such as the textile industry and food processors. They will be very vulnerable to foreign competition as a result of any increase in their costs. For them, the competitiveness test in the Government's assessment seems to be a bit of a joke, because it expressly rules out of the definition of competitiveness in any assessment of the impact of new charges on their competition with external competitors; it considers only whether there will be an effect on new entrants to the existing domestic market. In addition, what is the position of hospitals? The Government's assessment states that hospitals can expect significant increases in their bills, but I have seen no quantified estimate published anywhere. I hope that one will be published soon.</p>
	<p pid=".87.2/7">I shall make two brief points in conclusion. First, how will charges be enforced against non-payers? There is an increasing problem of bad debt in Great Britain. I can think of some parts of Northern Ireland where enforcement will be difficult. How does the Minister propose to deal with that? Secondly, why is he not using either Ofwat or the Scottish regulator in his consideration of the regulation of Northern Ireland's water system, as it seems, on the basis of the Government's documentation, that it is only the matter of legislative time that stands in the way of applying that existing store of expertise to the Province?</p>

	<p pid=".89.0/1"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1049" name="David Lidington">The hon. Member for Aylesbury (Mr. Lidington)</phrase> raised a number of detailed points with which I shall try to deal, but I may have to reply to some in correspondence. I welcome the opportunity to respond to this Adjournment debate and I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1195" name="Peter Robinson">the hon. Member for Belfast, East (Mr. Robinson)</phrase> on securing it.</p>
	<p pid=".89.0/2">When devolution was suspended in October 2002, we made clear our determination to bring about an early return of devolved government to Northern Ireland. However, that has not, as yet, been possible. One of the most difficult issues that we inherited from the Executive was the need to find a better way to finance water and sewerage services&mdash;that is one thing on which I think everyone can agree. An incoming Assembly and Executive would be in a position to change their minds, but not the arithmetic, as I hope to show during my response.</p>
	<p pid=".89.0/3">This year, water and sewerage services in Northern Ireland are costing more than &pound;380 million&mdash;more than &pound;1 million every day. I have not put much weight in my arguments over the last couple of years on the framework directive but, across Europe, higher standards are being introduced to improve the quality of the water that we drink and to reduce pollution in our rivers, on our beaches and in the sea. That imposes costs on the system while, at the same time, increasing demands are being placed on services in Northern Ireland. The modern lifestyle, as has already been mentioned, requires greater use of water. In addition, the welcome increase in demand for housing in Northern Ireland means that we have to cater for about an extra 200,000 homes that are expected to be built in Northern Ireland over the next 20 years.</p>
	<p pid=".89.0/4">All of that is costly. In 2003, it was estimated that the water and sewerage infrastructure would need &pound;3 billion of investment over the 20 years until 2023. Some of that investment is already taking place. The spending proposals contained in the budget published by the Secretary of State in December 2004 allocated &pound;735 million for investment in the water and sewerage infrastructure between 2005&ndash;06 and 2007&ndash;08. That will mean that about &pound;1.1 billion will have been invested in the infrastructure in the five-year period up to 2007&ndash;08, and that more than a third of the &pound;3 billion investment that I identified will have been provided before domestic consumers are asked to pay the full water charge.</p>
	<p pid=".89.0/5">It is worth re-emphasising the need to sustain investment. Water and sewerage services need sustained and reliable investment over long periods, which is difficult to achieve while the Water Service is within central Government and subject to the normal three-year financial planning periods. It has been accurately shown elsewhere in the UK that the water industry needs long-term planning and reliable revenue streams if it is to be efficient and effective.</p>
	<p pid=".89.0/6">The problem in Northern Ireland has been that the Water Service has had to compete for public funds with health, education and transport, unlike the position in England, Scotland and Wales. That may explain why there has been a legacy of under-investment in water and sewerage infrastructure, as several hon. Members have noted. Let me address the suggestion that that legacy should be financed by the central Exchequer. It is true that there has been under-investment in infrastructure, but that has been a feature of all regions in England and Wales, and not only in the water industry. We have all been living off the Victorian legacy.</p>
	<p pid=".89.0/7">It has also been mentioned that when English water companies were privatised in 1989&ndash;90 they received what was known as the green dowry. That was off-set in large part by the proceeds of privatisation&mdash;some &pound;6 billion&mdash;which provided a benefit to all UK taxpayers. The Northern Ireland Water Service was not privatised, so the green dowry arrangements did not apply. However, Northern Ireland's spending power was increased by some &pound;50 million a year to compensate for the fact that privatisation meant that water and sewerage services would, from that time on, be outside the scope of the Barnett regime.</p>
	<p pid=".89.0/8">It is also true to say that although there may have been under-investment in the water and sewerage infrastructure throughout the 1990s and up to the present date, Northern Ireland's share of public expenditure has been higher per person than in England, Scotland and Wales.</p>

	<p pid=".90.1/1">I am in no way defending the situation; I am describing it and the position that we are in now. Hon. Members need to say why they believe that UK taxpayers should pay for Northern Ireland's under-investment, when the UK taxpayer did not pay for the legacy of under-investment in England and Wales. I almost detected the implication from the hon. Gentleman that he thought that the voters of Montgomeryshire should pay for that under-investment, or perhaps the voters of Scotland or England. I am not sure that that would be acceptable.</p>
	<p pid=".90.1/2">That dilemma was recognised, if not by the hon. Gentleman, certainly by the Northern Ireland Executive before suspension in 2002. They reached the conclusion that there was no realistic prospect of the Treasury providing additional expenditure on the necessary scale. Indeed, it is worth quoting exactly what the Executive said in their rating policy review document, published in May 2002. They concluded that there was</p>
	<p pid=".90.1/3" class="indent">&quot;no realistic prospect that this funding requirement will be met from the Executive's routine public expenditure budget, because that would imply unacceptable constraints on the funding of other public services such as health, education and transport&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".90.1/4">They went on to say that it was not</p>
	<p pid=".90.1/5" class="indent">&quot;realistic to expect the Treasury to provide additional expenditure on this scale, as that would in effect mean that this large bill would be falling on UK taxpayers in a context where households&quot;&mdash;</p>

	<p pid=".90.1/7" class="indent">&quot;are contributing much less than those in similar circumstances in England, Scotland and Wales.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".90.1/8">That was a recognition of the reality, so I give full marks to those who try to change that reality, but we cannot do so, and it has not changed.</p>
	<p pid=".90.1/9">As an incentive to introduce self-financing arrangements, the Treasury offered to treat the non-cash costs of water services as fully additional to Northern Ireland's normal allocation of money for public services, thereby removing the responsibility for funding those costs from the Northern Ireland departmental expenditure limit, managed by the Executive. The Executive considered that before suspension, and it is worth noting that the draft budget for 2003&ndash;04 to 2005&ndash;06 that they presented to the Assembly in September 2002 did not make provision for the non-cash costs that would have been necessary had the Executive rejected the Treasury's offer. So, although it is true that the Executive had not made a firm commitment to introducing water charges, that was one of a number of signals that clearly showed the general direction in which they were heading.</p>
	<p pid=".90.1/10">We have to give careful consideration to how we might best develop and maintain the water and sewerage services that Northern Ireland needs for the 21st century. Having examined the limited alternatives, we are satisfied that the Executive were on the right course, and that water and sewerage services should become self-financing.</p>
	<p pid=".90.1/11">I am mindful of the time, so I shall move on quickly to the second issue: where should those costs fall? One question is in which area. In line with practice both in Scotland and in England and Wales&mdash;although there are variations between the two&mdash;we have taken the value of property to be the best indicator. That will mean that those who live where property is more valuable will end up paying more; that is the essence of any rateable system.</p>
	<p pid=".90.1/12">Metering is important, too, because that also determines where costs fall. About 80 per cent. of the cost of delivering water to households is fixed, irrespective of how much water is delivered. Only 20 per cent. is variable, depending on the amount delivered. That is particularly the case in Northern Ireland because it does not have the situation that prevails in, say, parts of eastern England, where additional reservoirs and new facilities may need to be provided. If we have a pro rata reduction, as is suggested by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1356" name="David Burnside">the hon. Member for South Antrim (David Burnside)</phrase>, those in better-off households will effectively receive a subsidy from those in poorer households. However we cut the amount of money, we come to the point when someone has to pay, and it is really a case of where the costs fall.</p>
	<p pid=".90.1/13">On the question asked about rateable value, we are clear that we will have in place the mechanism for sending out bills and collecting money by October 2006. The rateable values are due to be published. We will be working from the common database, so no one in the Northern Ireland Water Service will be in the firing line on appeals and so on. Those values will be published in April 2006. We will also have to get the necessary enabling legislation through, in order to ensure that the Government company and new framework are in place. We believe that we can do that in the timetable that I set out.</p>
	<p pid=".90.1/14">We believe that we have taken the right decision. We are following the principles enunciated by the previous Assembly and Executive, and we believe that what we are doing is necessary for delivering a proper water service for Northern Ireland.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-03-16.93.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/912" speakername="Sandra Gidley" colnum="93"  time="010:59:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/cm050316/halltext/50316h02.htm#50316h02_spnew2">
	<p pid=".93.3/1">I am sorry but I only have time for one intervention and that has been agreed beforehand.</p>
	<p pid=".93.3/2">The reaction that I have received so far is that the decision by NICE smacks of ageism and that the mechanism for calculating cost-effectiveness is deeply flawed. As with most things, it is useful to take events in a logical sequence, so I want to start by reminding the Minister of the guidance produced by NICE in 2001. Technology appraisal guidance number 19 dealt with the use of donepezil, rivastigmine and galantamine for the treatment of Alzheimer's. At that stage, Nice said:</p>
	<p pid=".93.3/3" class="indent">&quot;The three drugs . . . should be made available in the NHS as one component of the management of those people with mild and moderate Alzheimer's disease . . . as long as the patients conformed to certain criteria.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".93.3/4">Other conditions were laid down at the time and they included assessment and diagnosis in specialist clinics. Only specialists could initiate treatment, the carer's view of the condition should be sought, patients should be reassessed two to four months after reaching the maintenance dose of the drug and the drug should generally be continued only if there had been some improvement. Guidelines also covered when the drug should be discontinued.</p>
	<p pid=".93.3/5">No one appeared to have any quarrel with that. It seemed that NICE came up with a system that should ensure that those in need received the drugs, which were not prescribed unnecessarily if there was no proven benefit. NICE deemed that the drugs were effective but acknowledged that they did not work for everyone. When it came to cost-effectiveness, NICE acknowledged in 2001 that some of the methodologies were subject to uncertainty and acknowledged that the estimates of the cost per QALY&mdash;quality-adjusted life year, which is impenetrable to most people&mdash;covered a wide range of values. This is an important point and I will return to the thorny subject of QALYs later. NICE also acknowledged in 2001 that</p>
	<p pid=".93.3/6" class="indent">&quot;cost savings on later institutionalisation are not well established, and quality of life is not easily measured.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".93.3/7">Since then, more studies have taken place and the use of these drugs has been recently reviewed. Contrary to all expectations, the preliminary guidance now says:</p>
	<p pid=".93.3/8" class="indent">&quot;Donepezil, rivastigmine and galantamine are not recommended for use in the treatment of mild to moderate AD.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".93.3/9">I believe that this is probably the first time that NICE has reversed a decision in such a dramatic way. It goes on to say that people currently on the drugs should be able to continue until it is considered appropriate to stop but it appears to have effectively halted the use of the drug in new patients.</p>
	<p pid=".93.3/10">I have been bombarded with letters saying that these drugs could be withdrawn as early as July. We all know that once there is a diminishing number of patients on a drug, there comes a point when the drug company will find that it is not cost-effective to carry on manufacturing it. It is not immediately clear on reading the reports why things are so different now because, in parts of the report, NICE appears to be saying that the drugs are effective. Nor is it clear why the cost per QALY is now more important and the reasoning behind the costs is opaque.</p>
	<p pid=".93.3/11">I should like to remind the Minister of the Select Committee on Health's 2001&ndash;02 report on NICE. One of its recommendations was that there should be greater clarity over criteria for evaluating clinical and cost-effectiveness. It recommended that</p>
	<p pid=".93.3/12" class="indent">&quot;NICE should consider the wider societal costs and advantages of particular treatments and in particular the wider costs and benefits to the public purse of reduced benefit dependency and improved ability to work both for patients and their carers&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".93.3/13">The Government said that they agreed with the recommendation and that the Treasury would</p>
	<p pid=".93.3/14" class="indent">&quot;be issuing new guidance on economic appraisal which will broadly meet the Committee's point&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".93.3/15">and would be discussed with NICE. Our current argument about NICE suggests that that guidance might not have been issued, although I suspect that it was issued, but in a form that does not deal with the situation that we are faced with today.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-03-16.94.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/912" speakername="Sandra Gidley" colnum="94"  time="010:59:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/cm050316/halltext/50316h02.htm#50316h02_spnew4">
	<p pid=".94.1/1">My hon. Friend raises a good point, which was reflected in the press coverage over the weekend, when the Under-Secretary of State for Health, the hon. Member for South Thanet, seemed to cast some doubt on the criteria used. I will return to that.</p>
	<p pid=".94.1/2">The cost issue becomes even more confusing. The estimates of the costs per QALY range from &pound;2,000 to &pound;139,000, depending on the length of treatment and which set of assumptions are made. For reasons that are far from clear, it also appears that more weight has been attached to some studies than others. For example, much weight appears to be attached to the AD2000 study. The logic behind that seems to be that that study must be more reliable than some others because it was not funded by a drug company. That is not a sensible conclusion. Some drug company trials are excellent and others are not so good, and that is also the case for more independent trials. Therefore, it is the science that must be looked at, rather than who sponsors it.</p>
	<p pid=".94.1/3">I am concerned about this, because experts in the sector have questioned the methodology of the AD2000 trial, to which a lot of weight is given. I have been sent a copy of a submission to NICE from Dr. David Wilkinson, who is a consultant in old age psychiatry at Moorgreen hospital in Southampton. He was one of the clinical physicians on the inquiry panel. He raises a number of problems with the study. He states that the criteria were flawed because anybody who would benefit from the drug donepezil was automatically excluded from the trial and had to be treated elsewhere. Also, the recruitment was insufficient to provide detailed results; 3,000 people were supposed to be used, but only 565 were recruited, and only 20 remained at the end of the third year. He questions the implementation, too, because he says that he knows from direct experience that the measures were not carried out to ICH GCP&mdash;International Conference for Harmonisation good clinical practice&mdash;standards. He concludes by stating:</p>
	<p pid=".94.1/4" class="indent">&quot;It was therefore a series of one-year studies with an ever-diminishing number of highly atypical patients infrequently tested by unskilled raters with consequently a great deal of missing data which by their own admission was just made up for the final analysis.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".94.1/5">That is quite damning. I am happy to send a copy of the submission to the Minister, so he can read it in more detail.</p>
	<p pid=".94.1/6">Dr. Wilkinson also says:</p>
	<p pid=".94.1/7" class="indent">&quot;Despite claims that no long term data were available the data from two robust one year placebo controlled studies showing significant benefit in cognition and function were rejected in favour of shorter term studies.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".94.1/8">He also claims that assumptions were based on improvements gained in six-month trials and extrapolated, but with no reference to those who were discontinued from treatment.</p>
	<p pid=".94.1/9">It is interesting that Professor James Rafferty, the chair of the appraisal committee of the AD2000 study, was one of the authors of the study. He is hardly likely to criticise his own work. That raises questions about the impartiality of NICE with regard to this particular investigation.</p>
	<p pid=".94.1/10">The reaction to the NICE preliminary guidance has been remarkable in its unanimity.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-03-16.95.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/912" speakername="Sandra Gidley" colnum="95"  time="010:59:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/cm050316/halltext/50316h02.htm#50316h02_spnew5">
	<p pid=".95.1/1">My point is that, in the review, NICE should have taken into account the fact that one of the key authors of the study on which it placed so much weight was chairing the committee. There is a case for somebody else chairing the review, and I would be grateful if the Minister considered the points that I am making. I will send him a more detailed breakdown of my argument, which I do not have time to go through today. However, I was concerned when I read the comments. I believe that NICE is generally a good thing and feel worried if anything questions its impartiality or objectivity.</p>
	<p pid=".95.1/2">The reactions to the guidance have been almost unanimous. The Alzheimer's Society refers to it as &quot;alarming reading&quot; and makes the point that it is worth spending &pound;2.50 a day on drug treatments for dementia. It also claims:</p>
	<p pid=".95.1/3" class="indent">&quot;The models that NICE use do not allow a monetary value to be put on the things that mean the most to people receiving drug treatments, so they simply ignore them . . . Conventional pharmacoeconomics cannot be applied to drug therapies for dementia. QALYs inherently discriminate against older people and thus raise particular problems for calculating the costs of dementia.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".95.1/4">One reason for the discrimination is that the calculation of QALYs usually takes earnings into account, and because the drugs are most frequently prescribed for older people who are not earning, the figures are highly skewed. We definitely need a different model when we consider the position of older people.</p>
	<p pid=".95.1/5">Help the Aged is</p>
	<p pid=".95.1/6" class="indent">&quot;concerned that NICE have not taken into account the substantial gains in quality of life resulting from effective treatment with these drugs&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".95.1/7">The Royal College of Psychiatrists</p>
	<p pid=".95.1/8" class="indent">&quot;strongly disagrees with the assumptions and methodology of the health economic analysis that led NICE to these conclusions&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".95.1/9">The college repeats some of the points already raised. It says that the economic modelling used by NICE is unrealistic and not based on the use of drugs in clinical practice, and that alternative treatments, such as anti-psychotics, will actively do harm. One feature of dementia and Alzheimer's, if untreated, is often an increase in aggressive behaviour, so we will end up using drugs that are regarded by most people as a last resort and that have been described as a chemical cosh.</p>
	<p pid=".95.1/10">Three physicians from the Memory and Assessment Research Centre have written to me pointing out the possible long-term impact of withdrawing the drugs. They point out that the only proven treatment option will be lost and that there will be a two-tier health provision for Alzheimer's, because some patients will demand private prescriptions, meaning that only those with the ability to pay will benefit from them. There is a perception that AD patients are simply being abandoned by the NHS. More alarming, many think that memory clinics will close and services for people with AD will be decimated because managers will take the easy decision to close facilities as there will be no treatment options. NICE and the Government will be guilty of ageism and will lose international credibility, and an even larger burden will be placed on our already overstretched care services.</p>
	<p pid=".95.1/11">I will admit that I was delighted to see the press coverage over the weekend&mdash;&quot;U-turn over Alzheimer's&quot;, for example. The Under-Secretary of State for Health, the hon. Member for South Thanet, is alleged to have said:</p>
	<p pid=".95.1/12" class="indent">&quot;I can understand why the public are so worried. If you have someone in your family with dementia and you have drugs which do work then you are going to find this decision baffling. I want NICE to look at the methodology they have used, which a number of experts have called into question. It may be that once they have looked at extra evidence they will come to a different decision.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".95.1/13">A statement from the Department of Health seemed to confirm that, although it was in stark contrast to the defiant stance adopted by the Secretary of State for Health last week.</p>
	<p pid=".95.1/14"><i>The Observer</i> said:</p>
	<p pid=".95.1/15" class="indent">&quot;Dr Stephen Ladyman made clear that he will ensure the proposals are overturned.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".95.1/16">Much as I want to see the proposals overturned, the statement rang alarm bells, because I always understood that NICE was an arm's-length body and was immune from ministerial interference. Today's debate is a useful opportunity for me to seek clarification from the Minister about what form the intervention will take. The press release said that the submission was to be published on the NICE website. I looked hard at that last night and could not find where submissions were published. Will the right hon. Gentleman commit himself to publishing the submission on the Department of Health website, so that everyone can access it?</p>
	<p pid=".95.1/17">The Under-Secretary of State was also quoted as wanting NICE to examine the methodology that it used. It would be helpful if the Minister could inform the Chamber what advice has already been given or what advice is planned to be given about the methodology that should be used instead. If NICE adheres to the recommendation, as is its right, will he confirm that individual consultants should still be able to prescribe the drugs if they wish to, or will he devise alternative means of making drugs such as Beta Interferon available?</p>
	<p pid=".95.1/18">I end my speech by referring to a letter from a specialist community nurse who works at a local memory clinic:</p>
	<p pid=".95.1/19" class="indent">&quot;My work involves me exclusively in the initiation of these treatments and their follow up monitoring and review. I see first hand the hundreds of lives enhanced by their introduction. I see the sometimes remarkable improvements in a patient's cognitive and social abilities, the restoration of their former personalities and the return to some semblance of normal life for families disrupted by this tragic disease.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".95.1/20">To my mind, those words describe what must seem like hundreds of tiny miracles. That picture is repeated throughout the country. The Chamber and the public need to know what the Government will do to ensure that such miracles are allowed to continue.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-03-16.97.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/987" speakername="John Hutton" speakeroffice="The Minister of State, Department of Health"  colnum="97"  time="011:16:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/cm050316/halltext/50316h02.htm#50316h02_spmin1">
	<p pid=".97.0/1">I am grateful to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/912" name="Sandra Gidley">the hon. Member for Romsey (Sandra Gidley)</phrase> for giving me the opportunity to respond to her debate. I am sorry that I am not the Under-Secretary of State for Health, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1029" name="Stephen Ladyman">the Member for South Thanet (Dr. Ladyman)</phrase>, but I shall do my best to substitute for him.</p>
	<p pid=".97.0/2">As Ministers, my hon. Friend and I understand the sensitivity and importance of such matters and the need to achieve the right decision at the end of the process in October. It is important to put on the record a couple of matters to which the hon. Lady did not refer. I have been in correspondence with constituents, as she will have been, about the importance of treatment and drugs. At present, about 290,000 patients could receive the drugs, but only one in six people actually receive such medication. She suggested that, if the drugs were not available, that would mean the wholesale dismemberment of Alzheimer's disease services in the national health service. She referred to the closure of clinics and the transfer of resources. I must say to her, with all respect&mdash;and I have a lot of respect for her&mdash;that that statement is a grotesque distortion of reality. I hope that, on reflection, she will reconsider her words.</p>
	<p pid=".97.0/3">I turn to another important point. I did not detect from the hon. Lady's remarks that the document to which she referred is a draft for consultation. Throughout her speech, one would have gained the impression that the draft was a final decision by the National Institute for Clinical Excellence. That is a million miles away from the real position. She referred to several important and learned organisations that have expressed concerns about the draft guidance published by NICE. Those bodies should make sure that NICE has access to their views, and I am sure they will. As it has shown previously when a contested draft guidance paper has been produced for consultation, NICE is willing to revisit the basis of its initial proposal. It took such action with the proposed draft guidance on macular degeneration, with a view to making sure that its evidence is the best and reflects fully the available clinical, medical and scientific research. The hon. Lady assumed throughout her remarks that a decision has been made to withdraw the treatment that is provided. That is not the case. I am glad that she is acknowledging my remarks.</p>
	<p pid=".97.0/4">The Government are committed to improving the standard of care for those with dementia. The national service framework for older people that we launched four years ago sought to promote good mental health in older people and high-quality treatment and support for those with dementia and depression. The national service framework aims to ensure that older people have access to integrated NHS and local authority mental health services, providing effective diagnosis, treatment and support for those with mental health difficulties and their carers. I believe that we are making real and solid progress in that sector.</p>
	<p pid=".97.0/5">As Neil Hunt, chief executive of the Alzheimer's Disease Society, said in November last year:</p>
	<p pid=".97.0/6" class="indent">&quot;The tide is turning&mdash;fewer people are told that dementia is just old age and more people are receiving the support and treatment that they need.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".97.0/7">I hope that the hon. Lady welcomes that positive comment from Mr. Hunt.</p>
	<p pid=".97.0/8">In 2003, to support implementation of the national service framework, the Secretary of State for Health announced that, as part of the eighth wave of its work, NICE would produce a clinical guideline on the care of those with dementia, including the use of Alzheimer's drugs. NICE is scheduled to issue a consultation version of that clinical guideline in spring 2006.</p>
	<p pid=".97.0/9">Hon. Members will be aware of NICE's recent review of guidance on the use of drugs for Alzheimer's disease and the publication of its draft guidance for consultation. The hon. Lady spent much time referring to that. NICE suggests that the use of the Alzheimer's drugs covered by its 2001 guidance can no longer be considered clinically effective or cost-effective, and that they should not be offered to new patients by the NHS. The draft technology appraisal produced by NICE and issued on <phrase class="date" code="2005-03-01">1 March</phrase> is a consultation document. The consultation period closes on <phrase class="date" code="2005-03-22">22 March</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".97.0/10">The hon. Lady asked me on what basis NICE took the decision to issue that advice. NICE has said that the reason for the proposed change of advice is the availability of more recent evidence on clinical effectiveness. She has sought to challenge that, as she is entitled to do.</p>
	<p pid=".97.0/11">NICE will carefully consider all the responses to the consultation&mdash;I am sure that the hon. Lady will make a response&mdash;before issuing its final guidance in October 2005. Until then, the original 2001 guidance from NICE should be adhered to and patients currently being prescribed Alzheimer's drugs should continue to receive them.</p>
	<p pid=".97.0/12">I remind the Chamber of a point with which I hope that many hon. Members would agree: NICE has a strong track record and has built an international reputation for its work on clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness. Indeed, its methodologies have been commended by the World Health Organisation. Since NICE was established in 1999, it has issued 88 technology appraisals and 25 clinical guidelines, benefiting many thousands of patients.</p>
	<p pid=".97.0/13">However, I know that questions have been asked about the methodologies that NICE has applied in preparing its revised appraisal for Alzheimer's. It is right that such issues should be aired and that they are logged formally with NICE during the consultation period, so that it can consider their implications for its final guidance. I hope that all those with an interest will share their views with NICE during the consultation. My hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State for Health has been communicating with lobby groups and expert bodies to ensure that they submit all the available evidence of efficacy and explain to NICE any reservations that they have. The Department of Health will respond to the consultation, as is its normal practice when NICE issues draft guidance.</p>
	<p pid=".97.0/14">The Department of Health's response will touch on some specific areas that I know are of concern to the hon. Lady. It might help if I highlight some of those specifics. For example, we shall ask NICE whether it is content that the wider impact of those drugs, particularly on carers, is given appropriate weight and is adequately reflected in the guidance. We shall also ask NICE whether it believes that its appraisal fully captured the evidence on the effectiveness of those drugs in improving cognitive functioning, and the extent to which any such benefits may persist beyond the short term. In addition, we shall raise other issues, such as the potential costs and side-effects of alternative medications such as anti-psychotics, which might be prescribed for the behavioural and psychiatric symptoms of dementia should the existing Alzheimer's disease drugs be used far less extensively. Our response will also highlight the inter-relationship between those drugs and wider services for Alzheimer's disease such as memory clinics.</p>
	<p pid=".97.0/15">That is not, of course, a comprehensive account of the Department of Health's response to the NICE consultation, but I wanted to assure the hon. Lady that we understand the issues that are being raised and that we will, as always, use our own consultation response to highlight issues that we believe to be important.</p>

Lady the sense that we share some of her concerns. We intend fully to publish our response in the appropriate way.</p>
	<p pid=".100.1/2">It is worth pointing out that, in doing so, we are not questioning NICE's processes or its track record in providing good-quality, evidence-based advice to the NHS. Nor do we seek, as some press reports suggest, to overrule the national institute or to direct it to reach a particular conclusion. The hon. Lady expressed concerns that we might be preparing to do that. I hope that she is reassured.</p>
	<p pid=".100.1/3">I said that NICE is developing comprehensive guidance on the provision of dementia services in the form of a new clinical guideline. Clearly, it is important that the guideline links coherently with NICE'S final assessment of drugs for Alzheimer's disease. We will wish to discuss with NICE how the timing of those two pieces of work is best managed, so that patients, carers and clinicians have access to a single suite of advice covering the management of the condition.</p>
	<p pid=".100.1/4">The hon. Lady rightly, and for good reason, confined her remarks primarily to the draft NICE guidance. In the two or three minutes left to me, I would like to widen the debate slightly. It is important that we look at other issues surrounding the care and treatment of people with Alzheimer's disease. In that context, we should not forget the role of families and carers supporting those with dementia. The majority of people with dementia are cared for at home, which can be an incredibly demanding and exhausting task for the carers.</p>
	<p pid=".100.1/5">We were the first Government formally to recognise the contribution and concerns of carers. In 1999, with carers and the organisations that represent them, we developed the national carers strategy. We also introduced a carers grant to support councils when providing breaks and services for carers in England. The grant has been steadily increased every year, and it has provided an extra &pound;325 million over the past five years. It is worth &pound;125 million this year, it will be worth &pound;185 million next year and, in the last local government finance settlement, we confirmed our commitment to continue the carers grant until the end of financial year 2007&ndash;08. Local authorities have been able to use the money to give carers help with taking breaks from caring, and to give them ongoing support with caring. That was a hugely important step.</p>
	<p pid=".100.1/6">There is another context to the debate, which was raised when the hon. Lady expressed concern about resources. In July 2002, the then Secretary of State for Health, my right hon. Friend for Darlington (Mr. Milburn), announced a wide-ranging package of measures radically to reform services for older people. By 2006, compared with the resources available today, another &pound;1 billion a year will be spent on social services for older people. The package focuses on six main themes&mdash;faster assessment, stabilising the care home sector, an expanded range of services, easier access to community equipment, increased choices for older people, and more support for carers. All those services are of relevance to older people with dementia.</p>

	<p pid=".101.1/1">Again, we have tried to address those issues. The hon. Lady will be aware of the ombudsman's ruling on the application of the rules on continuing care. We are working hard with the NHS to ensure that the outstanding cases are processed speedily and efficiently.</p>
	<p pid=".101.1/2">It is worth bearing in mind that the NHS spends considerable sums every year on providing continuing care. In that context, continuing care does not cover personal and nursing care only. It covers the entire cost of accommodation, including the board and lodging of the person, and rightly so, because the NHS's responsibility is to provide the health care that people need. If a person's needs have been assessed as being predominantly health related, it is the NHS's job to fund that care. Meeting the concerns of the health ombudsman in dealing with the backlog of cases will cost the NHS about &pound;180 million&mdash;</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-03-16.104.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1271" speakername="David Taylor" colnum="104"  time="014:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/cm050316/halltext/50316h03.htm#50316h03_spnew2">
	<p pid=".104.1/1">I fully accept that point. I am in regular contact with a number of probation officers in my area, and I know of the trauma that has been endured because of those changes. A further such change now, with a lack of consultation, is not to be desired. The NOMS statement also compounds the disregard for the interests, concerns and views of staff, which my hon. Friend mentioned. In the consultation exercises last year, many people opposed the dismantling of the probation service, and they have been ignored. That compounds the lack of principles and values underpinning NOMS to inspire commitment and pride from staff, as well as the lack of clarity about the future direction and governance of NOMS.</p>
	<p pid=".104.1/2">There are alternatives that would deliver the Government's objectives, which I share&mdash;enhanced end-to-end sentence management, an increased role for community sentences in the sentencing process and, most importantly, a reduction in reoffending. The staff and their trade union representatives believe that such aims could be better met by developing models that enable structural reorganisation within the existing 42 boards, as my hon. Friend mentioned, which should continue to employ both offender case managers and intervention staff.</p>
	<p pid=".104.1/3">Such reorganisation should enable the commissioning of further services and contestability to be done with a clarity of roles, building on the spirit of partnership rather than of competition. It should enable the probation service to remain as an integrated service with a continuing identity with its own director general, supported as appropriate by the NOMS structures of the Home Office and the national probation directorate. Finally, it should also build on the model of the youth offending teams and the model now being introduced in Scotland for prisons and local authorities to require criminal justice agencies to work together locally.</p>
	<p pid=".104.1/4">I turn now to contestability, which used to be a two-word quality, highly prized by sportspeople, beauty queens and politicians. When it is welded into a one-word new Labour concept, however, it should be treated with scepticism. The Government say that they are not interested in using the private sector for its own sake, but there is not a scrap of evidence that the private sector can deliver public services more effectively or cheaply than the public sector; the very reverse is true. The community and voluntary sector, on the other hand, has an existing relationship with the probation service and operates with the same public sector ethos as the national probation service itself. A mixed economy involving the community and voluntary sector already exists, and it is by far a preferable option to privatisation.</p>
	<p pid=".104.1/5">The weasel word &quot;contestability&quot; was introduced in the document &quot;Reducing Crime, Changing Lives&quot;. The Government are fighting shy of such terms as &quot;privatisation&quot; or &quot;outsourcing&quot;; in a separate context, I raised that point in Deputy Prime Minister's questions today. It is unsurprising that the Government are fighting shy of such terms, given privatisation's failure to deliver in the past. Contestability is a flawed model that will result in more expensive, poorer-quality services from non-accountable providers.</p>
	<p pid=".104.1/6">The current NPS facilities management contracts are an example of how the use of the private sector has led to increased costs for poorer service standards. The service has discovered to its cost and detriment that private companies owe a first loyalty to their shareholders rather than to their public sector clients and the broader population. There is no evidence whatever that the private sector has been able, for example, to run prisons more cheaply than the public sector. I shall return to that point briefly later.</p>
	<p pid=".104.1/7">Providing a cheaper service would have to be, as it always has been, at the expense of labour standards in a two-tier work force. The Government's failure to extend protection against the two-tier work force beyond best value authorities raises suspicions in my mind that NOMS may try to deliver cheaper privatised services by driving down employment standards on outsourced contracts.</p>
	<p pid=".104.1/8">We should fight contestability as a route to privatisation on the following grounds. It would fragment integrated service delivery, because all public services use cross-subsidy and integration to share risks and the cost of delivery across diverse populations and communities. Moreover, the private sector is unlikely to bid for NOMS services that have higher than average supply costs, such as rural services, because without cross-subsidy, they cannot be made profitable.</p>
	<p pid=".104.1/9">We should also fight contestability because public services such as probation are not commodities; they exist to support the social and economic well-being of communities. We should fight it because public-private partnerships cost more than conventionally funded projects; they borrow at higher rates than the public sector, demand higher rates of return&mdash;typically, the rate is 19 per cent. for one prison at Bridgend&mdash;and they have high set-up costs involving solicitors, accountants like me and others. Furthermore, they involve a convoluted procurement process and escalate in both scale and cost.</p>
	<p pid=".104.1/10">We should fight contestability because the high cost of private finance initiative projects often leads to an affordability gap for the procuring authority, and that gap is often met by reductions in services and capacity. I shall quote briefly comments made by one member, whom I know well, who works in a hostel setting. He sets out his frustration at the abject failure of hostel arrangements to deliver a quality service:</p>
	<p pid=".104.1/11" class="indent">&quot;It is clear from the way the facilities contract is not working, and the fact that it is not cost-effective, that privatisation is not the answer to our problems. But how can we make the powers-that-be see this?&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".104.1/12">Those powers-that-be include the Minister.</p>
	<p pid=".104.1/13">If that is the future under contestability, quality of service is under real threat. The artificial split of the probation service into purchaser-provider functions is utterly irrational. The service should remain as a coherent whole and be given proper investment for growth&mdash;particularly for hostels and other interventions. The quality of service is under threat because the proposed purchaser-provider split will be expensive to set up and problematic and costly to manage, and it will lead to problems for communication, integration and risk management. We need a strong, efficient and effective probation service. The NOMS proposals do not provide a basis on which to achieve that. The consultation timetable has to be reset and the NOMS review's terms of reference widened to allow alternatives to be explored.</p>
	<p pid=".104.1/14">I turn to the future of the Prison Service. The publication in January 2004 of the Government's response to Patrick Carter's review of correctional services has effectively thrown the prison service into limbo. More than 14 months later, the service and those working in it remain uncertain about what lies ahead. All those working in and around the criminal justice system continue to acknowledge the great improvement made in recent years by the Prison Service in standards, decency and performance. That has been done through partnership, not through the perpetual use of threats from Ministers&mdash;although not, I hasten to say, from the Minister present today&mdash;and senior civil servants. Those programmes facilitated improvements in the Prison Service, through partnerships and co-operation, not threats, to a level where there are no failing prisons in England and Wales. The threat of market-testing establishments is not necessary and is being used only to achieve a Prison Service-for-profit ethos.</p>
	<p pid=".104.1/15">Let us consider prisons and the purchaser-provider model. A fundamental aim of the ideologically based concept of the National Offender Management Service experiment, on which its future success or failure is based, is the control of the prison population. In April 2004, the prison population reached an historical high of more than 75,000, which is just below its working operational capacity. On <phrase class="date" code="2005-03-11">11 March 2005</phrase>, the population had returned to those historically high levels and stood at 75,479, although the capacity had increased to cover the predicted population increase. Nevertheless, as a magistrate, I have visited numerous prisons and I know that grossly overcrowded establishments remain.</p>
	<p pid=".104.1/16">The most fundamental component of the accepted Carter recommendations is the introduction of a purchaser-provider model for the delivery of prison places. For that to be achieved, the purchaser must have an element of choice in deciding where to purchase the service that they require, otherwise there is not a genuine market. With the prison estate as overcrowded as it is, a purchaser-provider model cannot and should not be introduced, because the element of choice does not exist. It is widely acknowledged by everyone working in the criminal justice system that the prison population needs to be managed. For many people, the question is whether we need NOMS to achieve that, and for the vast majority of those people, the resounding answer is no.</p>
	<p pid=".104.1/17">I turn to the future funding of Her Majesty's Prison Service. It is widely accepted that for a number of years the service has been overcrowded and under-resourced. Since the end of last year, the prison population has increased by more than 2,000. Despite the apparent failure of the chief executive of NOMS to achieve his primary aim of reducing the prison population, he has more than once outlined his intention to reduce growth in funding for the Prison Service in future. No organisation can achieve its goals if it is starved of the necessary funding. Martin Narey intends to freeze Prison Service funding. In that context, we should look at early-day motion 603, which was tabled by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/909" name="Neil Gerrard">the Member for Walthamstow (Mr. Gerrard)</phrase>, who will no doubt refer to it himself.</p>

	<p pid=".107.1/1">The Prison Service would not fare well under the major public sector cuts that are anticipated should the hon. Lady's party be elected. However, to deal with her point directly, the Government see budget capping as an incentive for greater diversion to community sentences, which is worth while, as is reviewing the nature of the offences committed by people in prison.</p>
	<p pid=".107.1/2">To deliberately and with forethought starve the public sector of the funds that it needs to deliver the service that is expected is unacceptable. This year, we have already seen mothballing of usable prison places and regimes and programmes curtailed due to a lack of resources. A continuation of Martin Narey's stated plans will inevitably lead to the Prison Service failing to achieve ministerial targets, through no fault of its own. To date, after almost 15 months, the chief executive of NOMS has not published the detailed business case to prove that the formation of the new service was necessary.</p>
	<p pid=".107.1/3">In November 2004, the Home Office admitted that a detailed business case was being prepared and it was said that a draft was to be placed before the NOMS programme board on <phrase class="date" code="2005-11-22">22 November</phrase>. Despite numerous calls by Members of Parliament for publication of the business case for the creation of NOMS, it has still not been made available. The NOMS programme accelerates into chaos with blithe disregard for events.</p>
	<p pid=".107.1/4">In 2004&ndash;05, the cost of establishing the correctional service headquarters is in excess of &pound;105 million, which is a huge increase in non-front-line delivery costs. There will also be a requirement for more than 50 staff in each of the regional offender manager sites. The costs of those extra staff will further deplete the resources of front-line services. It is not surprising, when the estimates are considered, that NOMS declined to provide the business case, to which I referred, to justify the continuation of the project on value-for-money grounds.</p>
	<p pid=".107.1/5">The glaring weaknesses of PFI seem apparent to all but Ministers. Public-private partners profit from people; the trend in PFI contracts has been to reduce the salaries of staff delivering public services and to cut jobs. Privatisation has led to a two-tier work force in which new starters on contracts receive much lower salaries and benefits than transferred staff. It has led to pensions that are not properly protected under TUPE. Unacceptably, equality suffers under privatisation: many public sector private contracts are delivered by a class of women workers who have no decent occupational pension scheme and who work on inferior terms and conditions. PFI has also led to private companies making unacceptable profits. A National Audit Office report showed that Group 4 and Carillion boosted their expected profit from the Fazakerley prison contract by 75 per cent. Refinancing produced &pound;10 million for them, of which only &pound;1 million was paid back to the Prison Service. That is another example of the private sector putting profits before public service.</p>
	<p pid=".107.1/6">It may be apparent from some of my remarks that I do not have a great deal of confidence in the brave new world into which the Government are pitching the probation and prison services. I look forward to my hon. Friend the Minister telling me in detail why I am wrong next Tuesday at 1 o'clock in Room O in Portcullis House. In all seriousness, I have a great deal of confidence in, and respect for, the Minister answering today's debate. I know him reasonably well and his reputation is rightly high. In his earlier political life, he was dubious about high prison populations and the role of the private sector in the delivery of public services. As his route from Manchester and Sale to Marsham street clearly took in Damascus, he will no doubt explain to the Chamber the background to this second conversion of a man named Paul, albeit in the wrong direction.</p>

	<p pid=".108.0/1">I am grateful to my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1271" name="David Taylor">the Member for North-West Leicestershire (David Taylor)</phrase>, who introduced the debate, for securing it and bringing this subject to our attention. I shall try not to repeat too much of what he said, because I agreed with virtually all of it. I had hoped that we might be having a similar debate at about this time on the Management of Offenders and Sentencing Bill, which was introduced in the other place, but so far it does not even have a date for Second Reading. It therefore looks highly likely that it will not be proceeded with this side of the general election, which puts the debate off even further.</p>
	<p pid=".108.0/2">One of my major concerns, which I share with my hon. Friend, about the process that we are going through in establishing NOMS is the lack of debate in Parliament. I make no criticism of my hon. Friend the Minister for that. He has been generous with his time in meeting me and other hon. Members present. Through the justice unions parliamentary group, he has made every effort to meet and talk to us and we have been very grateful, but there has not been a wider debate in Parliament. The number of hon. Members who have signed the early-day motions on this subject shows that there is considerable concern, but there has not been an opportunity for a full debate.</p>
	<p pid=".108.0/3">I am also concerned that, although we have not had a full debate, the reorganisation and restructuring and the setting up of NOMS are moving on. A chief executive was appointed some time ago. More recently, regional offender managers have been appointed, even though they have no regions to manage as yet. Some, I understand, are continuing to do other jobs and will do for the foreseeable future&mdash;perhaps for another year or two&mdash;as well as taking on the regional offender management role.</p>
	<p pid=".108.0/4">Even though I have probably spent more time on this subject than most other subjects in the House in the last year or so, I am still confused about exactly what is happening to the structures, who is responsible for what, what the relationship really is between the regional offender managers and the probation boards, and the future of the boards themselves. In July last year, the Minister announced that, in the light of the consultation exercise that had taken place since January and the publication of the Carter report, he had decided not to do away the 42 existing probation boards, but that he was still going to bring in regional offender managers. In making the decision not to do away with those boards, he used the phrase &quot;at this stage&quot;. That seems to leave open the possibility, at the very least, that at some point in the future those probation boards will cease to exist.</p>

	<p pid=".109.0/1">The Minister will know this because he kindly organised a meeting with the south-west appointment to NOMS where I raised the very point that my hon. Friend is talking about. Members of my board have written to me questioning what their role is now and what their future role will be. So, there is a real problem. I am sure that he would say that things are similar in his area.</p>

	<p pid=".109.1/1">That is the case. I have certainly spoken to members of probation boards who find themselves in a situation of considerable confusion. They are not really sure yet quite what the relationship with the regional offender managers is supposed to be. If the ROMs are involved in making decisions about budgets, what does that imply? Who is actually the employer? Legally, as I understand it, the probation boards are the employers of the probation service, but if someone else starts to make decisions about budgets, performance and innovation, it is far from clear to me quite what that will mean for the boards in exercising their responsibility as employers. From talking to people who work in the probation service and the Prison Service, it is absolutely clear that there is a huge amount of uncertainty and worry among staff about what their future will be and where their services are going.</p>
	<p pid=".109.1/2">My hon. Friend the Member for North-West Leicestershire pointed to the issue of contestability. I know that the Minister will tell us that contestability is not privatisation. We have had that conversation several times. However, I have to say to him that, from the point of view of the people out there who are working in the service, it feels very much like privatisation. There is no question but that that is what it feels like to staff. If the probation service is to be split into purchaser and provider, and work is to be put out to tender, that feels very much as if some of it will be privatised. There is no question but that the talk about market testing of prisons certainly implies the possibility&mdash;if not the probability&mdash;of private providers taking over.</p>
	<p pid=".109.1/3">I recall being involved&mdash;I think in 1993&mdash;in the first debates in the House about the introduction of private prisons in the UK. I certainly recall the comments of the then shadow Home Secretary&mdash;I think that his constituency was Sedgefield&mdash;and the opposition that we put forward from the Labour Benches to privatisation. My hon. Friend pointed out what has been happening in the Prison Service.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-03-16.118.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/914" speakername="Cheryl Gillan" colnum="118"  time="015:01:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/cm050316/halltext/50316h03.htm#50316h03_spnew22">
	<p pid=".118.1/1">I am not seeking to score political points on that aspect of the debate. As I said, people expect perpetrators of crime to be locked up and, as I should have said, to remain locked up. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman and I would agree on that.</p>
	<p pid=".118.1/2">To return to the statistics on the current state of our Prison Service, the female prison population has almost doubled under this Government. Sadly, women are twice as likely to kill themselves and 14 times as likely to carry out self-harm in that environment. The availability of drugs in our prisons is also an enormous problem. According to the inspector of prisons, that raises serious concerns. Drugs fuel abscondence from open prisons&mdash;something that the hon. Gentleman would obviously be concerned about&mdash;and in closed institutions, the advent of drugs is undermining safety and raising levels of debt, bullying and intimidation.</p>
	<p pid=".118.1/3">Education and training in prison is also proving to be a weak link. In the last report from the inspector, 18 training prisons were inspected, and only 5 were found to provide sufficient work and training for their prisoners. I am sure that the Minister is familiar with that information, and I know that he is trying to address those problems. However, it is ironic that I have a letter sent to the Prison Officers Association by no other than his esteemed Prime Minister, who wrote to David Evans before taking up the mantle at No. 10 Downing street:</p>
	<p pid=".118.1/4" class="indent">&quot;In our view, a modern and effective Public Prison Service requires a disciplined and challenging regime free from the problems of gross overcrowding and indiscipline that have undermined the Service in the past.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".118.1/5">Unfortunately, I do not think that there has been much progress in the Prison Service since the Prime Minister's words, which were spoken before 1997.</p>
	<p pid=".118.1/6">Against that background, there is the continuing development of NOMS, but the way in which that development is taking place does not inspire observers with confidence in the Prison Service or probation service. That has been reflected in our debate. I could take some pleasure in seeing the Minister chided and upbraided by Labour Members, but I do not, because we have been working in quite a good, non-partisan way on the subject. Our ultimate aim is basically the same&mdash;to provide a modern prison and probation service for the 21st century. As the Minister knows, however, I cannot ignore the large quantity of paper that is starting to reach my desk concerning comments on the development of NOMS that require answers from him. I hope that he will address some of those matters today.</p>
	<p pid=".118.1/7">The consultation process on the proposed NOMS headquarters has raised many issues. For example, the speed at which the proposals are implemented will present real challenges. The consultation process has been so sparse&mdash;it has also been rushed through&mdash;as to prevent the consultation with staff, and even with unions, that everybody has demanded in this debate. The new contractual arrangements and purchaser-provider relationships will require changes, particularly in relation to reskilling. What measures have been taken to clarify those arrangements? Will the Minister set out the decision processes, particularly on key areas such as information technology and property?</p>
	<p pid=".118.1/8">Can the Minister say how any lack of the resources needed to deliver centrally set standards will be taken into account in the assessment of the public sector Prison Service in a market test or in other forms of contestability? Those issues need to be laid out. How is he dealing with clarifying responsibilities and overlap? For example, how is he solving the problems of the apparent separation of security policy from security standards? What will he do about the boundary issues between pure policy and operational policy? How will he handle the transfer of work between the Prison Service and NOMS? Can he confirm that there are anxieties about transferring complete areas, which may leave skills voids and will be dealt with only by extra costs or reduced effectiveness?</p>
	<p pid=".118.1/9">What progress has the Minister made on the problems of the prison estate? As I understand it, the scope of responsibilities has not been clarified. How will he deal with the backlog of unfunded maintenance? That is an even more important aspect, because managers can be held personally liable under health and safety legislation. Managers are anxious to know the extent of the support available to them.</p>
	<p pid=".118.1/10">Will the Minister comment on the safer custody group and say what he has done to deal with the fears of duplication? Likewise, has he addressed the issues that arise from moving the drug strategy unit as a whole into the health partnerships? I would also like to hear his view on the management of high-risk and high-profile cases, as well as on the policy on sex offenders, domestic abuse and child abuse. Has he established clear lines of accountability so that no serious business or public protection risks are associated with the transfers of responsibilities?</p>
	<p pid=".118.1/11">Why is the Minister rushing forward with these proposals when I understand that both director generals do not wish him to proceed at such a pace. All the evidence suggests that the best way forward is for probation to be kept in the localities. In the past month, even the Local Government Association stated in its &quot;Going Straight&quot; report:</p>
	<p pid=".118.1/12" class="indent">&quot;We do not believe that regional structures will help engage with local communities or are best suited to delivering tailored measures for offenders involving local services.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".118.1/13">The report added:</p>
	<p pid=".118.1/14" class="indent">&quot;we are disappointed that no consideration seems to have been given to existing partnership arrangements at the local level&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".118.1/15">The LGA does not believe that a regional approach will secure the Government's objective of energising local communities.</p>
	<p pid=".118.1/16">What is the justification for splitting the probation service into two sections&mdash;offender management and interventions&mdash;when all the research shows that the best way of working is to keep them together? I do not know whether the Minister is aware that on <phrase class="date" code="2005-02-10">10 February</phrase>, in discussions involving probation board members, a senior NOMS staff member was asked why they were splitting the functions. He replied that there was no evidence that the offender management and interventions split would deliver anything, but said that it had to be done because of political diktat. Will the Minister confirm that that is the view among some officials? If that is the case, it is a worrying state of affairs.</p>
	<p pid=".118.1/17">The Scottish route has been laid out well. I would like to know why the Minister has not taken it. We have been encouraging him for months to do so. I feel rather sorry for him, because I feel that he is not driving the process; I feel that it is being driven by other areas of his party and by other provisions. The good will towards him is understood in this Chamber. I understand that the Prime Minister has been involved, and I want to know, as far as No. 10 is concerned, what sort of timetable has been imposed on the Minister?</p>

	<p pid=".121.2/1">This has been an excellent debate conducted in a generous way. I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1271" name="David Taylor">the Member for North-West Leicestershire (David Taylor)</phrase> on his passionate and well-informed speech, which was based on long experience of the issues, and thank him for the kind words that he offered me.</p>
	<p pid=".121.2/2">Let me make it absolutely clear that there is uncertainty in our prisons and probation system. We are undertaking the biggest ever reform of those services, but I do not accept that the reform process is a mess. Let nobody be under any illusions about the fact that the Minister is driving that reform. Much as I accept the kind words and support&mdash;maternal and otherwise&mdash;from hon. Members, I assure them that the process is being driven forward, but that does not mean that we are not prepared to listen. Some of my previous actions demonstrate that I am prepared to listen, and I will continue to do so because it will be impossible to achieve what we have set out to achieve unless people work together. That requires all of us to work with the work force, management and those who drive policy to ensure that, wherever possible, we gain consensus or at least have a proper and full understanding.</p>
	<p pid=".121.2/3">My hon. Friend spoke about the lack of vision and values, and it might be helpful if I begin by setting out what I regard as the vision and values that drive the development of the National Offender Management Service. A number of them emanate from the work done by Patrick Carter, now Lord Carter, in the report that he presented to the Home Office just over a year ago, which we fully accepted.</p>
	<p pid=".121.2/4">The first issue is that of rebalancing the correctional system. My hon. Friend spoke about the days when the prison population numbered 40,000. I can be precise about the current numbers: there are 75,386 people in prison today, which is many more than all those years ago. What matters most is that the people in prison are those who need to be there. Serious, dangerous, violent or sexual offenders should be in prison for what they have done, and they should be there longer than has been the case in the past. The Criminal Justice Act 2003 and the Sexual Offences Act 2003 will ensure that that happens. However, prison places should not be wastefully taken up by people who are not dangerous. The less serious offenders could be given community sentences and thus put something back for the wrong that they have done. They would be paying the price but could remain at home, being in the community and engaging with the probation service.</p>
	<p pid=".121.2/5">On Monday, I was in Wigston&mdash;it is an area that my hon. Friend will know&mdash;to launch the national clean-up week. Offenders doing community service, which is unpaid work in the community, were refurbishing a sports facility and removing graffiti. That is precisely the kind of punishment that is appropriate for such people. We want to rebalance sentencing so that people are not given short-term prison sentences when they could be doing that sort of pay-back work. We also need to reinvigorate fines to ensure that they are properly enforced.</p>
	<p pid=".121.2/6">We will introduce proposals for a day fine in a management of offenders Bill, which I shall speak about in a moment. It is about rebalancing the system. It will also introduce offender management. At the moment, we have two systems&mdash;the Prison Service and the probation service. Yes, they work closer together than ever, but they are not sufficiently joined up when it comes to the management of individual offenders. We propose introducing a named offender manager for each offender. Each offender will have a sentence plan, and it will be the responsibility of the offender manager to ensure that the plan is fully carried out.</p>
	<p pid=".121.2/7">The offender manager will be accountable. One of the problems with the current system is a lack of accountability for the reducing of reoffending. That accountability will be put in place: that responsibility will be made clear to the offender manager. What we seek is what my hon. Friend called a central spine&mdash;offender managers managing the sentence plan, which could involve a custodial sentence, or intervention in the community, or both&mdash;as it will have a much bigger impact on reoffending.</p>
	<p pid=".121.2/8">The third element is that of contestability, which was mentioned by all Members who spoke this afternoon. As predicted, I will make it absolutely clear this afternoon that contestability is not privatisation. Privatisation means a service being given to the private sector&mdash;work for which the public sector is not permitted to compete. That is what privatisation means, whereas with contestability, all sectors are encouraged to compete for the work. I am actively encouraging the public sector Prison Service and those who run our probation services to gear up and be ready for contestability. I am confident that, with their professionalism, those services will win a great deal of the work. However, I also want the private sector to show us what it can do, and I want the voluntary and community sectors to show us what they can do, too.</p>
	<p pid=".121.2/9">I hope that I am not misquoting my hon. Friend, but I think he said he wanted a mixed economy. I want a mixed economy, but I want it to be based on adding value to the money that we invest. It is not about old-fashioned market testing, or reducing the cost to a minimal level. It is about driving more value out of the money that is invested in our correctional system. In a system that is bigger and in which more money than ever is being invested, I believe that everybody has a part to play; and if we develop that partnership, we can drive more value out of it.</p>
	<p pid=".121.2/10">Let be briefly describe the overall aim of the enterprise. We have to reduce the rates of reoffending. We spend &pound;4 billion a year on our prison and probation services. That is &pound;1 billion a year more than in 1997. Despite spending more, however, three of every five people who come out of prison are reconvicted within two years. We have to do better than that, which is why I seek reform.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-03-16.126.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/866" speakername="Julia Drown" colnum="126"  time="015:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/cm050316/halltext/50316h04.htm#50316h04_spnew0">
	<p pid=".126.1/1">I rise to raise the case of the murders in November 2003 of Julia and William Pemberton by Alan Pemberton. After shooting his wife and 17-year-old son, Alan Pemberton took his own life. Those deaths followed a history of domestic violence to which the police were alerted 15 months before the tragedy.</p>
	<p pid=".126.1/2">A number of the family and friends of Julia and William Pemberton are my constituents. I share their desire to understand the events leading up to that appalling tragedy and to stop similar events happening in future. We ask the Home Secretary, via the Minister, to call for a homicide review, to ask for the conduct of the coroner in the case, Peter Bedford, to be reviewed, and we seek a review of the granting of injunctions in domestic violence cases.</p>
	<p pid=".126.1/3">Many people are familiar with the final moments of Julia Pemberton's life, after the transcript of her 999 call was read to the inquest in September 2004. People heard of Julia's desperate pleas for help, her saying that her husband was approaching, was in the room and then silence, because Alan had found her, hit her and shot her. What is not so well known is the list of police failings leading up to the murders. The family are in no doubt that those failings contributed significantly to the deaths. If the police had done their job properly, we could expect those three people to be alive today.</p>
	<p pid=".126.1/4">The state has a positive duty to protect life. Home Office circular 19/2000 made that clear. It said that a force policy should be issued on domestic violence, making it clear that</p>
	<p pid=".126.1/5" class="indent">&quot;the main duty is to protect the victims and, if applicable, any children from further abuse&quot;,</p>
	<p pid=".126.1/6">that incidents should be investigated fully, and stressing</p>
	<p pid=".126.1/7" class="indent">&quot;the importance of comprehensive record keeping.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".126.1/8">The Thames Valley police failed Julia and William Pemberton in all those areas. The chief executive of Refuge, Sandra Horley, said that, in her 28 years of experience working with women and children escaping from domestic violence, she has never come across such a tragic and preventable series of events.</p>
	<p pid=".126.1/9">The family and I have had many meetings with Thames Valley police. Some have taken place with <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1187" name="David Rendel">the hon. Member for Newbury (Mr. Rendel)</phrase>, where the murders were committed. I am grateful to the police for giving us many hours of their time at those meetings and for answering many questions in writing. However, the family and I remain hugely dissatisfied with their response.</p>
	<p pid=".126.1/10">I have also discussed domestic violence issues with Swindon's police, who are part of the Wiltshire constabulary. They have a far more proactive approach to domestic violence. The difference in attitude is remarkable. I should like to record my appreciation of the commitment of Swindon's police to those issues.</p>
	<p pid=".126.1/11">I share the family's scepticism of the commitment of Thames Valley police to policing domestic violence. We have seen incompetence, complacency and the failure to follow Home Office and Crown Prosecution Service guidelines. That is apparent in the details of the events, and can be seen in the police's refusal, despite many requests from the family, to initiate any sort of inquiry.</p>
	<p pid=".126.1/12">I shall relate the events to the House. In September 2002, Julia informed her husband, Alan, that she wished for a divorce, following years of abuse. Alan threatened to kill Julia and commit suicide. To reinforce that threat, Alan left out in the study his and Julia's wills for Julia and their children to see, with instructions in the event of their deaths for their son William, then aged 15. Alan also scrawled numerous menacing messages in the study.</p>
	<p pid=".126.1/13">A threat to kill is a serious crime, and Julia and her brother, my constituent Frank Mullane, reported those threats repeatedly and persistently to the police in Newbury and begged them to visit the house to see the corroborating evidence. The police promised to attend, but did not. The police recorded the incident as a domestic dispute and did not report it to CID. Instead, the police domestic violence file recorded that further calls from Julia's brother Frank did not need to be responded to fast-time, despite Julia saying that she was willing to make a statement and to press charges.</p>
	<p pid=".126.1/14">After two days of relentless ringing of the police and getting no action, Julia and Frank visited Newbury police station, where they were referred to the domestic violence unit. Julia was advised to take civil action to secure an injunction preventing Alan from entering the family home or communicating with her, with a power of arrest, which she did. The domestic violence co-ordinator wrote a letter in support of that action, in which she stated, with reference to the wills being left out:</p>
	<p pid=".126.1/15" class="indent">&quot;In all my experience as Domestic Violence Co-ordinator I have not come across such a cruel act. I have flagged Julia's address to the effect that&mdash;any incidents from or to the house are to be treated urgently.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".126.1/16">That did not happen. Julia was informed that, if she made a 999 call, even a silent one, the police would be with her within 10 minutes. Again, that did not happen. By failing to visit the house, Thames Valley police failed to witness evidence in situ, so failing to give Julia the protection that she needed. There was no attempt to establish possible escape routes for Julia if Alan tried to enter the house, or to provide her with a safety plan.</p>
	<p pid=".126.1/17">Over the next several months, Julia and members of the family continued to receive numerous threats from Alan Pemberton. In April 2003, Julia and her son William returned from holiday and found the locks of the house superglued. She and her brother Frank reported that incident to the police, who promised that Alan Pemberton would be interviewed. He was not, despite the fact that, as the only likely suspect, he was clearly in breach of the injunction with the power of arrest. The police did not visit the property to collect any evidence. New locks had been fitted since the courts ordered Alan's exit from the house, so the presence of his fingerprints would have been incriminating.</p>
	<p pid=".126.1/18">A month later, Julia was told by the police that the case would not be pursued for lack of evidence and that the crime file was closed. That incident was never linked to the domestic violence unit, although Julia and Frank had repeatedly told the police of the injunction with the power of arrest in place and the death threats. Thames Valley police have since admitted that their handling of that incident was a failing on their part.</p>
	<p pid=".126.1/19">In May 2003, an envelope was hand-delivered to Julia's house addressed to William. Enclosed was a copy of the affidavit that Julia had sworn to secure the injunction. There were several menacing threats scrawled across the affidavit in Alan's handwriting, giving further evidence of his intentions. After seeking legal advice, Julia and her brother Frank delivered the affidavit to Newbury police station and explained the history of death threats, the glued locks and the injunction with the power of arrest in place. They made it very clear to the officer on duty how important that threatening document was, and Frank asked that it be reported to Sergeant Downing, to whom he had reported the original death threats.</p>
	<p pid=".126.1/20">Frank phoned the police after they had left the station, but it fell on deaf ears. Yet again, the police failed to respond appropriately to that third piece of serious evidence. As it is highly likely that Alan had delivered the affidavit to the house, it was a likely further breach of the injunction. It was also evidence of the continuing threatening behaviour of Alan Pemberton, which itself breached the injunction. The family had understood that any breaking of the injunction had to result in an arrest. I should be grateful if the Minister could clarify that.</p>
	<p pid=".126.1/21">Alan did not receive a response from the family, so he personally gave another copy of that document to William, who was aged 16. It is surprising that, as well as not addressing the abuse that Julia suffered, the police seemingly did not consider the seriousness of involving a child in the matter. The police have no record of having received the document, which, after the murders, was found in the closed glued-locks file. However, it took the family to tell the police of the existence of that evidence. Thames Valley police conceded that officers should have visited Alan Pemberton after seeking such evidence and that a lack of basic investigative skills existed. The police claim that they cannot identify the officer who took delivery of the document, despite a very particular description having been given by Frank Mullane.</p>
	<p pid=".126.1/22">In June 2003, Julia met the domestic violence co-ordinator. A panic alarm was subsequently installed in her home. She told the co-ordinator about the ongoing situation, the incidents involving the locks and the affidavit but, yet again, no action was taken to tackle Alan. That was a failure by the police, who should have done more to protect Julia. In terms of preventing a crime in the case, there was a complete disregard of the repeat victimisation suffered by Julia Pemberton; inadequate monitoring of the case; appalling information handling; a lack of supervision of the domestic violence co-ordinator; no training given to domestic violence co-ordinators; and a failure to use any of the available legislation, including that on the breach of injunction and the Protection from Harassment Act 1997.</p>
	<p pid=".126.1/23">More significant was the failure of Thames Valley police to recognise the seriousness of domestic violence and to implement an effective policy. That should have happened following Home Office guidelines issued in 1990&mdash;13 years earlier; surely enough time for them to be implemented, especially when they were reinforced by further guidelines in 2000. Instead, two sets of strong recommendations for a proactive approach to domestic violence incidents through arrest, investigation and recording, which were produced to protect the public, were ignored. Instead, for Thames Valley police, the co-ordinator's role was purely one of liaison, but it should have been more.</p>
	<p pid=".126.1/24">Thames Valley police have tried partly to excuse the failure to investigate the crimes by saying that they have a highly inexperienced force. The family are rightly appalled that the obvious failure to educate and to train officers appropriately should be dismissed so easily. It is shocking that, pre-July 2003, the police authority did not have any domestic violence policy at all. Thames Valley police have told us that they are revising their domestic violence policy. I have seen evidence of that and I welcome it, but concerns remain.</p>
	<p pid=".126.1/25">For example, the new policy will include a risk assessment. Although they have since changed their view, the police's first assessment to the family was that, even under the new policy, Alan Pemberton may not have been classified as high-risk. That statement is shocking, as a domestic violence co-ordinator had already marked the risk as having escalated, so that all incidents to and from the house would be treated urgently. If the new risk assessment model would not have unquestionably classified Alan Pemberton as high-risk, one questions the effectiveness of the entire policy.</p>
	<p pid=".126.1/26">I share the family's concerns about the slowness with which lessons on domestic violence are being learned by Thames Valley police. The family and I have pushed the police to find out what went wrong and to learn lessons from these tragedies. We are concerned that domestic violence has not been taken seriously by past and present chief constables. Home Office research indicates that an apparent lack of direction and managerial commitment to domestic violence results in a marginalisation of domestic violence work. That was the case up to and including November 2003, and we have no confidence that the situation has changed.</p>
	<p pid=".126.1/27">Julia Pemberton was thoroughly disillusioned with the police response. As a health visitor, she was a member of the local domestic violence forum, but she was shocked to find out first-hand the true nature of policing in this area. She was left to take out a private injunction, was advised to move&mdash;an impractical option for her at the time&mdash;and was told to have an aromatherapy bath and relax. One can imagine her feelings&mdash;that utterly trivialised a threat to kill. If what happened were not, literally, deadly serious, it would be farcical.</p>
	<p pid=".126.1/28">Julia reported to her friend, comparing that with the police response to a stolen bike:</p>
	<p pid=".126.1/29" class="indent">&quot;when my son's bike was stolen two police officers turned up at my door. When my husband threatened to kill me, no one was there to help.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".126.1/30">To add further insult to the family, 10 months after she died, Thames Valley police sent Julia a customer satisfaction survey.</p>
	<p pid=".126.1/31">On <phrase class="date" code="2003-11-18">18 November 2003</phrase>, Alan Pemberton arrived at Julia's house, ostensibly to take William for a driving lesson. When Julia heard sounds of commotion outside, she called the police. Her 16-minute 999 call described her fear for her and her son's lives. She reported several gun shots and pleaded for help. The transcript, read out at the inquest, left out crucial parts of the call. During the call, Julia was asked repeatedly to give her address. She sought advice on whether to run or stay, and was told to stay hidden. She questioned why it was taking the police so long to arrive, and was told that police were on their way &quot;now&quot;. Perhaps a minute before she died, she was even led to believe that they were outside the house. She was told to stop screaming and shouting.</p>
	<p pid=".126.1/32">Julia was asked to give directions to her house. It took between 10 and 12 minutes before the property was identified, despite the fact that it was flagged on the police computer and that previously Julia had been told that even a silent 999 call would be responded to urgently. It is sickening to think of how Julia must have felt when it dawned on her&mdash;as it clearly did&mdash;that, despite repeated police promises of a fast response if she ever rang 999, they did not even know where she lived.</p>
	<p pid=".126.1/33">Of course, Julia was not allowed to know that the firearms policy at the time appeared to exclude the option of immediate attendance to firearms incidents. We have heard differing police dispatch times. The first response was unarmed, and left 24 minutes&mdash;not, as she had been led to expect, 10 minutes&mdash;from the start of the call. It took 24 minutes for an unarmed team to be dispatched. By then, William had been shot five times, and Julia four times.</p>
	<p pid=".126.1/34">That unarmed team dispatched to locate the property arrived to see William's body on the drive. In an incredible act of bravery, and contrary to Thames Valley police policy, the three officers&mdash;Hadley, Ainsley and Blackburn&mdash;attempted to help William. The family have thanked those officers and I join them. However, the irony is that the officers who stand out as having done everything, and more, that the family could have expected from the police, were the ones who breached the police's policy.</p>
	<p pid=".126.1/35">What Julia needed was a firearms response, but it was more than one hour after she picked up the phone before the first armed response arrived outside the grounds. Armed units did not enter the house for almost seven hours, despite the fact that no sounds from it had been heard for more than six hours. Instead of going directly to the house, armed units were sent to a remote rendezvous point, and further problems were caused by poor communication among the police. The wrong silver commander was initially called, with the correct one not called for more than an hour after the start of the 999 call. When the silver commander finally arrived, he moved the rendezvous point and did not take command until three hours and 26 minutes after the call started.</p>
	<p pid=".126.1/36">During that time, it was not known whether Julia was dead or alive. The police priority was to preserve the lives of officers rather than the lives of victims. The police justified their lack of action by saying that it was not known whether Alan was still in the house and therefore a danger to the police or the public, even though no noise had been heard by anybody after 7.40 pm, 13 minutes after Julia's call had ended.</p>
	<p pid=".126.1/37">The police have now recognised that their firearms policy was over-cautious. The review of their firearms policy as a result of a similar tragedy at Highmoor means that they may now intervene more quickly and go directly to the house, which is what Julia needed. However, it is critical that future victims are given a true estimate of armed response arrival and, more importantly, whether the police will enter the house on arrival. It is not acceptable that a victim who is relying completely on the advice as they consider their options is told lies, leading them to make potentially fatal choices.</p>
	<p pid=".126.1/38">I turn now to events subsequent to the murders. After the family had an initial meeting with the police, the police refused to meet them again until after the coroner's hearing. That gave the family no option but to put their lives and grieving on hold while they tried to comprehend what had happened. I had to wait months for even a reply to my first letter to the chief constable formally asking for a meeting.</p>
	<p pid=".126.1/39">There are still lessons to be learned from the case, including on action in response to threats of violence and the advice on escape routes and police response times that is given to domestic violence victims. I hope that the Minister will see the necessity of a full homicide review, so that all the issues can be examined and learned from. I realise that he does not have the powers to insist on such a review, but I hope that he will be willing to raise it.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-03-16.131.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/866" speakername="Julia Drown" colnum="131"  time="015:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/cm050316/halltext/50316h04.htm#50316h04_spnew2">
	<p pid=".131.1/1">I thank my hon. and learned Friend for that intervention, and I hope that the Minister can clarify that point for us. The other lessons may also need to be referred to the Department for Constitutional Affairs, and I hope that the Minister will do so.</p>
	<p pid=".131.1/2">In July 2003, Julia returned to the Reading court to have an injunction with a power of arrest renewed. In addition to her original affidavit, she had sworn a further two, detailing the ongoing threats and breaches of the injunction. However, the injunction was reduced to an undertaking. Julia accepted that because it avoided her having to go through a full hearing and because the police were aware of her situation and had installed a panic button. She was led to believe that Alan could be arrested, even without the stronger injunction.</p>
	<p pid=".131.1/3">We can see how the law lets such people down: to avoid a traumatic hearing, protections weaken for victims. Under the Family Law Act 1996, it is clear that the courts should not accept an undertaking when the respondent has used or threatened to use violence, as happened in this case. I hope that the Minister can clarify how that happened and say what could be done to give people better protection through the process&mdash;in particular, whether the police should apply for the injunction rather than the victim.</p>
	<p pid=".131.1/4">On the inquest, the first coroner appointed to the case had legally unacceptable connections with Alan but failed to exclude himself until the family threatened judicial review. I hope that that can be investigated. Even with the actual coroner, there were problems. There are different sorts of coroners' inquests. One has a narrow remit and the other a wider one, which is used if the coroner wants an investigation under article 2 of the European convention on human rights to establish system failure. In such article 2 cases, it is possible for more extensive inquiries to be made. Even if article 2 is not invoked, the coroner has a duty to be alert to the evidence presented and to adjourn if he finds any indication of system failure by an organ of the state. Any scent of system failure that might have contributed to a death should lead to the coroner adjourning the case.</p>
	<p pid=".131.1/5">Initially, the family decided not to pursue article 2, because they wanted to minimise their trauma and they did not have access to all the information. For example, Thames Valley police refused to produce the command and control logs for the family until after the inquest, which prevented them and their solicitor from discovering some of the facts and the extent of the system failure.</p>
	<p pid=".131.1/6">At a preliminary hearing in May 2003, the police defended any moves by the coroner to include witnesses that might indicate that he was widening the interest parameters. The police's attitude can be summed by the words of the barrister at the inquest, who described the gluing of all external locks, which should have been taken seriously as a reason to question Alan Pemberton, as nothing more than &pound;150 worth of damage&mdash;in other words, an accounting entry.</p>
	<p pid=".131.1/7">The family submitted to the coroner before the inquest a statement reminding him of his duty to consider article 2, but it was clear that he had no intention of pursuing that. Yet, as the inquest progressed, it was apparent that there were ample indications of system failure. The Highmoor case, which showed that police firearms policy was over-cautious, was well known to the police by the time of the inquest and should again have been a reason to look at system failure.</p>
	<p pid=".131.1/8">The coroner accepted far too lightly the delays in the police response on the night, suggesting that, for the first dispatch, if one deducts the time of the call, the time delays were less serious. That is crazy, given that the police want victims to stay on the line. The comment that</p>
	<p pid=".131.1/9" class="indent">&quot;The only way . . . Julia Pemberton's life could have been saved would have been if she had had armed police escort throughout the time that she believed she was at risk&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".131.1/10">makes a mockery of the police's duty to protect and preserve life. The coroner failed to pick up glaring contradictions given by the Thames Valley police officers at the hearing, which revealed the further need to review the case. These inconsistencies should have given rise to serious questions as to what happened.</p>
	<p pid=".131.1/11">The coroner showed a total lack of compassion and sensitivity towards the family of Julia and William Pemberton and in particular to Laura, the surviving daughter. He expressed no acknowledgement of the family's grief and offered no words of encouragement to Laura. Perhaps most revealing was when he remarked that William could not have done something to deserve being shot, implying that Julia did. In view of all those failings I hope that the Minister will agree to get that behaviour looked at, to consider a homicide review of the whole case and to look at how injunctions need to be dealt with in future.</p>
	<p pid=".131.1/12">This is about the two people who are killed every week in this country from domestic violence. I hope that the Minister will also agree that an apology is due to the family from the police and the coroner. It would be a comfort to this grieving family to know that their unstinting work has achieved something for others who might otherwise face the trauma that Julia and William faced on that horrific night and in the months that led up to those fatal moments.</p>

	<p pid=".133.0/1">My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/866" name="Julia Drown">the Member for South Swindon (Ms Drown)</phrase> will appreciate that by outlining the case in great detail she has not left me much time to respond, but I will do so as fully as I can. May I begin by congratulating her on bringing the tragic case of Julia and William Pemberton to the attention of the House this afternoon? I join with my hon. and learned Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/709" name="Vera Baird">the Member for Redcar (Vera Baird)</phrase> in paying tribute to the way she has pursued the issue and others in this place on behalf of her constituents. It is important when we develop policy that we do so in a way that is informed by cases such as this tragic one, so that we get our policies right and make them more effective.</p>
	<p pid=".133.0/2">It was concern about precisely this kind of tragic case that gave the momentum to the legislation which my hon. and learned Friend mentioned, the Domestic Violence, Crime and Victims Act, which it was my privilege last year to take through the House. It received Royal Assent in November. There are some relevant measures within that Act which I hope will give my hon. Friend some reassurance.</p>
	<p pid=".133.0/3">There are two main messages. The first is to victims of domestic violence: the Government and the law are on their side and they can expect that the law will move more swiftly to their aid. Just as important, the message to the perpetrators of domestic violence is that their behaviour will no longer be tolerated and that if they persist in that behaviour they will feel the full weight and force of the law as it bears down upon them.</p>
	<p pid=".133.0/4">It might be helpful if I mentioned some specific measures in the Act that are relevant. First, it makes common assault an arrestable offence. That means that it will now be a police matter whether to arrest when called out to a domestic violence incident when there has been an assault. In other words, there will no longer be the burden on the victim to press charges. Secondly, it criminalises the breach of a non-molestation order and changes the law, so that the police can always arrest for breach. Where a non-molestation order has been issued, breaching it will always be a criminal offence and therefore will attract the power of arrest. Again, that shifts the burden of responsibility for enforcement from the victim to the criminal justice system.</p>
	<p pid=".133.0/5">I hope that my hon. Friend is reassured that the new power addresses one of the key points that she raised. In other words, the power of arrest will automatically be attached to every breach of an order. She mentioned the specific case involving Julia. The problem seems to have been that the order was downgraded to an undertaking and that her understanding of what that undertaking meant in terms of the power of arrest was not actually what could happen. We must ensure as we go forward that everyone&mdash;the police and the courts&mdash;are clearer about the new powers that exist.</p>
	<p pid=".133.0/6">We are extending the availability of restraining orders to cover all violent offences. Following any violent incident, courts will now have the power to issue a restraining order against a perpetrator or potential perpetrator. We are also introducing local multi-agency homicide reviews. During 2005, we shall commence the introduction of homicide reviews for all domestic violence-related homicides, so that local agencies can learn lessons and adjust their policies and procedures accordingly. I shall say a little more about that in a moment.</p>
	<p pid=".133.0/7">I know that my hon. Friend has a specific concern about whether there could be a domestic homicide review in relation to this case. She acknowledged&mdash;indeed, my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Redcar made it clear&mdash;that there are new provisions for domestic homicide reviews to take place. We are developing guidance on that. The reviews will not be mandatory. We want them to be light-touch investigations that improve practice, so that local agencies can make the necessary changes, but there will be a reserve power for the Secretary of State to order such a review if there is a lack of willingness and it is considered necessary for that to take place.</p>
	<p pid=".133.0/8">My understanding is that there is not a power for that to be operated retrospectively, but given that the issue has been raised this afternoon, it will need further clarification. My noble Friend Baroness Scotland will meet my hon. Friend and members of the family in the near future. I hope that, by the time that that meeting takes place, we can be clear on whether there is a retrospective power. I do not believe that there is that power, but I undertake to provide clarity on that. Having said that, there would be nothing to prevent the local agencies from deciding to conduct such a review themselves. Already in certain parts of the country and certainly in London on occasion, the agencies voluntarily agree to undertake a review. It is a deeply serious point that we should learn from every tragedy wherever we can.</p>
	<p pid=".133.0/9">My hon. Friend will understand that, although we all look forward to the introduction of the important measures in the Domestic Violence, Crime and Victims Act, the question whether there is a retrospective power will need further clarification. She will also understand that, although I have responsibility for the law and policy in relation to coroners services, I do not carry the authority to discipline coroners or to take any view about their conduct. That is a matter for the Lord Chancellor and the Department for Constitutional Affairs, but I will draw to the Lord Chancellor's attention the comments that she has made this afternoon.</p>
	<p pid=".133.0/10">The 2004 Act will give us new powers to ensure that the victim in cases of domestic violence is better protected, but in the end we are trying to change the culture&mdash;the custom and practice&mdash;so that all criminal justice agencies operate with the interests of victims of domestic violence at the heart of everything that they do. Domestic violence homicide reviews will help to change the culture, as will the more certain powers that we have, but we must make it clear that the victim is our top priority.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-03-16.135.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1073" speakername="Anne McIntosh" colnum="135"  time="016:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/cm050316/halltext/50316h05.htm#50316h05_spnew0">
	<p pid=".135.1/1">I am grateful for the opportunity to debate this very serious issue, which will become an increasing problem when the Clean Neighbourhoods and Environment Bill is eventually passed. I am delighted to see that the Solicitor-General is present and I welcome her to the debate. We have had one or two exchanges across the Floor of the House, but this is our first opportunity to consider the issue in depth.</p>
	<p pid=".135.1/2">My starting point is the excellent explanatory notes that the Government prepared in readiness for the debates on that Bill, which has been revised and is due to receive its Second Reading in the House of Lords. Paragraph 303 on page 43 of the explanatory notes states:</p>
	<p pid=".135.1/3" class="indent">&quot;The Bill contains a number of new reverse burdens of proof (which means that, to take advantage of a defence provided, the accused is required to demonstrate his innocence once the prosecution has proved certain facts, rather than the prosecution being required to prove the accused's guilt on all issues). A reverse burden can be legal, where the burden is on the accused to prove that the defence applies to him on a balance of probabilities, or evidential, where the accused must bring sufficient evidence for the defence to be an issue, and then the prosecution must disprove the defence.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".135.1/4">I pause momentarily to remind you, Mr. Deputy Speaker, and the House that I am a Scottish advocate, albeit a non-practising one. My recollection of environmental crimes incurring a reverse burden of proof some 20 years ago is rather hazy, so studying the Bill, other legislation and some of the court cases has provided an opportunity to update my knowledge.</p>
	<p pid=".135.1/5">My worst fears were confirmed during the remaining stages of the Clean Neighbourhoods and Environment Bill, including Third Reading, on <phrase class="date" code="2005-02-21">21 February</phrase> this year. The Minister for Rural Affairs and Local Environmental Quality, who led for the Government at that stage and though all the stages of the Bill, intervened on me to clarify the position. He said:</p>
	<p pid=".135.1/6" class="indent">&quot;If people do not like the fixed penalty notice, they do not have to pay the penalty, but they must then go to court and marshal their defence at that point.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".135.1/7">I understand from questions that the Solicitor-General has replied to that it will not be for the Crown Prosecution Service to prosecute environmental crimes under the Bill, or any other environmental crimes; it will be for the local authorities to do so. However, there was confirmation from the Minister for Rural Affairs and Local Environmental Quality that the accused will have to go to court to prove their innocence and incur considerable expense in the process. That alarmed not just me, but my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/929" name="John Gummer">the Member for Suffolk, Coastal (Mr. Gummer)</phrase>, who said on that occasion:</p>
	<p pid=".135.1/8" class="indent">&quot;The worry about fixed penalty notices is that, if they are issued willy-nilly, people are put in an extremely difficult position in deciding whether they should go through all the hassle of going to court and many people will therefore give way. We want to ensure that fixed penalty notices are not issued without due care, and I understand that that is what new clause 6 is supposed to do.&quot;&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2005-02-21.49"><i>Official Report</i>, 21 February 2005; Vol. 431, c. 49</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid=".135.1/9">Some concern about the reverse burden of proof was expressed in relation to other legislation. I refer in particular to the passage of the Criminal Justice and Police Bill in 2000&ndash;01. I do not have the <i>Official Report</i> reference, so I shall refer to an excellent note prepared for me by the House of Commons Library, quoting research paper number one of 10. It refers in particular to the concerns that the civil liberties pressure group, Liberty, expressed. Those concerns are as valid as the arguments that I present to the Solicitor-General this afternoon. Liberty is quoted as saying:</p>
	<p pid=".135.1/10" class="indent">&quot;We are concerned that these provisions are a further manifestation of the trend to mix criminal and civil law procedures. This dilutes the principles and protections of criminal law in particular the presumption of innocence and the burden of proof. Although these procedures will not attract a criminal conviction, they relate to behaviour that is by definition criminal and can lead to a criminal conviction if a penalty is not accepted.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".135.1/11">The quotation continues:</p>
	<p pid=".135.1/12" class="indent">&quot;We are particularly concerned that a penalty can be issued if an officer has reason to believe a penalty offence has been committed (Cl. 2(1)). This is a lesser standard than the criminal burden of proof.</p>
	<p pid=".135.1/13" class="indent">If a person provided with the notice goes to court to protest his or her innocence rather than pay the fine, the burden of proof the police will be expected to establish is beyond reasonable doubt. The practical implications of this are that there will undoubtedly be a large number of people challenging these notices, causing not only the administrative burden of issuing fixed penalty notices, but also upon the courts.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".135.1/14">I hope that the Solicitor-General will address some specific points in her response. The Library note on the reverse burden of proof prepared for me for today's debate has confirmed one point. We are all aware of the most recent court cases&mdash;namely, the House of Lords decision in Sheldrake in 2004 and R <i>v. </i>Johnson in 2003&mdash;and the Court of Appeal guidance on reverse burdens in the Attorney-General's reference No. 1 in 2004. Since the Human Rights Act 1998 was passed, we have seen an increasing commitment from this Government to reverse burdens of proof. According to the House of Commons Library note, as the use of reverse burdens grew, one difficulty was that draftsmen of parliamentary legislation did not always make clear whether defendants were to bear the legal burden of proof or an evidential burden. Since the Human Rights Act came into force, with section 3 requiring courts in so far as it is possible to interpret legislation in a way that is compatible with the convention rights, the new feature has seen the possibility of reading down legislation in cases where putting the legal burden on a defendant would be incompatible with convention rights, but putting the evidential burden on him might not be.</p>
	<p pid=".135.1/15">Those people who do not wish to express or recognise any guilt for offences&mdash;quite serious environmental crimes, which we all agree must be routed out&mdash;will increasingly have no alternative if they wish to proclaim their innocence but to refuse to pay the fixed penalty notice and go to court. There is concern that that will put a lot of pressure on the court system and that it may not be able to cope.</p>
	<p pid=".135.1/16">One aspect of the law that should have been addressed in the Clean Neighbourhoods and Environment Bill was not. I am referring to farmers or landowners who have vast tracts of land, often do not have the time to visit all of it, and who are the innocent recipients of waste that is dumped on their land. It could be hazardous waste, toxic waste, chemical waste or building waste. If the land is privately owned, the Environment Agency is charged with removing the waste at taxpayers' expense. However, the landowner is deemed guilty of an environmental crime. That will come into force under the Bill. It is currently before the House of Lords, so it could still be amended, except that it will be considered only on Second Reading, and not in Committee or on Report because of the timing of the general election.</p>
	<p pid=".135.1/17">It seems that there is a huge imbalance. An environmental crime has been perpetrated wilfully by an individual, but the onus of removing the waste is placed on an innocent party. I think that the phrase used is that it will be their decision whether or not they remove that waste and, if they do, it will be at their expense.</p>
	<p pid=".135.1/18">The only remedy that the innocent party will have under the new provisions in the Bill is that the police can catch and prosecute the perpetrator and then the cost to the landowner of removing the waste could be recovered. That was always our stance and we are delighted that the Government have adopted our position by making fly-tipping an arrestable offence. I welcome the opportunity to place on the record our worries and, hopefully, I shall receive a positive response from the Solicitor-General.</p>
	<p pid=".135.1/19">I think that the Solicitor-General said that, over the past six years, there has not been much opportunity to count the number of cases. The House of Commons Library has said that it would take substantial research to go through all the legislation. We are told that, in 1996, 219 examples of legal burdens or presumptions operating against a defendant were found in 540 offences that were triable in the Crown court. It said that, since then, no proper research has been carried out into such matters. However, for the purposes of this afternoon's debate, the Solicitor-General might have undertaken such research. We regret the drift towards the reverse burden of proof. We envisage a situation in which we shall rely much more on a party proving his innocence through no other means than by his having to go to court.</p>
	<p pid=".135.1/20">Let us consider the even more regrettable situation in which an innocent landowner is left with the task of removing waste that has been dumped on his land without his permission. Such serious environmental crimes are covered under the Clean Neighbourhoods and Environment Bill. I hope that that the Government will table amendments to clarify the position and to make sure that the situation that we envisage can be stopped in its tracks.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-03-16.138.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/939" speakername="Harriet Harman" colnum="138"  time="016:14:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/cm050316/halltext/50316h05.htm#50316h05_spnew2">
	<p pid=".138.1/1">We do not have vast stretches of countryside in my constituency, but we have plenty of fly-tippers, and plenty of people with loads of tyres on the back of lorries that they want to dump somewhere. So we are familiar with some of the issues, although perhaps on a different scale. I will get to that point in a moment.</p>
	<p pid=".138.1/2">I shall start with the general principle. The majority of criminal offences require the prosecution to prove all elements of the offence to the criminal standard&mdash;that is, beyond reasonable doubt. The principle that a person is innocent until proved guilty has always been a foundation of our common law; that principle is now reinforced by the direct application of article 6 of the European convention on human rights to the UK following the introduction of the Human Rights Act 1998. So, any unfairness that might otherwise have required people to wait to get all the way to Strasbourg can be judged right now in domestic court proceedings.</p>
	<p pid=".138.1/3">However there are a number of offences, some of long standing, where the burden of proof relating to some issues may be transferred to the defendant. These typically arise where an exception is provided and the accused must demonstrate that he falls within it, or where there is some excusing circumstance of which only the accused has knowledge. Those are typically the two bases.</p>
	<p pid=".138.1/4">Where the burden is transferred to the defendant, it may be a legal or an evidential burden, depending on the intention of the legislation. A reverse legal burden requires the defendant to discharge the burden but to the lower standard of the balance of probabilities. An evidential burden requires only that a defendant raise an issue in evidence, and once properly raised it falls back on to the prosecutor to disprove the matter beyond reasonable doubt.</p>
	<p pid=".138.1/5">The Court of Appeal and the House of Lords have considered the circumstances in which reverse legal burdens will be found to be reasonable and proportionate on a number of occasions since the implementation of the Human Rights Act 1998. They have identified a number of principles to be applied in considering whether a reverse legal burden will be compatible with article 6(2), most recently, as the hon. Lady said, in the case of Sheldrake. In that case, the House of Lords confirmed that the European convention on human rights does not outlaw presumptions of fact or law but requires that they should be kept within reasonable limits and should not be arbitrary. That has to apply not in the generality but to each and every specific offence that we are considering. The effect of the court's decision is that the overall burden of proving the offence should remain on the prosecution and that the trial of the issue should be fair. A reverse burden will be deemed compatible only so long as it is in pursuit of a legitimate aim, it is justified and it is proportionate to the overall aim of the legislation.</p>
	<p pid=".138.1/6">A simple example with which the hon. Lady will be familiar is the case of a defendant stopped in public while carrying a bladed article. Under the Criminal Justice Act 1988 he has a defence if he can show that he had it in a public place for a good reason: for example, he is a carpet fitter on his way to work. The courts have found that the reverse legal burden on the defendant to prove that good reason on the balance of probabilities is fair and proportionate. The defendant is in the best position in that sort of case to prove that he had a good reason, and the prosecution continues to bear the burden of proving all the other elements of the offence: the fact of possession, the fact that the defendant was in a public place and the fact that there was a bladed article.</p>
	<p pid=".138.1/7">One environmental example, which has been found to be compatible with the ECHR, is the offence of fly-posting under the Town and Country Planning Act 1990. That offence is intended to tackle the problem of businesses fly-posting walls, advertising hoardings and other street furniture with posters advertising their event. The offence has a reverse burden in that a person is guilty of this offence if he is the owner of the land covered by the posters or if it is his business that is being advertised, unless he can prove that the posters were being displayed without his consent or knowledge.</p>
	<p pid=".138.1/8">That reverse burden was supported by the courts recently in the case of Savvas. The Court of Appeal found that there was a reverse burden of proof in relation to knowledge and consent. To place a reverse burden of proof on persons whose business was promoted by fly-posting was determined to be reasonable and proportionate, as it was in the public interest, the exception was easy for the accused to prove, and of course, it was only on the balance of probabilities.</p>
	<p pid=".138.1/9">I understand that the hon. Lady may have some concerns, which she has expressed, about the reverse burdens of proof in the Clean Neighbourhoods and Environment Bill, which she indeed raised on Report. The central purpose of the Bill is to improve the local environment that directly affects people's quality of life wherever they live. It provides enhanced powers for local authorities and the Environment Agency to tackle local environmental quality and antisocial behaviour. I mention that because those reverse burdens do not arise in a vacuum; they are about remedying a problem through legislation. As well as having to be fair, they must be proportionate to the problem that is to be addressed.</p>
	<p pid=".138.1/10">The Bill contains reverse burdens of proof for a number of offences, and I will explain some of the reasons behind this in a minute. However, before I do, I should stress that this Bill has been, and will continue to be, subject to the usual checks and balances to ensure that it does not contravene the ECHR. The Bill has passed through the House of Commons and is currently waiting for its Second Reading in the Lords. The Joint Committee on Human Rights has published the results of its consideration of the Bill, stating that it accepted</p>
	<p pid=".138.1/11" class="indent">&quot;the statement in the Explanatory Notes that the new reverse burdens in the Bill are compatible with the presumption of innocence in Article 6(2) ECHR&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".138.1/12">So, it has been given a clean bill of health by that Committee.</p>
	<p pid=".138.1/13">My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs signed a statement confirming that the Bill is compatible with the European convention on human rights, as did Lord Whitty of Camberwell for the purposes of the Bill's introduction in the House of Lords. The Government consulted extensively for two years on many of the Bill's measures and no complaints about reverse burdens were registered with the Government by groups such as Liberty, with which there has been an exchange of correspondence. Indeed, the Minister for Rural Affairs and Local Environmental Quality offered Liberty a meeting if it had any concerns, and it did not take that offer up. If it has concerns&mdash;or if the hon. Lady's concerns are the same as its concerns&mdash;there is no reason why such a meeting should not take place. The Bill is not something that has not been examined and thought through.</p>
	<p pid=".138.1/14">Some of the reverse burdens in the Clean Neighbourhoods and Environment Bill slightly amend or improve existing reverse burdens introduced by the then Government in the Environmental Protection Act 1990 and the Town and Country Planning Act 1990. Appropriate reverse burdens have been around in environment legislation in relation to fly-tipping, litter control notices and fly-posting for some time.</p>
	<p pid=".138.1/15">I am aware, however, of two new examples of reverse burdens on nuisance vehicles in the Bill, which I understand the hon. lady queried on Report in the House of Commons. Clauses 3 and 4 of the Bill make it an offence to sell two or more cars on the same road as part of a business or to repair a vehicle on the road as part of a business. That is something we know about in Camberwell and Peckham&mdash;I say that with some feeling.</p>
	<p pid=".138.1/16">A person cannot be found guilty by the courts of those two offences if the defence proves to the satisfaction of the court that he or she was not selling or repairing the vehicles as part of a business. Those two clauses therefore create a legal reverse burden of proof, as the defendant is required to prove something to avoid being found guilty. However, the prosecution first has to prove that the defendant had two cars on sale for the question of a defence to arise in the first place.</p>
	<p pid=".138.1/17">The offences are targeting the rogue trader, not the private seller. Two or more vehicles being advertised for sale on the same road suggests the presence of a business venture. Local authorities have told us they have great difficulty in proving that an individual is acting in the course of a business when the transaction occurs in the street. In the unlikely case of a private seller selling two or more vehicles, it would be easy for them to prove through Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency documentation that the vehicles were registered in their own or their family's name and that it just so happened that the vehicles were being sold at the same time. It is easily proved through the DVLA that such vehicles are being sold and that such people are not traders trading on behalf of someone else.</p>
	<p pid=".138.1/18">The burden of proof is not on the basis of beyond reasonable doubt but on the basis of the balance of probabilities. That is a common-sense approach, particularly when the alternative is considered. That would be far more invasive; to put the burden on the prosecution would require intrusive powers to be given, for example, to examine paperwork or bank accounts. It is more humane to the defendant to say, &quot;Well, you produce the information,&quot; rather than to say, &quot;We are coming in to get it&quot;. It makes it cheaper for local authorities.</p>
	<p pid=".138.1/19">The hon. Lady might also be interested to know a cross-departmental group on ECHR issues in criminal law meets every two months. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, the Environment Agency and the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister are represented on that group. A sub-group examines reverse burdens. So, a machinery of Government incarnation addresses her preoccupations. It constantly examines what the courts are saying and seeks to ensure both that such things are being kept track of and that whenever the courts say something, we ensure that we comply with it.</p>
	<p pid=".138.1/20">The hon. Lady talked briefly about mixing criminal and civil law procedures together. So long as we have the right safeguards, we should not be hung up about which jurisdiction is involved. We just want the law to make common sense for people, for it to be fair and for it to address the problem that presents itself. I am sure that it would be useful if she had a meeting with the Minister for Rural Affairs and Local Environmental Quality to discuss the issues further. I would also be happy to do so at any time.</p>
	<p pid=".138.1/21" class="indent">It being half-past Four o'clock, the motion for the Adjournment of the sitting lapsed, without Question put.</p>
