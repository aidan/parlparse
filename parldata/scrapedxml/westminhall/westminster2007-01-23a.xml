<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-01-23a.381.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1967" speakername="Tom Clarke" colnum="381"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070123/halltext/70123h0001.htm#07012336000458">
	<p pid="a.381.2/1">My objective today is perfectly straightforward&mdash;to discourage energy companies from using the fluctuations in wholesale prices as an excuse for unacceptably high domestic energy bills. The issue affects every household in my constituency, particularly pensioners and families on low incomes with young children, and it causes financial misery to consumers. Today, I shall focus on two key themes: the lag between wholesale prices and retail prices, and low-income families suffering high energy costs, including families in which there are disabled adults or disabled children.</p>
	<p pid="a.381.2/2">It is my intention to explore every avenue with all relevant bodies. I have written to Ofgem&mdash;the Office of Gas and Electricity Markets&mdash;which has a duty to consumers, and to the Office of Fair Trading, which has a duty to ensure that, frankly, a cartel is not operating against the public interest. The problem that I am discussing will not simply go away, and my activity will continue until pressure is brought to bear on energy suppliers to reduce the inflated prices unfairly charged to all households. In that spirit, I very much welcome the debate and the presence of my hon. Friend the Minister.</p>
	<p pid="a.381.2/3">Last summer, as I travelled around my constituency, the issue uppermost in the minds of constituents was the rocketing prices for gas and electricity. The price of both had gone up substantially, leaving those consumers helpless or in debt from dealing with the problem. Of course, they had the option of moving from one supplier to another, but they were not exactly imbued with confidence in doing so. No sooner had they moved supplier than they discovered that the price had gone up again. That was a recurring story.</p>
	<p pid="a.381.2/4">I carried out some research on the industry and discovered that energy companies were simply leapfrogging one another with increases. The information available to me at the time showed that average annual gas bills had risen by 63.3 per cent. and average annual electricity bills had risen by 44.2 per cent. since 2003. No other product or commodity has risen in price so steeply during that period, and energy is not a luxury; it is a necessity.</p>
	<p pid="a.381.2/5">At the time, I was completely focused on how to achieve the lowest possible gas and electricity prices for all households in my constituency. I was to conclude that there was more likelihood of achieving something much more meaningful on a Lanarkshire-wide basis than in one parliamentary constituency. I contacted all my Lanarkshire MP colleagues on <phrase class="date" code="">13 June</phrase>, seeking their agreement that the matter should be further explored, with the possibility of producing a broad strategic approach that would benefit every household throughout Lanarkshire. Only a couple of weeks after the consultations began with my colleagues, Scottish Power announced higher prices effective from <phrase class="date" code="2006-07-10">10 July 2006</phrase>, which saw electricity prices rise by an average of 10 per cent., while gas prices rose by a staggering average of 17 per cent. I shall return to the current figures later; at this point, I want to develop my remarks on the outstanding role played by my parliamentary colleagues in Lanarkshire.</p>
	<p pid="a.381.2/6">Numerous factors motivated us to write to all energy suppliers. Domestic energy costs are a consumer issue, and we had received complaints from constituents. There had been intolerable increases in gas and electricity bills between 2003 and 2006. Last but not least, we wanted the best consumer energy price for our constituents in Lanarkshire.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-01-23a.390.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2007" speakername="Jim Sheridan" colnum="390"  time="010:09:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070123/halltext/70123h0002.htm#07012336000466">
	<p pid="a.390.1/1">As usual, my right hon. Friend makes an extremely valuable point. At this juncture, I would like to give credit to citizens advice bureaux for the advice they give consumers on energy prices and other issues. One of life's imponderables for me is what would happen to those people if organisations such as the citizens advice bureaux were not there to help them. My right hon. Friend has made an absolutely valid point.</p>
	<p pid="a.390.1/2">Many consumers are already having trouble paying for their energy costs as a result of the 60 per cent. increase in the cost of an average electricity bill since January 2003. Most pre-payment meter customers do not receive frequent&mdash;that is, quarterly&mdash;statements of account, so they will be unaware they are building up significant debts. Although suppliers have plans to replace their token meters with smarter key or card meters over the next one to five years, 700,000 of their customers are still at risk of falling further into debt over the next few years.</p>
	<p pid="a.390.1/3">Consumers with token pre-payment meters have already experienced, or are set to experience, an overnight price shock which may amount to a 138 per cent. increase in their weekly energy bill. The limitations of token meters were less visible when energy prices were more stable or&mdash;if anyone can remember this&mdash;decreasing. Price increases since have exposed the clear deficiencies of meters. For example, electricity prices have increased by 60 per cent. since January 2003 with each supplier raising its prices one, two or even three times a year during this period.</p>
	<p pid="a.390.1/4">The problem with token meters is that suppliers' recalibration processes have not been keeping track with the price rises, which means that consumers using those meters may not be paying the correct price for their electricity. That problem may push large numbers of consumers into debt. Furthermore, when the meters are eventually recalibrated a consumer may get hit with a substantial price shock, especially if their meter has not been recalibrated for a year or two, on top of the debts that had built up over the period. Energywatch are calling on the three suppliers who continue this practice to follow the lead of the other big three and end it.</p>
	<p pid="a.390.1/5">I shall now give hon. Members a short case study. A token meter consumer in Glasgow contacted Energywatch after receiving a statement from her supplier stating that she owed &pound;245, which had accrued since 2001. The consumer did not understand how the debt had been built up as she uses a pre-payment meter. The supplier had attempted to collect the debt at &pound;6 a week, which the consumer could not afford as she is on benefits. After Energywatch, to its credit, took up her complaint the supplier agreed to write off the debt.</p>
	<p pid="a.390.1/6">Consumers paying for their energy through pre-payment meters pay on average &pound;173 more a year for gas and &pound;113 more a year for electricity compared with someone paying by quarterly bill. For someone on benefits, as many of our constituents are, or on low incomes, this is money they cannot afford. Suppliers have done little to ease the hardship of pre-payment meter users, a third of whom are single parents with dependent children, and a third of whom are unemployed and in receipt of benefits. Citizens Advice Scotland recommend that suppliers should equalise tariffs between PPMs and other payment methods for both gas and electricity, as this would make a real difference to many of the most vulnerable people. Citizens Advice has joined forces with Energywatch to campaign to end the practice of back charging. We urge the suppliers that are still back charging&mdash;Scottish Power, npower and Powergen&mdash;to follow the good practice of the other suppliers and act responsibly towards their customers, by implementing price increases only when they manually reset meters.</p>
	<p pid="a.390.1/7">As has already been said, the Government have done a great deal to help with winter fuel costs, but as my right hon. Friend the Member for Coatbridge, Chryston and Bellshill said, the more that they do to help people less fortunate than ourselves, the more the major energy suppliers seem to exploit that situation.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-01-23a.391.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1783" speakername="Susan Kramer" colnum="391"  time="010:20:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070123/halltext/70123h0002.htm#07012336000467">
	<p pid="a.391.0/1">I join others in congratulating <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1967" name="Tom Clarke">the right hon. Member for Coatbridge, Chryston and Bellshill (Mr. Clarke)</phrase> on securing this debate on such a crucial issue. With the cold snap that we have experienced over the past couple of days, hon. Members will be conscious that some people have decided not to turn the heat up to the level at which it should be for their health and security, because they are exceedingly worried about the energy bills that will result.</p>
	<p pid="a.391.0/2">The energy market is one in which there seems to be precious little transparency. As hon. Members have said, some suppliers still plead the need to keep consumer prices high, when the wholesale price for gas has been in sharp decline for months. From March 2006 to December 2006, domestic gas bills rose by about 30 per cent., while wholesale prices fell by 40 per cent. Given that evidence, there is a prima facie case for arguing that the energy suppliers have sticky or jammy fingers, so we need a coherent response from Ofgem about the issue.</p>
	<p pid="a.391.0/3">There are underlying problems with energy supply. Both Conservative and Labour Governments have been pretty complacent following the discovery of North sea oil some 40 years. We have lacked long-term investment in pipelines and in gas storage, and even more so in renewables and in conservation, and we are now paying the price of that. However, to stick with the immediate present, according to Alistair Buchanan of Ofgem, many of the current gas supply constraints have been dealt with. The Langeled pipeline and the Balgzand Bacton line are completed, open and functioning. The rough gas storage facility in Yorkshire that was damaged by fire has been restored and is back up and running, while the interconnector gas pipeline between the UK and Belgium has been upgraded. With all those projects, the UK will, at least from February onwards, receive an additional 140 cubic metres of gas a day, as compared with last summer. If we add to that the absence of severe weather disruptions such as last year's hurricane in the United States, it becomes even harder to understand the current pattern of consumer pricing for gas and&mdash;as that gas flows through&mdash;electricity bills.</p>
	<p pid="a.391.0/4">One hears a variety numbers&mdash;it is a soul-destroying fact that, as far as I can see, every organisation measures things differently. However, the average household now faces a bill of some &pound;1,000 a year for its energy. Energywatch estimates that the standard credit energy bill in Britain is &pound;642 for gas and &pound;388 for electricity, giving a total of &pound;1,030. For many people that is about to get worse. British Gas, with its most exquisite sense of timing, has announced that it will charge &pound;5 for late payments of bills. The company says that it will not charge the most vulnerable, but I am always curious about the definition of &quot;vulnerable&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.391.0/5">Many people have been surviving because bills have been capped under various schemes from the energy companies, although such capping is offset in the financial markets, so it is not a gift horse from the companies. Powergen and Scottish Power's deals rolled off at the end of 2006, and British Gas's deal rolls off in April. Some households will experience a 70 per cent. increase in their bills as the capping programmes come to a close. We all recognise that new investment in infrastructure is vital, but Ofgem has allowed an increase in the return on capital to the energy suppliers, which will rise from 4.2 per cent. to 4.4 per cent. It is estimated that that will mean a further &pound;10 on gas bills and &pound;2 to &pound;3 on electricity bills. In a time of rising prices, all that is compounding an already unacceptable situation.</p>
	<p pid="a.391.0/6">The consumer is worse hit than that, because prices roll through into the inflation figures. Energy prices are a key component of inflation pressure through the consumer prices index and the retail prices index, with the resulting fear that increases will lead to higher wage demands and wage pressure. Indeed, that was a major part of the Bank of England's decision to raise interest rates to 5.25 per cent. earlier this month. Many people think that they will rise to 5.5 per cent. next month, which will also hit both the poor and the well-off consumer.</p>
	<p pid="a.391.0/7"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1730" name="Nick Brown">The right hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, East and Wallsend (Mr. Brown)</phrase> and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2007" name="Jim Sheridan">the hon. Member for Paisley and Renfrewshire, North (Jim Sheridan)</phrase> talked about fuel poverty. The number of vulnerable households in fuel poverty has doubled in the past two years, as the Minister will be well aware, to about 2 million. I should be interested to hear whether the Minister thinks that the Government target of eliminating fuel poverty by 2010 is now even feasible, given the recent rise in prices and the behaviour of the energy companies.</p>
	<p pid="a.391.0/8">We have also had an extensive and helpful discussion about meters and the problems in recalibration. There are about 1 million token meters in the UK. I asked Energywatch what it thought the differential was between the typical householder paying by token and those paying by direct debit, and the answer was &pound;180 a year, which is a rather different figure. That means that the winter fuel allowance for some is gone in one fell swoop. That is a huge differential. I struggle to think of any other retail industry that charges its highest prices to the least well-off and its lowest prices to the better-off. That is a complete reversal.</p>
	<p pid="a.391.0/9">The programme for smart metering, which could resolve the problem and put the energy companies in a position to charge the most vulnerable the same prices as the better-off, has been moving at a snail's pace. That issue must be tackled. I have written to British Gas, Scottish Power, npower and Powergen, which are the four companies that are charging back charges for deferred recalibration, to ask why on earth they are following that practice. The hon. Member for Paisley and Renfrewshire, North was eloquent in discussing those issues. Scottish and Southern Energy Group and EDF Energy do not feel the need to impose those back charges on people.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-01-23a.406.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1707" speakername="John Leech" colnum="406"  time="011:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070123/halltext/70123h0004.htm#07012336000482">
	<p pid="a.406.3/1">I agree, but one of the problems stems from significant underfunding of the police force while the Conservatives were in power before 1997.</p>
	<p pid="a.406.3/2">On the crime figures, the hon. Member for Stockport suggests in her amendment that she</p>
	<p pid="a.406.3/3" class="indent">&quot;looks forward to continuing improvement of police performance in reducing crime.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.406.3/4">Unfortunately, total crimes in Greater Manchester were up by 4.5 per cent. in the period from December 2005 until November 2006 compared with the previous year. Violent crimes are up by 9.4 per cent. and robberies increased by 11.7 per cent. in the same period.</p>
	<p pid="a.406.3/5">Only last Friday I attended a meeting of my local action partnership in Chorlton, at which the local police sergeant reported further rises in burglaries and robberies in the Chorlton area in just the past six months. It is true to say, and the hon. Lady's amendment points out, that the number of police community support officers should rise to 828 by <phrase class="date" code="">30 April 2007</phrase>. More PCSOs are a useful additional&mdash;I say &quot;additional&quot;&mdash;resource for the police, but they are no substitute for police officers. However, even these PCSO increases are being axed following the Government's decision to scrap plans to fund an increase in numbers to 1,238.</p>
	<p pid="a.406.3/6">Nationwide, the 24,000 figure that was a commitment in Labour's manifesto at the last general election has been dropped. That will save about &pound;105 million, &pound;70 million of which will be retained by the Home Office, while only &pound;35 million will be distributed to local forces. Of that &pound;35 million, only &pound;1 million will come back to Manchester, while a whopping &pound;20 million will go to the Met. The police authority is facing a significant deficit in the funding of PCSOs and the independent chairman has provided me with the figures of &pound;6.5 million for 2007-08 and &pound;8.4 million for 2008-09, rising to &pound;9.2 million in 2009-10. Although the GMP should welcome increased flexibility in deciding how the money is best spent, the fact that the overall resources will be significantly less than they anticipated will affect their flexibility to achieve the best mix of police, PCSOs and other police staff.</p>
	<p pid="a.406.3/7">It is time for the Home Office to accept that Manchester is getting a raw deal. It is not acceptable for the Minister to hide behind increases since 1997 to justify cuts now. In the information pack put together by the Library, a Home Office spokesperson suggests that forces should be able to make efficiency savings. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1371" name="Graham Brady">The hon. Member for Altrincham and Sale, West (Mr. Brady)</phrase> made the point that they have been making efficiency savings over a long period and there comes a time when they cannot do any more. I do not regard losing more than 200 police officers this year as efficiency savings. I see it as cuts and I am sure that a number of hon. Members will too.</p>
	<p pid="a.406.3/8">The spokesman went on to say that if police forces feel that they need additional funding they should contact the Home Office. That is what we are doing: we are contacting the Home Office and asking the Minister to give Greater Manchester a fair deal. I hope that the Department will reconsider the funding given to Greater Manchester police to avoid further cuts in the future.</p>

	<p pid="a.415.0/1">It is a pleasure to have the opportunity to contribute to this important debate under your chairmanship, Mr. Amess. I compliment <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1707" name="John Leech">my hon. Friend the Member for Manchester, Withington (Mr. Leech)</phrase> on securing it and on the diligent and industrious way in which he goes about representing the interests of his constituents. We have also had very worthwhile contributions from several other hon. Members, including <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1625" name="Andrew Stunell">my hon. Friends the Members for Hazel Grove (Andrew Stunell)</phrase> and for Rochdale (Paul Rowen), as well as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1838" name="Ann Coffey">the hon. Member for Stockport (Ann Coffey)</phrase>, who is a neighbour of mine in a constituency sense, and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1371" name="Graham Brady">the hon. Member for Altrincham and Sale, West (Mr. Brady)</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.415.0/2">Let me start by making it clear, as several hon. Members have sought to do already, that the purpose of the debate is certainly not to be critical of the Greater Manchester police authority, Greater Manchester police, their chief constable or anybody else involved in trying to do the job on the ground. On the contrary, I should like to compliment the police authority on the open way in which it has gone about ensuring that all Members in the Greater Manchester conurbation are precisely aware of the problems that it faces. The chairman, in particular, is to be given credit for inviting Members in just before Christmas to hear what the problems were. Put simply, the issue is that Greater Manchester police face a funding crisis, and that is what today's debate is intended to deal with. As the hon. Member for Altrincham and Sale, West said, this is precisely the time when we should be applying pressure to ensure that the Government understand Greater Manchester's needs and, I hope, why we feel hard done by in comparison with other areas.</p>
	<p pid="a.415.0/3">I happen to have in front of me the report that was given to those of us who attended the meeting with the chair of the police authority, and it gives a clear breakdown of the deficits for each of the next three years. For 2007-08, the shortfall will be &pound;1.3 million. As we heard from the hon. Member for Stockport, moves are already being made to address that deficit; indeed, the police authority chairman told us that when we met just before Christmas. However, the &pound;25.9 million figure for 2008-09 and the &pound;12.2 million figure for 2009-10 will require an awful lot of tweaking if they are to be manageable in any way, shape or form.</p>
	<p pid="a.415.0/4">Put simply, however, our contention is that those shortfalls will not be manageable unless there is a fundamental change in the funding formula, and we will see a greater diminution of the service to the people of Greater Manchester. Let us not forget that that will be in addition to the loss of 216 officers that we have already seen in Greater Manchester. The report makes it clear that those officers are lost for good, and none of the budget projections will lead to a recovery of the previous position. We have already lost 216 officers, but the police authority's documentation makes it clear that, in addition, the budget shortfall will be &pound;27 million over the next two years or &pound;39 million over the next three years.</p>
	<p pid="a.415.0/5">The hon. Member for Stockport talked about community policing. She was gracious enough to accept that Stockport, which is run by the Liberal Democrats, as opposed to the Labour party or the Conservatives, has seen a number of first-rate partnership initiatives with the police. As she rightly said, those have contributed to improved working, more joined-up thinking and a better all-round approach to crime and antisocial behaviour issues.</p>
	<p pid="a.415.0/6">The hon. Lady talked in some detail about the strategy behind neighbourhood policing or community policing&mdash;whichever term hon. Members prefer. Again, all of us buy into that strategy, and there is no disagreement about it across the political spectrum. However, there is disagreement about whether it is being implemented. I appreciate that the hon. Lady, like me, is a glass-half-full, not a glass-half-empty person, but I do not recognise her description of responses, general attitudes or, indeed, the allocation of resources&mdash;perhaps she is just very fortunate to have more policemen in her constituency than I have in neighbouring Cheadle. However, although the theory of neighbourhood or community policing is first rate, the reaction of most of my constituents, and those of other hon. Members, is, &quot;Frankly, it would be difficult for us to tell how good it is, because we don't see much of it.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.415.0/7">I make that point in the context of a meeting that I attended last year with the head of the Metropolitan police, Sir Ian Blair. He told me and several colleagues&mdash;the Minister will of course know this in his capacity not only as a Minister, but as a London Member&mdash;about the wonderful way in which community policing in London means that there is a dedicated team of six police officers in every local government ward. That team includes a sergeant, two police constables and three PCSOs&mdash;wonderful! In a constituency such as mine, that would mean the equivalent of 42 dedicated officers working within the boundaries of the parliamentary constituency. My guess is that the reality is a handful of officers at any one moment.</p>
	<p pid="a.415.0/8">Neither the borough commander, Neil Wain&mdash;for whom I have tremendous respect&mdash;nor the chief constable, Michael Todd, has tried to pretend to me that Stockport is getting anything like the community policing resources that other areas, particularly the capital, might have. I met the chief constable last autumn, and he told me&mdash;I am paraphrasing his words, but he has also made this claim publicly&mdash;that as long as Greater Manchester police continue to subsidise the Met to the tune of &pound;14 million or &pound;15 million a year, he does not see the situation changing.</p>
	<p pid="a.415.0/9">I know full well that the Minister will be his usual robust self in answering these criticisms, but I hope that he will understand that most of the key facts and figures that we have repeated today have not been dreamed up by Liberal Democrat campaigners or Members of Parliament; they have come from the chief constable, the borough commander and the police authority. If the Minister wants to take the line of arguing with the facts and figures that we have presented, it is important that we make clear where they have come from.</p>
	<p pid="a.415.0/10">Recorded crime is up by 3.6 per cent. The lack of police presence on our streets is a major worry&mdash;a major worry. Hon. Members have made it clear that in our constituencies the concern is not so much organised crime or high-level crime; it is low-level, antisocial behaviour and petty vandalism&mdash;the kind of crime that makes people's lives a misery. It affects not only constituencies that are largely socially deprived; it affects middle-class and affluent constituencies in just the same way.</p>
	<p pid="a.415.0/11">People do not believe that there is an adequate police presence any longer. People say to me, &quot;Mark, it's getting more and more like the fire brigade. The police will come out if you ring 999, but you never see them on beat patrol.&quot; I say again that I do not blame Greater Manchester police for that. I do not say that the Stockport borough commander has got his priorities wrong or anything like that. I simply say that the police are doing the best they can with insufficient resources. People are not satisfied with the lack of police presence on our streets. They do not feel safe to go about their business, particularly in the evenings, and they are, I think, increasingly disillusioned about the point of telephoning and reporting such incidents to the police, because they do not think that their calls will be followed up. Neighbourhood and community policing is a fine aspiration. We are all signed up to it, but the reality is that in too many of our areas there are very serious concerns about the lack of police presence and about the low-key, petty vandalism and antisocial behaviour that blights too many lives.</p>
	<p pid="a.415.0/12">I hope that the Minister will address our concerns seriously. The early-day motion that was referred to and today's debate are part of our genuine efforts to focus attention on the concerns, which I am sure are shared by all Greater Manchester Members. It is perhaps slightly disappointing that that is not reflected in their attendance today, with one or two honourable exceptions, but the concerns are widespread and genuine and I hope that the Minister will address them in the spirit in which we have raised them, which is that we all want to work together to bring crime levels down and to help people to feel safe in their communities again. The issue is not only that we are far, far away from that situation at the moment. Given the funding crisis that is outlined in the report from the police authority, which we have heard so much about already today, the great danger is that the problem, unless it is tackled by the Government, will continue to get worse, rather than get better. That would be unacceptable to all our constituents.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-01-23a.421.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1618" speakername="Tony McNulty" speakeroffice="The Minister for Policing, Security and Community Safety"  colnum="421"  time="012:15:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070123/halltext/70123h0007.htm#07012336000497">
	<p pid="a.421.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1707" name="John Leech">the hon. Member for Manchester, Withington (Mr. Leech)</phrase> on securing <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1371" name="Graham Brady">the debate. The hon. Member for Altrincham and Sale, West (Mr. Brady)</phrase> suggested that now is the right time for the debate, and I have absolutely no problem with that. It is right and proper and in the interests of all Members to debate such matters before or after the budgetary spending review. I have no difficulty with that at all, and I shall not hide behind&mdash;I think that was the phrase&mdash;the increases in police funding since 1997. I am proud of those increases and of the innovation of police community support officers. Let us be clear: whatever their numbers, they simply would not exist had any other Government been in control. This Government conceived and delivered them.</p>
	<p pid="a.421.0/2">By way of introduction and before I come to the specifics of the debate, there were some interesting themes underlying hon. Members' suggestions, and that is where the wider and larger debate should be. It is in part, as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1838" name="Ann Coffey">my hon. Friend the Member for Stockport (Ann Coffey)</phrase> said, about the nature of policing, neighbourhood policing and the multi-agency partnership approach that we must use to deal with much of what happens at the lower level&mdash;lower in terms of the hierarchy of crime, not the communities on which such behaviour impacts.</p>
	<p pid="a.421.0/3">Another fair and reasonable debate would be about how we, collectively, through a range of agencies, deal preventively as well as actively with much on that continuum of low-level crime and antisocial behaviour. The police are up for that debate, and they are keen to get involved with crime and disorder reduction partnerships and others. If my hon. Friend says that Stockport does such work very well, I am more than happy to agree with her. It is done well throughout the country, too.</p>
	<p pid="a.421.0/4"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1377" name="Nick Herbert">The hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs (Nick Herbert)</phrase> touched on the following point in his closing remarks. It is right and proper to debate what we want our police officers to do, and what the balance should be between police officers, police staff, police community support officers and other specialists. In specific terms, the debate is the domain of the local chief constable, but placing the debate in the national domain is worthwhile. It is also appropriate to debate the&mdash;I think euphemistically entitled, because it is not quite the right phrase&mdash;&quot;work force modernisation&quot; programme and other measures to analyse how the police do what they do.</p>
	<p pid="a.421.0/5">I said when I first entered this ministerial role that it is terribly nice of me as Minister with responsibility for police to say that there are 142,500 police officers&mdash;a record number&mdash;in this country, but if I cannot guarantee at any one time 138,000 officers out there policing, it is not much use. One of my officials said that actually, in some circumstances, there are probably more like 125,000 to 130,000 officers&mdash;or fewer&mdash;out there policing. Everyone agrees that accountable, visible, on-the-street policing is what all communities want, and that is what we aspire to.</p>
	<p pid="a.421.0/6">I am glad that for everyone apart from a few unreconstructed people, the debate has moved on from the notion that PCSOs are anything other than supplementary to, complementary to and supportive of police. They are neither substitute police, nor plastic police as they are sometimes referred to rather disparagingly, and they have carved out a real and distinctive role that adds to Manchester's policing needs and to those of every other community. They are here to stay.</p>
	<p pid="a.421.0/7">I could do the &quot;line-to-take&quot; stuff and tell everyone what has happened since 1997 and which trajectories have been on the up. The trajectories for spending and for police numbers are on the up, and PCSOs have been introduced. Of course, one can pull out selective areas, so I was careful to note the period quoted for the rise in recorded crime in Manchester. Overall trends are the other way around, however. Trends go up and down, up and down, and we will see what has happened to crime statistics nationally when they are published on Thursday.</p>
	<p pid="a.421.0/8">I do take two points, however, so as not to deeply offend anyone. The trajectory is rightly down both nationally and locally, but I accept the point made by hon. Members, including my hon. Friend, about people's perceptions of albeit low-level crime. If those elements of crime are high or remain stubbornly at levels that we cannot shift despite what we do with antisocial behaviour, and the broad perception is that that domain is troublesome to people, then that is troublesome to me as the Police Minister. However, that does not equate with the absolute doom and gloom cast by the hon. Member for Manchester, Withington, from which the hon. Member for Altrincham and Sale, West and my hon. Friend drew back.</p>
	<p pid="a.421.0/9">It is worth repeating that Greater Manchester is very well served by its police force, which has come on in leaps and bounds in the past 10 years. The police there have been hugely innovative in some areas, although by their own lights they would say that there is some way to go in some areas. I will not and cannot accept the notion that the time for reviewing, speculating on and trying to reassess and recalibrate how our police forces work is suddenly over and that despite the efficiencies that have been gained in recent years, there is no more to be squeezed out of the lemon.</p>
	<p pid="a.421.0/10">In order to respond to communities, policing has to be dynamic and constantly reinventing itself. I take issue with the notion of police work force modernisation, because it rather implies that there is currently stasis in those work forces, which is far from the case. They constantly innovate, re-energise, recalibrate, refocus, restructure and rebalance all elements of the police family. That must prevail if we are to deliver the policing that we want in each of our communities, including Greater Manchester. It is rather simplistic to draw a line and say, &quot;Well, we can't get any more efficiencies out of anything; we can't look again at how we do what we do in each of our component parts.&quot; That attitude is almost the politics of despair.</p>
	<p pid="a.421.0/11">None of that is to say that hon. Members' specific comments about Manchester were not well made and of some concern. I thought it most generous of the hon. Member for Manchester, Withington to say that the budget deficit for the next year is less of a problem. That is because, as my hon. Friend pointed out to him, there is not one.</p>
	<p pid="a.421.0/12">I move to the general points that were made about the comprehensive spending review, on which we are starting to make decisions. I must say in all candour that the wider concerns for forces and authorities up and down the country are about 2008-09, 2009-10 and 2010-11. There are a lot of discussions to be had and a lot of policy development to be done&mdash;across parties, I hope, and certainly up and down the country&mdash;about how to deal with policing in that next round once we know the broader parameters. The notion of moving to a three-year deal instead of a two-year deal must be right for Manchester and elsewhere. As someone said, that would take the kinks out so that people would be able to plan broadly, at least, and to know what the various scenarios are.</p>
	<p pid="a.421.0/13">However, one cannot accept a three-year plan for Manchester without accepting that when we divide up the national cake, some elements will have to be taken out of that process. There will have to be a raw redistribution through the formula and then adjustments precisely to give forces some degree of certainty. Money has not been withdrawn from Manchester; it has been redistributed to other forces. The hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs got a bit of the Manchester money because Surrey happened to be a net recipient rather than contributor&mdash;[Hon. Members: &quot;Sussex.&quot;] I do apologise; of course, the hon. Gentleman is from Sussex. Anyway, he has more money than Surrey, so there we are.</p>
	<p pid="a.421.0/14">Interestingly, I suppose, the Liberal Democrat Members' near neighbour&mdash;not that near because Lancashire is in between&mdash;in Cumbria will be a huge recipient rather than a contributor. I can go through the list, but it will simply show up where the odd Liberal MPs are. Cumbria, Devon and Cornwall, which is pretty well a redoubt for Liberal Democrats, benefit, as do Dorset, Durham, Lancashire, Norfolk, North Yorkshire, Sussex&mdash;they have the odd one down there; they have to be very odd down there, the Sussex Liberal Democrats&mdash;West Mercia, Northumbria, the GLA area and others. There has to be a sense of equity in the equation. I do not accept the premise that in that national picture with that national resource the GMP should somehow be treated differently from all other forces. There has to be that equity, not least to get some notion of planning and contingency into the equation.</p>

	<p pid="a.433.2/1">I am most grateful to have secured this debate, which concerns the Gerrards Cross tunnel collapse. I applied for and was granted such a debate rather a long time ago by Mr. Speaker, but unfortunately the debate fell on the day after Sir Edward Heath died. The House adjourned in the morning, following tributes to him, and the debate, which was to take place in the afternoon, was therefore lost.</p>
	<p pid="a.433.2/2">I rather took the view then that the necessity for the debate might evaporate with the passage of months. I regret to say, however, that the necessity for the debate has not gone at all. Now, at the beginning of 2007, my constituents in Gerrards Cross continue to face a nightmare situation, which has been brought about by the botched attempt to develop a Tesco store above the railway line, in the middle of their community.</p>
	<p pid="a.433.2/3">It is worth briefly running over the history of the matter. Tesco purchased from British Rail as far back as the early 1990s the air rights to build a store over the railway line at Gerrards Cross where it lies in the cutting. However, Tesco submitted a planning application for the construction of the store only in 1997, the idea being that the railway line would be filled in with a tunnel. Fill would be placed on top, and a store and a car park placed on top of that.</p>
	<p pid="a.433.2/4">That proposal went down extremely badly with the local community. Press coverage at the time, as well as an in-depth investigation, showed that 93 per cent. of the local community in Gerrards Cross were against the scheme, and they expressed their opposition vociferously. Even Tesco, having initially denied the level of opposition, subsequently had to admit that it was as high as that level.</p>
	<p pid="a.433.2/5">When Tesco persisted in pursuing the planning application, I attended a public meeting at which, I recollect, the local community raised &pound;14,000 in 20 minutes to pay for representation to resist the scheme. The matter went to a planning inquiry, at which the local community and the district council, which had turned down the application, united to try to persuade the planning inspector and the Deputy Prime Minister to turn the application down. Unfortunately, they were not successful. Even the Minister might agree that it was unfortunate that the application was not turned down in view of the history of what followed.</p>
	<p pid="a.433.2/6">The application was granted in January 1998. The inspector accepted that the development would cause massive disruption to the centre of the community and a great disturbance for those living near it, and laid down a number of criteria for the manner in which it should take place. It was envisaged that the development, which would require massive amounts of fill material to be brought in by rail only in order to minimise lorry movements, should take place over a seven-month period, and that the clearing up and landscaping thereafter should take a further three months.</p>
	<p pid="a.433.2/7">What in fact happened was that Tesco did not commence any of the work or do anything at all until the five-year period was nearly up. The consequence of Tesco's actions was to create great uncertainty in the local community, particularly for the traders who were likely to be put out of business if Tesco opened the store. As a result, some well known local businesses were forced to close and decided to relocate. It was only at the very end of the period&mdash;eight days before the planning permission expired&mdash;that Tesco decided to proceed and started the works. That was after Tesco had applied unsuccessfully to increase the size of the store by 30 per cent. and, in fairness to Tesco, after it had also taken into account the need to change the dimensions of the tunnel, because of the possibility of Central Railway, the Deputy Prime Minister's other interesting project, needing to run through the site.</p>
	<p pid="a.433.2/8">Thereafter, far from the work being done in seven months, it proceeded at a snail's pace. The result was to lengthen the disruption for the local community to the maximum possible extent. The development was in breach of the planning permission, but enforcing such matters was difficult and Tesco was given every allowance as the work proceeded. Finally, by June 2005, it seemed that the work of building the tunnel segments and putting the fill on top was at last coming to an end. Work was proceeding to tamp down the fill, which turned out to be bottom ash from the Edmonton and Rainham incinerators. That was not envisaged in the course of the original planning permission, but Tesco claimed that, as it was inert material, it was satisfactory to place it under the tarmac between the segments and the open air. I accept that the Environment Agency also thought that that was appropriate.</p>
	<p pid="a.433.2/9">On <phrase class="date" code="">30 June</phrase> at about 7 pm&mdash;a time of maximum commuter traffic&mdash;three units of the 16 segments making up the tunnel suddenly collapsed. It was only by a miracle that a train that had been passing through only a minute before was not covered with thousands of tonnes of debris. If it had, the matter of which we are now speaking would have been a major incident with many deaths.</p>

	<p pid="a.434.1/1">My hon. Friend is absolutely right. I was about to add that the driver of another train that was about to enter the tunnel realised what had happened and sounded the alert to prevent any further trains from running into the obstruction. The miracle that no one was killed, which was celebrated in the local community, was soon replaced by the realisation that the extent of the collapse meant that the line would be blocked for many weeks. Indeed, it was not until <phrase class="date" code="">20 August</phrase> that it was reopened. Massive disruption had been caused to the local community up and down the line from Banbury through to London. The line was one of the best and most efficient Chiltern lines in the country and was recognised as such.</p>
	<p pid="a.434.1/2">Furthermore, as the site was cleared under emergency procedure, lorries went through Gerrards Cross because the railway could not be used. Those lorries carried the spoil material that should have been under the tarmac, and scattered dust in all directions until finally dumping a large quantity of it, without planning permission, at Coleshill in <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1495" name="Cheryl Gillan">the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Chesham and Amersham (Mrs. Gillan)</phrase>. Subsequent attempts by Tesco to obtain planning permission for that dump were turned down and enforcement proceedings were brought. The dump was removed only when my hon. Friend wrote to the chairman of Tesco and pointed out that members of the local community, particularly children, were complaining of health problems in relation to the dust coming from the tip.</p>

	<p pid="a.442.1/1">The great lakes region of Africa is emerging from a long and terrible period of violence and dictatorship. Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi and now the Democratic Republic of the Congo have democratically elected Governments. The economies of Uganda and Rwanda in particular are being kick-started and there are many reasons to be mildly optimistic about the future of the region. Eastern Congo remains lawless, of course, and the writ of the Kinshasa Government does not yet run there in any true conventional sense. That lawlessness as a function of civil war, poverty and history continues to be fuelled in no small part by the existence of marauding bands of bandits formally associated with neighbouring countries that have at one time or another occupied parts of the country.</p>
	<p pid="a.442.1/2">Today I want to focus on the problem of the Lord's Resistance Army, which still occupies part of eastern Congo and has conducted a 20-year campaign in and around northern Uganda. In that time many children have been abducted and forced into military service, many people in northern Uganda have lost limbs and many have lost their lives. The suffering of the people of northern Uganda has been beyond expression at times.</p>
	<p pid="a.442.1/3">I come to the subject as chair of the all-party group on the great lakes region and genocide prevention. Just over a year ago, a delegation from the all-party group, including <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1850" name="David Drew">my hon. Friend the Member for Stroud (Mr. Drew)</phrase>, visited northern Uganda and met President Yoweri Museveni. The report of the visit reiterated the extent of human suffering the conflict in northern Uganda has caused. At the time many thought that the International Criminal Court indictments of the leader of the Lord's Resistance Army, Joseph Kony, and of several of his close associates, which were delivered while the mission was still in the field, signalled that the window for possible peace talks between the Lord's Resistance Army and the Ugandan Government had closed. Kony seemed unprepared to talk and President Museveni had urged the ICC to take up the case.</p>
	<p pid="a.442.1/4">When the group subsequently met President Museveni in London, it seemed that little had changed. The president had decided that if the LRA would not lay down its arms and if Uganda were not to be permitted by the international community effectively to invade the Democratic Republic of the Congo, it was up to the ICC to take charge of the situation. The ICC did that and there has apparently been a considerable turnround in many respects. The LRA has apparently taken part in talks in Juba, although&mdash;to put it in the most positive way&mdash;things are moving extremely slowly.</p>
	<p pid="a.442.1/5">It is estimated that 1,000 people a week in the region are dying as a result of the conflict. Children are still the principal victims of the violence: an estimated 1,500 are still in LRA ranks and at least 10,000 remain unaccounted for. It is worth emphasising the abominable extent of the crimes conducted in the course of the conflict. Some 20,000 to 25,000 children have been abducted and made to work as field wives, child soldiers, and porters of weaponry; often they have been forced to mutilate or kill friends and relatives. Tens of thousands of other people in the region have become night commuters, walking long distances every night into towns to try to avoid attack. Members of the all-party group met some of those children at the Noah's Ark shelter in Gulu. The founder of the Concerned Parents Association, a remarkable non-governmental organisation formed in response to the abductions and killings, told the all-party group the harrowing tale of her daughter: kidnapped by the rebels in a notorious attack on the Aboke girls' school, she was forced to become the wife of a commander and was held for seven years before she managed to escape and return home.</p>
	<p pid="a.442.1/6">The group's visit to Koch Goma internally displaced person camp was perhaps the most striking and depressing experience of its time in Uganda. As at other camps, the inhabitants live in fear. The day before the visit, residents who had gone to tend nearby fields had fled in panic after coming across signs of LRA presence. At a memorable meeting with the group, residents described an incident in May 2005 in which 16 people were killed and two abducted when the LRA attacked the camp. When the assembled crowd was asked who had lost someone to the LRA through murder or abduction, virtually every hand went up.</p>
	<p pid="a.442.1/7">I believe it is incumbent on anyone who wants to help alleviate that suffering to put the present victims at the top of the international agenda. If there is a way to make it stop, we have to help to find it and the sooner the better. There is another agenda, however, and that is to seek to prevent such things from happening in future. There is another agenda, however, and that is to seek to prevent such things from happening in future. That agenda is served by making it clear that the perpetrators of the world's worst crimes against humanity are held responsible and punished for the atrocities that they commit. The present situation in northern Uganda, with a temporary ceasefire in place while negotiations take place to make it permanent, I hope, is therefore extremely sensitive.</p>
	<p pid="a.442.1/8">At face value, that appears to be a Catch-22 situation. There is no doubt that atrocities have taken place over many years, and that cannot be ignored under any circumstances. That is why the ICC has indicted a number of LRA suspects. However, discussions imply movement on both sides. Such movement brings with it, one assumes, the possibility of damaging the ICC process and the crucial role that it will play in preventing future atrocities. It is essential not to find a messy compromise, but to serve both objectives&mdash;to stop the violence, while also holding to account those responsible for violence in the past.</p>
	<p pid="a.442.1/9">For those on the ground, that will be a challenge of the greatest proportions. For sure, the August 2006 cessation of hostilities agreement has so far led to increased safety, confidence and hope. With assistance from non-governmental organisations such as Christian Aid, Oxfam, Tearfund, and Save the Children, schools are being rebuilt and there is better access to health care. The improved security has allowed NGOs much better access to camps for families who have been forced from their homes by fighting. Displaced people have been able to move to new settlement sites, which are often closer to their homes and have access to farmland. New fighting and a return to terror tactics in northern Uganda could destroy all that progress, so we need to do what we can as an important member of the international community to prevent that from happening, if that is possible.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-01-23a.445.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1983" speakername="Eric Joyce" colnum="445"  time="013:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070123/halltext/70123h0010.htm#07012336000532">
	<p pid="a.445.0/1">I thank my hon. Friend for that. Mr. Chissano has been appointed to mediate on that important issue. He will have to face a decision. The LRA has suggested that it might like the comfort of a hotel in Kenya for the next few years, instead of getting on with things in Juba. Sometimes, we have to take rumours as being exactly that. People on the ground will understand what they mean and be able to interpret them. I am concerned by what some of the LRA negotiators may have said recently about continuing at Juba, but at the moment, we must hold fire. They should crack on and continue at Juba because there is a worry that if they move to another location they might simply get bogged down and stay there for the next few years.</p>
	<p pid="a.445.0/2">On <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1455" name="Kerry McCarthy">the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Bristol, East (Kerry McCarthy)</phrase>, it has been suggested&mdash;this may be a cynical view&mdash;that the current talks are a ruse for the Government of Uganda to keep the heat off until after the Commonwealth Heads of Government conference in November. Supposedly, the Ugandan army has been deploying in sensitive areas, and President Museveni has not given any ground in the talks so far. It is important to note that he is, more or less, the democratically elected president of a UN-recognised state and that the LRA is a somewhat different entity. I put it no stronger than that. There is an argument about moral equivalence. We should not be too hard on President Museveni, who has faced a threat over his border and has not been allowed to pursue the enemy because we have not permitted him to make an incursion into another country.</p>
	<p pid="a.445.0/3">It would help if the Government would make it clear that a resolution of the conflict is at the heart of its policy and interests. The spotlight will be firmly on Uganda in November as we approach the Commonwealth Heads of Government conference that it is hosting. A sound and durable peace process would be a huge and laudable achievement to showcase to the world.</p>
	<p pid="a.445.0/4">In order to reach a solution to the conflict, underlying issues that contributed to it must be addressed, particularly the apparent underdevelopment of services in northern Uganda in comparison with other parts of the country. In many ways, Uganda is a great success story. The film, &quot;The Last King of Scotland&quot;, shows what a mess it was in before President Museveni. Some might say that he has not always done the right thing recently, but there is now universal primary education across Uganda and it leads the region in many laudable ways.</p>
	<p pid="a.445.0/5">There may be arguments for separating talks on the future of the LRA from discussions on the wider issues of development in northern Uganda. Any such talks should involve not only the LRA, but a wider and, one might argue, far more legitimate representation of the people of northern Uganda. It is particularly important that civil society organisations should attend such talks. Will the Minister reassure us that whenever and wherever appropriate, the Government will be ready to make an appropriate contribution to such efforts quickly, whether to the negotiations or to the relationship between the Ugandan Government and northern Uganda on the ground? I am sure that that has already been done, but it is a good idea to flag up such considerations when one gets a chance such as this.</p>
	<p pid="a.445.0/6">One of the most difficult issues in the talks is the indictments of the ICC. I flag this up again because it is a core problem. It is imperative that the ICC is supported as a tool of international accountability. The question is whether any overlap exists between the overriding need to maintain the credibility of the court and the need to find a solution in the talks that will end the violence in the region. I know that if such overlap exists, the UK Government will do what they can to assist people to exploit it.</p>
	<p pid="a.445.0/7">I sense that the ICC does not see itself as a blunt instrument. It is aware of the reality on the ground for the people of northern Uganda, such as the Acholi people. I would like to find a way forward that maintains its authority and does the best for northern Ugandans. The danger is that if the ICC takes an unnecessarily blinkered approach, it may simply say that the writ of the ICC has to be upheld, and people will have to pay for that on the ground. It appears, however, from recent ICC comments and our contact with it, that its position is much more sophisticated than that, which I am extremely glad to see.</p>
