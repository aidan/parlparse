</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-02-19b.1.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1399" speakername="Andrew Selous" colnum="1"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080219/halltext/80219h0001.htm#08021973000444">
	<p pid="b.1.2/1">May I say what a pleasure it is to serve under you this morning, Miss Begg? I had the pleasure of working alongside you in the Work and Pensions Committee in the last Parliament.</p>
	<p pid="b.1.2/2">I am very grateful to Mr. Speaker for granting me this debate. This important subject does not get the attention that it deserves, and it is extremely distressing and upsetting to our constituents. I speak this morning directly at the request of a number of my constituents who have urged me to bring the issue of thefts from the cloning of debit and credit cards to the attention of the House, the police and the banks and credit card companies&mdash;or financial institutions as they are known. I have endeavoured to do that over the past few weeks.</p>
	<p pid="b.1.2/3">I am particularly grateful to Bedfordshire police for the specific briefing that they have given me on the matter, and I look to the Minister to assure us this morning that the Home Office will hold an urgent and serious review of the current procedures. The procedures are clearly failing and I will try to set out why.</p>
	<p pid="b.1.2/4">In brief, at the end of November or in early December, a skimming machine was inserted in the credit and debit card machine at a garage in the south of my constituency. Bedfordshire police tell me that, to date, 745 debit and credit cards have had money stolen from them, often on multiple occasions. One credit card may have had five, six, 10 or 12 amounts of money stolen from it. We are not talking about small amounts of money either. Typically, sums of &pound;1,000, &pound;2,000 and &pound;5,000 are taken. I declare a personal interest. My wife had &pound;1,000 stolen in four or five withdrawals from cash points in New York in early January. It was lucky that she checked her bank statement pretty soon after that and realised that something was wrong.</p>
	<p pid="b.1.2/5">I shall quote briefly from letters from some of my constituents, who are unhappy with the current system for dealing with this serious crime. On many occasions, I have told Bedfordshire police that if 745 purses and wallets had been stolen, mainly in the two villages of Studham and Kensworth, there would probably have been police officers behind almost every hedge trying to catch the culprits. Card crime is no less serious. We are talking about a lot more money than most people have in their purse or wallet. The fact that the money is almost always reimbursed by the financial institutions does not make the theft any less traumatic, difficult and upsetting for the person, or any less of a crime. I object to the fact that the people who have money stolen from them in that way are not described as victims in the legislation.</p>
	<p pid="b.1.2/6">Financial institutions are described as the victims because they have to reimburse the money, but if someone steals my wallet, I am a victim even if I get the money back later. I do not like that terminology. One police officer said to me, &quot;We don't report gun crime to the small arms manufacturers. We don't report alcohol-fuelled violence to the drinks manufacturers.&quot; Yet, in the current system, card crime is reported to the financial institutions. I am not calling for that law to be scrapped because I understand the reasons for it. However, there are serious flaws in the procedure.</p>
	<p pid="b.1.2/7">My constituents have written to me to say that they are outraged about what is going on. One stated:</p>
	<p pid="b.1.2/8" class="indent">&quot;No law-abiding citizen can witness the large-scale theft of money from the UK without indignation.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.1.2/9">A woman from Luton had her card skimmed from another garage close to my constituency. She wrote to me:</p>
	<p pid="b.1.2/10" class="indent">&quot;They cleared our account down to &pound;5. We have two kids to feed as well. We were worried about how we would survive for three weeks until my husband got paid again.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.1.2/11">In many cases, banks and credit card companies try to reimburse people as quickly as possible, but that does not always happen. Imagine the person who is abroad and reliant on their credit card. Suddenly, because of illegal withdrawals, they go over their credit card limit and their card issuer will not let them take out any more money. They could be completely stuck. What about small businesses which have their accounts frozen and are not able to pay their suppliers? The ramifications of this crime are absolutely huge.</p>
	<p pid="b.1.2/12">It is interesting to look at the range of countries from which money is being withdrawn. Britain has chip and pin&mdash;all credit to UK financial services, we are the most chip and pin compliant country in Europe and possibly the whole world. We are even better than Luxembourg, which is the next best in Europe. However, that does not mean that as UK citizens we are any safer. Highly organised criminal gangs clone the details from the magnetic strips on the back of our credit and debit cards and take our pin numbers through the skimming machines, and money is then withdrawn all over the world. From talking to my constituents and the police, I have found out that money is being withdrawn from the following countries: Malaysia, America, India, Hong Kong, Philippines, Dubai, Australia, Canada, Sri Lanka, Singapore, Germany and Thailand. There was an attempt in Ghana, but it was not successful. Let us pause for a moment and consider the scale of that highly organised, sophisticated criminal operation.</p>
	<p pid="b.1.2/13">Furthermore, there is the question of the use to which the money is put. I have no evidence, but it has been suggested to me that some of the money may have found its way to the Tamil Tigers in Sri Lanka, to Pakistan and possibly to funding terrorism. It is, therefore, a very serious issue. I am talking about not just theft from our constituents but also the use to which the money is put.</p>
	<p pid="b.1.2/14">The Fraud Act 2006 is in general a good Act. Much of it is sensible and is welcomed by the police. It simplified things and I am not calling for its repeal, but since <phrase class="date" code="2007-04-01">1 April 2007</phrase>, if someone finds that thousands of pounds have been stolen from their bank account or from their credit card, they can no longer go to the police unless the card has been stolen. In most cases, however, the card has not been stolen; the details have been skimmed and the card has been cloned. One must go to one's financial institution&mdash;bank or credit card company&mdash;and it will be up to them to inform the dedicated cheque and plastic crime unit, which will then liaise with local police forces. However, Bedfordshire police tell me that of the 745 debit and credit cards that were cloned, they did not have one single referral back from a bank or a credit card company.</p>
	<p pid="b.1.2/15">That is where the current system is completely failing. The most serious issue is this: had just one bank been even semi-switched on, perhaps action would have been taken after five or 10 cards had been cloned. Everyone knew locally that one particular garage was involved. Do not ask me how they knew, but everyone said, &quot;It's that garage that is doing it.&quot; If Bedfordshire police had been alerted, they could have gone in within days. If they had raided the garage immediately, they probably would have seized the skimming machine. They might have mounted a covert operation if they had seen that the skimming machine was there, because such machines need to be in place only for three or four days to capture thousands of details. Then they could have caught the criminals coming back to remove the machine, perhaps to take it to another garage. The police would have had fantastic intelligence and would have been able to question the criminals involved.</p>
	<p pid="b.1.2/16">I understand from Bedfordshire police that typically a lone employee is in a garage, perhaps late at night. The criminal gang arrives and threatens violence, offers bribes or perhaps both. The criminals say, &quot;We'll beat you up. We'll do in your family unless you turn a blind eye. We're going to put something into the card reader. You keep quiet or you'll be in trouble.&quot; The machine is there for only a few days and then they remove it. That is how the crime happens.</p>
	<p pid="b.1.2/17">The current system is failing. The public are not being protected. Bedfordshire police raided the garage to which I have referred, partly because my constituents were not content just to tell their banks and credit card companies; they got on to the police. Prompted by my constituents, I got on to the police as well, but when they eventually raided the garage, two or three weeks ago, it was a classic case of locking the stable door after the horse had bolted. The key point that I want the Minister to do something about is ensuring that information is passed on to local police forces as soon as a pattern emerges, so that the public can be protected. If action had been taken earlier, many hundreds of my constituents and, indeed, other people passing up and down the A5 could have been protected. It is the first duty of Government to protect their citizens from crime, and that is crime by any standard.</p>
	<p pid="b.1.2/18">It is often said that such activity is victimless crime because people are, by and large, compensated by banks and credit card companies. I refute that suggestion entirely because, as the British Bankers Association said,</p>
	<p pid="b.1.2/19" class="indent">&quot;ultimately the financial burden is carried by the general public as a whole in the form of direct personal financial losses, increased charges and premiums, failed businesses, devalued investments, increased taxation, reduced public services and lost jobs.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.1.2/20">That is clearly the case. At the very least, the Government are losing out on the corporation tax they could be receiving from the banks, because it is a legitimate expense when they repay customers from bank profits. Banks will recoup that money in the form of higher charges or higher interest rates, just as shops have to do from shoplifting and insurance companies have to do from illegal activities. We all lose out, including the Government, from this crime.</p>
	<p pid="b.1.2/21">Since the introduction of the Fraud Act 2006, particularly the provisions that took effect from <phrase class="date" code="2007-04-01">1 April 2007</phrase>, people have commented that because the police are not directly informed, card cloning will become a forgotten crime. Derek French, a banking campaigner, has certainly said that. Ross Anderson, the professor of security engineering at Cambridge university's computer laboratory, is also unhappy about the procedures now that</p>
	<p pid="b.1.2/22" class="indent">&quot;banks completely control the reporting and prosecution of card fraud&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.1.2/23">I also have concerns about the position of fraud as a police priority. There is only one police force in the whole country for which fraud is a paramount consideration, because its police authority insists that should be the case&mdash;the City of London police. The view of the British Bankers Association is that fraud is largely &quot;a Cinderella function&quot; for every police force in the country. I do not say that just to score a cheap point. Fraud is not given the priority that it deserves, which is surprising because I am informed by the British Bankers Association that the Home Office's own assessment of different types of crime</p>
	<p pid="b.1.2/24" class="indent">&quot;places the harm to society caused by fraud as second only to that caused by Class A drugs, and more than that due to people trafficking.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.1.2/25">Many of us might be slightly surprised by that prioritisation, but it is apparently the Home Office's view of the seriousness of fraud in general, of which the cloning of credit and debit cards is a very serious part. As that is the Home Office's view, people might reasonably assume that one or more of the 147 statutory performance or key diagnostic indicators would relate to fraud or financial crime, but that is not so. Again, I am informed by the British Bankers Association that not one of the statutory performance or key diagnostic indicators relates to fraud or financial crime. I happen to know that only last week the association wrote to the Minister for Security, Counter-Terrorism, Crime and Policing to ask why that was the case.</p>
	<p pid="b.1.2/26">The police are ranked according to the targets and indicators that they have to meet. They are only human, like everyone else, so if fraud is not one of the priorities put on them, they will put their resources towards the areas on which they are ranked and from which league tables are created to show how well or badly they are doing. If the Home Office says that fraud is the second most serious type of crime, why does it not feature among the priorities? That is a fair question, to which I do not have an answer, so perhaps the Minister can enlighten us when she replies to the debate.</p>
	<p pid="b.1.2/27">I do not think that we know the scale of this crime, but I found out that, according to the Association for Payment Clearing Services, the incidence of overseas fraud using cloned UK cards rose by 126 per cent. in the first six months of 2007, so it is a fast-growing area of crime&mdash;probably limited only by the criminal gangs' capacity to manufacture or put skimming machines in place. Frankly, it is easy money. I am not aware that the gang to which I referred have been caught up with. They must be laughing their heads off somewhere with suitcases or bank accounts full of money. Given how they acquired it, perhaps they have better systems to ensure that their bank accounts are not skimmed.</p>
	<p pid="b.1.2/28">There is a loss to the Exchequer&mdash;to UK plc&mdash;from the activities that I have been describing. I wrote to all four main high street clearing banks last week and one of them, a major one that may hold many of the bank accounts for the 745 cards that Bedfordshire police knew about last week, said that</p>
	<p pid="b.1.2/29" class="indent">&quot;if we discover linked fraudulent events, for example, a petrol station compromising card details, we directly notify the DCPCU.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.1.2/30">If the bank was doing that, what did the people at the DCPCU do with the information? Did they just sit on their hands from late November through to the end of January, when enough of my constituents were so fed up that they were almost beating down the doors of Dunstable police station? I was regularly on the phone to acting Chief Superintendent Andrew Street asking him what he was going to do about the crime. I am afraid that the information flow is not working well and something needs to be done about it.</p>
	<p pid="b.1.2/31">The purpose of the debate is not simply to have an interesting discussion but to bring about change so that something is done. My hope that something really will be done rests in part on a written answer to my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1640" name="James Brokenshire">the Member for Hornchurch (James Brokenshire)</phrase>, who will speak from the Conservative Front Bench in this debate. The Minister for Security, Counter-Terrorism, Crime and Policing affirmed the Government's commitment to</p>
	<p pid="b.1.2/32" class="indent">&quot;continually assess the effectiveness of new arrangements for reporting and recording of cheque and plastic card fraud introduced on <phrase class="date" code="2007-04-01">1 April 2007</phrase>.&quot;&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2007-07-02.922"><i>Official Report</i>, 2 July 2007; Vol. 462, c. 922W</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="b.1.2/33">I hope that I have demonstrated as reasonably, clearly and logically as possible that the arrangements are not working well. Of course the Government have good intentions; they clearly have no interest in fraud being perpetrated on such a scale. However, I contend that although the Fraud Act 2006 was put on the statute book with the best of intentions, it is failing our constituents in a major way when they could be protected.</p>
	<p pid="b.1.2/34">Having money stolen from one's bank account is as bad psychologically as having one's house broken into. Someone comes into the most personal and private area of another person's life and takes from them what they use to feed their family, put petrol in their car, put clothes on their family's backs, pay their mortgage and so on. I want action to follow from the debate, and I hope that when the Minister replies she will assure me that it will happen urgently.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-02-19b.5.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1707" speakername="John Leech" colnum="5"  time="009:51:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080219/halltext/80219h0001.htm#08021973000445">
	<p pid="b.5.0/1">I did not intend to speak in this debate, but having heard <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1399" name="Andrew Selous">the hon. Member for South-West Bedfordshire (Andrew Selous)</phrase>, I decided to make a few comments. I congratulate the hon. Gentleman on securing a debate on this important issue, which is a problem for all our constituents who have suffered credit or debit card fraud.</p>
	<p pid="b.5.0/2">The hon. Gentleman made a pertinent point when he suggested that we are talking about an invasive crime. When a person is burgled, they know that the crime is over and done with, but people who suffer credit or debit card fraud are never sure what scale of fraud has taken place. A close relative of mine was recently a victim of such a crime, so I know about the impact on individuals.</p>
	<p pid="b.5.0/3">I want to make some brief points, not about what action the Government can take, but about banks. Banks could do more to assist the victims of credit and debit card fraud, as I know from the comments that were made to the member of my family who was recently a victim. When my relative found out that she was a victim of debit card fraud, she immediately went to the bank and asked it to stop all transactions on her account. She was informed that money was due to go out of her account, but she had certainly not spent it. Although she informed the bank of the fraud before the money actually went out of her account, the bank told her that it had to honour the transaction, because it had taken place.</p>
	<p pid="b.5.0/4">The bank told my relative that it could not do anything, because its fraud department had to investigate the matter. It said that unless the fraud department was satisfied that the transaction was fraudulent, it could not stop the money going out of her account. In such circumstances, banks should at least delay pre-arranged transactions until their fraud departments have concluded their investigations. Sometimes, members of the public are made to feel that they are in some way responsible for credit and debit card fraud when, in fact, they have done everything possible to ensure that their credit and debit card details are kept secret. In my relative's case, either somebody in a shop used her details to access her bank account or someone in a shop passed those details to somebody else.</p>
	<p pid="b.5.0/5">Banks could do an awful lot more to reassure customers and to protect their money. Customers should at least be given the opportunity to stop additional money going out of their accounts while investigations take place.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-02-19b.6.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1641" speakername="Lynne Featherstone" colnum="6"  time="009:55:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080219/halltext/80219h0001.htm#08021973000446">
	<p pid="b.6.0/1">I am grateful for the opportunity to discuss identity theft and fraud, which is a growing concern for everyone. I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1399" name="Andrew Selous">the hon. Member for South-West Bedfordshire (Andrew Selous)</phrase> on securing such an important debate. I know victims of such crimes, and one of the things that most shocked me is that there is no mandatory requirement for the banks to inform the police, as the hon. Gentleman has mentioned. That is complete nonsense when it comes to detecting and convicting for fraud.</p>
	<p pid="b.6.0/2">We could be forgiven for thinking that because sophisticated anti-fraud card technology has become commonplace, card theft will become a thing of the past. However, the truth is that every time the industry makes a move, criminals become equally innovative in the pursuit of a circumvention of the systems, in particular regarding their ability to clone cards, as the hon. Gentleman has described. However, we should never lose sight of the potentially devastating effect of becoming a victim of credit card fraud. It appears that victims are increasingly in a David and Goliath fight with the banks to get back what has been stolen. In the good old days, banks and institutions automatically reimbursed people, but it is becoming more of a fight as we move towards a cashless society.</p>
	<p pid="b.6.0/3">I was shocked to find&mdash;perhaps I should not have been surprised&mdash;that there are more debit cards in circulation than people. In the last quarter, more than &pound;91 billion was spent on plastic card purchases, which puts the matter in perspective and shows the honeypot that attracts the criminal fraternity.</p>
	<p pid="b.6.0/4">Cards have huge benefits for retailers, because they entail handling less cash and reduced staff fraud. Consumers also benefit&mdash;I am sure that we can all find a card or two in our purses. The chip and pin system has been tremendously successful in reducing fraud in shops. Bank costs have fallen from &pound;218 million in 2004 to &pound;72 million in 2006, which is quite an achievement. The system required significant investment from the banking industry, but as returns on investments go, I am sure that they are making their money back.</p>

	<p pid="b.7.0/1">The problem with improving security is that people become less concerned about checking whether they are the victims of fraud. They are lulled into a false sense of security and believe that their details are secure. We need to return to a situation in which people check their statements every single month and are far more careful. People used to be like that, but these days they are lulled into a false sense of security because the system is allegedly safe.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-02-19b.7.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1641" speakername="Lynne Featherstone" colnum="7"  time="009:55:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080219/halltext/80219h0002.htm#08021973000448">
	<p pid="b.7.1/1">My hon. Friend is right that everyone should take personal responsibility for checking their bank statements and not relax into thinking that everything will automatically be okay.</p>
	<p pid="b.7.1/2">The banks should not use the security of the chip and pin system as an excuse to reverse one of the fundamental principles of the banking code, which underpins consumer confidence in the plastic card industry. Without customer confidence, the whole house of cards would fall and the system would no longer work. The principle is that the onus is on the banks to prove that a card has been used fraudulently before they can refuse to reimburse a transaction, and the evidence shows that it is coming under attack.</p>
	<p pid="b.7.1/3">The banks may say that they have invested zillions&mdash;or billions or whatever&mdash;in chip and pin technology. They may be more reluctant to refund money, because they feel that that investment has made the system relatively secure, but there are two problems. First, credit card fraud has not disappeared with the advent of chip and pin. Secondly, the havoc and hardship to which customers are potentially exposed if they are victim to fraud is totally unacceptable.</p>
	<p pid="b.7.1/4">The recent increase in disputed payments has ended up with the Financial Ombudsman Service, which is a real indication of a worrying trend. It is not automatic for such transactions to be reimbursed automatically, and there is a quite a time lag. Reports indicate that the service is now dealing with between 20 and 30 cases a week, and, as is the case with any ombudsman service, that is likely to be only the tip of the iceberg. As the hon. Member for South-West Bedfordshire has pointed out, the harsh reality is that many people can ill afford to be without the considerable sums involved.</p>

	<p pid="b.8.0/1">Before the hon. Lady leaves the subject of the security checks that the banks have in place, one of my constituents told me how surprised he was to find that money had been withdrawn on the same day in Malaysia and Canada from the same credit card account. The bank did not pick up on that. The system is so automated that checking systems do not seem to be in place, otherwise the bank would have realised that it is a physical impossibility to fly from Canada to Malaysia on the same day.</p>

	<p pid="b.8.1/1">I thank the hon. Gentleman for that intervention. I am reminded that my bank called me recently to check on some strange movements in my account, which were all done by me on the same day. The banks are obviously working on the problem, but they have not got their ducks in a row when it comes to realising that it is pretty difficult to withdraw money on two different sides of the world on the same day.</p>
	<p pid="b.8.1/2">If there is an increase in disputes about reimbursement and a time lag in the return of the money, people will suffer hardship if they are caught up in credit card fraud. Government policies include encouraging pensioners to have a bank account, so that payments can be made directly to the bank and so pensioners no longer need to use the post office. How will someone living on a state pension cope, perhaps on &pound;83 a week, if money goes missing from their bank account for a few months? They may have to go through a protracted battle with the bank.</p>
	<p pid="b.8.1/3">Hon. Members are capable of having a good stand-up row with the bank, and we all know how difficult it is when one is passed from pillar to post while finding someone who knows what they are talking about. It must be much more difficult for those who are more vulnerable, when sorting out such a mess creates havoc for the most able. Such a situation could be disastrous, possibly forcing people into emergency debt, if they do not know how to handle things. At my surgery, recently widowed pensioners who have never dealt with money before ask for my help. How are they to cope with that sort of problem?</p>
	<p pid="b.8.1/4">The answer is not always to legislate. As a Liberal Democrat, I do not always jump to regulation as the first option. I obviously prefer to talk it out, but if banks persist in pushing the burden of proof on to the customer, there will be no alternative to regulators taking a tougher line in order to ensure that the police are informed by the banks or financial institutions. The presumption of innocence is a cornerstone of British justice, but if the banks want to continue to rely on British justice when it suits them&mdash;protecting their interests in court over fraud problems&mdash;they must continue to have faith in their customers.</p>

	<p pid="b.8.2/1">Has the hon. Lady considered the position of the Financial Services Authority? I received this letter from the FSA last week:</p>
	<p pid="b.8.2/2" class="indent">&quot;We require all regulated firms to have systems and controls to protect themselves and their customers from financial crime, whether committed by staff, customers or others. We monitor the effectiveness of these controls and we take action, including enforcement action, where we find that firms' controls have fallen seriously short.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.8.2/3">Does the hon. Lady believe that the FSA should be looking into that, to ensure that those controls are more robust?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-02-19b.9.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1641" speakername="Lynne Featherstone" colnum="9"  time="009:55:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080219/halltext/80219h0002.htm#08021973000452">
	<p pid="b.9.0/1">I believe that the FSA should take a tighter view. To be fair, the crime has been zooming up at every stage and at every move and countermove, but it is now time to ensure that what is in place works or to put things in place that will work if there are failures in the system, which there clearly are.</p>
	<p pid="b.9.0/2">I wish to consider the future of credit card fraud and efforts to foil those who use cloning technology. Figures show that a significant proportion of such fraud is now online. Indeed, online banking losses due to fraud have increased by 44 per cent. from &pound;23.2 million in 2005 to &pound;33.5 million last year. That is easy pickings for would-be online fraudsters. In a virtual world, it is possible completely to bypass the complexity of replicating chip and pin technology&mdash;put a reader in place, get your hands on stolen card details and you're away. Only yesterday in Hornsey and Wood Green, a cupboard filled with people's personal data was found in an old housing benefits office. The papers had been dumped by the council when the staff moved out, and squatters reported the matter to <i>The Sun</i>. Details are not always entirely safe, and bank details such as those found in that pile of papers yesterday are enough to make a start.</p>
	<p pid="b.9.0/3">It is already possible to get plug-in chip readers for personal computers, and it will become easier to do so. It will not be long before the online industry works out how to use personal physical identification&mdash;the Government have gone down that road with identity cards and passports. I could go to Tottenham Court road today and buy a laptop computer complete with a fingerprint reader. It does not take a great leap of the imagination to envisage how the industry might turn its mind to the verification of who is using a computer and who is ordering. That might play an important part in helping to authenticate online transactions.</p>
	<p pid="b.9.0/4">I am a Liberal Democrat&mdash;we are nothing if not persistent&mdash;and we are averse to automatic biometric database systems. I throw into the pot the fear that such hugely sensitive information can be accidentally lost, whether the situation is similar to that in Haringey yesterday, whether a laptop is stolen from a bank employee's car or whether a data disc turns up in a dumpster. If people are worried about receiving a letter from the bank stating that their banking details had been lost, how would they feel if they received a letter saying that their fingerprints, their iris scan or another physical record&mdash;details that are theirs for life&mdash;has been mislaid?</p>
	<p pid="b.9.0/5">Before banks contemplate going down that route, they should give a cast iron guarantee that such monumental data breaches are physically impossible&mdash;as we were promised with other data. That is where we could go in an effort to stop fraud. Frankly, I find it incomprehensible that such a large amount of data can be physically downloaded from a computer system on to a disc and taken out of a building. In my view, that should be impossible.</p>
	<p pid="b.9.0/6">Finally, I would like to consider what the state can do to help banks fight that crime. As the hon. Gentleman has said, we are discussing an international racket supported by organised crime. We welcome the moves to make reporting of the crime easier for the victim, but I have not found much evidence that the Government are responding to an international problem with an international solution. I would welcome some comments from the Minister about what the Government are doing to co-ordinate their response with European police forces. We cannot treat this issue in a silo, because such treatment would ultimately lead to failure as organised criminals pay scant regard to borders and pick off police forces one by one. Some parts of the Lisbon treaty, which is going through now, address some of those issues, but I would welcome the Minister's comments about what she feels can be done specifically to deal with that crime, which, as we have heard, leaps around the world with such ease and causes such grief for its victims.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-02-19b.10.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1640" speakername="James Brokenshire" colnum="10"  time="010:11:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080219/halltext/80219h0002.htm#08021973000453">
	<p pid="b.10.0/1">May I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1399" name="Andrew Selous">the Member for South-West Bedfordshire (Andrew Selous)</phrase> on securing this morning's debate on what is a very serious and growing issue, and one that affects all our constituents? I can think of a particular case in my constituency in which a petrol station was subject to a skimming attack. Many of my constituents were defrauded and that fraud had a major impact on them. We can look at individual cases. As my hon. Friend said, in one case the details of 745 individual cards were taken from just one outlet. That example highlights how quickly this crime can be carried out and the number of people who can be involved.</p>
	<p pid="b.10.0/2">My hon. Friend was absolutely right to state clearly that this is not a victimless crime: neither for the individuals concerned nor for the financial institutions that seem ready to bear some significant losses arising from the fraud perpetrated through the skimming and cloning of cards. There is also the direct and personal impact on individual victims of credit card fraud or any other kind of financial fraud. It can be quite traumatic for many people and it dents and knocks their confidence in terms of their willingness either to use their credit card or to engage in other financial transactions.</p>
	<p pid="b.10.0/3"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1707" name="John Leech">The hon. Member for Manchester, Withington (Mr. Leech)</phrase> highlighted an individual case involving his relative. In many ways, he put this crime into a physical context, demonstrating the impact that this type of fraud can have. The person involved has a sense of their security or safety being invaded or breached, especially as they do not expect to become a victim. So it is perhaps even more shocking when they do become a victim, because the fraud comes out of the blue, when they are least expecting something like that to happen.</p>
	<p pid="b.10.0/4"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1641" name="Lynne Featherstone">The hon. Member for Hornsey and Wood Green (Lynne Featherstone)</phrase> was right to make the point that things are moving quickly in relation to this crime. Innovation among criminals presents a growing and changing threat. The banks, Government and law enforcement agencies must be equally fast-moving and reactive in examining criminals' changing patterns of behaviour, and in considering how best we can confront the organised criminal gangs that perpetrate such offences and use the funds obtained for various unsavoury purposes.</p>
	<p pid="b.10.0/5">APACS, the Association for Payment Clearing Services, is the trade body for the banks and financial institutions, and its figures indicate that the use of counterfeit cards is a growing trend. For the first six months of 2007, plastic card fraud losses as a whole rose by 26 per cent. to &pound;263.6 million. Of that figure, counterfeiting losses, of which skimming forms a part, amounted to &pound;72.3 million, which was a rise of 37 per cent. Given that counterfeiting losses for the whole of 2006 were less than &pound;100 million, we can safely say that the 2007 figures to be released next month will show a significant increase in the losses that have occurred due to the skimming, cloning and counterfeiting of cards and of the metallic strip, which is then put on the back of a number of these fraudulent cards that are subsequently used overseas.</p>
	<p pid="b.10.0/6">APACS describes the operation of this counterfeiting process quite clearly:</p>
	<p pid="b.10.0/7" class="indent">&quot;Most of this fraud involves skimming, whereby a card's magnetic stripe data (on the back of the card) is electronically copied by a criminal. Fraudsters often skim cards by using a device that is fitted to a cash machine or a PIN pad. This data is then transferred onto a fake magnetic stripe card. A counterfeit magnetic stripe card can potentially be used in any UK or overseas shop that hasn't upgraded to chip and PIN or at an overseas cash machine that hasn't been upgraded to chip and PIN - although to use a fake card at a foreign cash machine a criminal will also need to have obtained the card's PIN by separate means.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.10.0/8">I suppose that that explains how the advent of chip and pin and the use of other technology has provided an element of protection, but we cannot be complacent about this crime, given that criminals will use technology and other means to get round the chip and pin mechanism and to try to obtain details of the pin numbers. Such numbers can be obtained by various means.</p>
	<p pid="b.10.0/9">In discussing this issue, we must look at it in its wider context; by that, I mean the overall cost of financial fraud, including banking and credit card fraud. A report for the Association of Chief Police Officers' economic crime portfolio in February 2007 tried for the first time to demonstrate the total cost of financial fraud, of which this type of credit card fraud forms a part, to the UK economy. That report came up with the staggering figure of &pound;13.9 billion in 2005&mdash;including the cost of having to deal with financial fraud&mdash;of which fraud against private individuals amounted to &pound;2.75 billion. Those are huge numbers and they demonstrate the real cost of fraud and the fact that it is certainly not a victimless crime. Furthermore, it shows the impact that fraud has on our economy, if this level of finance is getting into the hands of organised criminal gangs.</p>
	<p pid="b.10.0/10">Credit card fraud is part of a wider picture of financial fraud. We might be talking this morning about counterfeit card fraud, skimming and cloning, but that fraud links into the selling of details abroad, using the internet and other technology that is now available. It also links into identity fraud, with the matching of information, such as matching credit card details with other personal information, and how that information is then combined to commit other frauds. Furthermore, once individuals have been identified by fraudsters, they can be targeted time after time.</p>
	<p pid="b.10.0/11">Also, with the advent of mass e-mailing, phishing e-mails and spam have been used to try to attract people either to some sort of direct fraud or to attract them to visit another website, where they can input their pin number and other information. If fraudsters can identify an individual and match their personal information with the information that has been skimmed off a credit card, it is easy to see how that combined information can be used to perpetrate perhaps even more convincing frauds. Therefore, this crime needs to be focused on clearly, because it is developing very quickly.</p>
	<p pid="b.10.0/12">My hon. Friend made the point about the use to which these fraudulently obtained funds are being put. Increasingly, questions are being asked about whether such funds are going not only to those involved in organised criminal activity&mdash;sophisticated, international, organised gangs&mdash;but to those involved in terrorist activities. That is why it is so important that, for our own safety and security, we do all that we can to counteract this very serious criminal activity.</p>
	<p pid="b.10.0/13">My hon. Friend talked in detail about the changes to the reporting of financial fraud that were introduced last April, since when I have been concerned about not only their practical impact, to which I shall return, but the message that they send. If an individual cannot report financial fraud to the police, that sends the very damaging message that it is not an important priority; indeed, it almost sends the message to criminal gangs that we are not bothered about financial fraud.</p>
	<p pid="b.10.0/14">Therefore, I remain critical of the way in which the changes were introduced. It was suggested that the aim was to reduce the bureaucracy involved in fraud recording and to streamline the reporting, recording and investigation of fraud. However, nothing happened in the case highlighted by my hon. Friend, in which 745 individual cards were, effectively, stolen after their details were obtained. That highlights a real failure in the system, which is not even operating in the way that was intended or meeting the goals that were set for it in terms of recording and reporting financial fraud.</p>
	<p pid="b.10.0/15">Last summer, I put several questions to the Government about the manner in which the new arrangement was to operate. In response, the Minister for Security, Counter-Terrorism, Crime and Policing stated:</p>
	<p pid="b.10.0/16" class="indent">&quot;From <phrase class="date" code="2007-04-01">1 April 2007</phrase> each police force now has a single point of contact...that has been set up to receive reports of cheque and plastic card crime direct from financial institutions. It is a matter for the financial institutions which crimes they decide to refer to the police for recording. It is then a matter for individual chief officers to decide which crimes will be investigated.&quot;&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2007-07-02.462"><i>Official Report</i>, 2 July 2007; Vol. 922, c. 462W</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="b.10.0/17">The system almost has two limbs: there is the question of whether financial institutions report fraud to the police, and whether the police do anything about it. From the individual case highlighted by my hon. Friend, it seems that the system is falling down on two levels, because there are questions about whether any of the incidents are properly reported to the police and&mdash;even when they are&mdash;whether anything is done about them.</p>
	<p pid="b.10.0/18">It is almost as if a double inertia has been created in the system, which masks the true extent of what is going on. Although we have the figures provided by APACS, the association admits that banks and financial institutions have no common standards governing the reporting of data to the centre or, indeed, whether to report it at all. That raises significant concerns because financial institutions almost have an incentive not to report. There is a fear that they do not want to show the true scale and nature of the problem, and nothing actively encourages them to do so.</p>
	<p pid="b.10.0/19">I heard clearly what my hon. Friend said about the letter that he received from the Financial Services Authority, and that raises an important point. We must ensure that the regulations that sit behind financial institutions operate robustly and clearly. I hope that the Minister will say that she has had contact with her colleagues at the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform to ensure that the regulation of financial institutions dovetails with other provisions so that we have a streamlined process. When I asked about that a few months back, however, I was given no real assurance that that was happening. Even if we assume that this is the right way forward&mdash;there are very real questions about that&mdash;the issue must be addressed at several different levels to ensure that regulation is robust and effective.</p>
	<p pid="b.10.0/20">The second part of the issue relates to the manner in which the police deal with such matters, and there is a certain chronology to the way in which different police forces are intended to investigate such crimes. First, there is the police force covering the location of the fraudulent operation, and then the police force area where the greatest number of individual usages has taken place. We then move down to the police force area where the first offence was committed and finally to that where the victim is located. I appreciate that we need a protocol and standards in place, but such an approach highlights the bureaucracy and complications involved. When someone has become a victim of a crime and wants something done about it, they must go through such a process or even get their Member of Parliament involved if they want the issue addressed.</p>

	<p pid="b.13.0/1">Does my hon. Friend agree that one important change that should be made is that people who have their money stolen should be referred to as victims, even if they are reimbursed? That, however, is not how I read the introduction to the Fraud Act 2006.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-02-19b.13.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1640" speakername="James Brokenshire" colnum="13"  time="010:11:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080219/halltext/80219h0003.htm#08021973000455">
	<p pid="b.13.1/1">The clear point that is being made is that fraud is not a victimless crime, and any suggestion to the contrary is counter-productive and unhelpful in ensuring that we crack down on fraud.</p>
	<p pid="b.13.1/2">Interestingly, that flows from the issue of reporting, which we have discussed. The answer that I got from the Minister of State last summer stated:</p>
	<p pid="b.13.1/3" class="indent">&quot;Where an account holder does contact the police to report this matter without having first spoken to their financial institution, a crime related incident will be recorded and the account holder will be referred to their financial institution.&quot;&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2007-07-02.462"><i>Official Report</i>, 2 July 2007; Vol. 923, c. 462W</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="b.13.1/4">I appreciate that one reason why that change was introduced was that people's experience of reporting such crimes to police stations was not good. Trying to get someone to focus on such things was difficult, and the whole experience continues to draw criticism from individuals and the business sector. However, something is wrong if someone who has taken the time and trouble to report something to the police is turned away and told, &quot;It's not our problem. It's not something we really want to be involved in.&quot; Again, there is the question of whether such things are regarded as important and of what message that sends out. That also plays into the issue of whether people will actually bother to report fraud to the police or their financial institution if they are not confident that something will be done about it. If they do not, we will end up with under-reporting and under-recording, and the law enforcement agencies will not have a proper indication of patterns of offending or the nature and scale of the problem that we face.</p>
	<p pid="b.13.1/5">I have a lot of respect for the dedicated cheque and plastic crime unit, whose representatives I have met. I have been to see its facilities, and I know that it takes this issue extremely seriously. The City of London police, as the ACPO lead on the issue, has also been pushing hard to raise the issue with the Government in the context of the ongoing fraud review, which I shall discuss shortly. However, there is not a level playing field in terms of the response that people receive from individual police forces, and although some police forces are very good, some are not. The Government's target-driven approach perhaps means that if we do not have a target, the issue is not a priority. That has perhaps meant that the discretion that people should have to treat crimes seriously has been fettered, with the result that the offences that we are discussing cannot be treated properly.</p>
	<p pid="b.13.1/6">I was shocked to hear about an individual case involving a financial institution. The institution had packaged up a number of offences, followed the protocol and given the case to the local police force that was responsible under the ranking system. First, nothing happened. The institution pressed again. What happened? The material was given to the dog handler. The institution was frustrated because it had tried to package the offences up and to give 20 different offences to an individual police force, after which nothing happened, and they were not treated seriously. Getting fraud prioritised and dealt with as a serious crime, in relation to cost and the increasing number of victims falling foul of it, is a serious issue. With the advent of the internet, and the changing nature of offending, the problem will become more serious, and we are not properly prepared either for the threats that we must withstand today or those that the country will face in the months and years ahead.</p>
	<p pid="b.13.1/7">It seems that there has been no proper assessment of the manner in which the system is being operated. My hon. Friend is right to urge the Minister today to undertake an assessment of the practicalities of the system and the proportion of cases that are actually reported to police forces after financial institutions have been notified, and to find out how many are then investigated. There is no real incentive to take the issue seriously. The way the scale of the problem is almost masked can, in some ways, bizarrely, suit financial institutions, in that it does not show the scale or nature of the problem. One might say that it also assists the Home Office, in that it ensures that the crime figures do not record that level of reporting.</p>
	<p pid="b.13.1/8">The Government have undertaken a fraud review, and in the spring of 2006 they published their interim report, in which they euphemistically accepted that</p>
	<p pid="b.13.1/9" class="indent">&quot;the lack of a national strategy meant that some problems are not being addressed.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.13.1/10">From the reports that we have received, and the individual reports of cases, that is an understatement. However, one thing that has come out of the proposal is the establishment of a national fraud strategy and a national fraud reporting centre. In principle, that is clearly a good idea, but I am entirely unconvinced about how it will work in practice. It is one thing to establish a national fraud reporting centre, but how will that fit into the arrangements that have been described this morning? How will it be promoted so that people understand that they should and can report individual incidents to the national fraud reporting centre? What guarantees are there that, even if the reports are sent through, something will be done to provide a proper insight into the nature of the problem and to ensure that criminals will be convicted of related offences, with a consequent reduction in harm?</p>
	<p pid="b.13.1/11">One of my concerns is that the online environment and the e-crime aspects of fraud reporting have not been properly factored into the establishment of the NFRC. Many industry players to whom I have talked say that that does not appear to have been on the radar screens until very recently. Therefore, practically, I have significant concerns about how effective the arrangements will be. Judging by the feedback that I am receiving, the prognosis is not good. I should be interested to hear from the Minister how the NFRC will tie into the existing reporting arrangements, and what comfort there will be in the sense that, if reports are made, something will be done. Will financial institutions be obliged to share reports with the NFRC? Otherwise it seems as if there will be no meaningful picture on the nature and extent of, or trends in, financial fraud.</p>
	<p pid="b.13.1/12">The Government have not been speedy in coming forward to address the matter. It does not appear to be the priority that it should be. I suggest that the approach to credit card fraud and e-crime has been lacklustre. Clearly, there is a growing problem, but the Government appear to prefer to see it as someone else's, not theirs. Sadly, it looks as if in the months and years ahead the consequence of that inaction will be that more people will fall victim to this growing crime, with all its impact and effects.</p>

I commend him for raising this important issue in his characteristically measured, calm and well researched way.</p>
	<p pid="b.15.0/2">The hon. Gentleman has raised some interesting and useful points. He has rightly pointed out&mdash;as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1640" name="James Brokenshire">the hon. Member for Hornchurch (James Brokenshire)</phrase> has mentioned&mdash;the impact that such crime has on people. The Government agree that credit and debit card cloning is not a victimless crime. Not only are the individuals who are targeted victims, but the whole of society effectively becomes a victim, because of the issues that he has raised.</p>
	<p pid="b.15.0/3">It was sobering to hear the example from the hon. Gentleman's constituency involving 745 transactions at one petrol station. However, it is worth highlighting the fact that fraud is not rampant at petrol stations. Rather, those are working environments where transactions are very frequent&mdash;people pour through making vast numbers of transactions, which are often small. Overall, such compromises occur in very few petrol stations. There is no particular reason to target petrol stations, other than the fact that they are retail outlets with high transaction rates.</p>
	<p pid="b.15.0/4">It is worth going into the background to set the scene on the issues around fraud, which have been raised by hon. Members from all parties. I remind the Chamber that credit and debit cards are genuinely a very safe way of going about business. I take issue with <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1641" name="Lynne Featherstone">the hon. Member for Hornsey and Wood Green (Lynne Featherstone)</phrase> on her example concerning pensioners and bank accounts. I am not sure whether it is her party's policy to suggest that it is safer for people to carry large amounts of money. Having had direct contact with many pensioners, and thinking about the amount of money that they could carry around, it is safer for their money to be in a bank account than it is for it to be known that people carry cash in the street or have cash at home.</p>

	<p pid="b.16.0/1">I do not want to labour the point, but I simply meant that vulnerable people with very little money can be more exposed if they have to wait for the banks to negotiate or if the banks extend the period before reimbursement, when presented with a case of fraud.</p>

	<p pid="b.16.1/1">If I have time, I will touch on some of those points later. We must remember that criminals will identify loopholes and weaknesses in any payment system. The hon. Member for Hornchurch is right when he says that Government and other bodies must be fast-moving to keep pace with that, which is why the Government work closely with industry&mdash;the fraud units in industry and banks are often ahead of the game. The Government take the matter seriously, and it is wrong to say that we do not, but it is important for us to work in partnership with others, because we cannot solve the problem alone. There are responsibilities among the financial institutions, and individuals to try to protect against fraud, and the Government clearly have a role. I shall outline what we have been doing, explain why we should not be thought complacent and discuss how we work with the financial sector and law enforcement to improve the situation and tackle fraud.</p>
	<p pid="b.16.1/2">Levels of plastic card fraud are higher than we would like, but I want to nail one myth: it is not impossible to go to the police to report an incident. An individual is still entitled to go to the police, but the first port of call would normally be the financial institution. The reasoning behind that is that there was a very low rate of reporting to police. Around 5 per cent. of relevant crimes were reported to them, as far as we could identify. It is difficult to be absolutely sure of the reporting level, but it was a very small number. In a case in which, for example, someone is clear that the fraud happened at a particular physical location, it is clearly sensible to report it to the local force, so that something can be done about it in real time. However, that does not negate the importance of gathering intelligence from a range of financial institutions to monitor patterns, which can be passed on to the police.</p>

	<p pid="b.16.2/1">Will the Minister accept, however, that when someone takes the time and trouble to go to the local police station and queue up to report an individual financial fraud, and they are then turned away by someone who says, &quot;I am sorry; we cannot help you and you must refer it to the financial institution,&quot; it hardly sends an encouraging message about reporting such incidents again?</p>

	<p pid="b.16.3/1">I cannot get drawn into what individual police station front desks might say, but if there is a problem with machines attached to banks cloning cards, as in the hon. Gentleman's constituency, the local police would take an interest. However, they would also gather intelligence, because a one-off situation might be lower priority than a situation involving regular contact. It is important that the police set their priorities and determine the most important issues to resolve. I just wanted to nail the myth that people cannot report such incidents to the police. However, it is important that the system works both ways.</p>

	<p pid="b.17.0/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2008-01-09">9 January</phrase> this year, the front page of <i>The Luton News </i>reported Bedfordshire police as saying that</p>

	<p pid="b.17.1/1">I am not familiar with <i>The Luton News, </i>but I look forward to receiving a copy and passing it on to the Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1593" name="Vernon Coaker">the Member for Gedling (Mr. Coaker)</phrase>. I am sure that he would be interested to read about that approach from the local police in Bedfordshire.</p>
	<p pid="b.17.1/2">As the hon. Gentleman has rightly acknowledged, chip and pin represents a major improvement in tackling card fraud. It was introduced to tackle precisely the type of fraud that we are discussing today. The chip makes it impossible to use a cloned card in a cash machine and for a criminal to use a lost or stolen card. The Government supported the banks in introducing that, and fraud on lost or stolen cards fell by 23 per cent. in 2006, compared with 2005, with a further 15 per cent. fall in the first six months of 2007. Losses in this country have fallen, but that has led, as we have heard, to clever approaches by fraudsters to use those cards abroad.</p>
	<p pid="b.17.1/3">I shall return to my point about how the Government alone cannot solve this problem. I have some sobering statistics that demonstrate the challenge at the international level. In 2006, plastic card fraud losses were &pound;428 million&mdash;3 per cent. lower than in 2005&mdash;but in the first six months of 2007 losses increased by 26 per cent., compared with the first six months of 2006. That increase was largely driven by increasing fraud abroad on UK-issued cards. Members will be pleased to know that the European banking industry has set a target of completing its chip card roll-out by 2010, which will protect British citizens and their cards from the sort of fraud that we have heard about today.</p>
	<p pid="b.17.1/4">Last year, the Home Office worked with the Association for Payment Clearing Services and the Foreign Office in order to raise the profile of the problem in the countries that account for the largest amount of fraud on UK-issued cards, and we continue to engage on an international level. That demonstrates, again, that many other people and Governments need to be involved in tackling such fraud. Hon. Members might be interested to know that fraud on UK-issued cards in America is increasing and that, in 2006, it accounted for 14 per cent. of total fraud losses abroad, so clearly work needs to be done. The industry has found it particularly difficult to engage with bodies in America over this problem. However, the Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department, my hon. Friend the Member for Gedling&mdash;this is primarily his area of responsibility&mdash;recently agreed to write to his political counterparts in the United States to raise the profile of the problem. We hope for progress on that and co-operation from the Americans.</p>

	<p pid="b.18.0/1">The Minister has talked about the international aspect, but will she comment on how the Serious Organised Crime Agency fits into the matter? How much of a priority is card fraud for it?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-02-19b.18.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1605" speakername="Meg Hillier" colnum="18"  time="010:35:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080219/halltext/80219h0003.htm#08021973000464">
	<p pid="b.18.1/1">With permission, I shall ask my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary to respond to that in writing.</p>
	<p pid="b.18.1/2">As hon. Members have mentioned, the Government introduced a fraud review, which led to us allocate &pound;29 million in order to implement recommendations arising out of it. I shall list the key points: we are setting up the national fraud strategic authority, which will drive UK anti-fraud strategy, as hon. Members have mentioned; we will establish a national fraud reporting centre, which will help to improve our intelligence and information on fraud; and we will establish a national lead force, which will enhance policing capacity. City of London police will be the lead force, and it is already the lead for the south-east. We want to build on its work and expertise in that important area.</p>
	<p pid="b.18.1/3">I shall explain the rationale behind the approach since April 2007, particularly because it has been criticised by the hon. Gentleman. However, I am pleased that the hon. Member for South-West Bedfordshire has acknowledged that the change to reporting to financial institutions was not necessarily wrong, although, as he has rightly pointed out, perhaps we can continue to make improvements in certain areas.</p>
	<p pid="b.18.1/4">A great deal of fraud is carried out by organised criminal gangs and it is important that we develop policies in order to understand how best to deploy resources against them. We hope that the improved reporting mechanisms mean that the level of reporting will go up. In many cases, the lack of reporting has meant dealing only with police figures, which are very low. In 2004-05, some 121,000 cheque and plastic card crimes were reported to police. In 2005-06, that figure fell to 88,000, and it fell to 59,000 in 2006-07. That sounds like a good news story, but the figure from APACS for 2006-07 was nearly 2.3 million.</p>
	<p pid="b.18.1/5">Clearly, there was a level of under-reporting to police, because most people just want their money back. It is not that people are not interested in passing the information on to the police, but they have busy lives and want to get the real problem sorted, which for them means getting their money back. Clearly, that has an effect on behaviour. I stress that there are very severe sentences for fraud by false representation&mdash;up to 10 years' imprisonment. Severe penalties can follow an investigation, and we want more introduced as a deterrent to people working in that area. The reporting of fraud is important, and we want to make it easier for people. That is why we adopted that approach, which has advantages for all concerned.</p>

	<p pid="b.18.2/1">I am sure that the Minister is coming to this point, but I am not sure when she will finish her speech, so I thought that I would intervene now. I would be incredibly grateful if, before concluding her remarks, she were to address my central point about enabling the police to seize a skimming machine early on. Reporting is one matter, but taking action to capture skimming machines or, even better, to apprehend criminals removing them, is the prize that I am seeking in order to protect my constituents and others from suffering needlessly from such crime over many weeks. Early action should be taken.</p>

	<p pid="b.19.0/1">There is nothing to prevent the police from doing that now. I shall move on, before concluding, to some of the other issues that the hon. Gentleman has raised about reviewing the situation.</p>
	<p pid="b.19.0/2">It is worth highlighting why the new system benefits people. The old system clearly had problems. The account holder can now go to their bank knowing that the information will be, or should be, filtered through to the police, where appropriate. Financial institutions now have a single point of contact in each force, which is key. I met with the single points of contact for different forces and other organisations in the country at the end of last year.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-02-19b.19.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1399" speakername="Andrew Selous" colnum="19"  time="010:35:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080219/halltext/80219h0004.htm#08021973000467">
	<p pid="b.19.1/1">Why does the Minister think that, despite the 745 people&mdash;not individual transactions&mdash;who had money stolen from their cards, not one bank or credit card company contacted the single point of contact in Bedfordshire police?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-02-19b.19.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1605" speakername="Meg Hillier" colnum="19"  time="010:35:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080219/halltext/80219h0004.htm#08021973000468">
	<p pid="b.19.2/1">I do not know the answer to that. We need to look at why that happens and whether it is a regular occurrence. Later, I shall touch on how the Home Office wants to review the current situation.</p>
	<p pid="b.19.2/2">The single points of contact will develop expertise. In the past, when cases were reported to police station front desks, it was not always clear whom they should be reported to. That was certainly a problem in cases involving complicated transactions involving several frauds in different locations, some of which might have taken place outside the local force's area or even abroad. It could get very complicated for local police forces. Single points of contact will develop expertise and allow intelligence to be shared between different points of contact with others in the local police force and with the national fraud reporting centre. That will help to build up a pattern of intelligence. That means that resources can be targeted at the most important cases in which there are the highest number of victims or the most serious incidents.</p>
	<p pid="b.19.2/3">The other benefit of the new system is that the police do not have to wait for correspondence from the financial institution while they assess whether the report concerns a genuine fraud. The police have an important duty, as do the financial institutions, to ensure that a fraud that is reported is indeed a fraud. I was perplexed by the comments from the hon. Member for Hornsey and Wood Green about how the financial institutions check out fraud. It is important for the banks to have a process, but that is not for the Government to determine. The banks must ensure that they investigate, otherwise fraudsters will have&mdash;excuse the phrase, Miss Begg&mdash;a blank cheque to claim fraud on their accounts. They would have their money reimbursed, if we were to pursue to the end the hon. Lady's approach.</p>

	<p pid="b.19.3/1">The point that I was trying to make is that it is becoming more difficult for people to secure reimbursement, because banks are introducing more investigation. No one says that the banks should not investigate, because they must, but the number of cases referred to the Financial Ombudsman Service is increasing. I should have thought that the Government would be interested to learn about that and concerned about the extension in the time taken to investigate.</p>

	<p pid="b.19.4/1">I welcome the hon. Lady's clarification.</p>
	<p pid="b.19.4/2">The hon. Member for Hornchurch asked how the national fraud reporting centre will work in practice, and I hope that I just answered some of that question. The centre will bring together the pattern of intelligence, just as in each local force, officers and lay professionals gather and analyse the data and intelligence to see the patterns of crime in an area. Similarly, the national fraud reporting centre will make such determinations, provide the data and intelligence to local forces and see whether there is a pattern throughout the country and internationally. It is worth stressing that the crime is international, as the figures that I have stated demonstrate. Therefore, intelligence gathering must be undertaken centrally. It would be an enormous burden on an individual force to try to tackle the issues internationally.</p>

	<p pid="b.20.0/1">I want to clarify with the Minister one specific point: how the current situation, with reports effectively going to financial institutions, will interrelate with the NFRC. If that information is not channelled from the financial institution to the NFRC, it will receive not a full but a partial picture. It will not receive the intelligence and patterns of criminal behaviour that the Minister has addressed in her comments.</p>

	<p pid="b.20.1/1">The financial and banking industries have been very positive about the establishment of the NFRC.

	<p pid="b.20.3/1">If the hon. Gentleman will forgive me, I must conclude my comments.</p>
	<p pid="b.20.3/2">The hon. Gentleman also raised the issue of fraud as a policing priority. It clearly competes with other serious and organised crime for policing priority, but the Home Office is consulting on a measurement framework to determine whether we can establish the levels of investigation and success. I stress again how seriously the Government take the issue. We have put in money to set up the mechanisms that I have outlined to ensure that there are better procedures not only to tackle fraud but to examine how we measure it.</p>
	<p pid="b.20.3/3">The hon. Members for Hornsey and Wood Green and for Manchester, Withington (Mr. Leech) have raised a couple of points. The hon. Member for Manchester, Withington raised an individual case anonymously, but it is difficult to comment on an individual bank's approach to fraud investigation. Financial institutions must take operational issues into account, but that is not the subject of this debate.</p>
	<p pid="b.20.3/4">The hon. Member for Hornsey and Wood Green has mentioned fraud that is growing through remote channels, which is a concern. There are several technical solutions to such fraud, including hand-held readers, and the Government are working closely with financial institutions to encourage the take-up of such initiatives by banks and the public. In the long term, I am responsible for the Home Office's and the Government's approach to identity cards, and we are at the early stages of investigating how that technology might benefit customers and financial institutions in that situation.</p>
	<p pid="b.20.3/5">It is worth highlighting the protective measures that individuals can also take. We in the House are responsible for reminding all parties and the public of what can be done. I urge the public to look out for attachments on cash machines&mdash;if something looks fishy, do not use it. If a credit card is taken out of one's sight, especially abroad, it is a risk, and it is always best to keep one's credit card in view. One simple measure is for people to advise their bank when they travel abroad legitimately, because it helps the bank to build up patterns of behaviour&mdash;including the interesting patterns that the hon. Lady has dangled before us, but about which she did not go into detail&mdash;to ensure that it is the customer's behaviour, not the fraudster's. Using only locked and secure websites is also important. People frequently give out information online to anything that looks legitimate, but it is important that they are aware of the security issue, as the hon. Lady has rightly said.</p>

	<p pid="b.22.1/1">It is a pleasure to see you chairing our proceedings today, Miss Begg. This is an important debate about the sentencing options available to our criminal courts, and I am glad that we shall be under your watchful eye as you take care of us with your usual compassion and attention to detail. I am also pleased that my hon. Friend the Minister will listen to today's contributions and respond to the debate. She is conscientious and diligent in carrying out her ministerial duties, and she will want to take close account of what is said. I hope that she will be able to respond positively to some of my points.</p>
	<p pid="b.22.1/2">About 1.3 million adults are sentenced each year in the courts of England and Wales. In addition, children and young people appear before the courts, and about 120,000 court disposals were reported in 2006-07 involving them. Overall, since 1997, the number of crimes, including violent crime, is down, and last year, the number of deaths that the police reported as homicides was down to an eight-year low. The debate presents us with an opportunity not only to consider what to do for the future, but to pay tribute to those who work so diligently and with such commitment to serve the public through their work in, and for, the criminal justice system.</p>
	<p pid="b.22.1/3">I very much support the police in their work. They play a pivotal role at every stage, from keeping the peace, through detecting crime, apprehending offenders, securing the evidence for convictions, enforcing bail conditions and taking part in the management of offenders subject to restrictions post-sentence, to playing their part to the full in multi-agency work, which includes persistent and prolific-offender programmes, such as the one I have visited four times in Stafford, and assessments of public protection and risk.</p>
	<p pid="b.22.1/4">In addition to the police, the Crown Prosecution Service works conscientiously to secure fair trials, convictions of the guilty and advice to courts on appropriate sentences. Working with the police and agencies such as Victim Support, it ensures that victims feel as involved in the process as they want to be and that the system places them and their interests at its heart. At least, that is the ambition. The last time we had Question Time to the Solicitor-General, I asked him whether he was yet satisfied that the CPS consistently achieves that aim. I hope that we will continue to give attention principally to the interests of victims in the criminal justice system.</p>
	<p pid="b.22.1/5">To carry on with my praise for those involved in the system, professional and lay judges bear heavy responsibility for decisions on guilt and innocence, bail and sentences, with a barrage of ill-informed criticism awaiting them when a decision is wrong or, with the benefit of hindsight, shown to be inadequate. Prison staff have a tough job keeping dangerous and violent people safely under lock and key and having an eye for vulnerable individuals who are not coping with imprisonment. They work tirelessly to improve the prospects of those leaving prison, so that they leave free from drug or alcohol misuse and with educational skills that they lacked on entry, and which will, we hope, assist them to be supported after release, especially in such crucial matters as housing, work and relationships.</p>
	<p pid="b.22.1/6">In the community, probation staff do phenomenal work with offenders. The risks are obvious given that there can hardly be 24-hour supervision, which is no doubt why so many probation officers give 110 per cent. effort to their work, routinely going beyond the call of duty, patiently working with offenders when others might feel like giving up on them, and securing benefits for the community at large by reducing offending, supervising payback and educating the public about sentencing.</p>
	<p pid="b.22.1/7">Then there is the Youth Justice Board and the many youth offending teams up and down the country, which perform so valiantly as they seek to divert children and young people from what might otherwise become a life of crime. Given the prolific nature of some offending, they are truly in the forefront of efforts to protect the public. As someone who took part in the many parliamentary debates about the creation of the National Offender Management Service, I know only too well that many other organisations contribute a huge amount to the work that goes on to reduce offending, to give effect to court sentences and to support victims of crime&mdash;organisations such as Victim Support, the National Association for the Care and Resettlement of Offenders and Rainer. No doubt there are many other groups and organisations that I have omitted to praise. I acknowledge the fantastic work that they all do, and I mean them no discourtesy by not naming them individually.</p>
	<p pid="b.22.1/8">I turn to the situation in our prisons and to imprisonment as a sentence. In my view, and I think that of most people, prisons should be reserved for dangerous and violent offenders. The public demand protection from dangerous people and severe punishment for people who commit heinous crimes. Prisons are full, partly because sentences are longer. Indeterminate sentences keep very dangerous offenders in prison longer, and those who breach their licence conditions after early release are much more likely to be returned to prison. That ought to give the public some reassurance that prison provides the right deterrent and punishment for dangerous people.</p>
	<p pid="b.22.1/9">However, the near doubling of the prison population in the past decade has created enormous pressures&mdash;not just financial cost to the state and the need to build more prisons, but the early release of prisoners and subtle pressure on sentencers. Faced with a case that is borderline but for which prison may be the right sentence, courts are given the message that there are no places in prison. We should consider ways to keep out of prison people who are not dangerous and who should be dealt with by community sentences. For non-violent women, imprisonment should be avoided when possible, for all the reasons that the Corston review recently set out. We should do much more to keep children out of prisons and comply with the United Nations convention on the rights of the child. In addition to working hard to keep women and children out of prison, we should provide alternatives to prison for people who do not pay fines, those with learning difficulties and those with a mental illness. Drugs and alcohol fuel crime, and there should be earlier access to health care outside prison.</p>
	<p pid="b.22.1/10">I wish to focus primarily on community sentences and other community solutions. The Criminal Justice Act 2003 helpfully sets out the purposes of sentencing in most cases. They are fivefold: punishment, reduction of crime, reform and rehabilitation of offenders, protection of the public and reparation by offenders to persons affected by their crimes. I enumerate them, but as I recall from the debates on the Act&mdash;I was closely involved in every stage of its parliamentary proceedings&mdash;the five were not intended to be in sequence. Each was to be weighed against the others by the sentencing court.</p>
	<p pid="b.22.1/11">How are we doing on the five purposes? Lord Woolf was asked that question by the Select Committee on Home Affairs when he gave evidence to it on <phrase class="date" code="2007-04-17">17 April 2007</phrase>. He said:</p>
	<p pid="b.22.1/12" class="indent">&quot;Perhaps we achieve the punishment of offenders, but when we look at the other four our record is very poor.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.22.1/13">He indicated the difficulty of reforming and rehabilitating prisoners when prisons are overcrowded and there is pressure on staff to deliver the courses needed. He believes that reparation solutions are underdeveloped and that we are not protecting the public sufficiently if we do not prevent reoffending effectively. I shall develop his arguments and suggest that there are ways in which we can do better.</p>
	<p pid="b.22.1/14">The aims of sentencing are best met when the period that elapses between the crime and the disposal is as short as possible. That is true especially when the offender is young, but it holds good for many crimes, irrespective of the offender's age. The public understand that argument and expect the Government, Parliament and the criminal justice system to make criminal cases shorter. Back in 1997, in the heady days of winning my first election to Parliament, I found that that message really resonated with the public. I remember Labour's five pledges on the little pledge card that we used to give out to people. One was to halve the time that it took to bring young offenders to court for their sentences. That resonated with the public because they understood the importance of keeping the distance between offence and sentence as short as possible. When only a little time elapses between the commission of the offence and the offender facing up to the consequences of it, the connection between wrongdoing and payback is strong for both the offender and the victim. That is why, in appropriate cases, fixed penalty notices and restorative justice can be so powerful. The former is self-explanatory, but I shall say more about the latter.</p>
	<p pid="b.22.1/15">There is now well-defined practice and law for restorative justice in cases involving children and young persons. A restorative justice order can even be made in a court. For adults, the position is less clear and the powerful tool of restorative justice does not play the role that it should in our criminal justice system. In Staffordshire, Chief Inspector Mark Riley has applied restorative justice solutions since 1994, and he is positive about their benefits. He told me:</p>
	<p pid="b.22.1/16" class="indent">&quot;The Victim often feels much better about the outcome, for even if they do not get recompense from the Offender, the fact that they have been able to 'Get it off their chest' is very cathartic for them.</p>
	<p pid="b.22.1/17" class="indent">The Offender will obviously 'benefit' as they do not get a conviction out of the process, although the emotional trauma that they go through in the RJ process and the fact that they have to apologise for their actions often means that they comment about it not being a soft option.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.22.1/18">The upsides of using restorative justice include, first, that it is victim-centred; the needs of victims are addressed and victims have a say in how the process should be carried out, so it empowers them rather than leaving them on the sidelines. Secondly, it is possible to hold group sessions&mdash;for example, in antisocial behaviour cases. Thirdly, it can involve all the interested parties and improve communication between different parts of the community. Fourthly, it can address long-standing complaints within communities as well as specific incidents.</p>
	<p pid="b.22.1/19">There are downsides, however, some of which we can address. In a police performance culture, restorative justice does not count as detection. The Government have recently begun to get a grip on that problem by releasing the police from over-prescriptive targets on detection. That is welcome, but, as with other community punishments and diversions from court, it is important that the community, the police and the criminal justice system all feel that restorative justice brings as positive a result as a court sentence would have achieved.</p>
	<p pid="b.22.1/20">A second downside is that it takes the police as long to resolve a restorative justice case as to prepare a full file for court. A third is that too few police officers are trained to facilitate restorative justice, which requires experience and skill to make it work in the victim's favour. However, training is available to those who want to pursue that outlet. Mark Riley referred me to Inspector Tony Walker of Thames Valley police, who trained him, so I sought out Inspector Walker and spoke to him about restorative justice. I am told that Thames Valley police is probably the best police force in the country at developing restorative justice as a solution. When I spoke to Inspector Walker yesterday, he was extremely enthusiastic about it as a general solution that ought to be widely available in criminal cases. He reports that through his use of restorative justice, there have been immense reductions in repeat and serial offending as well as reductions in crime in a problem area.</p>
	<p pid="b.22.1/21">There should be well-defined practices for offenders to apologise to victims and to hear what effect their crimes have had on their victims, and perhaps to pay compensation or do unpaid work for their victims. However, it should be clear which cases are suitable for that approach, and care should be taken to prevent its use where it would be dangerous or counter-productive. There should also be sufficient training of police officers and other facilitators to remove lack of capacity as an excuse for not using restorative justice. When restorative justice is the right solution, it ought to count as a successful conclusion to a case.</p>
	<p pid="b.22.1/22">Conditional cautions do not involve going to court to get a sentence. The Government place great store in conditional cautioning as a vehicle to achieve greater use of restorative justice. It will become universally available to the police and the Crown Prosecution Service in April after a period of trialling, including in Staffordshire. Police in Staffordshire who have experience of conditional cautioning speak positively about it. Will the Minister explain the Government's intentions regarding conditional cautioning from April onwards, when it becomes widely available? How much does she anticipate it will be used? Looking back at the pilots and trials, what assessment has been made of its success to date, and what success is predicted for the future?</p>
	<p pid="b.22.1/23">I recently asked the Minister about conditional cautioning in a written question. In her reply, she stated that the</p>
	<p pid="b.22.1/24" class="indent">&quot;compliance rate is about 6 per cent.&quot;&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2008-01-29.292"><i>Official Report</i>, 29 January 2008; Vol. 471, c. 292W</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="b.22.1/25">That sounds quite worrying, and it does not make much sense. If a conditional caution means that the police and the CPS have agreed that if a certain course of action has been taken, a caution will follow, non-compliance does not apply because there will be no caution if the required work is not carried out. I am not sure what the phrase means, so I would be grateful if the Minister will clarify that point.</p>
	<p pid="b.22.1/26">Conditional cautioning is quick and cuts out court sentencing altogether. I am content with that as long as the scheme meets other important public policy and sentencing objectives. Crucially, if that method of disposal is used regularly, there must be accountability about how it is used, so that there is no abuse. Statistics must be collected and published to ensure transparency.</p>
	<p pid="b.22.1/27">Although the debate is about sentencing, I have been talking about ways of keeping sentencing out of the hands of judges, which some people will think is good and others will think is bad. Before I discuss courts' sentencing powers, I shall say a little more about court diversion and other ways of resolving cases. There are methods that meet all the aims of sentencing policy and wider public protection, but which are quick and cut out the need for court proceedings; for example, drivers who are caught exceeding the speed limit may, in defined circumstances, pay to go on a speed awareness course and avoid fines and points on their driving licences&mdash;as can drivers who are caught driving without due care and attention. Such schemes have led me to consider where similar practices could be used.</p>
	<p pid="b.22.1/28">I recently asked some parliamentary questions about military training, which is given both to armed forces personnel and to members of the public by way of outreach work by the military. In reply to one of my written questions, the Under-Secretary of State for Defence, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1609" name="Derek Twigg">the Member for Halton (Derek Twigg)</phrase>, told me that there is a military corrective training centre at Colchester that</p>
	<p pid="b.22.1/29" class="indent">&quot;exists to retrain and rehabilitate service personnel who have offended&quot;.&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2008-01-22.1840"><i>Official Report</i>, 22 January 2008; Vol. 470, c. 1840W</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="b.22.1/30">There is also an outreach programme to help vulnerable young people outside the military, and young people could join the cadet forces that operate widely in the UK.</p>
	<p pid="b.22.1/31">I know from my experiences of cadet forces in Staffordshire that they are run on a shoestring. I regularly visit the military base at Stafford, where the Army cadets train, and I am the honorary president of the Penkridge air cadets, so I regularly visit their training centre too. I have seen the brilliant work that is done with youngsters to give them discipline, a sense of purpose, recognised qualifications and Duke of Edinburgh awards. As a result of their training, some young people have the ambition of joining our armed forces, and they are well placed to be recruited because of the skills and qualifications that they have acquired.</p>
	<p pid="b.22.1/32">Cadet force instructors are incredible people. Some of them volunteer completely, giving all their time for free, while others receive payment for some of their work, but do miles more than they are paid to do. We could not ask our overstretched military forces to do more with their money and pay for the kind of training courses that I am talking about, so we need to consider how we could fund such a solution. I am interested in that as a way of diverting people from a life of crime and certainly from an appearance in court. If by training people and putting them straight, the military gained a new way of recruiting suitable armed forces personnel, that would be an added bonus.</p>
	<p pid="b.22.1/33">The Minister of State, Ministry of Justice, my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1530" name="David Hanson">the Member for Delyn (Mr. Hanson)</phrase> recently told me in a written answer:</p>
	<p pid="b.22.1/34" class="indent">&quot;We are consulting with a range of organisations which have an interest in youth justice and the provision of youth justice services as part of the Youth Crime Action Plan which will be published in the summer, and will consider the feasibility of sending young offenders on training programmes by the armed services in light of the response to that consultation.&quot;&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2008-01-28.154"><i>Official Report</i>, 28 January 2008; Vol. 471, c. 154W</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="b.22.1/35">Therefore, this is not an out-of-field suggestion; it is under consideration. For some non-violent, antisocial offences, offenders could choose to go on training courses run by the military rather than going to court for sentencing. Such a scheme would apply mostly to young offenders, but need not be exclusively for young people.</p>
	<p pid="b.22.1/36">Nor need we stop at the military as providers of suitable training courses, such as the one that I just described. In Staffordshire, for example, the fire and rescue service runs a young firefighters training course. Those identified to take the course are young people in danger of social exclusion and those whose behaviour shows them to be in danger of becoming involved in crime.</p>
	<p pid="b.22.1/37">Can we not consider whether more providers are ready and willing to take part in schemes that have the backing and recognition of law? Could public sector bodies develop appropriate courses? Might there be private sector offers as well? Third-sector providers such as Rainer and the National Association for the Care and Resettlement of Offenders are already involved with similar projects.</p>
	<p pid="b.22.1/38">Those are my suggestions for taking the weight of sentencing off the court, but when we come to community sentencing itself, we must look at how we can make the process speedier. Beyond the early disposal of cases without a court hearing at all, existing community sentences ought to be adapted&mdash;adjusted by Parliament&mdash;to make possible a sentence that specifies attendance on training courses, such as the ones that I described, as a whole or a part of the court disposal. That would be in addition to the more than 6 million hours of unpaid work that are already carried out in the community each year.</p>
	<p pid="b.22.1/39">On that work, it is time that we settled whether payback is the brand for all reparation work that is ordered by the courts and carried out by offenders for the victims and the community more widely. We ought to ensure that there is much more labelling of the public property that is repaired or paid for by offenders as a result of such orders, and of community projects that have been completed by offenders undertaking unpaid work at the order of a court. In that way, the public would see constant reminders, as they went about their everyday business, that people had been caught, punished through the courts and made to do work to pay back the community for what they did. That would help us to inform and educate the public about crimes being detected and successfully prosecuted, and community sentences being served as a result. The public would then have a sense of the criminal justice system working for them, and punishment would be successfully allied with payback.</p>
	<p pid="b.22.1/40">One important aim of reducing reoffending is making people pay for what they have done wrong, but I appreciate that the National Offender Management Service has developed seven pathways for reducing reoffending. To remind hon. Members of the full list, NOMS deals with accommodation; education, training and employment; health; drugs and alcohol; finance, benefits and debt; children and families; and attitudes, thinking and behaviour. All are clearly important, and all require the speedy responses that I mentioned earlier.</p>
	<p pid="b.22.1/41">Alongside thinking about how we can quickly deliver a community sentence at the end of the process, I would like to deal with speeding up the procedures to get to the end of the process. That links up with my argument about keeping to a minimum the period between the offence and the sentence. It is important that we continue to encourage initiatives that are already taking place.</p>
	<p pid="b.22.1/42">The first and most obvious initiative is to free the police from unnecessary burdens of bureaucracy to allow them more time on the front line to do the work that we need them to do, of reassuring the public, catching criminals and keeping the peace. The Flanagan review, which has just been made public, makes important recommendations about cutting police &quot;blue tape&quot;. I am pleased to say that Staffordshire is actually pushing the Home Office to let it be at the forefront of implementing Flanagan recommendations to cut bureaucracy and free police to do the quality policing that the public want from them. That initiative would speed up the whole process.</p>
	<p pid="b.22.1/43">The second initiative, which has already begun but needs to be recognised and encouraged, is the excellent practice of co-locating police and prosecutors, thereby getting much earlier and more accurate decisions on the right charges and the right cases to take forward for prosecution. Allied to the successful co-operation between the police and the prosecution has been the development of low-bureaucracy court files for the most straightforward cases. Again, that takes away some of the excuses for unnecessary delays and the resulting adjournments in proceedings.</p>
	<p pid="b.22.1/44">There have been several experiments with specialist courts such as those for drugs and domestic violence cases, and there has even been talk of courts for mental health cases. As long as we assess the effectiveness of each, and as long as they do not divert resources that would be more effectively used for the mainstream business of courts, there is a lot to be said for developing expertise in each of those areas to speed up court proceedings.</p>
	<p pid="b.22.1/45">Another initiative that my friends in the Staffordshire police are enthusiastic about, having now witnessed it, is the virtual court. The police officer and the accused can remain at the police station. They are in touch with the court by a video link, and the whole process is got out of the way and dealt with without moving outside the custody suite in the police station.</p>
	<p pid="b.22.1/46">Those are procedures that we are already developing and adapting in this country to speed up the process. They should be welcomed and encouraged to take greater hold. If we speed up the process, and ultimately get effective community sentence orders from the court, it is important to ensure that those orders are then carried out effectively. There is no point in Members of Parliament such as me suggesting additional and refined sentencing powers if the existing ones are not already being used, where appropriate. I take that lesson from last month's report by the National Audit Office, which states:</p>
	<p pid="b.22.1/47" class="indent">&quot;Not all components of community orders are used in all probation areas.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.22.1/48">Why is that? What is wrong? Why are people given powers to operate and then not able to use them? The NAO finds that community orders are effective, that they offer benefits over other court sentences and that they can reduce reconviction rates. Contrary to popular belief, most sentences are completed&mdash;94 per cent., according to the NAO report, although, to be absolutely open and complete, it states that 94 per cent. are completed, breached or revoked.</p>
	<p pid="b.22.1/49">The report revealed a particular weakness in the use of one component of a community order: alcohol treatment. Given the concerns that members of the public have about how much of today's offending behaviour is fuelled by alcohol consumption, such a weakness is particularly inappropriate. The report says that the availability of the alcohol treatment component varies greatly across the country, and it identifies responsibilities not just in the Ministry of Justice and the Home Office but in the Department of Health and, at the local level, for primary care trusts and the deliverers of health services. NHS involvement means that Justice Ministers need to work conscientiously and as hard as they can across Government to ensure that the funding and facilities are in place to make alcohol treatment available everywhere.</p>
	<p pid="b.22.1/50">The final area that I wish to cover is parenting. I have learned in a lifetime of experiences, and as a lawyer who dealt with divorce cases, family dispute cases and public law cases involving children being taken away from their parents, that the first three years of everybody's life is the most crucial in determining how they will perform and behave throughout the rest of their life. One of the many experts whom I have heard speak said that we learn up to half of all that we ever learn, however long we live, in the first three years of life.</p>
	<p pid="b.22.1/51">Many people spout on about how schools and education can solve a lot of the problems of children who might be growing up with identified weaknesses. However, the starting age for school is five, reception classes are offered at four and a child may be able to get into a nursery at three, so nobody is near a school in the vital years from nought to three. Who are the vital educators during those years? The parents. That is so blindingly obvious, yet some parents do not understand how important they are. I want to look at ways of reducing offending behaviour by starting at the right point&mdash;at year zero&mdash;with every new citizen.</p>
	<p pid="b.22.1/52">Of course, this is a debate about sentencing, and we have an option called a parenting order, but that would be aimed at the parents of a youth&mdash;perhaps a teenager&mdash;who has offended. I am sure that those orders can sometimes be useful at that stage, but there needs to be rigorous enforcement of attendance and participation by parents. It is at that stage that we might find that the absence of parents or their inability to take part is the reason that we have a problem in society. Nevertheless, where parenting orders are used, we need to be as rigorous as possible in getting a whole-family approach to tackling the offending behaviour of the person who has been in trouble with the law.</p>
	<p pid="b.22.1/53">Parenting orders represent an intervention some way down the line, after the offending behaviour by the child has become established. I have been attracted to the work of an international charity called Wave. A report co-written by Professor George Hosking in 2005 draws a number of conclusions about how a public health approach to crime prevention in those first three years of children's lives could lead to a great reduction in violent behaviour and offending in later life.</p>

	<p pid="b.30.0/1">I congratulate the hon. Gentleman on bringing an important matter to the House in a balanced, eloquent manner. However, does he share my concern that over the past few decades, as the state has become more involved in parenting&mdash;for instance, it has prevented the loving chastisement of children by pulling them up or slapping them on the back of the leg when they are doing wrong&mdash;we have seen the growth not only of bad behaviour and crime among youngsters as they grow up, but of violent crime?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-02-19b.30.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1833" speakername="David Kidney" colnum="30"  time="010:57:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080219/halltext/80219h0005.htm#08021973000481">
	<p pid="b.30.1/1">No, not really. Of course, I share all the concerns that the hon. Gentleman has mentioned&mdash;that is the point of my mentioning parenting in a debate about court sentencing&mdash;but the use of violence by a parent to reinforce discipline reflects completely the wrong attitude. Violence between a parent and a child is a sign of failure and of pushing the child away from the parent, instead of their being drawn in and loved and cared for. I do not share his analysis of what the right solution to the problem is, although I agree that there is a problem. I should like to expand a little on that to show what I mean.</p>
	<p pid="b.30.1/2">I have more time than I thought, so I should like to say a little more about the 2005 Wave report, which concluded, among other things, that serious violence in England and Wales is rising and that that trend can be reversed by effective early interventions focusing on the period from pregnancy to the age of three. Another conclusion of the report, which is the result of nine years' research&mdash;this is not something that has been considered lightly&mdash;is that the propensity to violence is developed primarily from wrong treatment before the age of three.</p>
	<p pid="b.30.1/3">We should explain to every parent how important those first three years are, to equip them with the skills and the outside support that they feel that they need, entirely through their choice. However, the danger is the nanny state, which was the point that the hon. Gentleman was drawing me towards. I understand that it is for each parent to do their job and carry out their responsibilities, but as a society it is our job to make them appreciate what their role is and give them support when they feel that they need it. It is entirely for them to choose whether they need it or not. However, if parents fail in their job, when their children end up in the court system we must hold them to account as well as their children. That is the incentive for them to pay attention when we give them such messages.</p>
	<p pid="b.30.1/4">In my constituency, I have been promoting for Staffordshire a universal parenting support service that is available to all parents. Universality is important. We should not try to stigmatise bad parents, because that would simply drive them away from us. We need to say that every parent reaches a point when they need somebody to turn to and there is nothing wrong with people turning to help that is already available for them. That is what I would like to achieve. However, that does not mean adding some new agency of the state. In my constituency, health visitors, midwives, general practitioners' practice nurses, churches and organisations such as Home-Start already exist: it is about branding them, drawing them together and offering support. My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1747" name="Graham Allen">the Member for Nottingham, North (Mr. Allen)</phrase> is doing similar creative work in Nottingham, trying to make it the early intervention city, precisely on the same reasoning that I am using. That is a very important way forward.</p>
	<p pid="b.30.1/5">There are some recommendations at the end of the Wave report, based on research and hard evidence from around the world, about some of the responses that we ought to consider applying as a matter of course in this country: a course called &quot;Roots of empathy&quot;, drawn from successful practice in Canada, prepares parents-to-be while they are still schoolchildren; a British charity, Parents in Partnership Parent Infant Network, prepares parents-to-be during the first pregnancy; in the United States of America, the Nurse-Family Partnership supports first-time parents from pregnancy onwards; and there is also an internationally known approach called the &quot;circle of security&quot;, which is a group-based parent intervention programme to increase sensitivity between parents and children. All those ideas already exist. The Wave report says simply:</p>
	<p pid="b.30.1/6" class="indent">&quot;Debate is invited on the merits of a focused, national crime prevention agency to co-ordinate, fund and drive effective early prevention strategies.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.30.1/7">It is calling for a debate about what is the most effective use of our money.</p>
	<p pid="b.30.1/8">I attended a presentation by Professor George Hosking at which he showed that intervention in a child's life had the greatest effect from nought to three years old. He superimposed on that profile the spending by the state on children's upbringing. The biggest payment that we make as a state is when children are 15, 16 or 17 and the smallest payment is when they are aged from nought to three. Yet the greatest intervention that we could make is at nought to three. We ought to think about whether we should make changes. I say to the Minister that it is important to work across Government to get the right solutions.</p>
	<p pid="b.30.1/9">I have been speaking for quite a while because I am the only Back Bencher who wants to make a full speech, but I will come to my conclusions now. Another great connection that Labour made with voters in 1997 was through the promise of being &quot;tough on crime, tough on the causes of crime&quot;. We have certainly been tough on crime in terms of more and longer prison sentences. That seems to be Lord Woolf's conclusion as well. We have been tough on some of the societal causes of crime, for example, cutting worklessness, rough sleeping and poverty. But my connection with my public in my Stafford constituency tells me that other causes of crime have been under-addressed. People often mention a loss of discipline, a decline in standards of behaviour in public and binge drinking.</p>
	<p pid="b.30.1/10">For me, discipline starts with good parenting and upbringing. Upholding decent standards of behaviour calls for a genuine zero tolerance of annoying public crimes such as damage to property, graffiti, litter, public disorder and antisocial behaviour. Tackling binge drinking requires determination to stop supermarkets selling alcohol below cost price.</p>
	<p pid="b.30.1/11">I want accommodation, health care and help getting a job to be available to people at risk of offending before they commit an offence. I want those who wish to face up to their drugs and alcohol misuse helped to overcome their addiction before they embark on a rash of acquisitive crimes to feed their habit. Sometimes, people commit such crimes precisely to access one or more of those supports because they cannot get them soon enough as law-abiding citizens. That is wrong. As I have said, a cross-Government approach is required to achieve such outcomes.</p>
	<p pid="b.30.1/12">It is the responsibility of Back-Bench and Opposition Members of Parliament, as elected representatives of the British people, to exert pressure on the Government to take the right actions, facilitate the passing of the laws that are needed and scrutinise the resultant use of funding and other resources to make sure that the taxpayer gets best value. Above all, it is our responsibility to bring about safer communities and a safer Britain.</p>

	<p pid="b.32.0/1">It is a pleasure to take part in this debate, Miss Begg, and I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1833" name="David Kidney">the hon. Member for Stafford (Mr. Kidney)</phrase> on securing it. The hon. Gentleman has a long history, in his career in the House, of raising issues of this kind and speaking with a great deal of intelligence and commitment on matters associated with criminal justice. He and I, and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1615" name="Edward Garnier">the hon. and learned Member for Harborough (Mr. Garnier)</phrase>, are veterans of too many criminal justice Bills for our own good. Nevertheless, we have frequently had the opportunity to debate such issues.</p>
	<p pid="b.32.0/2">The hon. Gentleman is right to look at sentencing in the context of what happens beforehand. I was pleased that he paid tribute to a large number of the participants in the process, including the police. Sentences cannot be imposed until a criminal is before a court, and my view has always been that the greatest deterrent to crime is the expectation of being caught, but sadly that has not been the case for far too long.</p>
	<p pid="b.32.0/3">The hon. Gentleman was also right when he said that we have not paid enough attention&mdash;the Government have certainly not done so&mdash;to the causes of crime, particularly the elements that he described, and parenting is a large component of that. I do not want to be misunderstood in suggesting that there is an hereditary component to crime, and I am certainly not talking about a genetic predisposition; I am talking about a behavioural element, because there is undoubtedly learned behaviour from parents and peer groups. If that disjunction can be cracked, intervention at an early age is more likely to reduce people's potential to find themselves in a life of crime. That is not universally the case, and some parents have done everything that might be expected of them, but still find their children in trouble with the law. I do not want my suggestion to be considered an absolute, but the hon. Gentleman is right in saying that we have not yet sufficiently considered the idea.</p>

	<p pid="b.33.0/1">The hon. Gentleman may recall that in 1997, I introduced a private Member's measure on underage drinking and confiscation of alcohol, which is now much talked about and much used&mdash;probably the most used law in the land, apart from traffic regulations. Is he aware that the legislation tried to ensure that when removing alcohol from young people, police officers would always tell the parents and involve them so that they could take control action with their youngsters? That provision has not been widely used until now, but does he welcome the fact that at last the Home Secretary has woken up to it, and is telling the police to use that facility?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-02-19b.33.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1824" speakername="David Heath" colnum="33"  time="011:39:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080219/halltext/80219h0006.htm#08021973000484">
	<p pid="b.33.1/1">I certainly welcome that, but I also recognise the practical problems for a single officer or pair of officers on the beat in towns such as Frome in my constituency on a Friday evening. I have been out on patrol with the police, and there are many underage drinkers on the streets in Frome on Friday nights. Dealing with them is a problem, and my question is: why do parents not ask why a 13 or 14-year-old is not at home well past midnight, and why, when they finally return, they are legless? That returns to the point made by the hon. Member for Stafford about parenting and the expected norms in exercising a little parental control. However, that is a slight diversion from what we are discussing: sentencing policy.</p>
	<p pid="b.33.1/2">I am pleased that among his bouquets, the hon. Gentleman handed one to the lay magistracy, because we often do not recognise its extraordinarily difficult and unpaid job, and the value that it adds to society.</p>
	<p pid="b.33.1/3">What should we look for in sentencing? My starting point throughout my forays into home affairs and justice matters is to ask whether it is effective in reducing crime. That is the whole point of a criminal justice system. If it does not reduce offending, it is not doing its job effectively. Secondly, we are entitled to expect some consistency throughout the country and in relation to specific crimes, so that there is an underlying feeling about the justice of the outcome for any specific disposal. Thirdly, we must allow discretion. It is not for Parliament or the Government to prescribe in minute detail the outcome of a court case. There is no point in wise people sitting in judgment if they cannot take account of the evidence before them and the circumstances of the crime in question. Such discretion is an important part of the principles of justice.</p>
	<p pid="b.33.1/4">Fourthly, we should seek more transparency, which returns us to the argument we often have in this place about honesty in sentencing. We should describe sentences in a way that everyone inside and outside the courts understands, so that they are not dismayed by the realisation that when we say someone will serve 20 years in prison, they are released after five or six years, and that a 20-year sentence is not in fact a 20-year sentence, or that a life sentence is not for life. We need honesty in sentencing, and that can be achieved in the way in which we describe sentences, rather than by any major change in the nature of sentences. Finally, we must have centrality in sentencing from the victims' point of view, and their concerns must be put before the court, understood by the court and, if possible, addressed by the court.</p>
	<p pid="b.33.1/5">For many years we have concentrated far too much on custodial sentences as the only &quot;proper&quot; sentences that work. Custodial sentences undoubtedly have a part to play, and are the only effective sentence for protecting the public from a dangerous criminal who is likely to reoffend, so it is essential that such sentences play a part in our penal process. However, the hon. Gentleman was right in saying that they are often used when they are not the best disposal, although his argument that because more people are breaking their licences and being returned to prison, the public should be reassured that prison is working was rather difficult to understand in logical terms. I suggest that it may do the opposite.</p>
	<p pid="b.33.1/6">Why are our prisons so overcrowded? Why do they so often fail in their primary duty of rehabilitation, re-education and the reduction of recidivism? They contain far too many people with mental health problems who should be in secure mental health units. They contain far too many people with drug and alcohol dependency issues that should be treated rather than simply reinforced, as, sadly, they often are in the prison estate. Far too many women are in prison. Baroness Corston's report clearly shows that women who do not represent a danger to the public are often imprisoned inappropriately for lower level offences. There are certainly too many children in our prisons. There are better ways of dealing with children, and there is ample evidence that prison does not work in reducing offending in children. The reverse is the case.</p>
	<p pid="b.33.1/7">Too many people are serving short-term sentences when all the evidence is that such sentences are almost certain to result in a reoffending individual. Why on earth do we spend enormous amounts of public money on putting people into prison for a very short time when they can have no opportunity for education or rehabilitation, and when they reoffend almost immediately after being released? Some of the figures show that reoffending rates exceed 90 per cent., and that includes only those who are caught. The system simply does not work in its primary purpose, so why do we spend enormous amounts of money on pursuing a policy that does not work?</p>

	<p pid="b.34.0/1">The hon. Gentleman asks an important question: why do sentencers send people to prison for short periods even though they know that it will not help to reduce reoffending? What is his answer? My answer is that it is because until recently there has been lack of confidence in community alternatives, although the trend is beginning to change. My contribution is about trying to create even more confidence in the community sentence alternative.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-02-19b.34.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1824" speakername="David Heath" colnum="34"  time="011:39:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080219/halltext/80219h0006.htm#08021973000486">
	<p pid="b.34.1/1">The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right. I was just about to mention that issue. There are better possibilities for effective community sentences, but the problem is that until recently the Government have appeared not to believe in such proposals and the public do not believe in them either. We need to establish in the public mind the fact that community sentencing can be rigorous and effective and do the job as well, or better, than a custodial sentence. To do that we need to re-examine the way in which we deal with community sentencing.</p>
	<p pid="b.34.1/2">There are some high-intensity schemes with prolific offenders that operate in the community. Such schemes cost a lot of money and are not undemanding in terms of resources, but it has been shown that they can reduce offending among a notoriously difficult group of offenders. In Bristol, a scheme has been operating for some time with, interestingly, the police as the prime movers, although they work with other agencies. I used to be the chairman of Avon and Somerset police authority and am impressed by what the force has been doing. I would like to see more such schemes, but I recognise that there needs to be a large resource for them to work effectively. There will, of course, be failures; we are talking about prolific offenders who have been to prison and come out. We should deal with a comparator that makes sense in terms of the general public, but nevertheless such schemes have been shown to be more effective than simply a lock-them-up-and-forget-about-them approach.</p>
	<p pid="b.34.1/3">What would make community sentencing more acceptable in terms of public perception? The hon. Gentleman mentioned some points in relation to that. Immediacy is important, as is propinquity to the offence and the community that is affected because that means there is a relationship between the offence and the offended community or individual. Visibility is also important. We must make community sentencing more visible so that the public realise that it is not a soft touch, but a way of directly making amends for the crime in the community in which it has been committed. If we put those factors together, there is likely to be greater public acceptability. The restorative element, whether within a formal community sentence or outside it, is extraordinarily important and we should find ways to incorporate it so the person who is arrested for graffiti is seen to clean up the graffiti that he or she created. The restorative element is important for establishing public confidence and there are many examples of that kind.</p>
	<p pid="b.34.1/4">The hon. Gentleman is right: it is often most difficult for the offender to come to terms with the restorative element. When an offender has to come face to face with the victim and say how sorry they are, they realise how much their action has affected that individual.</p>
	<p pid="b.34.1/5">The worst argument for community sentencing is simply to say that it is needed because our prisons are full. I am worried about much of what has recently happened because there have been some quite arbitrary measures. Rather than having confidence that community sentencing is a better disposal, people have been saying, &quot;Well, we haven't got enough room in prisons so we will require our magistracy or judges to use community sentencing more&quot;. I hope that will not be the case in future, but it worries me. The Lord Chancellor has set up a review of sentencing, on the basis of the Sentencing Guidelines Council, which will consider the relationship between sentencing and penal provision. The Lord Chancellor appears to have pre-empted that review in his speech last week in America&mdash;I think it was at George Washington university&mdash;where he appeared to say, &quot;Well, we want to go the way of the American model where in some states there is a direct relationship between cell availability and sentencing policy&quot;. I question that approach. It may work in Minnesota or Michigan&mdash;it is a state beginning with M, but I cannot remember which one&mdash;but it will not work for us. Such a policy is not right in principle either, because if somebody is a threat to the community, they should be in prison; if they are not a threat, we should consider the alternatives and ensure that they work effectively.</p>
	<p pid="b.34.1/6">Other disposals are below the level of formal court hearings, such as disposals at neighbourhood courts or at a peer group level. That sort of thing has been experimented with; for example, a restorative justice panel in Chard, Somerset, has worked well. Recidivism levels are well below those of a normal court dealing with the same sort of individual because there is a relationship between the offender, the offended against and the community. We need to consider such proposals, explore their effectiveness and see how far they can be expanded.</p>
	<p pid="b.34.1/7">A further level below court, to which the hon. Gentleman referred and about which he is slightly more enthusiastic than I am, is that of summary measures taken by a police officer or prosecutor. I am worried about the proliferation of summary disposals that do not have the advantage of a court or judicial input. It is far too easy for a police officer or even a prosecutor to take an injudicious decision for the benefit of his or her records, rather than in the interests of justice. I am not saying that all such disposals are wrong&mdash;we all live in the world of fixed penalty tickets for parking and traffic offences&mdash;but I am worried that they are increasingly being used as an alternative to a proper judicial process. The same applies to processes that pre-empt the actual commission of an offence&mdash;the various forms of civil injunction to reduce criminal offending. I do not wish to sound too pompous, but the more we go down that road, the more we erode the principles of British justice. If such measures are effective, we need to consider them in terms of reducing crime, but we should be aware that we are putting the cart before the horse, or the sentence before the commission of an offence, which is a dubious approach.</p>
	<p pid="b.34.1/8">[David Taylor <i>in the Chair</i>]</p>
	<p pid="b.34.1/9">My last point is about the importance of diversionary availability, to which the hon. Gentleman referred. I am not convinced that Colchester would welcome a lot of civil offenders or that cadet forces are the best place for people who have no interest in the armed forces, but simply need to be kept off the streets&mdash;putting a gun in their hands may not be the best way of teaching them to be better citizens. However, I accept that we should do a lot more in relation to youth provision, of which the cadet forces are an important part, and that we should provide alternative structures and diversions for young people so that they are interested in and engaged by something and are active. They need excellent role models to learn from and, to that extent, the hon. Gentleman is right.</p>
	<p pid="b.34.1/10">We have a sentencing and a criminal justice system to protect the public and to reduce crime and re-offending. That is what our sentencing procedures should be about; not simply sounding tough, but being effective.</p>

	<p pid="b.37.1/1">The hon. Gentleman has reached the next part of my virtual notes. I was about to declare an interest. I am a Crown court recorder and have had some good and bad experiences of the problems that our criminal justice system currently has in relation to sentences.</p>
	<p pid="b.37.1/2">I spent last week sitting as a recorder in a court in London. Every time that I do that, I face the same problem&mdash;our prisons and community punishment system are overcrowded. We can see an overcrowded prison, but an overcrowded community punishment system is not so obvious. According to Government statistics, about 60 per cent. of our prisons are officially overcrowded. It is no longer controversial to say that our prisons are overcrowded. Last Friday, we reached a disgusting state of affairs in which nearly 82,000 people were being held in custody. Even the Operation Safeguard system had hit the ceiling. Some 400 people were in police or court cells as a consequence of the Government's mismanagement of the present system, which prevented those who were sentenced or on remand from being housed in proper prisons.</p>
	<p pid="b.37.1/3">That has a consequence. Unlike prison cells, police and court cells do not have the facilities to evaluate medically the people who are sent there. The point made by the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome about the mentally ill and those who are affected by substance abuse is writ large when such people have to be detained overnight, or for several nights, in police cells. It is bad enough in a place such as Pentonville in which the medical staff are working their backs off just to stabilise the drug addicts in their care. They cannot hope to get them off drugs or make them better. All they can do is to stabilise them with a methadone scrip or some other form of medication to ensure that they do not die during the course of their custody.</p>
	<p pid="b.37.1/4">I thought that the hon. Member for Stafford would mention the current state of affairs in relation to the ability of sentencers in Staffordshire to give the appropriate sentence. As I understand it, and the hon. Gentleman will correct me if I am wrong, magistrates in Stafford, and Staffordshire more widely, find it increasingly difficult to sentence offenders to community punishments because such courses are no longer available. Therefore, for those people for whom custody is not appropriate, the resources are no longer in place to sentence them, under the Criminal Justice Act 2003, to one of the community sentence options, such as unpaid work, or alcohol or drug rehabilitation&mdash;I think that there are 12 such options. I know, Mr. Taylor, that as a magistrate you will have some familiarity with that as well. As a consequence, magistrates in Stafford and Staffordshire now have to send inappropriate people into custody as opposed to dealing with them in the community. That adds to the terrible problem of overcrowding that the Government have created.</p>
	<p pid="b.37.1/5">Mr. Taylor, if I have not finished by 12.15, will someone please shut me up?</p>

	<p pid="b.38.0/1">I want the Minister, who has been waiting patiently, to have an opportunity to respond to the points that have been made. In particular, I would like her to respond to the points made by the hon. Gentleman, even if she does not have time to respond to those made by the Opposition.</p>
	<p pid="b.38.0/2">Since 1997, the criminal justice system has been going through a period of revolution. Unfortunately, we have seen more movement than productivity. That is beginning to manifest itself in the overcrowded prison estate and in the inability of justices of the peace to sentence appropriately. As the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome said at the end of his remarks, sentencers' discretion is being undermined on a daily basis. I am not suggesting that there is a malign motive. I do not believe that the Minister and her colleagues get up in the morning and say, &quot;How can I further erode the judicial and sentencers' discretion?&quot; However, that erosion is the unintended consequence of the mismanagement of our criminal justice system.</p>
	<p pid="b.38.0/3">The prison and probation services have been victims of the Government's failed experiment in public sector reform through targets and central control. The Government confidently believed that central Government could hold unwieldy Departments to account using top-down targets. Civil servants would be rendered super-efficient, almost stakhanovite, with the aid of efficient modern IT systems. However, their confidence was misplaced. Officials have been burdened with too many targets. Monitoring has forced them to meet intermediate targets, leading to ineffective, demoralising box-ticking instead of productive and fulfilling work. The IT systems that are supposed to make the whole system function have invariably been late and over budget.</p>
	<p pid="b.38.0/4">The Government rightly realised that the split between prison and probation is the root cause of failure, but their attempts to fix it have foundered. The first attempt was the National Offender Management Service, which was envisaged by Lord Carter as a new bureaucracy that would co-ordinate the prison and probation services. NOMS assigned a case officer&mdash;an offender manager&mdash;to follow the progress of each criminal from the time that they were sentenced until they were reintegrated into society. The officer was to use a state-of-the-art computer system, C-NOMIS. However, instead of drawing together prisons and probation, as Carter wanted, the Government created an inflated bureaucratic monster that sat above the Prison Service and probation service, did little to facilitate co-ordination, and sucked more than &pound;1.5 billion a year&mdash;more than the budget of the national probation service&mdash;from the resources available for offender management. The computer system, C-NOMIS, was late and over budget, and the Ministry of Justice has now announced that a system that it previously described as</p>
	<p pid="b.38.0/5" class="indent">&quot;central to end-to-end offender management&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.38.0/6">will not be rolled out to the probation service. As for NOMS, the Government have decided to merge the top management of the Prison Service, probation service and NOMS, effectively subsuming a slimmed-down NOMS into the Prison Service, but without integrating the delivery of the services on the ground.</p>
	<p pid="b.38.0/7">Meanwhile, Ministers have continually interfered in the running of prisons. The former director general of the Prison Service and chief executive of NOMS, Martin Narey, said on Radio 4's &quot;Analysis&quot; programme on <phrase class="date" code="2006-07-20">20 July 2006</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="b.38.0/8" class="indent">&quot;The Prison Service for some years has been an executive agency in name only. The autonomy, the ability of its director general to get on and manage the organisation has been significantly eroded... I was spending 70 per cent. of my time in my last year at the Home Office managing ministers. For prison and probation services alike, targets have been focused on measurable levels and on throughputs, but not on success at tackling reoffending.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.38.0/9">That, as a recent National Audit Office report has found, creates perverse incentives and outcomes, stifles innovation, and ultimately restricts the ability of the Ministry of Justice to deliver on its own service level agreement to reduce reoffending.</p>
	<p pid="b.38.0/10">The Government's approach suffers from two fundamental flaws: the chasm between prison and probation, which they have failed to bridge, and the lack of incentives for people within the system, which they have not attempted to address. In essence, reoffending has not been reduced because it has been nobody's job to reduce it. That is why we have the problems that the hon. Members for Stafford and for Somerton and Frome mentioned in relation to the collapse of the sentencing system.</p>
	<p pid="b.38.0/11">Time does not allow me to analyse what is going wrong with our prisons. Let me deal with the subject of community punishments, which is creaking in Stafford and Staffordshire, and, increasingly, elsewhere in the country. Magistrates deal with about 90 to 95 per cent. of all criminal cases. Although the Crown court deals with more serious offences, it deals with a smaller proportion of the offences brought to justice. It has often been said that the answer to the state of our prisons is to give up and to advocate the use of community punishments. The hon. Member for Somerton and Frome highlighted the implied policy of the Secretary of State for Justice that, because of the prison overcrowding, the only thing that can be done is to send inappropriate people on community punishments. I do not think that he has gone that far, but he might yet. That would be as wrong as over-filling the prisons in the first place.</p>
	<p pid="b.38.0/12">We reached a ludicrous stage last Thursday, when the Prison Service and the probation service met for a private conference in Leeds, at which the director general of the Prison Service, Mr. Wheatley, was having to advise prison governors during the tea break to go back to their telephones and ring their prisons to ensure that the overcrowded prison estate was emptied into the less crowded open prison estate. &quot;If necessary, use your own transport,&quot; he is alleged to have said. The Government have organised a grossly irresponsible set of affairs whereby the director general of the Prison Service is, as a consequence of prison overcrowding, requiring unsuitable people to be decanted out of the secure estate into the open estate.</p>
	<p pid="b.38.0/13">I am no spokesman for the Prison Officers Association, but I am not surprised that on <phrase class="date" code="2008-02-18">18 February</phrase> it issued a press release that stated:</p>
	<p pid="b.38.0/14" class="indent">&quot;POA members were bussing prisoners from establishment to establishment to try and accommodate almost 82,000 prisoners over the weekend. This policy will lead to unrest amongst prisoners and prisoners being placed in unsuitable accommodation and thus endangering the general public. We are aware that the Ministry of Justice have instructed all Governors to send prisoners to open prisons. It is believed that all open prisons will be operating at around 95 per cent. capacity. To the POA that can only mean one thing; open prisons will be dangerous places to work in and the public in surrounding areas will be at risk...The problems of overcrowding are not new; and the problems we face today are as a direct result of the lack of real investment for new prisons over the last 10 years. If things continue as they are we will see more and more unsuitable and dangerous prisoners released early and public safety will be at risk.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.38.0/15">Believe that or not, it is a fact that unsuitable people are now being pushed through to the open prison estate and, as a consequence, are not receiving the proper rehabilitation that they should have received within the closed estate if the sentencing planning system was operating in a correct manner. Just as the resources appear to have been mismanaged in the secure estate, so the resources are now being managed in a detrimental fashion in the community punishment system, particularly in Staffordshire.</p>
	<p pid="b.38.0/16">The Secretary of State for Justice was invited to address the Howard League for Penal Reform and in a speech to it on <phrase class="date" code="2007-11-21">21 November 2007</phrase>, which I attended, he said:</p>
	<p pid="b.38.0/17" class="indent">&quot;For people sentenced to under twelve months in prison, reoffending rates have long been too high, and this is the case regardless of exactly how long those prisoners are inside. Community sentences will, in many cases, be a better alternative.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.38.0/18">However, robust alternatives to custody have so far evaded the Government. As the National Audit Office observed in a report published in January,</p>
	<p pid="b.38.0/19" class="indent">&quot;for unpaid work to be seen to be punishing and implemented properly, it needs to be demanding&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.38.0/20">However, probation inspectors found that only 63 per cent. of unpaid work requirements were suitably demanding. The Ministry of Justice concedes that, although the maximum amount of work under such requirements can be up to 300 hours, the average is only 100.</p>
	<p pid="b.38.0/21">There is a place for community sentences to deal with offenders whose crimes do not warrant imprisonment and where treatment in the community offers a better prospect of rehabilitation than imprisonment. Such punishments can be useful in so far as they allow offenders to remain close to home, family and work, while affording opportunities to receive vital rehabilitation and skills. However, they cannot simply be used as an act of faith, and should not be used simply because the jails are full. The way to use community punishments to reduce the prison population is to make community punishment work to reduce reoffending, and so reduce the supply of criminals who will be sent to prison in the future.</p>
	<p pid="b.38.0/22">In the past decade, the Government have embraced community sentences as a way to divert criminals away from the ever more overcrowded prison estate. Five years ago, the then Home Secretary, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1810" name="David Blunkett">the right hon. Member for Sheffield, Brightside (Mr. Blunkett)</phrase>, talked about tough community sentences to</p>
	<p pid="b.38.0/23" class="indent">&quot;reduce the prison population at the lower end&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.38.0/24">Disturbingly, community sentences are now given to more than 40 per cent. of violent offenders, and in the past three years nearly 90 rapists have received community sentences. In addition, a fair few of the 12,000 or 13,000 people who have been released early from custody on licence&mdash;I am referring to the end of custody licence scheme&mdash;since <phrase class="date" code="2007-06-29">29 June 2007</phrase> have been violent offenders, despite the fact that the Government's rules for the release of people on ECL are supposed to keep violent offenders off ECL. The Secretary of State says, &quot;Oh, don't worry about the 18 days,&quot; but it is in the last 18 days that short-sentence prisoners receive the necessary contacts with the health service, jobs and so on&mdash;</p>

	<p pid="b.41.1/1">Thank you, Mr. Taylor. No doubt <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1615" name="Edward Garnier">the hon. and learned Member for Harborough (Mr. Garnier)</phrase> now regrets suggesting that he be stopped, because he was stopped in full flow, but I am sure that he will have a chance to finish his sentence on another occasion.</p>
	<p pid="b.41.1/2">I begin, as all hon. Members have done, by congratulating my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1833" name="David Kidney">the Member for Stafford (Mr. Kidney)</phrase> on both securing this debate on an important topic, which has provoked a great deal of interest among Front Benchers, and the way in which he has advanced his theses and made his remarks. His speech was excellent and well worth listening to, and I know that it was appreciated on both sides of the Chamber. Some of us perhaps come at the issue from a slightly different perspective, but there is a lot of common ground across the Chamber in respect of much of what he has said.</p>
	<p pid="b.41.1/3">I echo what my hon. Friend has said about the people who work throughout the criminal justice system, who are not thanked as often as they ought to be by society&mdash;I always do my best to thank them personally&mdash;for their work in tackling tough problems and issues and dealing with people with many difficulties and problems who are not the most sympathetic members of our society. They all do an excellent job. My hon. Friend has mentioned most of them, but, like him, I am happy to thank everybody involved, even though they may not have been mentioned by either him or me. Clearly, what they do is sometimes a thankless task, but it is vital in our society, and we all appreciate it. I want to make that absolutely clear.</p>
	<p pid="b.41.1/4">As my hon. Friend has also said&mdash;other hon. Members have echoed this&mdash;custody will always have to be available for serious and dangerous offenders, but a key part of the reform of sentencing policy over the past few years has been to try to limit the use of short custodial sentences for less serious offenders by unlocking the potential of the community order and increasing its flexibility, making it more possible for sentencers, be they magistrates or judges, to deal appropriately with individual cases, as has been emphasised. It is entirely appropriate that they take the decisions in individual cases; it is not for Parliament or Ministers to impose solutions to individual cases in our courts system.</p>
	<p pid="b.41.1/5">Within a framework of reserving prison for serious and violent offenders, we are doing our utmost to enable the system to reduce reoffending, to protect the public and to give those who have offended a chance to tackle the problems that have perhaps led to their offending behaviour and ensure that they come out as more useful members of society than they were when they entered the criminal justice system. That balance is correct, and I have not heard any hon. Member in this debate or in other debates on the subject suggest that it is wrong. Prison should be used for serious and dangerous offenders in order to protect the public, and we should use other approaches to deal with those who would not benefit from custody or who do not have to be in custody for the public to be protected.</p>
	<p pid="b.41.1/6">The Criminal Justice Act 2003 provided an adult sentencing framework that was clearer and more flexible than that which previously pertained. The legislation set out for the first time in statute the purposes of sentencing for adults, which all hon. Members have referred to, namely, punishment, crime reduction, reform and rehabilitation, public protection and reparation. Sentences were reformed in that legislation, but perhaps most significantly the various types of community order for adults were replaced with a single community order with a range of possible requirements, and new sentences for serious and violent offenders were introduced to ensure that they are kept in prison or under supervision for longer than previously to try to manage the risks that they present. The intention is for the court to provide each offender with a sentence that best meets the needs of the case, at any level of seriousness, for sentences to be more effectively managed by the correctional services and for correctional services and the courts to work closely together on delivering the new sentences.</p>
	<p pid="b.41.1/7">Tough community sentences include a wide range of requirements, as they should, including unpaid work, drug treatment and curfews&mdash;some of those things were mentioned in the debate. They allow offenders to maintain employment, education and family links and ensure that offenders do not get sucked into a cycle of repeat offending that they are less likely to get out of as time goes on. Instead, the sentences deliver interventions to address offending behaviour.</p>
	<p pid="b.41.1/8">The Government are convinced that a well planned and properly supervised community sentence can be tough on the offender and far more valuable than prison in offering the individual opportunities to change their behaviour and constructive possibilities for the future. The overall reoffending rate for community sentences, 51 per cent., is lower than that for short prison sentences&mdash;the overall reoffending rate after a short custodial sentence is more than 70 per cent. Even on the basis of those bare figures, such approaches are more effective.</p>
	<p pid="b.41.1/9">We have made substantial progress on both the enforcement and quality of community sentences&mdash;my hon. Friend has referred to that&mdash;and 90 per cent. of breaches are now dealt with. There is no reason why the public and sentencers cannot have confidence that community sentences are tough alternatives to short custodial sentences. Increasing community confidence in the effectiveness of such arrangements is the aim of ensuring rigorous enforcement.</p>
	<p pid="b.41.1/10">I agreed with my hon. Friend when he talked about ensuring that the general public understands how tough community sentences can be and how useful they are. There is a general perception or feeling at the moment, as any Member of Parliament will know, that people who receive community sentences have had some kind of let-off. Of course, they have not&mdash;community sentences can be much tougher than short custodial sentences, and they can make an offender face up to the problems that they have caused and deal with the issues that led them into offending more intensively than if they simply went into custody. As my hon. Friend has said, restorative justice is now embedded in the youth justice system, which is perhaps not that well known among the general public. Victim contact or reparation can be a part of youth disposals.</p>
	<p pid="b.41.1/11">My hon. Friend has raised the issue of conditional cautions and made a point about a written answer. The answer should have stated that the non-compliance rate, rather than the compliance rate, was 6 per cent. There was a misspelling in the answer, but we were attempting to make the point that conditional cautions are almost always complied with. They are successful, and the conditions can have an impact. Often, they make a real difference to whether an individual becomes involved in offending behaviour again. Obviously, the Criminal Justice and Immigration Bill, which the House of Lords is debating, extends the capacity to use conditional cautions on 16 and 17-year-olds.</p>
	<p pid="b.41.1/12">I agree with everyone who contributed to the debate, including the hon. and learned Member for Harborough, that diverting young people away from the criminal justice system in the first place is the way to control the increase in the prison population in the medium and longer term. Diverting people away from the criminal justice system must be the best thing for society, and conditional cautions appear to have the potential to do so. They have restorative and reparative features, and they can involve victims. Offenders might be required to write letters of apology to victims, or to deal with or put right the damage done by their graffiti or criminal damage, for example.</p>
	<p pid="b.41.1/13">Those are visible ways in which to say to a community that the person who committed such offences has been caught, that they are putting things right, that they have had to apologise, and that they have agreed to those things. Quite often, such people are required to pay compensation. That is an effective way in which to deal with the kind of low-level antisocial behaviour that is so corrosive in our communities, as many MPs know. Calling such things &quot;antisocial behaviour&quot; may make them seem minor, and the offences might be at the petty end of the scale, but they can be a real problem in vulnerable communities, and they need to be rigorously tackled. That is why there is a sense in many of our communities that custody is the right answer&mdash;people want such behaviour to stop. Conditional cautioning provides an alternative way to make that point clearly in our communities.</p>
	<p pid="b.41.1/14">My hon. Friend has referred to problem-solving courts, which have the potential to deal with those issues positively. People involved in the community court pilot in north Liverpool, which I know particularly well, make a great effort and provide great quality work. The district judge in the court, David Fletcher, does a superb job with the people who come before him every two weeks, if they have not met the conditions by going through drug rehabilitation or looking for a job. He knows that if those people have not done what he asks them to do, they cannot hide behind the fact that they will next appear before a different judge.</p>

	<p pid="b.43.0/1">It is obvious that the drugs court in Liverpool is a success, as is its equivalent in west London, but why are there only two? Surely there ought to be more.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-02-19b.44.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1687" speakername="Maria Eagle" colnum="44"  time="012:15:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080219/halltext/80219h0008.htm#08021973000495">
	<p pid="b.44.0/1">There are two drugs courts pilots at present. The Government like evidence-based policy making, so we should ensure that the pilots work and that they make a difference. The court in north Liverpool is a community court&mdash;it does not deal only with drug-related matters, although drug rehabilitation is often part of what the district judge orders for persistent offenders who appear before him repeatedly. He seeks to supervise such people in the community and to avoid sending them into custody, if he can.</p>
	<p pid="b.44.0/2">There are 13 community court pilots. Early evaluations show that they have the potential to reduce reoffending over time. It is too soon for us to be clear on that, because the pilots have not been going long enough for us to be sure of the long-term impact on reoffending behaviour among persistent offenders. However, we are extending the approach&mdash;there are now 13 community courts&mdash;and we intend to ensure that magistrates courts in other areas adopt some of the lessons, so that we can show in due course that they have a persistent impact on the types of offence that I have mentioned.</p>
	<p pid="b.44.0/3">We intend to ensure that we have the money to extend the process to other courts areas, but before we become too enthusiastic and roll the pilots out further, we must be clear that the pilots work properly and that, when we evaluate the evidence, we see that they work. We need to be able to show that the problem-solving approach works, whether in community, domestic violence or drug courts.</p>
	<p pid="b.44.0/4">My hon. Friend has referred to the problem-solving approach. We may argue how well offender management works, whether it is well resourced and what the problems are, but the idea behind it is to wrap interventions around the needs of the individual, particularly persistent and young offenders, to solve their problems so that they do not commit further crime. I believe that that is the way forward.</p>
	<p pid="b.44.0/5">My hon. Friend has referred to interventions below court level and to intensive supervision. I agreed with what he said about the importance of the first three years after birth and parenting. The Government, with the Youth Justice Board, are developing some intensive supervision and surveillance programmes to deal with those who fall into bad behaviour partly because of their upbringing and bad experiences as young people. That approach involves family and parenting support over a six-month period, with the intention of ensuring that, at the end of the period, young people can go back to their families secure in the knowledge that their families are more able to cope with them, and that the young people concerned have changed their behaviour. That has a great deal of potential.</p>
	<p pid="b.44.0/6">My hon. Friend may know that we are piloting intensive fostering in his area, which is another way in which to take hold of people who have gone wrong, perhaps because of poor experiences and parenting in their early years, and to ensure that they can be returned to society when they are less likely to offend in future.</p>
	<p pid="b.44.0/7">A lot of work is being done in our criminal justice system to tackle the issues raised by my hon. Friend and others who spoke in the debate. We need to continue to put effort, money and time into the approaches that I have discussed. I congratulate my hon. Friend on the way in which he put his ideas forward, and he raised one or two issues that I shall have to go away and think about.</p>

	<p pid="b.45.1/1">It is a pleasure, Mr. Taylor, to be under your chairmanship, and to debate this subject with the Minister.</p>
	<p pid="b.45.1/2">It is hard to imagine a greater privilege than being on Salisbury cathedral's spire with a stonemason, 300 ft above ground, considering how best to conserve an individual stone in that enormous edifice. That was where my passion for stone conservation started some 20 years ago. Since then, we have seen the progress of an astonishing number of cathedral and parish church projects throughout the country. Much of the credit for that must go to English Heritage, but even more must go to the skill of the stonemasons and conservators. They are responsible for ensuring that our generation passes to future generations the inheritance of those wonderful mediaeval buildings that are such an important part of the life of our country.</p>
	<p pid="b.45.1/3">This is a huge subject, and I cannot begin to do more than scratch the surface. For those who are particularly interested, I commend the winner of the 2007 Royal Institute of British Architects book award for construction&mdash;&quot;Stone Conservation: Principles and Practice&quot;. The book was edited by Alison Henry, a distinguished conservator. In it, she said:</p>
	<p pid="b.45.1/4" class="indent">&quot;How often, for example, do we hear someone talk of restoration when what they really mean ...is in fact conservation?...at what point does restoration or preservation (of individual stones) stop and conservation (of the building) begin?&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.45.1/5">She continued:</p>
	<p pid="b.45.1/6" class="indent">&quot;The concept of conservation as a proactive means of managing the inevitable change in the historic environment is something that escapes the majority of people.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.45.1/7">How right she is.</p>
	<p pid="b.45.1/8">Of course, I do not want to speak only about Salisbury, although we are blessed not least because we have the benefit of the original stone quarries at Chilmark and Purbeck from which the cathedral was built. Indeed, this year, we celebrate the 750th anniversary of the laying of the cathedral's foundation stone. However, Canterbury has had a more difficult story.</p>
	<p pid="b.45.1/9">The distinguished archaeologist Tim Tatton-Brown, writing in the Ecclesiastical Architect and Surveyors journal of spring 2007, said of Canterbury:</p>
	<p pid="b.45.1/10" class="indent">&quot;Alien stones have been brought in, which have not matched the original masonry, and this new stone has changed every few decades in the 20th century, following 'fashions' determined by their Surveyors to the Fabric (architects). So, for example, between about 1908 and 1920 Doulting stone from the Mendips was used, followed by Clipsham stone in the 1930s. After the last War, it was Bath (Box Ground) stone that was in fashion. Then from the 1960s it was decided to use Lepine stone, a totally different stone, which was being imported from France by lorry for Chichester Cathedral. Unfortunately none of these stones are in any way a match for the original medieval masonry. At Canterbury the principal stone used between the late 11th and late 15th centuries was high quality Caen stone, but this has been used alongside other English stones like Reigate stone and Kentish Ragstone.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.45.1/11">It is a huge problem that affects every parish church with a few bits of stone that need attention.</p>
	<p pid="b.45.1/12">How do the conservators approach such a problem? Their first duty is to preserve as much of the historic fabric as possible, and to record fully the archaeological and historical information of each area treated. They seek to maintain the fabric in a sound condition through cleaning&mdash;removing damaging or potentially damaging material&mdash;by repairing smaller areas of decayed or damaged stone with lime mortar repairs, or by replacing or piecing-in larger areas of decayed or damaged stone with new stone.</p>
	<p pid="b.45.1/13">Conservators, architects and stonemasons are always reluctant to replace historic stonework; they do so only after careful inspection and consideration of the degree of decay&mdash;in size, form and depth&mdash;from location to location. The decision to replace is taken only after the implications of intervention have been discussed jointly by the cathedral architect and the consultant conservator while on the scaffolding. Since 1994, such decisions at Salisbury have been fully discussed with English Heritage. Its inspecting architect has visited the cathedral regularly, and has developed a good relationship&mdash;until recently.</p>
	<p pid="b.45.1/14">There has been a change of policy at English Heritage. The cathedral has had to face up to a significant change to work that is being carried out, but to do so it would need the approval of the cathedral fabric advisory committee and the Cathedral Fabric Commission for England. The problem arose this year. It might seem curmudgeonly to say it, but the press release in which English Heritage announced the award of &pound;2.1 million to 28 cathedrals only a couple of weeks ago was not greeted with universal enthusiasm by cathedral deans throughout the country, and not only in Salisbury. Why?</p>
	<p pid="b.45.1/15">The real problem is that the lack of money has led to a change of policy. It is not about sour grapes for Salisbury. English Heritage has been very generous to Salisbury cathedral&mdash;more generous to Salisbury and Lincoln than to any other cathedral. However, English Heritage provides a minority of the funding. We have been fundraising in Salisbury since 1986, when we launched our spire appeal. That raised &pound;8 million for the spire, the tower and the west front. However, total expenditure since 1986 to the end of this financial year is more than &pound;18 million, of which English Heritage has generously provided &pound;6.25 million.</p>

	<p pid="b.46.0/1">I declare an interest as chairman of the Cathedral Fabric Commission for England. I am pleased about the way in which the theme is being developed. We all accept that English Heritage does not have enough money to carry out its functions properly. When comparing the budget being voted on later today for Northern Rock with the good done by the English cathedrals, there seems to be a mismatch. Although we accept that English Heritage funds will always be inadequate, is not the main point that it should give funds in such a way that it does not make it more difficult for those cathedrals that are unsuccessful or that do not have their grants renewed to continue to raise funds? The commission is certainly concerned about that issue.</p>

	<p pid="b.46.1/1">Of course, the right hon. Gentleman is entirely right. He points out the very small amount of money that English Heritage has to distribute. That, of course, can be blamed only on the Treasury. However, the Treasury has its priorities; and Northern Rock is apparently a much greater priority than the southern rock of Salisbury cathedral. The right hon. Gentleman is right. We have a strange sense of what it is right to subsidise. For example, Salisbury's excellent theatre will receive not far short of &pound;1 million in annual subsidy, but the cathedral will not.</p>
	<p pid="b.46.1/2">As the cathedral will not now be receiving the money that it had hoped for from the excellent Wolfson Foundation&mdash;it provides the money for cathedrals, which is administered by English Heritage; it previously came from the Treasury&mdash;the problem is starker. It makes things much more difficult. As the right hon. Gentleman said, we do not want to make fund-raising more difficult for those churches.</p>
	<p pid="b.46.1/3">It is also terribly important to remember that 25 per cent. of all listed buildings in the country are funded by the Church of England, as are 40 per cent. of all grade 1 listed buildings. It is a pretty stark challenge for the Christian community to have to pay for the iconic buildings of our country. We are very grateful to the Wolfson Foundation for providing &pound;1 million a year for three years for our cathedrals.</p>
	<p pid="b.46.1/4">The problem that we faced with the decision of English Heritage was not that it did not have enough money and had to spread it more thinly but that it changed the criteria. There is no doubt about that; the chief executive told me himself that English Heritage had changed the criteria in order better to distribute its finances. However, the way that English Heritage changed the criteria caused considerable upset. That was surprising in some ways. Sir Hayden Phillips, who is the chairman of the Salisbury cathedral fabric advisory committee and a former distinguished permanent secretary of the Department for Culture, Media and Sport and then the Lord Chancellor's Department, said:</p>
	<p pid="b.46.1/5" class="indent">&quot;English Heritage failed properly to pursue a consultation process to which the cathedral was committed, and which involved the Cathedrals Fabric Commission for England (CFCE), to resolve differences of opinion on stone conservation policy. They should have done so before making this the reason for denying continued support. We hope English Heritage will accept that their decision-making process fell short of the best standards of public administration and will engage with us, and the CFCE in dealing with the specific issue of stone conservation and our general concern about the way their decisions appear to be made.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.46.1/6">We are therefore faced with a challenge for the future. We have had a change of policy. I suspect that the problem stems from the changes at English Heritage themselves and I hope very much that the excellent commissioners for English Heritage will take note of that. We used to have an excellent cathedral team in the headquarters of English Heritage, led by Richard Halsey who then retired. Since his retirement, there has been regional devolution and it seems that there has been no overall control of cathedral policy. English Heritage no longer has a chief architect, which is also a pity.</p>
	<p pid="b.46.1/7">We really must have consistency in policy by English Heritage, which is meant to be the guardian of this type of conservation of our great buildings. Regionalisation by English Heritage has led to a lack of national consistency. So, my first request of the Minister is that she should facilitate for English Heritage a serious national conference to decide the best approach for conserving stonework, not just in cathedrals and parish churches but in any of our great stone buildings.</p>

	<p pid="b.47.0/1">English Heritage and the CFCE are going to stage such a conference. However, is the hon. Gentleman not making the point&mdash;I just wish to underline it&mdash;that the cathedrals themselves now have groups of experts and the commission itself has groups of experts, which are now probably greater in number than those that English Heritage has? Our expertise is being pitted against English Heritage and English Heritage then makes public statements about the worth of the decisions made by individual cathedrals and by the commission.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-02-19b.48.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1803" speakername="Robert Key" colnum="48"  time="012:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080219/halltext/80219h0008.htm#08021973000500">
	<p pid="b.48.0/1">I am sure that that is absolutely right. Certainly, Michael Drury, the cathedral architect at Salisbury, is a well-known and greatly respected expert on stone conservation, as is Nicholas Durnan, who is the consultant conservator to Salisbury cathedral; he is not only a distinguished sculptor but has worked on many English cathedrals over the years. The accumulated wisdom of experts in cathedrals up and down the country is indeed very great.</p>
	<p pid="b.48.0/2">The conference that the right hon. Gentleman mentioned will take place in London from 11 to <phrase class="date" code="2008-03-13">13 March</phrase>, with the sponsorship of RIBA, English Heritage, <i>The Architects' Journal</i>, the Stone Federation and others. The Natural Stone Show 2008 is unmissable for the Minister and for anyone else who has a bent in that direction.</p>
	<p pid="b.48.0/3">I have asked that the Minister facilitate a serious conference, which the cathedrals had asked for and hoped for, but the consultation processes had not been completed by English Heritage on the grant allocations, which is the burden of the complaint by Sir Hayden Phillips. I also ask the Minister, for the sake of future generations, to look at the problem that arises from having a lot of courses for stone masons in the UK while stone conservation training is very limited indeed. Most conservation training is now done on the job. There is a lack of recognised qualifications in stone conservation. The accreditation scheme for conservation in the UK, promoted by the Institute of Conservation, is a step in the right direction. Also, the institute's stone and wall paintings group is doing very great work. Nevertheless, there is a lot more to be done in this very important area.</p>
	<p pid="b.48.0/4">I end where I started by saying that anyone who just looks at a great building, whether it is the Palace of Westminster, Westminster abbey, Salisbury cathedral, or the cathedrals of Durham, Canterbury, Lichfield or wherever, should understand that it is more than just a whole image; in the case of Salisbury cathedral, it is about 750 years of continuity. Minimum replacement of stone is always the objective. However, if we do not have a consistent policy in this area and if we insist on replacing only the most damaged stonework without consideration of that stone that is going to need replacing in the next 10 or 20 years, we will see our buildings deteriorating and remaining covered in scaffolding for generation after generation.</p>
	<p pid="b.48.0/5">In Salisbury, we very much hope that by 2015&mdash;an important date in our history because 1215 is the date of the signing of Magna Carta of which Salisbury cathedral has the best surviving copy&mdash;the scaffolding that has been there since the late 1980s, being continually moved around the cathedral, will have been removed. For goodness' sake, today we have heard that after hundreds of years the Forth bridge will no longer be painted, but the scaffolding will not be taken down from English cathedrals and churches for many years to come if we do not have a sensible, consistent and agreed policy on stone conservation in this country.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-02-19b.49.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1383" speakername="Margaret Hodge" speakeroffice="The Minister of State, Department for Culture, Media and Sport"  colnum="49"  time="012:46:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080219/halltext/80219h0008.htm#08021973000501">
	<p pid="b.49.0/1">First, I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1803" name="Robert Key">the hon. Member for Salisbury (Robert Key)</phrase> on securing this debate. I should also like to express a little envy that he has Salisbury cathedral within his constituency. I was privileged enough to visit the cathedral when I visited Stonehenge last summer and it is indeed one of the most magnificent buildings that we have in our cultural and heritage infrastructure, which is much valued and enjoyed by all who go there.</p>
	<p pid="b.49.0/2">I should just like to say a little about churches and cathedrals in general, because they have a hugely important role to play in their communities, not only because they fulfil their primary purpose as places of worship but because they are storehouses for historic treasures. As the hon. Gentleman said, Salisbury cathedral is 750 years old this year. Many of our cathedrals also commission new works of art. Cathedrals host a range of cultural events, including exhibitions and concerts. They uphold all our fine choral traditions and they also help many vulnerable people in our communities. So cathedrals and churches contribute in a huge range of ways to the life of our nation, and they provide space for many community and cultural activities.</p>
	<p pid="b.49.0/3">We should always bear in mind that cathedrals and churches are very important in terms of our children's education. They are often the scene of educational visits; many of them employ educational officers, and every year thousands of schoolchildren explore the wonders of art history, architecture and religion within the confines of these buildings. Finally, as the hon. Gentleman will know, we have plans to offer children more cultural opportunities, and I hope that the cathedrals and churches will play their part in that scheme.</p>
	<p pid="b.49.0/4">I also recognise, particularly in Salisbury but also in many of our other cathedrals, how important cathedrals and churches are in benefiting local economies and local businesses, in the way that they attract visitors and tourists. We calculate that about &pound;91 million a year of local expenditure is associated with visits to cathedrals.</p>
	<p pid="b.49.0/5">Most importantly, of course, cathedrals cater for the spiritual needs of many people, whether it is in a formal service&mdash;I understand that the congregations for those services are increasing&mdash;or just by being places for people to sit quietly and contemplate.</p>
	<p pid="b.49.0/6">I would like to say just a little about Government support generally for cathedrals and churches, because the hon. Gentleman was right to draw our attention to the fact that so many of our cathedrals are listed under grade I or grade II status. If one looks at the totality of the Government funding that is provided, either through the Government directly, through our non-departmental public bodies or through lottery programmes, it is more than &pound;50 million a year, which goes to helping us to conserve and preserve these places of worship.</p>
	<p pid="b.49.0/7">The current spending review settlement was very tight, as the hon. Gentleman will know, and I am pleased that we have managed to increase the grant to the Churches Conservation Trust. Even English Heritage, which has had a flat-rate settlement for many years, will also see an increase in its settlement from the Department over the period of the current spending review.</p>
	<p pid="b.49.0/8">The Churches Conservation Trust, which, as I said, got more money, cares for the most significant redundant Church of England buildings. Some of that money will be used to help vulnerable congregations to fight off the possibility of buildings becoming redundant, which is hugely important, and to help redundant buildings to find new uses.</p>
	<p pid="b.49.0/9">English Heritage is also looking at what more it can do to help congregations to prioritise their repairs, because money will always be tight. It will also help them to identify potential further uses of underused buildings and to seek new sources of support. All that is in line with the Inspire campaign, with which I am sure that the hon. Gentleman is familiar.</p>
	<p pid="b.49.0/10">On the grants that we give out, both our listed places of worship grant scheme and the joint English Heritage and lottery fund church repair scheme have awarded many millions of pounds and helped many thousands of buildings. We will have an announcement soon on the latest round of grants offered under the joint scheme.</p>
	<p pid="b.49.0/11">As the hon. Gentleman said, English Heritage made an announcement only two weeks ago about the latest awards that it will make under its grants for cathedrals scheme. Some 28 cathedrals have been offered a share of more than &pound;2 million, and once the current round of grants has been taken up, the scheme will have given out nearly &pound;50 million since 1991. We are of course grateful for the match funding from the Wolfson Foundation, to which the hon. Gentleman referred. That generous contribution is allowing the scheme to go much further.</p>
	<p pid="b.49.0/12">The Heritage Lottery Fund also makes many millions of pounds available to cathedrals and churches. York minster received &pound;10 million towards the huge project of restoring the great east window, and the church of St. Martin-in-the-Fields in London has received more than &pound;40 million towards its ongoing work, as the hon. Gentleman will have seen.</p>
	<p pid="b.49.0/13">As the hon. Gentleman said, Salisbury is one of the finest, if not the finest, of all our cathedrals. That is why it has received more English Heritage grant funding that any other cathedral and more from that body than almost any other building in the country. As he said, it has received well over &pound;6 million since the start of the current cathedral grant programme; indeed, it has received &pound;1 for every &pound;8 given out by the scheme, under which there are 40 eligible buildings. Salisbury is also making use of the VAT relief grant scheme and has received &pound;130,000 from it in the past few months.</p>

	<p pid="b.50.0/1">That is absolutely true, but it is important to point out that that happened with the agreement of the Association of English Cathedrals, which agreed, as a body, that Lincoln and Salisbury were in the greatest need. It is not fair to say that Salisbury is being greedy, because it is not&mdash;it just has the biggest problems.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-02-19b.50.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1383" speakername="Margaret Hodge" colnum="50"  time="012:46:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080219/halltext/80219h0009.htm#08021973000503">
	<p pid="b.50.1/1">I take the hon. Gentleman's point, but I hope that he will acknowledge that an appropriate response has been made to that need through the grants that have been awarded.</p>
	<p pid="b.50.1/2">The hon. Gentleman raised several issues. First, he suggested that there had been a change in English Heritage's policy on stone repair, but my understanding is that there has been no such change. English Heritage had its established policy, and the confines of that policy meant that it could not support the specific works proposed in the latest application.</p>
	<p pid="b.50.1/3">The hon. Gentleman suggested that the criteria of the grant scheme had changed. I must tell him, however, that the criteria attached to the grant scheme have been in place since 2003 and were reconfirmed to all cathedrals in summer 2007.</p>
	<p pid="b.50.1/4">The hon. Gentleman alleged that there was a lack of national consistency, but there is no evidence of that. Guidelines and criteria are applied nationally, but each cathedral is different. Salisbury has been dealt with by English Heritage's south-west regional office for several years.</p>
	<p pid="b.50.1/5">My right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1410" name="Frank Field">the Member for Birkenhead (Mr. Field)</phrase>, who has left the Chamber, raised the point that the failure of funding to come from one organisation might impact on funding from the another organisation. In this case, however, the Wolfson Foundation simply agreed with English Heritage's assessment of the works that were required. This is an issue of the judgment about an individual application, rather than a lack of funding from one organisation leading to a lack of funding from another.</p>
	<p pid="b.50.1/6">I do not know whether the hon. Gentleman has met locally with English Heritage and the Church authorities. I see from my notes that there was a meeting between English Heritage and all the bodies concerned in the middle of last year, although I have not seen the minutes of that meeting. I do not know whether the hon. Gentleman has convened such a meeting to bring everyone together, but there is clearly an issue of judgment over the best way to deal with the damage to Salisbury cathedral's stonework, and judgments appear to differ.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-02-19b.51.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1803" speakername="Robert Key" colnum="51"  time="012:46:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080219/halltext/80219h0009.htm#08021973000504">
	<p pid="b.51.0/1">To answer the Minister's question, I was not present at that meeting, although I would be delighted to convene such a meeting. The real problem, however, is the lack of a national agreed policy, and that is what we are asking for. There should be a meeting with all the English cathedrals and others concerned so that we can have a consistent policy.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-02-19b.51.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1383" speakername="Margaret Hodge" colnum="51"  time="012:46:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080219/halltext/80219h0009.htm#08021973000505">
	<p pid="b.51.1/1">Indeed. We have also been informed of the meeting that is taking place in March to thrash out whether we can achieve a nationally agreed policy. I am not sure whether the hon. Gentleman or I could act as experts or judges in this instance, but my understanding, having discussed the matter in preparing for this debate, is that English Heritage does take expert advice. Common sense tells me that one would always go for conservation rather than the replacement of stone, and I am sure that the hon. Gentleman would endorse that attitude. However, a judgment must be made about what life the stone will have and whether conservation is a cost-effective way forward.</p>
	<p pid="b.51.1/2">The hon. Gentleman asked two specific questions. First, he asked whether we would consider convening a conference. The sensible thing is probably to wait and see whether some agreement comes out of the conference that will be convened by all the interested bodies in March. If there still appears to be huge disagreement, however, it would be appropriate for the Government to see whether we could bring the parties together at that point.</p>
	<p pid="b.51.1/3">The hon. Gentleman also asked whether I could look at the training of stone masons to see whether there were appropriate facilities. It struck me that we could look at our apprenticeship scheme, which we are trying to expand, to see whether we could provide more opportunities through apprenticeships for individuals. I do not know whether there are opportunities there, but I will take the issue away, look at it and write to the hon. Gentleman in due course.</p>
	<p pid="b.51.1/4">English Heritage has explained its position in dialogue with the cathedral over many months, and what happened with the grant application this year was no surprise to anybody. Strenuous efforts have been made on both sides to reach agreement on the way forward, but not enough progress has been made to allow grant to be awarded in the current year. However, English Heritage is continuing to work with the cathedral to agree a new stone conservation policy.</p>
	<p pid="b.51.1/5">Clearly, a compromise needs to be found to allow the work at Salisbury cathedral to continue, and I think that that is what we all want. Salisbury should apply again for a grant next year, and although English Heritage makes no guarantees, it will continue to work with the cathedral to give its application the best chance of succeeding. English Heritage will work with the cathedral, the Cathedral Fabric Commission and other groups to see whether they can share best practice, share views and come to a common understanding.</p>
	<p pid="b.51.1/6">Again, I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for raising this issue. I hope that the debate has moved us a little way forward and that we can work together to ensure that all the major works at Salisbury can progress.</p>

	Housing (Calderdale)
</minor-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-02-19b.53.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1471" speakername="Chris McCafferty" colnum="53"  time="013:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080219/halltext/80219h0009.htm#08021973000506">
	<p pid="b.53.1/1">With your permission, Mr. Taylor, I should like my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1607" name="Linda Riordan">the Member for Halifax (Mrs. Riordan)</phrase>, whose constituency neighbours mine, to speak in the debate.</p>
	<p pid="b.53.1/2">Calderdale is one of the five boroughs in West Yorkshire. The local authority is the sixth largest of the 36 metropolitan areas in terms of land area. It has a population of about 192,000 people, comprising 81,000 households. Calderdale itself is made up of many distinct and diverse communities. It is a multicultural area: people of Asian, Irish, Italian and eastern European origin have formed part of the community for many years, the largest group being the Pakistani community, which has a very young age profile.</p>
	<p pid="b.53.1/3">Most social and economic indicators show Calderdale to be close to the national average for prosperity, but that can mask wide variations within the borough. Deprivation figures for 2007 published by the Department for Communities and Local Government showed that four wards contained areas ranked within the 10 most deprived in the country, and that poor quality of housing is a significant factor in those and several other wards of the district. Conversely, there are some very prosperous areas in the borough. Calderdale is equidistant from the regional centres of Manchester and Leeds, and good rail and road links have drawn commuters who wish to live in the area.</p>
	<p pid="b.53.1/4">In recent years there has been an enormous spate of development of executive apartments, many of which are located in former mill buildings. Calderdale is therefore an area of great contrasts, with high house prices in areas that also accommodate deprived communities living in poor quality older properties. Although its mix is in many respects healthy, it has the effect of masking underlying problems. As a result, Calderdale has not always attracted significant public expenditure from national and European institutions and regeneration programmes of the kind enjoyed by its surrounding neighbours.</p>
	<p pid="b.53.1/5">Calderdale's traditional economic base was founded on textiles and engineering, and those sectors still account for a quarter of local employment. In recent years, employment in the service industry has grown, particularly in the financial sector, HBOS being the largest single private sector employer. With local schools consistently performing well, and blue chip employers established in the borough, Calderdale has the potential significantly to contribute to strategies for the economic development of the region. However, if that potential is to be realised, it is vital not to neglect basic agendas that will attract and retain a skilled work force in the borough. In that respect, housing agendas are neglected at our peril.</p>
	<p pid="b.53.1/6">In that context, I want to set out some of the challenges that are currently being faced in Calderdale as it attempts to implement a five-year housing strategy entitled &quot;Decent and Affordable Homes in Safe and Sustainable Neighbourhoods&quot;. The council recently undertook a comprehensive survey of its private sector stock, which rightly drew attention to its condition. The key findings were that half the private sector stock was built before 1919. More than 8 per cent. of the stock was statutorily unfit for human habitation, which is 2 per cent. above the national average. The rate at which dwellings are becoming unfit is greater than the rate at which unfit dwellings are being improved. Almost one fifth of all private sector homes were classified as being in serious disrepair. There was a high level of damp, and private tenants are more than twice as likely to live in unfit properties as owner-occupiers.</p>
	<p pid="b.53.1/7">The highest concentration of unfit housing and homes that are difficult to heat is among pre-1919 stock. Three quarters of the privately rented property in Calderdale was built before 1919. More than half of the unfit houses have an energy efficiency rating substantially below the level required to achieve affordable warmth among low-income groups. The study concluded that more than &pound;300 million was required to remedy that level of unfitness and to bring the private sector stock up to an acceptable standard of general repair. It seems extraordinary that after decades of housing policy and investment, we can still paint such a picture.</p>
	<p pid="b.53.1/8">I want to use the Harley Bank area of Todmorden as an example. The streets are stone-built terraces of a dozen or so properties. The stone building lends a certain charm, but it can mask poor conditions. Homes in Harley Bank, as indeed in most of Calderdale, are genuinely back-to-back properties. They literally back on to another property, and are bounded on either side by others in the same terrace. A typical arrangement would be a one-up, one-down house, perhaps with an attic room. Roofs are generally in poor condition and doors and windows usually need renewing. The properties are usually of a single leaf stone construction, with no cavity, so energy efficiency improvement is, to say the least, challenging. Kitchen areas are likely to be modest in scale, and there is often one precipitous winding staircase to the first floor. Despite those limitations, such properties can be, and are, made into attractive homes for single people and smaller families. They can be cheap and economical to run, but they need investment, if they are to be a useful part of our housing stock in the future.</p>
	<p pid="b.53.1/9">The agenda that I am discussing concerns our commitment to the most vulnerable people, who are most likely to live in such homes, and to their most basic need, which is a warm, secure home in decent order. The Minister shares that commitment, and I am sure that she wants to honour it. Other agendas are germane not only to Calderdale but to West Yorkshire in general and places further afield. I know that it is believed in some quarters that the north of England is not affected by the problems of affordability and high house prices that are found elsewhere, but that is not true. House prices have perhaps not reached the dizzy heights in the south of the country, but the increase in house prices in recent years has been dramatic and has had a substantial impact on communities where wages are historically very low. In Calderdale, house prices have risen 24 per cent. since 2004. The highest average rise in the whole country between 2001 and 2004 took place in one town in my constituency, Brighouse.</p>
	<p pid="b.53.1/10">In that context, I welcome the Government's commitment to a larger programme of investment in affordable homes. I am pleased that the social housing grant deployment in West Yorkshire is likely to rise by 32 per cent. in 2010-11, compared with the current financial year. The matter of most concern is the degree to which it may prove possible to deploy that resource usefully. I say that because I am concerned about the combined effect of well meant Government targets on housing density, high land prices and Housing Corporation policy on unit costs. All too often, we seem to emphasise the number of houses being built&mdash;the quantity of building&mdash;rather than housing need and building quality.</p>
	<p pid="b.53.1/11">That echoes the market trend of developing apartments rather than family houses, which we now desperately need in Calderdale. I ask the Minister to consider the degree to which local authorities are being empowered and enabled to reject inappropriate applications for high density flat development, and instead, perhaps, enabled to insist on higher proportions of family houses, built to good space standards and at a reasonable density. I find it a cause for concern that in this day and age we still have no minimum space standards for dwellings. We seem to have gone backwards since the Parker Morris standards of the 1950s.</p>
	<p pid="b.53.1/12">A knock-on effect of the points that I have raised is the growing number of empty homes, which is a curious and perplexing phenomenon at a time when we know that there is very high housing need in Calderdale. There are also problems of affordability given the natural desire for home ownership. In Calderdale, we now have nearly 4,000 empty homes, some 2,500 of which have been empty for more than six months. Some of those are older, poorer properties in need of just the sort of investment that I mentioned earlier, but others are small apartments, which are usually situated in older, converted mill premises although some of them are new builds. All are driven by high land prices, high density requirements in national planning guidance and a short-sighted housing market that seems to see housing as an alternative investment chip at a time when returns on investments elsewhere are perhaps low.</p>
	<p pid="b.53.1/13">We are now seeing the results of that policy in Calderdale, where we are building too much of the wrong sort of housing, when we really need medium-density family homes. I call upon the Minister, therefore, to introduce legislation, guidance and assistance to local authorities to enable them summarily to reject such applications in favour of the kind of housing development needed in their communities, and, certainly in Calderdale, better to utilise section 106 agreements, which have an important place in the provision of affordable local housing. Furthermore, will the Minister look at the link between investment in private sector housing and the rural housing agenda, because two thirds of Calderdale is classified as rural?</p>
	<p pid="b.53.1/14">Finally, I flag up the link between the need for investment in our older stock and the energy efficiency housing agenda. In my constituency, which has been subject to significant flooding over many years, the importance of thinking globally and acting locally is not lost upon the community. I welcome the Government's target of all newly-constructed homes being zero carbon by 2016, and I call for a similar commitment to a radical improvement in the existing stock in areas with a legacy of older housing.</p>

	<p pid="b.55.0/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1471" name="Chris McCafferty">the Member for Calder Valley (Chris McCafferty)</phrase> on securing this important debate, which raises a crucial issue in the area that I represent as well as in hers. The importance of additional, private sector housing money to take forward new schemes around Halifax cannot be underestimated.</p>
	<p pid="b.55.0/2">So far, due to restrictions on finance, investment has been restricted to one or two areas with the most pressing housing needs. However, other parts of Halifax, such as Lee Mount, Boothtown, and Siddal, to name but three, would benefit from similar levels of investment. We need the Government to help secure that investment. Halifax needs not only a fair distribution of resources across different communities, but to be seen to have a fair distribution of money. To enable that to happen, and to support the work of Calderdale council, enough money will be needed over the next three years to take forward that work and to enable the necessary changes. To put it bluntly, more money is needed to help turn dreams into reality.</p>
	<p pid="b.55.0/3">As my hon. Friend has touched upon, Calderdale has diverse housing needs. Halifax also has areas with high house prices, as well as many deprived communities living in poor quality older properties. That situation needs addressing. In recent years, money from central Government has helped to tackle key regeneration schemes in the Park ward area and Illingworth. We now need more of the same to tackle similar problems in other parts of Halifax.</p>
	<p pid="b.55.0/4">Key pockets of deprivation often lie in more prosperous wards, which are not highlighted in the indices of deprivation. It is not good enough that, as my hon. Friend has stated, almost one fifth of all private sector homes are in serious disrepair, that there is a high level of disrepair and damp and that private sector tenants are more than twice as likely to live in unfit properties as owner-occupiers. It is incredible that, after decades of housing policy, investment and action plans, such a picture can still be painted. We need to start with a fresh canvas and ensure a new picture is created for this generation. That work needs to start in Calderdale today. I urge the Minister to come and see first hand the housing challenges that need addressing in Calderdale. At the risk of repeating a well-used mantra, much has been done, but there is certainly much to do.</p>
	<p pid="b.55.0/5">I want to point out the good work being carried out by housing officers in Calderdale. The &quot;links in the chain&quot; concept has recently been developed, and it will build on some of the excellent inward investment in recent years. Exciting plans and regeneration schemes are in place, but in Halifax we do not want to rest on our laurels. As the local MP, I want much more done. The council has plans for post-18 education links between Calderdale council and local universities. However, in order to help build on that success, the council needs to develop further proposals for linked housing and economic investment.</p>
	<p pid="b.55.0/6">The main message that I want to bring to this debate is the need to give the council the financial support that it needs and wants, so that the pieces in the jigsaw can be completed. The money will provide the momentum, so that positive work can begin. I urge the Government to listen to the message from me and my hon. Friend and to help kick-start some much needed investment in the borough's housing stock, which will benefit hundreds of my constituents.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-02-19b.57.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1543" speakername="Caroline Flint" speakeroffice="The Minister for Housing"  colnum="57"  time="013:17:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080219/halltext/80219h0010.htm#08021973000508">
	<p pid="b.57.0/1">I congratulate my hon. Friends the Members for Calder Valley (Chris McCafferty) and for Halifax (Mrs. Riordan) on speaking today about the problems faced in their areas and the initiatives in their constituencies for thinking creatively about tackling different housing needs. As a Yorkshire MP, I am pleased to be joined by two Yorkshire colleagues who are making the point that housing is not just an issue for London and the south-east; it is an issue throughout the English regions. My Parliamentary Private Secretary, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1894" name="Chris Ruane">the Member for Vale of Clwyd (Chris Ruane)</phrase>, is in the Chamber and I know housing is an issue for our colleagues in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, too.</p>
	<p pid="b.57.0/2">It is important that the Government strike the right balance when identifying national challenges and problems. We must try as hard as possible to ensure that our planning guidance and legislation are in tune with a policy that sets challenges and targets while providing the flexibility for local authorities to work in partnership with others at local and regional level to identify and pinpoint more accurately the problems and needs of different communities. There is not necessarily a one-size-fits-all approach. However, it is fair to say that for decades house building has been insufficient, which has contributed to some of the price and affordability problems.</p>
	<p pid="b.57.0/3">We are increasingly recognising the need to consider the changing demographics of our communities. We are all living longer&mdash;thank goodness&mdash;but that raises challenges about the type of homes we want. Furthermore, we recognise that for some young people relying on the bank of mum and dad is not enough for them to get on to the first step of the housing market. Within that is the need to secure quality as well as quantity in social housing provision both for those who rely on it entirely and for others who need it as a springboard to other forms of home ownership or housing. I am glad, therefore, to have the opportunity to discuss such matters today.</p>
	<p pid="b.57.0/4">In areas such as Calderdale, in which my hon. Friends' constituencies lie, house prices rose by about 130 per cent. between 2001 and 2006 and one in nine families in the area are on the waiting list for social housing&mdash;far higher than the national average. Between 2004 and 2026, it is predicted that 526,000 new households will be formed in the region, and almost half are likely to be in West Yorkshire. Owing to that, and to the fact that what is happening in West Yorkshire is a challenge nationally, we have committed to deliver 3 million new homes by 2020. As my hon. Friends have said, the issue is not just a numbers game in terms of more homes, but crucially about building better homes&mdash;more sustainable, better designed and more suitable for the needs of communities&mdash;and examining existing stock, including where it fits into communities and how it will work and deliver for families. It is about delivering the homes that people need, including larger properties for families when appropriate, and affordable housing for first-time buyers and, most important, about giving a choice to older people to downsize and move into more appropriate accommodation as their needs change. As the experience of Calderdale shows, those homes are needed throughout the country, not just in the south-east.</p>
	<p pid="b.57.0/5">It is really positive to see the commitment from people working on housing throughout the region&mdash;from all the partners and stakeholders who are helping to shape the regional housing strategy. I shall single out the work in Calderdale, which is an authority that has made housing a central priority. It is one of the few authorities in the country with an affordable housing stretch target in its local area agreement, and I congratulate it on that ambition, and others on supporting it. The authority is working to ensure that new homes better reflect the needs of local families, with bigger houses in more convenient locations.</p>
	<p pid="b.57.0/6">We have changed some of our policies to strengthen people locally. Housing needs assessments deal much more with the types of accommodation required, and offer flexibility to tackle the issue. In the past, a site might have been allocated for certain housing, and one could not change it if the community's housing needs changed. I have been in communication with Councillor Grenville Horsfall&mdash;I think he is the planning committee chairman&mdash;who wrote to me regarding the concern about the flats that have been built. We hope that the new planning guidance strengthens people locally by using housing needs assessments to be much clearer about numbers, and by relating the guidance to the type and location of housing that is needed. There is nothing to gain in the commercial market from people building flats or houses that they cannot sell or let, but there is an opportunity locally to engage with local developers and say, &quot;Look, you may have built these a few years ago, but they are lying empty, so isn't it time to look at how you might market them?&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.57.0/7">One of our tasks is to consider how we can market apartments or flats to older people, and reassure them about the block. I know and have visited some of the mill houses in parts of Yorkshire. Housing presents a great opportunity to revitalise those wonderful structures, but there is a marketing challenge regarding older people and whether they think that such places could become a home, because they want to be reassured about safety and to know who will live there. Older people are concerned about those issues, as we all are as we grow older.</p>
	<p pid="b.57.0/8">There is also the question about whether flats should be knocked through to create bigger properties, such as four-bedroom flats. Leeds charges full council tax on empty properties. I do not know whether that happens in Calderdale, but it might be one way of incentivising developers to sell properties or put them on the rental market. The issue is about delivery&mdash;people seeing our words, and our ambitions for housing; it is about being realistic, through something that people can reach out to and touch. We are in constant dialogue with all the people involved in the West Yorkshire partnership to ensure that the local strategy reflects the national agenda as well as local needs.</p>
	<p pid="b.57.0/9">In 1997, housing investment for West Yorkshire was about &pound;65 million. In the past two years, it has averaged more than &pound;181 million, excluding four private finance initiative schemes that are under consideration. Some decisions about funding for West Yorkshire have still to be taken, but on the regional housing pot, we have announced overall investment of &pound;559 million in the Yorkshire and Humber region, which by 2010-11 will represent an increase of 32 per cent. on the figures in 2007-08. I cannot say what that will mean for West Yorkshire, but my hon. Friends will agree that it is a significant amount. It is important to engage in a debate about how best that money can be used, and to what end, to meet the challenges in local communities.</p>
	<p pid="b.57.0/10">Building on that measure, we have invested a great deal through the Housing Corporation to deliver the affordable housing that is needed locally. With large numbers of people attracted to the new jobs that are being created in areas such as Leeds, there will be additional pressure on the housing market, and some people who live in the constituencies that my hon. Friends represent travel or commute to Leeds. That is why we expect the region to set its sights higher by providing about 2,500 affordable homes per year by 2010-11. The target is undoubtedly challenging, but given the funding available, it is realistic. If the West Yorkshire partnership can identify suitable sites, it is likely to benefit significantly from the available funding, so there is no question of resources being pared back. It is a question of examining strategically what one can deliver locally, and discussing the issue together.</p>
	<p pid="b.57.0/11">Over the past two years, West Yorkshire has also benefited from funding through the housing market renewal programme, which, as my hon. Friends know, was set up to address the problem of severe market failure in some areas of the north and in the west midlands. There has been real progress across the areas chosen for intervention. As the National Audit Office found last year, all pathfinder areas have started to close the gap in prices in their regions, and there have been clear physical improvements in many neighbourhoods. We recently announced a further &pound;1 billion investment in the programme over the next three years, but decisions have not been taken about the allocations to each pathfinder, and we will target areas with the strongest and most persistent need. We are considering all the available information, including the business plans and housing strategies for all areas concerned, and I hope that we can make an announcement in the not too distant future.</p>
	<p pid="b.57.0/12">I hope that my hon. Friends feel from today's debate that we understand housing problems throughout the country, and certainly in their part of Yorkshire. As my hon. Friend the Member for Halifax said, the cup is half full, not half empty, but I realise how much more we must do. Local authorities can be empowered to do much more. Through their local development frameworks, they can assess and specify housing need. As planning authorities, they are fully empowered to reject inappropriate developments, and the new PPS3 also encourages use of section 106 agreements to deliver affordable housing. All those measures can be used with discretion as local tools. However, we must engage the commercial market and make it understand that there is no point in building if it cannot sell the houses. No one wants empty homes in our communities.</p>
	<p pid="b.57.0/13">Although I cannot confirm today the total funding that West Yorkshire will receive over the next three years, I hope that it is recognised that our track record of investment demonstrates our commitment to change. The latest allocations through the regional housing pot alone will make a real difference to local residents.</p>
	<p pid="b.57.0/14">On the points about warm and secure homes, our Warm Front programme has been important. We have ambitious zero-carbon targets for new-build homes by 2016, but again, in the few weeks that I have been in the post, I have realised that we must analyse existing stock, too. The issue is not just about numbers, but about quality and whether homes meet the needs of local communities.</p>
	<p pid="b.57.0/15">I shall think about the points made about minimum space standards. The Department is examining overcrowding and suitable homes in the commercial and social housing sectors for larger families, and I take on board the point about the link with rural housing agendas. In my constituency, none of which includes Doncaster town, there are many rural villages, and there is a need for affordable and social housing in those communities, too. They are vital to keep schools and services open in rural communities. I look forward to working with colleagues from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and other partners in that regard, because the lack of housing in those communities neither serves many people nor keeps families close together. I welcome today's debate and the contributions from both my hon. Friends, and I look forward to discussing the issue further at a later date.</p>

	Will Writing Industry
</minor-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-02-19b.61.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1823" speakername="Lorely Burt" colnum="61"  time="013:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080219/halltext/80219h0010.htm#08021973000509">
	<p pid="b.61.1/1">In the years between being selected to fight and winning my seat, to earn money in a flexible way that could fit in with campaigning I worked as a part-time, self-employed will writer with a company called, strangely enough, the Will Writing Company, which did what it said on the tin. I was not legally trained, but I was trained by the company and sat exams set by the Institute of Professional Willwriters, which were marked externally.</p>
	<p pid="b.61.1/2">Will writing is a good job for a nosey person, because by the time one has left the client, one knows all about them&mdash;their means, family arrangements, property situation and so on. A will writer needs that information to be able to make their client aware of the viability of what they want to do with their will and the most tax-efficient way to do it. Once the instructions were taken, the wills went to our head office to be scrutinised by legal professionals to ensure that I had given the best advice, and to be written up in a watertight legal form.</p>
	<p pid="b.61.1/3">To give proper advice takes time and training. Until the late 1980s, will writing was the sole province of solicitors, who were the only people who had access to training for the skills required, so they effectively retained the activity within their own regulated environment. That effective monopoly of solicitors was ended in the late 1980s, when Simon Francis Harris, a serial fraudster and undischarged bankrupt, was jailed at Liverpool Crown court. He served part of his sentence with Keith Best, a discredited Member of Parliament&mdash;he served for Anglesey from 1979 to 1987&mdash;and struck-off solicitor, who had written a book on will writing. On his release, Harris founded the Quill Group, a non-solicitor will-writing franchiser. It provided rudimentary training in basic will writing to its franchisees. By 1992 there were more than 400 franchisees, who had paid anything from &pound;6,000 to &pound;15,000 for their franchise areas. Quill Testamentary Services Ltd, the group company that sold the franchises, was wound up by the High Court on <phrase class="date" code="1993-05-05">5 May 1993</phrase> on a petition of the Department of Trade and Industry, as it was then. That came as a devastating blow to the franchisees, many of whom lost their life savings or had borrowed money to buy a franchise, but also left tens of thousands of clients without access to their wills.</p>
	<p pid="b.61.1/4">The story continued. In the late 1990s, Gerald Barton founded JHD Associates and sold franchises in a manner similar to that of Quill Wills. It mounted a major national advertising campaign offering to write wills</p>
	<p pid="b.61.1/5" class="indent">&quot;for a limited period for &pound;19.50 + vat (Usual Fee &pound;59)&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.61.1/6">Despite that unviable yet permanent price, JHD promised its franchisees minimum incomes in excess of &pound;20,000 per annum. It achieved that seemingly impossible feat by making additional charges for any variations required by clients' circumstances, which resulted in bills for up to &pound;500 for a pair of so-called &pound;19.50 wills.</p>
	<p pid="b.61.1/7">In February 2001, <i>Which?</i> magazine highlighted the case of a couple who were charged a total of &pound;287 for two wills, lifetime safe storage at</p>
	<p pid="b.61.1/8" class="indent">&quot;Somerset House, The Nation's Will Storage Centre, probably the most secure storage system in the UK&quot;,</p>
	<p pid="b.61.1/9">and legal advice for their executor. In 2000, the JHD offices closed and Gerald Barton was eventually traced to Gibraltar. Thereafter, 10,000 wills were discovered in boxes at a storage company in Wincanton, Somerset&mdash;hardly Somerset house. Barton subsequently returned to the UK and started an identical operation called Willmakers Ltd., offering &quot;affordable peace of mind&quot; for &pound;23.44 including VAT. By 2002, Willmakers had become National Legal Services, from the same address and with the same freephone number. It was wound up on a petition of the DTI in late 2007. Evidence showed that, once again, it had been formed for the purpose of selling franchises rather than actually writing wills.</p>
	<p pid="b.61.1/10">That is the state of the so-called professional will writing industry. Independent financial advisers are regulated and required to be qualified, and solicitors need to be qualified and closely controlled, but someone could be a convicted fraudster, set up as a will writer tomorrow with no qualifications, experience or professional indemnity insurance and proceed to dispense advice on tax, inheritance laws and so on. Most consumers are unable to judge the quality or value of the service that they are getting, so it is no exaggeration to say that will writing has become a happy hunting ground for the incompetent, the dishonest and the fly-by-night operator.</p>
	<p pid="b.61.1/11">Of course, there are many ethical operators, and there are two professional bodies for will writers. I have mentioned the Institute of Professional Willwriters, and the other main body is the Society of Will Writers. The problem is not with them, or with the vast majority of their members, but with those who operate without proper training, professionalism and insurance.</p>
	<p pid="b.61.1/12">Writing a will is probably unique, in that a defect will almost certainly not be found until after the person making it has died, by which time it can be too late to do anything about the problem. It is essential to get it right first time, otherwise there will be an ever-increasing number of invalid or ineffective wills. Many of those making wills with untrained writers will not die for another 20 or 30 years, and only then will the problems being created today come to light, when redress will be unavailable. History is littered with problems created by short-term sales of long-term products and services, whether endowments, pensions, equity release or wills.</p>
	<p pid="b.61.1/13">Many consumers do not appreciate the difference between a will writer and a solicitor. In fact, many assume that a will, being a legal document, can be drafted only by a solicitor. A survey carried out for the Institute of Professional Willwriters by Taylor Nelson Sofres in March 2007 found that 92 per cent. of consumers did not know that someone with no training or regulatory provisions could offer a will-writing service. When asked whether they thought that that was wrong, 77 per cent. said yes. Customers trust the person who turns up to write their will. Those customers are often elderly and easy meat for the unscrupulous will writer.</p>
	<p pid="b.61.1/14">The citizens advice bureau has provided me with several examples. An elderly couple from Nottinghamshire responded to an offer of will writing for &pound;20 plus VAT. With joint assets below the inheritance tax threshold, they were charged more than &pound;1,000 for services that they discovered that they had bought only when the paperwork arrived in the post. The irony was that they already had wills, which could easily and cheaply have been amended. CAB clients in Lincolnshire, who were receiving benefits, responded to an advertisement offering wills for &pound;23.50. A representative came to their home and charged them &pound;705, including storage costs. Another worrying matter is what happens to wills that clients have paid to have stored when a company goes bust or ceases trading.</p>
	<p pid="b.61.1/15">What are the Government doing, and what steps should they take? In March 2005, the then Lord Chancellor, Lord Falconer, announced that his Department would</p>
	<p pid="b.61.1/16" class="indent">&quot;consider the case for regulation of Will writing and estate administration services.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.61.1/17">Both the professional bodies that I have mentioned met officials of the then Department for Constitutional Affairs, and a White Paper, &quot;The Future of Legal Services: Putting the Consumer First&quot;, was published in October 2005. It states, on page 79, that</p>
	<p pid="b.61.1/18" class="indent">&quot;there does not appear to be a compelling argument for statutory regulation. However, the Government's view is that improvements must be made in the control of quality and standards of will writing and related services in order to protect consumers. This could be most effectively achieved by voluntary regulation, such as codes of conduct and consumer education schemes.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.61.1/19">For the past 18 months, the IPW and the Society Of Will Writers and Estate Planning Practitioners have been drafting their own codes of practice that meet the requirements of the Office of Fair Trading's consumer codes approval scheme. That is all well and good, but the CCAS requirements do not lend themselves fully to will writing. For example, there is no requirement for competence: the CCAS accepts that failure is inevitable and requires a robust mechanism of redress. But how can consumers complain, given that defects will probably become apparent only after they are dead? I am hardly a great fan of regulation&mdash;indeed, I believe it should be avoided where possible&mdash;but I wonder whether there should be an approved code of practice incorporating a system of redress, professional indemnity insurance and minimum qualification.</p>
	<p pid="b.61.1/20">Estate agents are bound by the OFT's estate agency guide and the Estate Agents Act 1979. Recently, a measure was introduced requiring them to belong to an independent, approved ombudsman scheme after voluntary regulation similar to that proposed for will writers conspicuously failed. I am a veteran of the Consumers, Estate Agents and Redress Act 2007, and in our debates on the Bill, I argued that a basic professional qualification should be a prerequisite to practise as an estate agent, but I failed to persuade the Government on that occasion. Here, we have an even stronger case for ensuring that services are right from the outset.</p>
	<p pid="b.61.1/21">If a will is written badly and does not reflect the interests and desires of the person who made it, the fault might not be discovered for 20 or 30 years. Indeed, it might never be discovered by the person who made it, because they will be dead when the problem arises. Learning that a will has been badly drafted is a huge blow to bereaved relatives who are trying to work their way through the complex system of obtaining probate&mdash;if they ever find out. Can a voluntary regime be enforced? If not, the untrained and unethical will still provide will-writing services, and those who are trained and acting ethically will be at a commercial disadvantage as they will be subject to the costs of the regime.</p>
	<p pid="b.61.1/22">Consumer awareness of the importance of making a will is incredibly low. Estimates indicate that only 30 per cent. of the population leave a valid will when they die. The Government have stated that their</p>
	<p pid="b.61.1/23" class="indent">&quot;overriding aim is that consumers receive a better standard of service, which they have a right to expect and deserve.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.61.1/24">I ask the Minister to respond to the following questions. How can we defuse the &quot;ticking time bomb&quot;, as the National Consumer Council describes it, of the 27 million people who do not have a will, particularly given that those who are least likely to have one are those who need one the most? Consumer education will not be effective other than through major, high-profile and continuous promotion&mdash;that means Government promotion.</p>
	<p pid="b.61.1/25">The will-writing profession is not in a position to fund such activity, given that it consists of only about 700 to 1,000 businesses, employing less than 2,000 practitioners. Indeed, we do not know how many will-writing companies there are, because there is no requirement for them to register. We need something like a CORGI register for will writers. CORGI is a trusted brand that delivers a guaranteed level of service, and someone, somewhere has promoted that brand so that everyone knows and trusts it. Do the Government have the political will to promote the needs of citizens and their loved ones after their death?</p>
	<p pid="b.61.1/26">I also want to know how it is possible to bring the cowboys of the industry into line if there is no central register of firms that trade as will writers, and no requirement to adhere to a voluntary code of conduct? The majority of consumers who take the trouble to make wills believe that their wills are being written by someone who is legally qualified. Will writers do not need to be legally qualified as long as they are properly trained, but as things stand, customers are sitting ducks. The industry's reputation is going down the drain, and ethical companies can do nothing but put themselves at a competitive disadvantage by swallowing the additional cost of doing the right thing: providing proper training and continuous professional development, and having full insurance cover and an overriding concern for clients and their interests. The ethical part of the industry needs a helping hand.</p>

	<p pid="b.64.0/1">I am grateful to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1823" name="Lorely Burt">the hon. Member for Solihull (Lorely Burt)</phrase> for this opportunity to discuss the will-writing sector. She has described her personal interest in the subject, and I know that she is, rightly, keen that consumers should be protected from unscrupulous will-writing organisations.</p>
	<p pid="b.64.0/2">The crux of the matter is whether will writing should be a reserved legal activity. That question was debated at length during scrutiny of the Legal Services Bill last year. At that time, the Government's position was that there was insufficient evidence to make a compelling case for regulating will-writing services, and I must disappoint the hon. Lady by telling her that we still do not see a compelling case. I reiterated that position in a recent written answer to my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1761" name="Linda Gilroy">the Member for Plymouth, Sutton (Linda Gilroy)</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.64.0/3">Our position will disappoint some people in will-writing organisations, such as the IPW, as they recently wrote to MPs seeking support for regulation, but we do not rule out future regulation. We will regulate, if there is evidence that regulation is not only necessary, but the most effective way of increasing consumer protection. We are committed to reducing regulatory burdens as far as possible, and we will not introduce regulation unless there is evidence of significant problems.</p>

	<p pid="b.65.1/1">I hope that I will answer the hon. Lady's questions during the course of my remarks. If I do not, I am sure she will come back to me on those points.</p>
	<p pid="b.65.1/2">There is always a possibility that mistakes will be made in will writing, but regulation would not necessarily rectify those problems, and there is no evidence that lack of regulation causes those mistakes. Solicitors, who are regulated, can often make mistakes in will writing, and we are concerned that the cost of regulation might restrict competition and impose unnecessary burdens on providers and costs on consumers. That was the view of the NCC in its report, &quot;Finding the will&quot;, which was published in September 2007. The report, to which the hon. Lady has alluded, examined will-writing behaviour among adults in England and Wales.</p>
	<p pid="b.65.1/3">Not everyone wants to go to a solicitor or even to a professional will writer. Some choose a do-it-yourself pack because of cost or accessibility. What is most important from the consumer's point of view is the need to know that, whatever option they choose, it is the right one for them. They need to be aware of the pros and cons of all the options available to them. For example, Which? provides advice. It makes it clear to consumers that while the do-it-yourself will is certainly cheaper, it is suitable only if a person's circumstances are straightforward. Which? advises consumers against using such wills if their circumstances are in any way complicated or if there are detailed requirements for passing on their assets. They are advised instead to consult a solicitor or a qualified will writer who is a member of a recognised trade body.</p>
	<p pid="b.65.1/4">Just before the NCC published its report last year, the Probate Service published an internet leaflet that provides factual, unbiased information about the benefits of making a will and the consequences of not doing so. The Government want to encourage people to make a will. If, as the NCC found, two out of three people have not made a will, we need to find ways of encouraging them to do so. The hon. Lady has alluded to the point that the people who do not make wills include those from ethnic minorities, those from lower income groups and those with dependent children&mdash;all groups that would be more vulnerable if someone were to die intestate. We have a real job of work to do in educating the public at large about the importance of making a will. The NCC report specifically recommended that we defuse what it termed the &quot;looming wills time bomb&quot; and find new ways to encourage people to make wills. We are looking closely at its recommendations and hope to come to a conclusion before too long about how to take them forward.</p>
	<p pid="b.65.1/5">The hon. Lady has made important points about protecting consumers. The best way to do that is to ensure that improvements are made in the quality and standards of will writing. In 2006, as part of our work to encourage that, we met with several interested groups to discuss more effective options such as the Office of Fair Trading's voluntary codes scheme. An OFT-approved code gives the consumer a high level of service and specifically addresses areas of concern and consumer detriment in a particular sector. The OFT's consumer code approval indicates to consumers the quality of service that they should get, and it would deliver real benefits without unnecessarily restricting the range of providers, which is crucial for consumer choice.</p>
	<p pid="b.65.1/6">If will writers sign up to an approved code, they will be able to provide the consumer with the benefits that are outlined in it, including everything from clear pre-sale information, fair contracts and access to independent redress&mdash;all the key issues identified by the hon. Lady for improving will-writing services. Although an approved code cannot guarantee that all transactions with a business that complies with it will be trouble-free, it certainly provides a straightforward procedure for resolving complaints. If members fail to comply with the code, the code sponsors&mdash;in this case, the will-writing organisations&mdash;will be expected to discipline them or even expel them, if necessary.</p>
	<p pid="b.65.1/7">The hon. Lady and others have suggested that a voluntary code may not be sufficient to raise standards as it would not be enforceable, and, obviously, not everyone would become a member of the organisation.</p>

	<p pid="b.66.0/1">I am grateful to the Minister, who is being patient with me. I am trying hard to understand how the voluntary code will actually work. It is estimated that a good 25 per cent. of will writers are not members of either institution and can operate, as I have said, with no insurance, no code and no redress or complaints system. There is so much ignorance, and many people assume that the person who writes the will is a legally trained person. How will those people be covered by a voluntary code?</p>

	<p pid="b.66.1/1">The hon. Lady has made an important point. We are looking at that matter specifically. We want to put much of our effort into raising consumer awareness. If consumers are aware that there are a couple of reputable organisations whose members are signed up to the OFT's consumer code approval, they will have much more confidence in the individual will writer and that the overarching organisation that they represent will have some power in dealing with rogue members, if that becomes necessary. When the Government and consumer organisations launch the consumer awareness initiative, we must ensure that we give people detailed information about what to look for&mdash;the hon. Lady has mentioned the CORGI stamp of approval. They will want a brand in which they can have some confidence, just as they would if they were going to a solicitor for other forms of legal advice. We are keen to look at how we do that in following up the NCC's report.</p>
	<p pid="b.66.1/2">The starting point in developing a proper picture of what we can do would be to find out what information is currently available. We need evidence of widespread detriment. The hon. Lady mentioned rogues and gave examples of how things can go badly wrong. We need to ensure that such behaviour is not widespread. As I have said, we will keep the question of regulation under review.</p>
	<p pid="b.66.1/3">The new independent oversight regulator, the Legal Services Board, which was established under the Legal Services Act 2007, will have the power to advise the Government on unregulated gaps in the legal services market. Through secondary legislation, we will be able to bring those unregulated legal activities within the regulatory net. The LSB may investigate, and if it finds that there is a compelling argument for statutory regulation of will writing or any services in that area, and if it believes that that would better consumer protection, it would recommend to the Secretary of State that will writing become a reserved activity. I would expect it to act on any evidence of widespread misuse of the system.</p>
	<p pid="b.66.1/4">By establishing the LSB, the Government have put in place arrangements that will allow us to act swiftly, if evidence of consumer detriment emerges in the future. Until then, I want to work with consumer organisations and others, including the will-writing associations, to ensure that consumers have sufficient information to make informed choices about the quality of service that they expect to receive. I am happy to keep the hon. Lady informed as we move forward.</p>
	<p pid="b.66.1/5" class="italic">Question put and agreed to.</p>
	<p pid="b.66.1/6" class="italic">Adjourned accordingly at one minute to Two o'clock.</p>
