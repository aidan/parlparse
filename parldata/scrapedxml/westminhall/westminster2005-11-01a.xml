<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-11-01a.189.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1841" speakername="Mark Fisher" colnum="189"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051101/halltext/51101h01.htm#51101h01_spnew10">
	<p pid="a.189.0/1">It is not for me to say; I suspect that the Minister will have a clear view on that. However, my hon. Friend makes a good point; given his medical and scientific expertise, I think that he will be listened to carefully.</p>
	<p pid="a.189.0/2">The drug is not yet approved by NICE. As a result, until quite recently, few PCTs were anxious to prescribe it; they wanted to wait and see. Roche has not yet applied for a licence. I spoke to people from Roche yesterday and I asked what the delay was. They said, &quot;Licence applications are very difficult. This one will probably have 3,000 pages of text and analysis. We have not finished it, but we hope to do so and apply for a licence in February. It should not take very long then.&quot; Nevertheless, Roche emphasised that we do not have to wait for the licence. Oncologists want to prescribe the drug and they feel safe about doing so. It is being prescribed in other countries, such as France and Canada. I do not think that that necessarily is a full explanation about why it is not being prescribed in this country.</p>
	<p pid="a.189.0/3">The drug is undoubtedly expensive; it costs &pound;21,000 for a years' treatment. However, the Secretary of State told the Select Committee on <phrase class="date" code="2005-10-27">27 October</phrase> that cost is not an issue. Perhaps it is not an issue for her&mdash;it is rather encouraging to hear that she believes that this should be paid for&mdash;but it is one for many PCTs that are millions of pounds in debt. It is not a satisfactory solution for the Secretary of State simply to say to PCTs that are &pound;10 million or &pound;15 million in debt, &quot;Cost is no problem, go on and do it.&quot; It is not satisfactory that women in those PCTs should be penalised for whatever the financial problems of those PCTs are.</p>
	<p pid="a.189.0/4">The drug has terrific cost benefits. If a diagnosis is made in the early stages of breast cancer, it can be cured and the direct saving of cost to the NHS is enormous. If, as now, it is prescribed only at a late stage, the cost of the treatment through Herceptin and the chemotherapy associated with it will be considerable for a number of years. It is in everybody's interest&mdash;the patient's, the PCT's, the Government's and the national health service's&mdash;that it is prescribed at an early stage, when it can save lives rather than simply prolong them.</p>
	<p pid="a.189.0/5">Those cost benefits do not take into account the indirect cost benefits to the state. If these women die, the costs of the people who are dependent on them&mdash;young children and dependent parents&mdash;will fall considerably on the state. The knock-on costs of not prescribing the drug at an early stage are considerable. As we do not know how many people in the country are suitable to have the drug, we cannot calculate those costs. That is yet another reason for getting on with the testing.</p>
	<p pid="a.189.0/6">Where are we with this issue? Women with money and access to the finances receive the drug. Women in Cornwall, Devon, Dorset and now Leeds are receiving it; I gather there was also a case in the Wyre valley last week. It is more widely available in the south of England than in the north. In the midlands, it is hardly available at all. Why is there yet another postcode lottery, when postcode lotteries in health have been so discredited and reviled? I cannot understand it, and it is not acceptable.</p>
	<p pid="a.189.0/7">I understand the difficult position that the Minister is in and the fact that she, as all Members of this House do, cares very much about the fate of these women. However, there are things that it is right that we ask her and the Government to do. First, we must make testing generally available now, so that we know how many people can be helped by this drug. Secondly, we must give clear guidance to the PCTs now. It is not enough simply to give encouragement to them. They need to know that the Government are behind them and will back them up financially. This is not a local decision and should not be left as such.</p>
	<p pid="a.189.0/8">Will the Minister take the issue back to the Secretary of State, so that she can reconsider her decision that this is a local decision? It is not a local decision. Discussions should be entered into with Roche. That &pound;21,000 might, in some ways, be a negotiable figure, particularly if the drug is widely prescribed and therefore the unit costs ought, logically, to come down&mdash;although once &pound;900 million has been invested, that will take some time. Also, amazingly, Roche's patent expires in 2011, so it does not have much time to recoup its costs. Nevertheless, with the Secretary of State's influence and strong position, it would be helpful if she entered into discussions with Roche.</p>
	<p pid="a.189.0/9">Finally, the Secretary of State really must enter into discussions with the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Treasury now. More money is going to be needed for this. In Government terms, it is not a huge sum of money, but it is more money than the primary care trusts can find. There has to be some additional funding from the Treasury to recognise the potential of this drug. Those are not unreasonable requests and they make good sense.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-11-01a.190.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1926" speakername="James Gray" colnum="190"  time="009:52:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051101/halltext/51101h01.htm#51101h01_spnew13">
	<p pid="a.190.2/1">May I first congratulate you, Mr. Bercow, on your elevation to the Speaker's Panel? However, seeing a member of one's own intake in your elevated position does age one a little. My congratulations are therefore a bit half-hearted in that sense. May I also congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1841" name="Mark Fisher">the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central (Mark Fisher)</phrase> on initiating this extremely important debate?</p>
	<p pid="a.190.2/2">I have a small personal interest to declare, albeit not a financial interest as far as I am aware at this stage. Right in the middle of the general election campaign, horrifyingly enough, my wife was diagnosed with breast cancer. I remember going to see the surgeon who said, &quot;Oh yes, I've arranged a date for surgery. It will be <phrase class="date" code="2005-05-05">5 May</phrase>.&quot; Sarah and I had to explain why that would not be appropriate. She is now in the middle of her chemotherapy.</p>
	<p pid="a.190.2/3">I understand that Herceptin is not suitable for women who are in the middle of chemotherapy. Therefore, I presume that it would not be suitable for Sarah. But the interesting point is that as far as I am aware&mdash;I have not checked her notes&mdash;she was not tested for HER2 and she certainly was not offered the opportunity of having Herceptin. Although it would not now be appropriate for her to have it, I would be interested to know whether it would have changed the course of her treatment, which is a tough business by any standards, as many here will know.</p>
	<p pid="a.190.2/4">I was very impressed when I attended the Breakthrough Breast Cancer lobby last Tuesday. What a well organised lobby it was. We are all subjected to all kinds of lobbies from all kinds of different interest groups. Breakthrough Breast Cancer organised a superb lobby and told us all precisely what to do. One thing it told us to do was to get in touch with our local primary care trust and discover whether Herceptin would be prescribed automatically and whether testing was done. Being an efficient bunny I did exactly that. I wrote to my PCT and I got the reply this morning. I wrote simply asking whether North Wiltshire and Kennet primary care trust would prescribe Herceptin.</p>
	<p pid="a.190.2/5">I spent six years at university so I pride myself in not being too dim, but I shall read out the reply carefully. It states:</p>
	<p pid="a.190.2/6" class="indent">&quot;We have funded the full drug uplift&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.190.2/7">whatever that might be&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.190.2/8" class="indent">&quot;which has been recommended nationally, in all major acute providers for 2005/2006. This means that Trusts are free to make clinical decisions about any new/high cost drugs without having to come back to the PCTs for financial approval.</p>
	<p pid="a.190.2/9" class="indent">The planning process for 2006/2007 is just starting and within that we will take full account of emerging national guidance on the prescribing of Herceptin.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.190.2/10">I have read that about six times and the meaning is just dimly beginning to come through to me. At the moment, the Government say that hospitals can make up their own minds on the subject&mdash;the PCT does not have to decide&mdash;but that they will none the less take full account of emerging national guidance over the next few months. Frankly, if I sent that letter to a constituent, particularly one who had recently been diagnosed with breast cancer, and said, &quot;Here is what the local NHS has to say on Herceptin&quot;, it would make the situation a great deal worse than it is at the moment.</p>
	<p pid="a.190.2/11">One thing that we must do&mdash;perhaps it will be an outcome of the debate&mdash;is to clarify to the many thousands of women being diagnosed year by year with breast cancer what Herceptin is for and whether they will be automatically tested for it. The question of testing is extremely important. I think that only 35 per cent. of PCTs test for HER2. Such testing should be universal. Will women be tested for it; will they be suitable for Herceptin? If they are suitable, will their local PCT or the local hospital deal with the issue?</p>
	<p pid="a.190.2/12">Frankly, the architecture of the health service is an academic matter. It may interest the Minister and others in this Room, but my constituents who have been diagnosed today with breast cancer do not care whether it is the PCT, the Avon, Gloucestershire and Wiltshire strategic health authority, the national health service in London or the Bath Royal United hospital that deals with the issue. My constituents want to know whether Herceptin will work for them and whether Her Majesty's Government, or the national health service, will pay for it. Those are the important things. Sending out confusing letters is not helpful. Some of the language that we have heard is exactly what the national health service should not be using. It is national; it is the health service. Her Majesty's Government are responsible for it because it uses taxpayers' money. We want to know from the Government whether they will make automatic testing for Herceptin available and whether the drug will be available more generally than it is at the moment.</p>
	<p pid="a.190.2/13">Incidentally, I accept the point made by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1744" name="Ian Gibson">the hon. Member for Norwich, North (Dr. Gibson)</phrase>. He is absolutely right to say that many more breakthrough drugs for all kinds of cancer will come along in the next few years as science develops rapidly, so getting the protocol right for this breakthrough drug now is desperately important for the future.</p>
	<p pid="a.190.2/14">Many other hon. Members want to take part in this very important debate, so I shall conclude with a relevant issue that is a particular hobby-horse of mine. We welcome the establishment of NICE. It is perfectly reasonable and sensible that there should be a Government organisation set up to examine the efficaciousness of drugs. Some drugs work for some people and some drugs do not. It is absolutely right that the Government should examine which are which. However, the word that we do not like in the task given to NICE is &quot;cost-effective&quot;. NICE should determine whether drugs are effective&mdash;whether they work. NICE should determine whether Herceptin would have been appropriate in my wife's case. That should be a clear and straightforward matter. It should then say to the Government and to the national health service whether the drug is good, bad or indifferent.</p>
	<p pid="a.190.2/15">Of course, the situation may be much more complicated than that. NICE might say that the drug is good in some cases, but not in others. However, it should not have to say, &quot;This is a good drug. It works, but we are not certain that the Government can afford it.&quot; The affordability of drugs should be a matter for the Government&mdash;for politicians. It should be up to the Minister of State, Department of Health, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1690" name="Jane Kennedy">the right hon. Member for Liverpool, Wavertree (Jane Kennedy)</phrase>, to stand up this morning and say&mdash;this may well not be the case&mdash;&quot;NICE has said that this is a brilliant drug. It works. However, I am awfully sorry but my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer has said that he is spending the money this year on schools, so the money will not be available for Herceptin.&quot; That would be a perfectly legitimate political decision to take&mdash;a tough decision, but perfectly legitimate. To shuffle off the decision about whether the drug is cost-effective to an anonymous organisation called NICE, which few people know, seems to me to be less acceptable. The Government should come to a conclusion as to whether the drug is cost-effective as well as effective; that should not be left to NICE.</p>
	<p pid="a.190.2/16">We need greater clarity. My local PCT, like many others, is massively in debt&mdash;to the tune of millions of pounds. Is the decision up to the PCT? In that case, I fear that the nice people who run my local PCT will have to say, &quot;Well, I'm awfully sorry, but I'm going to be faced with a choice between closing two or three community hospitals&quot;&mdash;there is a debate in this Chamber tomorrow on community hospitals&mdash;&quot;and making Herceptin available.&quot; That should not be a decision that it takes. It should not be a decision that the Bath Royal United hospital takes, because it is deeply in debt. That decision should be taken by the NHS; it is a national health service, and if this drug works, it must be available to all.</p>
	<p pid="a.190.2/17">I hope that the Minister echoes some of the remarks that the Secretary of State made at the Breakthrough Breast Cancer lobby meeting last Tuesday. She made encouraging comments on this matter at that meeting. The Government agree with me about what is the right direction, so I do not want to press them unduly. However, I hope that the Minister will acknowledge that the drug works, that testing is essential and should be universal rather than done on a postcode basis, and that it should be the Government who decide whether it is affordable. If it is, I would also like her to explain the mechanism by which it will be paid for.</p>
	<p pid="a.190.2/18">I congratulate the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central on asking the right questions so well. He is right: we need to know from the Government today&mdash;as do the tens of millions of women throughout Britain who have a keen personal interest in this subject&mdash;whether the drug will be made available, on what basis it will be made available and who will pay for it.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-11-01a.209.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1374" speakername="Sammy Wilson" colnum="209"  time="011:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051101/halltext/51101h02.htm#51101h02_spnew0">
	<p pid="a.209.1/1">I am grateful for the opportunity to debate an issue that is of increasing importance in Northern Ireland. I am grateful, too, that the Minister is in attendance this morning. I know that I have dragged her away from the fair shores of Northern Ireland, which she left yesterday. She is rushing back again, so keen is she on the place, but she has come to respond to the debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.209.1/2">All public representatives are finding that levels of satisfaction with the Northern Ireland Planning Service are falling. That dissatisfaction is experienced not just by those who make applications, but by objectors to applications and those who simply have an interest in the planning system. The two greatest concerns are delays in the planning process and lack of accountability. Those two problems go hand in hand. The lack of accountability has resulted in a lack of urgency in the planning process and a lack of response to the increasing criticisms of the process.</p>
	<p pid="a.209.1/3">I want to deal first with delays. Delays occur in the processing of planning applications, in the production of policies and in the bringing forward of area plans. The Planning Service suffers from more delays than British Rail on a bad day&mdash;and it probably comes up with as many excuses, too. Those bringing forward major developments now build in a minimum of two years for planning permission, and most housing association schemes take up to one year for the planning application process to be completed.</p>
	<p pid="a.209.1/4">As to what some stakeholders and players in the system have said about the planning system in Northern Ireland, Tesco described it as &quot;wading through treacle&quot;. Banks now put planning risk as a major financing risk to any scheme&mdash;significantly, it now ranks above political instability. One of the large private developers in Northern Ireland, CUSP, claims that the planning process is extremely slow, to the extent that development opportunities are being put at risk or missed altogether. In a recent report, Investment Belfast estimated that in excess of &pound;1 billion of property investment has been lost to Northern Ireland. It has flowed into Great Britain, instead. That is equal to about 15,000 full-time construction jobs. The Northern Ireland Independent Retail Trade Association described the system as a farce and a shambles, and William Ewart Properties Ltd recently invested in three GB-based shopping centres because of the uncertainty and difficulties in getting planning permission in Northern Ireland.</p>
	<p pid="a.209.1/5">That all comes at a time when, rightly, the Government are seeking to wean Northern Ireland from dependence on the public sector, yet the opportunity to create jobs in the private sector is being held up by major impediments in the planning process. It is clear from the examples that I have given that economic development and job promotion are being held up, and that the planning process is responsible for a shortfall in economic growth in Northern Ireland.</p>
	<p pid="a.209.1/6">Delays in the planning system are not just manifested in the slowness of the divisional planning offices in assessing and processing planning applications. There is another major delay in bringing forward policies and area plans. That creates greater uncertainty, because planning then takes place in a vacuum. Those who are objecting do not know the status of certain areas and those applying do not know the ground rules.</p>
	<p pid="a.209.1/7">The Belfast metropolitan area plan, which covers two areas in my constituency of East Antrim&mdash;Newtownabbey and Carrickfergus&mdash;was meant to replace the Belfast urban area plan, which is in itself 10 years out of date. The Belfast metropolitan area plan has been five years in the making. The draft was finally published at the end of 2004. It is now going to be subject to a public inquiry, and it could be 2009 before it is adopted. We could have 14 years of no formal plan for the Greater Belfast area.</p>
	<p pid="a.209.1/8">That turgid document&mdash;that is all one can describe it as, because it lacks vision&mdash;and its technical support stand 3 ft high. I am not so sure that it is a useful document for anyone who applies. Indeed, a document that is as prescriptive as that one in itself creates difficulties, which is one of the problems with the way in which area plans are drawn up.</p>
	<p pid="a.209.1/9">The damage that tardiness in advancing planning policies can do could not be illustrated better than by the disgraceful way in which successive Ministers have handled the review of planning policy statement 5, which deals with retail planning policy in Northern Ireland. The guidelines have now been under review for five years. That review was greatly needed because, after several judicial reviews and other legal challenges, PPS5, which was meant to protect town centres, was so watered down that it was almost meaningless and certainly did not protect town centres.</p>
	<p pid="a.209.1/10">The work started in autumn 2000. The original research was carried out by Roger Tym and Partners, who were the authors of the successful policy that limited superstore development in the Republic to 30,000 sq ft. The report, which was published in February 2003, indicated that the Northern Ireland food market was reaching saturation point, with growth down from 1.28 per cent. to less than half that figure. Obviously, that did not suit some people in the Department, because at that stage there was an influx of major food retailers such as Tesco, Sainsbury's and Asda into Northern Ireland.</p>
	<p pid="a.209.1/11">There was therefore a delay in submitting the document for public consultation. It was available in September 2004 and was to go out to consultation in November 2004. The then Minister, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1906" name="John Spellar">the right hon. Member for Warley (Mr. Spellar)</phrase>, decided that there would be a further delay while he consulted another Department. It was promised that the consultation would start in February 2005, but we then had an election, so it was delayed for that. Since the election, however, there has still been no sign of it. The document was delayed, but it now seems to have fallen off the radar completely.</p>
	<p pid="a.209.1/12">The planning vacuum that has occurred as a result has created dangers for many provincial towns. Let me give one example. Enniskillen, a town in the west of the Province, with 17,000 people, currently has four applications for food superstores. I know that they will not all be granted, but if they were, there would be another 7 sq ft of retail shopping for every man, woman and child in the whole of County Fermanagh. That creates uncertainty for investment in Fermanagh, but it also creates frustration for those who have applied, because there is no clear policy on which of the schemes are most likely to be successful.</p>
	<p pid="a.209.1/13">Some people argue for a moratorium on the processing of applications until the new PPS5 is in place. I do not support that call, because I believe that it would only prolong the uncertainty about investment in town centres and would stymie some schemes that would benefit the economy of some provincial towns. Rather than having a moratorium, the obvious answer is simply to produce the policy, to put it out to public consultation, to get it adopted, to start applying it and to inject some certainty into the planning regime.</p>
	<p pid="a.209.1/14">I believe that other planning documents require revision, but one that concerns me in particular is PPS2, which deals with planning, nature conservation and the protection of natural habitats. It is quite clear that the statement is not up to date and is not strong enough. In my constituency of East Antrim, I have seen builders deliberately tear out old field hedges and take down copses, even when those have been marked on maps as features that must be preserved. There seems to be little or no protection. In large housing developments, much of the landscaping that is required as a result of the quality development requirements is unimaginative. It often resembles the landscaping that we would expect from a garden makeover, rather than integrating naturally into the environment.</p>
	<p pid="a.209.1/15">The Woodland Trust has estimated that about 40 hectares of native trees need to be planted in the Larne area to meet the standards in &quot;Space for People&quot;. Rather than allowing the unimaginative landscape schemes that are accepted at present, we should make provision to create quality open space by planting woodland, particularly on large housing developments, which can tolerate planting because of their scale. That would also go a long way towards meeting the demand in &quot;Space for People&quot; for woodland access within two miles of where people live.</p>
	<p pid="a.209.1/16">There are many creative ideas from developers and groups such as the Woodland Trust, and those should be considered in the review of PPS2. It is significant that the members of the working group that was set up in May 2004 have not been called together since. That is another example of the lack of urgency in reviewing policies.</p>
	<p pid="a.209.1/17">The problem seems to be that the planning system finds it difficult to cope with the current volume of planning applications, to the point that those people who would be involved in drawing up policy are now allocated to development control. That means that policy development has been all but forgotten.</p>
	<p pid="a.209.1/18">What has caused this problem of delay? Why is the planning system grinding to a halt in that way? The planners blame everyone but themselves, and the excuses that have come from the planning system mimic those that we got from British Rail for the delays to trains. The latest culprit to be identified is councils. We are told they are responsible for the delay, that they defer applications, that they send them to the management board and that they are irresponsible. Under &quot;Modernising Planning&quot;, therefore, councils will be limited to one deferral of a planning application, regardless of the reason for that deferral.</p>
	<p pid="a.209.1/19">I know that some councils are irresponsible and defer a planning application when they do not know what to do with it; they send it to the management board to pretend that they are doing something. I was the chairman of the Belfast city council planning committee for many years, and we would have sent an application to the management board as a last resort. We had a self-denying ordinance that, where the council did not show that it was delaying or deferring an application for good reasons, the committee would take the application out of its hands and push it through the system. However, such councils will be punished, because the planning system wants to find a scapegoat. That will not speed up the planning process, because most of the planning applications about which people complain come to councils only a year and a half after they were first made.</p>
	<p pid="a.209.1/20">The other reason that there has been a delay is that no such restrictions are placed on statutory consultees such as the Roads Service, the Environment and Heritage Service, the Water Service and the landscape division of the Department of the Environment, which can, and often do, delay a process for as long as they want. To save time, I shall give hon. Members just one example, involving a planning application by one of my constituents, who lives beside Belfast lough. I do not know whether this has anything do with the debate, but I got a call from the Environment and Heritage Service yesterday, saying that, after two years, it had finally sorted the matter out. I hope that that illustrates the power of Parliament, but I shall wait to see. If I have planning difficulties in future, however, I might apply for another debate; that might be the way to get things done.</p>
	<p pid="a.209.1/21">The building of Carrick marina changed wave patterns, and the sea wall that bordered my constituent's property was starting to wash away. Every week, he was paying builders to shore it up to stop it and his garden being washed into the lough. He needed to build some armouring, which would have extended 4 ft on to the beach and run 100 yd along it.</p>
	<p pid="a.209.1/22">One of the consultees, the Environment and Heritage Service, rightly took an interest in the matter, because Belfast lough is a special protection area. Over two years, however, the service asked him to do survey after survey. First, he was asked to do a survey of the ducks and seagulls&mdash;a bird survey. When that was done, he was asked to do a seal survey. It then asked him to do a worm survey&mdash;the service called it a benthic invertebrate survey, but I think that means worms. After that, he had to do a model of coastal dynamics to show the macro-effects of the development on the whole north shore of the lough&mdash;the whole north shore of the lough stretches for about 15 miles, and he was going to do some work on 100 yards. He was then told that he was going to have to do a bird-nesting survey. I think that the only survey they did not ask him to do was on the impact on global warning&mdash;and had it not been for this debate, he may have been asked to do that.</p>
	<p pid="a.209.1/23">My constituent spent more than &pound;9,000 on those surveys. He was happy to do so, if that was what was required. However, if the Environment and Heritage Service knew at the start that those were the areas it was concerned about, why did it not ask for surveys on them to be done all at once? Why did it ask for one after another over two years? During that time, he was spending money shoring up the wall. The irony is that, had the sea wall come down and the garden been washed on to the beach, it would not have impinged on to 4 ft of beach; it would have washed across a much larger area.</p>
	<p pid="a.209.1/24">I will not bore hon. Members by giving further illustrations; I am sure that they could give many similar illustrations. However, I could provide further illustrations on the Roads Service, the Water Service, and the landscape division of the Department of the Environment. There does not seem to be any curtailment on how long consultees can hold the process up.</p>
	<p pid="a.209.1/25">Another explanation that has been given is that the number of applications received by the Planning Service has jumped greatly, and that is true. However, that is also true for councils, which have to deal with the building control aspects of any planning application. The odd thing is that, during the period of the increase in planning applications, councils' building control departments have reduced their waiting lists and times, whereas the length of time it takes the planning system to deal with planning applications has increased dramatically.</p>
	<p pid="a.209.1/26">The Minister authorised the employment of 120 new planners&mdash;she can correct that figure if it is wrong&mdash;to supplement those already employed, and to move people off area plan teams and policy making in order to try to deal with the backlog, yet the problem has still not been dealt with. One of the reasons for that is that, although additional planning staff have been introduced, the bureaucracy of the planning system has not been dealt with. It grinds slowly and frustrates the public and their representatives.</p>
	<p pid="a.209.1/27">One of the major sources of delay in recent times has been the practice of sending planning applications back as invalid. I do not know if architects are getting worse, or if, as a result of ageing, they are becoming senile, but I cannot understand why that is happening. Architects' applications used seldom to be declared invalid, but now there is suddenly a big jump in the number of invalid applications. That has added delay to the process.</p>
	<p pid="a.209.1/28">I dealt with one such application in my constituency. A group that had got temporary permission simply photocopied and sent in the same application as the previous year&mdash;an application that had been processed and given permission&mdash;and it was sent back to them as invalid. I could not find out what the reason for that was, and neither could any members of the group. Once I started making inquiries, it was determined that perhaps it was valid.</p>
	<p pid="a.209.1/29">One architect who knew about this debate sent me a letter on five applications he had submitted. All of them were initially returned as invalid, but were subsequently passed after a period&mdash;one after a year&mdash;without any amendment to the documentation or plans. That is another issue that the planners need to address.</p>
	<p pid="a.209.1/30">The second problem is one of accountability. I will deal with only one aspect of that, because I know that I will probably have a disagreement with my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1666" name="Jeffrey M Donaldson">the Member for Lagan Valley (Mr. Donaldson)</phrase>, who is sitting beside me. Planners have decided that they will consult councils even less than they did in the past. In Northern Ireland, councils are only consultees. They are not the final authority on planning decisions. It rests with the civil servants. So there is a lack of accountability already. We have no chance to question the Minister who makes the decisions directly, although I am sure that the Minister who is here this morning will do an excellent job in responding, because he is a member of the other House. As a result, the channels and communications required for accountability are being stretched.</p>
	<p pid="a.209.1/31">One case study that illustrates that lack of accountability was the decision to permit John Lewis to locate at Sprucefield along with 20 other retail units on the site. I am sure that my hon. Friend will wish to say something about that. The Minister made that decision fairly quickly when he took office and has explained his position by saying that the decision was &quot;a no-brainer&quot;. That major planning decision, which will have an impact on Lisburn town centre, on Belfast and on a number of other town centres was put through.</p>
	<p pid="a.209.1/32">Many people in Northern Ireland welcomed the fact that at least the Minister was prepared to make a decision, even though it was controversial and opposed by many. But one would have expected at least some explanation of why that decision was made, especially as, when the Minister was the Minister for Regeneration in the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister, he stated:</p>
	<p pid="a.209.1/33" class="indent">&quot;But allowing the market to do what it likes risks severe economic, environmental and social consequences&mdash;because investment will tend to gravitate to honey pot areas like affluent suburbia or the edge of towns. Having to burn a pint of petrol to buy a pint of milk . . . because retailers haven't chosen to locate in your area makes no sense whatsoever.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.209.1/34">What was the Minister's first decision when he reached Northern Ireland? He granted an application for one of the largest out-of-town shopping developments in the United Kingdom. It may well be that, when he crossed the water and changed Department, he changed his mind. That is fine, but an accountable planning system ought at least to have had a mechanism to explain that change of heart, especially when it was opposed by a wide range of interest groups. That did not happen. It goes against all the policies on urban densities, sustainable communities, public transport and social exclusion, yet we had no explanation from the Minister.</p>
	<p pid="a.209.1/35">I want to describe some of the things that could be done to improve the current situation. First, there must be an immediate publication of PPS5 and an agreement to update the other planning policy statements that are out of date and causing problems, including PPS2.</p>
	<p pid="a.209.1/36">Secondly, consultees must be put under pressure to respond much more quickly than they do at present, as they are one of the major reasons for planning applications being held back. Whether that is by means of a service level agreement, an indication that, if representations are not received within a certain period the application will be determined without them, or some other arrangement, should be a matter for debate. One set of consultees&mdash;those who are at least allowed some public accountability&mdash;should not be restricted in how long they can delay planning applications while statutory consultees are given carte blanche. That is what happens at present.</p>
	<p pid="a.209.1/37">Thirdly, in parts of England, planning applications have been speeded up by the establishment of business planning zones, where economic clusters are established and where decisions are made quickly on a basis of established planning principles which have been laid down. We should look at that in Northern Ireland, too. Fourthly, additional resources could be made available to the planning system if developers were given assurances that their applications would be fast-tracked if they provided additional resources to buy in some of the expertise that might be needed to do economic impact or environmental assessments, which the planning system does not have the resources to do at present. Some people would say that that compromises the planning system. However, if it were simply a case of developers handing over money to the divisional planning office or the Department for Regional Development to buy in the services, there would be no conflict of interest and it might speed things up. How often have I rung planners who say, &quot;We can't process this because the person who is meant to be dealing with it is working on another job&quot;? If additional resources could come from developers, why not? Many developers would be prepared to provide that, because a quick decision would be less costly than the delay that happens at present.</p>
	<p pid="a.209.1/38">Fifthly, the process of drawing up policies must be reviewed. The Belfast metropolitan area plan, which many people welcomed at the time, was subject to massive consultation&mdash;about four years of consultation. Then when the draft plan was drawn up, what did we get? We got 9,000 objections, which will go through a legal process. Either the consultation method is wrong or the legalistic nature of what happens after the draft plan is published is wrong. One thing is certain: we cannot go on with the present arrangements, which drag things on for ever.</p>
	<p pid="a.209.1/39">With certain safeguards, planning powers could be devolved to councils. I hope that that will happen under the review of public administration. Other hon. Members may want to comment on that.</p>
	<p pid="a.209.1/40">It is significant that until 2002 the Planning Service carried out customer satisfaction surveys. In 2002, it decided that it would aim for 80 per cent. of applicants being satisfied with the way in which their planning applications were determined; that was the target. The figure for the previous year was 64 per cent. The service sent questionnaires to 1,200 applicants. However, only 61 per cent. of respondents indicated that they were satisfied with the service. Rather than going up, the figure went down. The Planning Service promptly decided not to do any more surveys. That is one way of ensuring that there is no dissatisfaction, or at least that it is not expressed. It may indicate the uncertainty that the planners themselves feel about the way in which they deal with planning applications.</p>
	<p pid="a.209.1/41">I am sure that other hon. Members want to make contributions. I look forward to hearing them and the response from the Minister.</p>
