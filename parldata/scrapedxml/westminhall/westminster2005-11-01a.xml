<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-11-01a.187.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1841" speakername="Mark Fisher" colnum="187"  time="09:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051101/halltext/51101h01.htm#51101h01_spnew8">
	<p pid="a.187.1/1">I had noted that remark and, indeed, the Secretary of State's evidence to the Select Committee on <phrase class="date" code="2005-10-27">27 October</phrase>, in which she said that the matter was one for PCTs, and that they should proceed with the issue. She then gave her support to the drug. However what she said rather clouds the issue. It is no good saying that prescription for the drug is a matter for PCTs if they cannot afford it, and we cannot leave the issue of whether women die from the disease to the financial skills of PCT managers around the country. This is not really a local matter; it needs to be decided nationally and we need guidance and a lead from the Minister. She cannot hide behind the PCTs and say, &quot;It's over to you. You make the decisions and find the money.&quot; Most PCTs&mdash;or very many of them&mdash;are heavily in debt, and the women in those PCTs could be denied this drug simply because of those financial problems. This national problem should be dealt with nationally, and that applies as much to diagnosis as to prescription.</p>
	<p pid="a.187.1/2">Some very small PCTs do not have oncologists on the panels that make such decisions. A PCT in <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1834" name="Charlotte Atkins">the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Staffordshire, Moorlands (Charlotte Atkins)</phrase> had to decide a case last week, but felt that its panel did not have the necessary professional expertise. It had to defer its decision and look outside the panel for that expertise. That is not a problem for a PCT in a big city such as Leeds or Manchester, but it is a genuine problem across the country. We cannot leave this issue to the vagaries of, and disparities between, PCTs.</p>
	<p pid="a.187.1/3">This problem affects women all over the country, and regardless of where they live or of the financial circumstances of their PCTs, this issue should be decided on the basis of clinical need. PCTs in deficit are unlikely to feel that they can afford to prescribe the drug. They need not only guidance and a lead from the Secretary of State, but some help.</p>
	<p pid="a.187.1/4">I have mentioned two cases in my constituency, and there are others: a staff nurse is using her life savings because, as she said, she wants to live to see her daughter walk down the aisle. The husband of another sufferer has just lost his job, and she now wonders whether she will be able to remortgage her house to pay for the Herceptin that may keep her alive. She does not know whether she will get a remortgage, given that her husband is now out of work.</p>
	<p pid="a.187.1/5">I am very conscious that we should not decide these things on the emotional context. Nevertheless, we ought all to be aware of that context, and I am sure that we are. These matters are not simple but they concern people's lives and hopes, and we should therefore at least be aware of the emotional context, even if that is not the sole factor.</p>
	<p pid="a.187.1/6">What are the problems? Why is Herceptin not being prescribed? It is licensed for late-stage treatment, but giving it for late-stage breast cancer means that the patient has to be on the drug for the rest of her life, however long that is, and that is very expensive. Moreover, the drug will never cure them. Herceptin is not licensed for early-stage breast cancer, when 12 months' treatment is enough to decide whether the patient can be cured. As <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1546" name="Annette Brooke">the hon. Member for Mid-Dorset and North Poole (Annette Brooke)</phrase> suggested, not everybody is tested, so there are no national statistics. That inhibits the debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.187.1/7">Herceptin is not yet approved by the European Medicines Evaluation Agency and is not licensed by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence, which is the Minister's particular responsibility. We shall be very interested to hear what she has to say about that.</p>
	<p pid="a.187.1/8">Until recently, few primary care trusts would prescribe Herceptin; they were waiting for formal approval, as is understandable and correct. However, the drug is now prescribed widely, off-licence, in other countries such as France. Waiting for a drug as well proved and mature as Herceptin to be licensed is not as essential, I understand, as it might appear to the layperson.</p>

<gidredirect oldgid="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-11-01a.189.0" newgid="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-11-01b.189.0" matchtype="changes"/>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-11-01a.189.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1841" speakername="Mark Fisher" colnum="189"  time="09:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051101/halltext/51101h01.htm#51101h01_spnew10">
	<p pid="a.189.0/1">It is not for me to say; I suspect that the Minister will have a clear view on that. However, my hon. Friend makes a good point; given his medical and scientific expertise, I think that he will be listened to carefully.</p>
	<p pid="a.189.0/2">The drug is not yet approved by NICE. As a result, until quite recently, few PCTs were anxious to prescribe it; they wanted to wait and see. Roche has not yet applied for a licence. I spoke to people from Roche yesterday and I asked what the delay was. They said, &quot;Licence applications are very difficult. This one will probably have 3,000 pages of text and analysis. We have not finished it, but we hope to do so and apply for a licence in February. It should not take very long then.&quot; Nevertheless, Roche emphasised that we do not have to wait for the licence. Oncologists want to prescribe the drug and they feel safe about doing so. It is being prescribed in other countries, such as France and Canada. I do not think that that necessarily is a full explanation about why it is not being prescribed in this country.</p>
	<p pid="a.189.0/3">The drug is undoubtedly expensive; it costs &pound;21,000 for a years' treatment. However, the Secretary of State told the Select Committee on <phrase class="date" code="2005-10-27">27 October</phrase> that cost is not an issue. Perhaps it is not an issue for her&mdash;it is rather encouraging to hear that she believes that this should be paid for&mdash;but it is one for many PCTs that are millions of pounds in debt. It is not a satisfactory solution for the Secretary of State simply to say to PCTs that are &pound;10 million or &pound;15 million in debt, &quot;Cost is no problem, go on and do it.&quot; It is not satisfactory that women in those PCTs should be penalised for whatever the financial problems of those PCTs are.</p>
	<p pid="a.189.0/4">The drug has terrific cost benefits. If a diagnosis is made in the early stages of breast cancer, it can be cured and the direct saving of cost to the NHS is enormous. If, as now, it is prescribed only at a late stage, the cost of the treatment through Herceptin and the chemotherapy associated with it will be considerable for a number of years. It is in everybody's interest&mdash;the patient's, the PCT's, the Government's and the national health service's&mdash;that it is prescribed at an early stage, when it can save lives rather than simply prolong them.</p>
	<p pid="a.189.0/5">Those cost benefits do not take into account the indirect cost benefits to the state. If these women die, the costs of the people who are dependent on them&mdash;young children and dependent parents&mdash;will fall considerably on the state. The knock-on costs of not prescribing the drug at an early stage are considerable. As we do not know how many people in the country are suitable to have the drug, we cannot calculate those costs. That is yet another reason for getting on with the testing.</p>
	<p pid="a.189.0/6">Where are we with this issue? Women with money and access to the finances receive the drug. Women in Cornwall, Devon, Dorset and now Leeds are receiving it; I gather there was also a case in the Wyre valley last week. It is more widely available in the south of England than in the north. In the midlands, it is hardly available at all. Why is there yet another postcode lottery, when postcode lotteries in health have been so discredited and reviled? I cannot understand it, and it is not acceptable.</p>
	<p pid="a.189.0/7">I understand the difficult position that the Minister is in and the fact that she, as all Members of this House do, cares very much about the fate of these women. However, there are things that it is right that we ask her and the Government to do. First, we must make testing generally available now, so that we know how many people can be helped by this drug. Secondly, we must give clear guidance to the PCTs now. It is not enough simply to give encouragement to them. They need to know that the Government are behind them and will back them up financially. This is not a local decision and should not be left as such.</p>
	<p pid="a.189.0/8">Will the Minister take the issue back to the Secretary of State, so that she can reconsider her decision that this is a local decision? It is not a local decision. Discussions should be entered into with Roche. That &pound;21,000 might, in some ways, be a negotiable figure, particularly if the drug is widely prescribed and therefore the unit costs ought, logically, to come down&mdash;although once &pound;900 million has been invested, that will take some time. Also, amazingly, Roche's patent expires in 2011, so it does not have much time to recoup its costs. Nevertheless, with the Secretary of State's influence and strong position, it would be helpful if she entered into discussions with Roche.</p>
	<p pid="a.189.0/9">Finally, the Secretary of State really must enter into discussions with the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Treasury now. More money is going to be needed for this. In Government terms, it is not a huge sum of money, but it is more money than the primary care trusts can find. There has to be some additional funding from the Treasury to recognise the potential of this drug. Those are not unreasonable requests and they make good sense.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-11-01a.190.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1926" speakername="James Gray" colnum="190"  time="09:52:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051101/halltext/51101h01.htm#51101h01_spnew13">
	<p pid="a.190.2/1">May I first congratulate you, Mr. Bercow, on your elevation to the Speaker's Panel? However, seeing a member of one's own intake in your elevated position does age one a little. My congratulations are therefore a bit half-hearted in that sense. May I also congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1841" name="Mark Fisher">the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central (Mark Fisher)</phrase> on initiating this extremely important debate?</p>
	<p pid="a.190.2/2">I have a small personal interest to declare, albeit not a financial interest as far as I am aware at this stage. Right in the middle of the general election campaign, horrifyingly enough, my wife was diagnosed with breast cancer. I remember going to see the surgeon who said, &quot;Oh yes, I've arranged a date for surgery. It will be <phrase class="date" code="2005-05-05">5 May</phrase>.&quot; Sarah and I had to explain why that would not be appropriate. She is now in the middle of her chemotherapy.</p>
	<p pid="a.190.2/3">I understand that Herceptin is not suitable for women who are in the middle of chemotherapy. Therefore, I presume that it would not be suitable for Sarah. But the interesting point is that as far as I am aware&mdash;I have not checked her notes&mdash;she was not tested for HER2 and she certainly was not offered the opportunity of having Herceptin. Although it would not now be appropriate for her to have it, I would be interested to know whether it would have changed the course of her treatment, which is a tough business by any standards, as many here will know.</p>
	<p pid="a.190.2/4">I was very impressed when I attended the Breakthrough Breast Cancer lobby last Tuesday. What a well organised lobby it was. We are all subjected to all kinds of lobbies from all kinds of different interest groups. Breakthrough Breast Cancer organised a superb lobby and told us all precisely what to do. One thing it told us to do was to get in touch with our local primary care trust and discover whether Herceptin would be prescribed automatically and whether testing was done. Being an efficient bunny I did exactly that. I wrote to my PCT and I got the reply this morning. I wrote simply asking whether North Wiltshire and Kennet primary care trust would prescribe Herceptin.</p>
	<p pid="a.190.2/5">I spent six years at university so I pride myself in not being too dim, but I shall read out the reply carefully. It states:</p>
	<p pid="a.190.2/6" class="indent">&quot;We have funded the full drug uplift&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.190.2/7">whatever that might be&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.190.2/8" class="indent">&quot;which has been recommended nationally, in all major acute providers for 2005/2006. This means that Trusts are free to make clinical decisions about any new/high cost drugs without having to come back to the PCTs for financial approval.</p>
	<p pid="a.190.2/9" class="indent">The planning process for 2006/2007 is just starting and within that we will take full account of emerging national guidance on the prescribing of Herceptin.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.190.2/10">I have read that about six times and the meaning is just dimly beginning to come through to me. At the moment, the Government say that hospitals can make up their own minds on the subject&mdash;the PCT does not have to decide&mdash;but that they will none the less take full account of emerging national guidance over the next few months. Frankly, if I sent that letter to a constituent, particularly one who had recently been diagnosed with breast cancer, and said, &quot;Here is what the local NHS has to say on Herceptin&quot;, it would make the situation a great deal worse than it is at the moment.</p>
	<p pid="a.190.2/11">One thing that we must do&mdash;perhaps it will be an outcome of the debate&mdash;is to clarify to the many thousands of women being diagnosed year by year with breast cancer what Herceptin is for and whether they will be automatically tested for it. The question of testing is extremely important. I think that only 35 per cent. of PCTs test for HER2. Such testing should be universal. Will women be tested for it; will they be suitable for Herceptin? If they are suitable, will their local PCT or the local hospital deal with the issue?</p>
	<p pid="a.190.2/12">Frankly, the architecture of the health service is an academic matter. It may interest the Minister and others in this Room, but my constituents who have been diagnosed today with breast cancer do not care whether it is the PCT, the Avon, Gloucestershire and Wiltshire strategic health authority, the national health service in London or the Bath Royal United hospital that deals with the issue. My constituents want to know whether Herceptin will work for them and whether Her Majesty's Government, or the national health service, will pay for it. Those are the important things. Sending out confusing letters is not helpful. Some of the language that we have heard is exactly what the national health service should not be using. It is national; it is the health service. Her Majesty's Government are responsible for it because it uses taxpayers' money. We want to know from the Government whether they will make automatic testing for Herceptin available and whether the drug will be available more generally than it is at the moment.</p>
	<p pid="a.190.2/13">Incidentally, I accept <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1744" name="Ian Gibson">the point made by the hon. Member for Norwich, North (Dr. Gibson)</phrase>. He is absolutely right to say that many more breakthrough drugs for all kinds of cancer will come along in the next few years as science develops rapidly, so getting the protocol right for this breakthrough drug now is desperately important for the future.</p>
	<p pid="a.190.2/14">Many other hon. Members want to take part in this very important debate, so I shall conclude with a relevant issue that is a particular hobby-horse of mine. We welcome the establishment of NICE. It is perfectly reasonable and sensible that there should be a Government organisation set up to examine the efficaciousness of drugs. Some drugs work for some people and some drugs do not. It is absolutely right that the Government should examine which are which. However, the word that we do not like in the task given to NICE is &quot;cost-effective&quot;. NICE should determine whether drugs are effective&mdash;whether they work. NICE should determine whether Herceptin would have been appropriate in my wife's case. That should be a clear and straightforward matter. It should then say to the Government and to the national health service whether the drug is good, bad or indifferent.</p>
	<p pid="a.190.2/15">Of course, the situation may be much more complicated than that. NICE might say that the drug is good in some cases, but not in others. However, it should not have to say, &quot;This is a good drug. It works, but we are not certain that the Government can afford it.&quot; The affordability of drugs should be a matter for the Government&mdash;for politicians. It should be up to the Minister of State, Department of Health, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1690" name="Jane Kennedy">the right hon. Member for Liverpool, Wavertree (Jane Kennedy)</phrase>, to stand up this morning and say&mdash;this may well not be the case&mdash;&quot;NICE has said that this is a brilliant drug. It works. However, I am awfully sorry but my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer has said that he is spending the money this year on schools, so the money will not be available for Herceptin.&quot; That would be a perfectly legitimate political decision to take&mdash;a tough decision, but perfectly legitimate. To shuffle off the decision about whether the drug is cost-effective to an anonymous organisation called NICE, which few people know, seems to me to be less acceptable. The Government should come to a conclusion as to whether the drug is cost-effective as well as effective; that should not be left to NICE.</p>
	<p pid="a.190.2/16">We need greater clarity. My local PCT, like many others, is massively in debt&mdash;to the tune of millions of pounds. Is the decision up to the PCT? In that case, I fear that the nice people who run my local PCT will have to say, &quot;Well, I'm awfully sorry, but I'm going to be faced with a choice between closing two or three community hospitals&quot;&mdash;there is a debate in this Chamber tomorrow on community hospitals&mdash;&quot;and making Herceptin available.&quot; That should not be a decision that it takes. It should not be a decision that the Bath Royal United hospital takes, because it is deeply in debt. That decision should be taken by the NHS; it is a national health service, and if this drug works, it must be available to all.</p>
	<p pid="a.190.2/17">I hope that the Minister echoes some of the remarks that the Secretary of State made at the Breakthrough Breast Cancer lobby meeting last Tuesday. She made encouraging comments on this matter at that meeting. The Government agree with me about what is the right direction, so I do not want to press them unduly. However, I hope that the Minister will acknowledge that the drug works, that testing is essential and should be universal rather than done on a postcode basis, and that it should be the Government who decide whether it is affordable. If it is, I would also like her to explain the mechanism by which it will be paid for.</p>
	<p pid="a.190.2/18">I congratulate the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central on asking the right questions so well. He is right: we need to know from the Government today&mdash;as do the tens of millions of women throughout Britain who have a keen personal interest in this subject&mdash;whether the drug will be made available, on what basis it will be made available and who will pay for it.</p>

	<p pid="a.193.0/1">May I start by saying what a pleasure it is to debate this subject under your chairmanship, Mr. Bercow? If, as a result of t<phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1841" name="Mark Fisher">his debate secured by my hon. Friend the Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central (Mark Fisher)</phrase>, we end up with a Government position that allows us to deal with Herceptin within the NICE bureaucracy so that we have a way forward on this issue, we will have performed a good service.</p>
	<p pid="a.193.0/2">I congratulate my hon. Friend. We and other Members of Parliament from north Staffordshire met our constituents in the summer, and it is clear that we are totally behind them in their campaign, from north Staffordshire, to make Herceptin available throughout the country. I hope that this debate will lead to a better engagement with the Secretary of State and Ministers. There are still many unanswered questions and issues that urgently need to be resolved.</p>
	<p pid="a.193.0/3">Over the weekend, there was much press speculation and discussion about a conference in Birmingham that was attended by more than 1,000 people. As I tuned into various media shows, I heard how much the Government wanted to listen to people&mdash;wanted to listen to those 1,000 people about the way forward for the health service. I say to my right hon. Friend the Minister that 37,000 people in north Staffordshire have signed a petition; they simply want the Government and the Secretary of State to listen to what they are saying about Herceptin.</p>
	<p pid="a.193.0/4">It is important to set out, as the contribution of my hon. Friend the Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central did, the real issues that we are dealing with. We are dealing with the long term and the short term in respect of the way in which the NHS is able to provide care across the country.</p>
	<p pid="a.193.0/5">I have followed this matter carefully since we first had meetings with our constituents in the early summer months, and I think that the Government have made a lot of progress, and I commend them on that. In particular, it is good that the Government have now said that there will be testing throughout the country. I assume that that means that they have conceded that it is almost certain that NICE will approve the licensing once the drug has gone through its submission from Roche to the European licensing structure and then on to NICE. As we are to have national testing, I also assume that the necessary machinery will be put in place, and that finance will subsequently be put in place, and that guidance will follow in order to ensure that anyone diagnosed now will have that testing.</p>
	<p pid="a.193.0/6">Those bureaucratic hurdles must be overcome, and other hurdles that are not bureaucratic must also be overcome. I genuinely believe that we need to have a proper licensing structure. I assume that when they have been overcome and everything is in place, there will not be any problem in the long term with people being able to access Herceptin as a NICE treatment, as the Government are starting to put those particular bits of the machinery in place. I welcome the decision about testing.</p>
	<p pid="a.193.0/7">I also welcome the statement that the Health Minister in the other place made on <phrase class="date" code="2005-10-19">19 October</phrase>. He said that a review of how the NHS pays for expensive treatments and expensive drugs would be undertaken. I gather that that review will be completed in December. I hope that the debate on the non-availability of Herceptin will be able to contribute to that review.</p>
	<p pid="a.193.0/8">When I raised the issue at Prime Minister's questions almost a fortnight ago, I felt that I received a sympathetic response from the Prime Minister. He acknowledged that NICE's drug-approval system is not working quickly enough, not only in approving <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1744" name="Ian Gibson">Herceptin but, as my hon. Friend the Member for Norwich, North (Dr. Gibson)</phrase> pointed out, the other new cancer treatments that are about to be introduced as a result of technological advances. The Prime Minister's response suggested that we must do more, more speedily; however, we must to do it effectively, too.</p>
	<p pid="a.193.0/9">In response to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1677" name="David Taylor">the intervention from my hon. Friend the Member for North-West Leicestershire (David Taylor)</phrase>, there is no way that we want to be in a situation in which we say that drugs that will cause other serious medical illnesses should be prescribed. I accept that the Government are looking to do more, which I welcome and on which I congratulate them.</p>
	<p pid="a.193.0/10">When it comes to the short-time issue, however, I feel angry. The Government are almost hiding behind bureaucracy and the machinery that is in place. As my hon. Friend the Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central pointed out, we have a system whereby tests have been ongoing for five years with the manufacturers Roche. We now know that 50 per cent. of the women who have tested for HER2 positive status could benefit, and they are now having that treatment. A huge sense of injustice and unfairness is building because treatment is being considered on a case-by-case basis. I could understand that if case by case meant that the consultant clinician said, &quot;You have tested positive for HER2; therefore Herceptin can make a real difference to your treatment. The primary care trusts will decide whether to agree that treatment in exceptional cases.&quot; However, each primary care trust has to reinvent the wheel while NICE assesses whether to approve the treatment. That cannot be right. Why, for example, should the North Stoke primary care trust have to fund research into whether the outcome of the New England review will be as cost-effective as we have been led to believe in order for it to be able to prescribe Herceptin subject to conditions?</p>
	<p pid="a.193.0/11">We have NICE, yet every primary care trust in the country is seeking to establish that it will prescribe the drug cost-effectively for the small group of women who are now known to be HER2 positive and who need the treatment now. Those women cannot wait to be treated, yet the NHS is denying them the treatment because the Government are hiding behind NICE.</p>
	<p pid="a.193.0/12">Following meetings that I&mdash;along with colleagues in north Staffordshire&mdash;have had with the women who are waiting to be treated, I have asked for a meeting with the Secretary of State, although I have not yet been given one. I hope that when the Minister responds, she will look carefully at agreeing to a meeting with the north Staffordshire MPs to see how we can deal with the situation in the interim.</p>
	<p pid="a.193.0/13">It is too late for some women in north Staffordshire to be tested. Had they been involved in the tests, they would have had Herceptin. Had they been in the control group, they would still have had access to Herceptin. However, their cancer is at too early a stage for NICE. About 1,000 women are affected by that. That is where the nub of the debate lies: what do we do about those 1,000 women around the country, of whom there are about 14 affected in north Staffordshire? Budgets have been set for this year that have been unable to account for unanticipated expenditure should treatment be agreed on a case-by-case basis. The money is not there because the primary care trusts are so much in deficit. The Government must deal with that issue, but they have not done so. They have put all the long-term measures in place, but they have not faced the reality that about 1,000 women known to be HER2 positive will simply not get the treatment because the primary care trusts cannot agree it. That is a question of money. It is important in the long term that this discussion should open a wider debate on NHS funding. We talk about taxes, but I do not think that we should be in the position where we say that we will pay less tax. Everyone whom I meet says, &quot;Joan, we want these women to get this treatment if they need it, and if it has been recommended.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.193.0/14">We must hold the debate on how we fund the NHS and ensure the availability of stunning treatments such as Herceptin, which is 50 per cent. effective in cases for which it is available. For that reason, I support my hon. Friend the Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central. I ask the Minister to hold a meeting with north Staffordshire MPs. Our primary care trust is asking whether the Government will give them a bridging loan, as this is a matter of short-term finance between now and the next financial year.</p>

	<p pid="a.203.2/1">May I add my congratulations to you, Mr. Bercow, on your elevation to the Speaker's Panel?</p>
	<p pid="a.203.2/2">I shall start by congratulating <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1841" name="Mark Fisher">the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central (Mark Fisher)</phrase> on securing this timely debate, and other hon. Members on their heartfelt contributions. We all have families in our constituencies to whom this issue matters a great deal. The debate has raised a number of serious questions that the Government need to answer.</p>
	<p pid="a.203.2/3">It has long been apparent that the postcode lottery in cancer health care is not a scare story put about by the media, but a reality that must be addressed. Last year, the cancer tsar, Mike Richards, confirmed that fact by denouncing the unacceptably high variations in cancer treatments. A survey by CancerBACUP published in 2003 measured the extent to which a postcode lottery existed for the drug Herceptin, despite the drug's undoubted merits and efficacy. Some 61 per cent. of women in the south-west had access to the drug, compared to a shameful 14 per cent. in the midlands. Those figures were updated recently by a study cited in <i>Clinical Oncology</i>, which last year confirmed the extent of the postcode lottery when it came to Herceptin. It showed that 16 per cent. of eligible women in Essex were prescribed the drug, compared with some 90 per cent. in Dorset.</p>
	<p pid="a.203.2/4">Why does that postcode lottery exist? Part of the reason is that although primary care trusts no doubt want to prescribe Herceptin and many other drugs, they are unable to do so because of the financial deficits that many of them now face. That issue has been raised time and time again by hon. Members in debates such as this. The situation seems to be getting worse rather than better. We in the Opposition contend that the Government's 300-plus targets have spawned a massive bureaucracy, which has soaked up a lot of the new money that has undoubtedly been put into the NHS. That bureaucracy has prevented a lot of that new money reaching front-line services, including drug delivery.</p>
	<p pid="a.203.2/5">International comparisons are revealing. In the cancer plan 2000, it was claimed that, by 2010, the UK's survival rates in relation to cancer mortality would be comparable with the best in Europe. However, the truth is that the UK remains in the bottom third of the European cancer mortality league table. If the UK matched the European leaders in respect of cancer mortality, as many as 23,000 to 25,000 lives could be saved.</p>
	<p pid="a.203.2/6">A key reason for our poor survival rates is that Britain lags considerably behind many of our European neighbours when it comes to the uptake of new medicines for the benefit of cancer patients. A very interesting and recent report by the Karolinska institute and the Stockholm school of economics found that, despite the proven benefits of new treatment options, patients across Europe did not have equal access to new drugs. Of the 19 countries surveyed representing something like three quarters of the population of Europe, the UK lagged well behind, in good part because of financial considerations and pressures.</p>
	<p pid="a.203.2/7">The postcode lottery in Herceptin also exists because of the Government's ambivalence to NICE. NICE should have a crucial role to play in appraising drugs for the benefit of patients, with the minimum of delay. It should be at centre stage in the Government's efforts to allow patients to benefit from the latest technology, treatment and drugs. However, the Government have recently cut NICE funding by &pound;3 million, forcing it to scrap one of its appraisal committees. Does the Minister not agree with me&mdash;and with CancerBACUP&mdash;that it is unacceptable, with all the extra billions being put into the NHS at the moment, that 23 vital cancer treatments have been subject to long delays before being made available to the NHS? In September, NICE submitted its recommendations for reform of its procedures. Will the Minister publish those recommendations and set a timetable for the Government's response in order to try to eradicate the postcode lottery?</p>
	<p pid="a.203.2/8">It is equally unacceptable that NICE, which was set up to stamp out postcode lottery inequalities and to ensure that patients have rapid access to the best available treatments, is having its guidance ignored by NHS bodies because of financial pressures. How are the Government going to address that issue?</p>
	<p pid="a.203.2/9">The Opposition have consistently called for NICE to be given the support that it needs to achieve, primarily, two objectives. The first is that appraisals for new drugs are, where possible, considered with their original licence applications, so that the unacceptable delay between drugs being licensed and being approved by NICE are removed from the system. I welcome the Government's consideration of that. The second objective is that resource implementation assessments&mdash;the issue of NICE's funding has been raised by several hon. Members&mdash;are conducted alongside NICE appraisals to ensure that NHS bodies implement NICE guidance with the necessary resources.</p>
	<p pid="a.203.2/10">A third strand of our thinking is that it is wrong that although appraisals have statutory backing, NICE guidelines do not. NICE would be at centre stage in our proposals for the NHS, and guidelines would be given statutory force. The targets now set by politicians would be replaced with standards set by medical professionals through NICE. That would ensure that money soaked up by bureaucracy because targets need measuring would be released for the benefit of cancer patients and of drug delivery.</p>
	<p pid="a.203.2/11">The question of the availability of Herceptin for early-stage breast cancer crystallises a number of issues. The Secretary of State's announcement in the summer about the decision to fast-track NICE's appraisal of Herceptin is to be welcomed, but it is still likely to be many months before Herceptin is widely available for women with early-stage breast cancer. Many women who have already been diagnosed with breast cancer simply do not have time to wait until the licence and approval processes are completed next year. They need Herceptin now. According to Breakthrough Breast Cancer, experts estimate that about 1,000 lives could be saved every year if Herceptin were available to treat early-stage breast cancer. It is possible for women to be prescribed Herceptin prior to its licensing if their PCT agrees to fund it and the patient's doctor retains clinical responsibility.</p>
	<p pid="a.203.2/12">As we have heard, on <phrase class="date" code="2005-10-25">25 October</phrase> the Secretary of State stated&mdash;perhaps because of the Barbara Clark case&mdash;that PCTs should not refuse Herceptin solely on the ground of its cost. Two days later, she seemed to go further by suggesting that all PCTs will be directly informed that they are now required to fund and prescribe Herceptin to treat early-stage breast cancer when there is a clinical need to do so. The Secretary of State's intervention is all-important, yet, as we have heard from many hon. Members, it is causing confusion. Will the Minister clarify the situation? Is the Secretary of State obliging PCTs to fund Herceptin when it is prescribed even if that means diverting resources that are already intended for other services? If so, what assessment has been made of the services that will suffer as a result of finances being redirected to achieve that directive?</p>
	<p pid="a.203.2/13">Will the Minister tell us how many trusts are in a financial position to take up the Secretary of State's instructions? She must be aware that many PCTs have financial deficits. A British Medical Association survey suggests that three out of four PCTs face deficits. As the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central said, the Secretary of State cannot hide behind PCTs on this issue. She seems to be placing obligations on PCTs without providing the resources to enable them to meet them. Does the Minister agree that the Secretary of State's comments are an admission that the licensing and appraisal processes are taking far too long? What is the point of NICE if the Secretary of State is just going to bypass it?</p>
	<p pid="a.203.2/14">Those questions need to be answered because the Secretary of State's intervention has caused confusion. If it is a directive, many PCTs cannot afford it, while the treatment may not be prescribed because it is unlicensed and NICE seems to be left on the sidelines. If, on the other hand, the comments did not amount to an instruction, what were they meant to achieve? The uncharitable view might be that the Secretary of State was simply responding to media pressure, as PCTs already know they are free to fund the drug.</p>
	<p pid="a.203.2/15">There has been no shortage of evidence from respected charities in the country, well known bodies and think tanks internationally, and from hon. Members in this debate, that a postcode lottery in cancer drugs exists. The Government are to blame because they have failed to reform the way in which NICE operates and have created a situation in which PCTs are unable to implement its guidance in many areas because of financial pressures. I hope for the sake of the many women who are anxiously waiting for Herceptin to be made available to them that the Minister directly responds to the questions other hon. Members and I have asked today.</p>

	<p pid="a.206.2/1">I absolutely accept the point that my hon. Friend makes and I will come to that, if he will allow me.</p>
	<p pid="a.206.2/2"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1842" name="Joan Walley">My hon. Friend the Member for Stoke-on-Trent, North (Joan Walley)</phrase> said that she felt that some people may have missed the opportunity to be tested. I reassure her that people can have the test at any time. The tumour sample is kept and can be tested. However, I acknowledge that the problem is the point at which the treatment begins after the testing.</p>
	<p pid="a.206.2/3">It is important that we take care not to give the impression that the drug is suitable for all or even most women with breast cancer. It is also linked to serious cardiac problems, and I know that that was acknowledged by other contributors to the debate. Nevertheless, as has been repeatedly said, the early evidence of effectiveness in women who do fit the category is very strong. That is why we acted in response to that evidence.</p>
	<p pid="a.206.2/4">To ensure that we can identify all the women who can benefit from treatment, we have asked professor Professor Mike Richards, the national clinical director for cancer, to ensure that HER2 testing is available across the NHS as soon as possible. He has already met with the directors of the 34 cancer networks and that move has been enthusiastically welcomed by them. The manufacturers of Herceptin have not yet applied for a licence&mdash;that point, too, was made. The Government play no part in the licensing process&mdash;we cannot intervene&mdash;but we have urged the manufacturer to apply for a licence as quickly as possible. However, I appreciate that the company is taking time to ensure that it gets the details of the licence application right.</p>
	<p pid="a.206.2/5">A number of hon. Members, including <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1744" name="Ian Gibson">my hon. Friend the Member for Norwich, North (Dr. Gibson)</phrase>, who has left the Chamber, asked why we are bothering with licensing or the NICE process. I urge hon. Members to bear in mind that the number of people with early breast cancer is much larger than those with late-stage cancer, and that the side effects are potentially much more serious when compared to the likely outcome.</p>
	<p pid="a.206.2/6">That question will be addressed by the licensing process, not the NICE process. However, NICE will consider a complex range of factors, including cost-effectiveness, which is an important consideration when introducing an expensive new treatment. I strongly support the NICE process. I hope within a few days to be able to go into detail about the work that we are doing with NICE. I am considering proposals for a faster technology appraisal process for important new drugs, not only for Herceptin, so that NICE can offer the NHS guidance on their clinical worth and their cost-effectiveness closer to the time of licensing. I am grateful to NICE for that important work.</p>
	<p pid="a.206.2/7">The Secretary of State has asked NICE to begin its appraisal of the use of Herceptin for early-stage breast cancer as soon as possible; indeed, that process has begun. As a result, the appraisal of the treatment will run concurrently with the licensing process. If the licence is granted, NICE guidelines can be issued shortly afterwards.</p>
	<p pid="a.206.2/8">We now come to the nub of the matter. A number of women being treated for early breast cancer could benefit from Herceptin. I accept that. The Minister of State, Department of Health, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1544" name="Rosie Winterton">my hon. Friend the Member for Doncaster, Central (Ms Winterton)</phrase>, met representatives of the women fighting for Herceptin on <phrase class="date" code="2005-09-22">22 September</phrase>. My hon. Friend and I are in close touch, and we will be communicating by way of a NHS circular exactly how we expect PCTs to respond to patients whose clinicians believe that they would benefit from Herceptin.</p>
	<p pid="a.206.2/9">It has been said many times that the Secretary of State has announced that PCTs should not refuse to fund Herceptin on cost grounds alone. What does that mean? It means that there has to be a medical reason for the medicine not being prescribed. That reason ought to be communicated to the patient and her clinician.</p>

	<p pid="a.209.1/1">I am grateful for the opportunity to debate an issue that is of increasing importance in Northern Ireland. I am grateful, too, that the Minister is in attendance this morning. I know that I have dragged her away from the fair shores of Northern Ireland, which she left yesterday. She is rushing back again, so keen is she on the place, but she has come to respond to the debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.209.1/2">All public representatives are finding that levels of satisfaction with the Northern Ireland Planning Service are falling. That dissatisfaction is experienced not just by those who make applications, but by objectors to applications and those who simply have an interest in the planning system. The two greatest concerns are delays in the planning process and lack of accountability. Those two problems go hand in hand. The lack of accountability has resulted in a lack of urgency in the planning process and a lack of response to the increasing criticisms of the process.</p>
	<p pid="a.209.1/3">I want to deal first with delays. Delays occur in the processing of planning applications, in the production of policies and in the bringing forward of area plans. The Planning Service suffers from more delays than British Rail on a bad day&mdash;and it probably comes up with as many excuses, too. Those bringing forward major developments now build in a minimum of two years for planning permission, and most housing association schemes take up to one year for the planning application process to be completed.</p>
	<p pid="a.209.1/4">As to what some stakeholders and players in the system have said about the planning system in Northern Ireland, Tesco described it as &quot;wading through treacle&quot;. Banks now put planning risk as a major financing risk to any scheme&mdash;significantly, it now ranks above political instability. One of the large private developers in Northern Ireland, CUSP, claims that the planning process is extremely slow, to the extent that development opportunities are being put at risk or missed altogether. In a recent report, Investment Belfast estimated that in excess of &pound;1 billion of property investment has been lost to Northern Ireland. It has flowed into Great Britain, instead. That is equal to about 15,000 full-time construction jobs. The Northern Ireland Independent Retail Trade Association described the system as a farce and a shambles, and William Ewart Properties Ltd recently invested in three GB-based shopping centres because of the uncertainty and difficulties in getting planning permission in Northern Ireland.</p>
	<p pid="a.209.1/5">That all comes at a time when, rightly, the Government are seeking to wean Northern Ireland from dependence on the public sector, yet the opportunity to create jobs in the private sector is being held up by major impediments in the planning process. It is clear from the examples that I have given that economic development and job promotion are being held up, and that the planning process is responsible for a shortfall in economic growth in Northern Ireland.</p>
	<p pid="a.209.1/6">Delays in the planning system are not just manifested in the slowness of the divisional planning offices in assessing and processing planning applications. There is another major delay in bringing forward policies and area plans. That creates greater uncertainty, because planning then takes place in a vacuum. Those who are objecting do not know the status of certain areas and those applying do not know the ground rules.</p>
	<p pid="a.209.1/7">The Belfast metropolitan area plan, which covers two areas in my constituency of East Antrim&mdash;Newtownabbey and Carrickfergus&mdash;was meant to replace the Belfast urban area plan, which is in itself 10 years out of date. The Belfast metropolitan area plan has been five years in the making. The draft was finally published at the end of 2004. It is now going to be subject to a public inquiry, and it could be 2009 before it is adopted. We could have 14 years of no formal plan for the Greater Belfast area.</p>
	<p pid="a.209.1/8">That turgid document&mdash;that is all one can describe it as, because it lacks vision&mdash;and its technical support stand 3 ft high. I am not so sure that it is a useful document for anyone who applies. Indeed, a document that is as prescriptive as that one in itself creates difficulties, which is one of the problems with the way in which area plans are drawn up.</p>
	<p pid="a.209.1/9">The damage that tardiness in advancing planning policies can do could not be illustrated better than by the disgraceful way in which successive Ministers have handled the review of planning policy statement 5, which deals with retail planning policy in Northern Ireland. The guidelines have now been under review for five years. That review was greatly needed because, after several judicial reviews and other legal challenges, PPS5, which was meant to protect town centres, was so watered down that it was almost meaningless and certainly did not protect town centres.</p>
	<p pid="a.209.1/10">The work started in autumn 2000. The original research was carried out by Roger Tym and Partners, who were the authors of the successful policy that limited superstore development in the Republic to 30,000 sq ft. The report, which was published in February 2003, indicated that the Northern Ireland food market was reaching saturation point, with growth down from 1.28 per cent. to less than half that figure. Obviously, that did not suit some people in the Department, because at that stage there was an influx of major food retailers such as Tesco, Sainsbury's and Asda into Northern Ireland.</p>
	<p pid="a.209.1/11">There was therefore a delay in submitting the document for public consultation. It was available in September 2004 and was to go out to consultation in November 2004. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1906" name="John Spellar">The then Minister, the right hon. Member for Warley (Mr. Spellar)</phrase>, decided that there would be a further delay while he consulted another Department. It was promised that the consultation would start in February 2005, but we then had an election, so it was delayed for that. Since the election, however, there has still been no sign of it. The document was delayed, but it now seems to have fallen off the radar completely.</p>
	<p pid="a.209.1/12">The planning vacuum that has occurred as a result has created dangers for many provincial towns. Let me give one example. Enniskillen, a town in the west of the Province, with 17,000 people, currently has four applications for food superstores. I know that they will not all be granted, but if they were, there would be another 7 sq ft of retail shopping for every man, woman and child in the whole of County Fermanagh. That creates uncertainty for investment in Fermanagh, but it also creates frustration for those who have applied, because there is no clear policy on which of the schemes are most likely to be successful.</p>
	<p pid="a.209.1/13">Some people argue for a moratorium on the processing of applications until the new PPS5 is in place. I do not support that call, because I believe that it would only prolong the uncertainty about investment in town centres and would stymie some schemes that would benefit the economy of some provincial towns. Rather than having a moratorium, the obvious answer is simply to produce the policy, to put it out to public consultation, to get it adopted, to start applying it and to inject some certainty into the planning regime.</p>
	<p pid="a.209.1/14">I believe that other planning documents require revision, but one that concerns me in particular is PPS2, which deals with planning, nature conservation and the protection of natural habitats. It is quite clear that the statement is not up to date and is not strong enough. In my constituency of East Antrim, I have seen builders deliberately tear out old field hedges and take down copses, even when those have been marked on maps as features that must be preserved. There seems to be little or no protection. In large housing developments, much of the landscaping that is required as a result of the quality development requirements is unimaginative. It often resembles the landscaping that we would expect from a garden makeover, rather than integrating naturally into the environment.</p>
	<p pid="a.209.1/15">The Woodland Trust has estimated that about 40 hectares of native trees need to be planted in the Larne area to meet the standards in &quot;Space for People&quot;. Rather than allowing the unimaginative landscape schemes that are accepted at present, we should make provision to create quality open space by planting woodland, particularly on large housing developments, which can tolerate planting because of their scale. That would also go a long way towards meeting the demand in &quot;Space for People&quot; for woodland access within two miles of where people live.</p>
	<p pid="a.209.1/16">There are many creative ideas from developers and groups such as the Woodland Trust, and those should be considered in the review of PPS2. It is significant that the members of the working group that was set up in May 2004 have not been called together since. That is another example of the lack of urgency in reviewing policies.</p>
	<p pid="a.209.1/17">The problem seems to be that the planning system finds it difficult to cope with the current volume of planning applications, to the point that those people who would be involved in drawing up policy are now allocated to development control. That means that policy development has been all but forgotten.</p>
	<p pid="a.209.1/18">What has caused this problem of delay? Why is the planning system grinding to a halt in that way? The planners blame everyone but themselves, and the excuses that have come from the planning system mimic those that we got from British Rail for the delays to trains. The latest culprit to be identified is councils. We are told they are responsible for the delay, that they defer applications, that they send them to the management board and that they are irresponsible. Under &quot;Modernising Planning&quot;, therefore, councils will be limited to one deferral of a planning application, regardless of the reason for that deferral.</p>
	<p pid="a.209.1/19">I know that some councils are irresponsible and defer a planning application when they do not know what to do with it; they send it to the management board to pretend that they are doing something. I was the chairman of the Belfast city council planning committee for many years, and we would have sent an application to the management board as a last resort. We had a self-denying ordinance that, where the council did not show that it was delaying or deferring an application for good reasons, the committee would take the application out of its hands and push it through the system. However, such councils will be punished, because the planning system wants to find a scapegoat. That will not speed up the planning process, because most of the planning applications about which people complain come to councils only a year and a half after they were first made.</p>
	<p pid="a.209.1/20">The other reason that there has been a delay is that no such restrictions are placed on statutory consultees such as the Roads Service, the Environment and Heritage Service, the Water Service and the landscape division of the Department of the Environment, which can, and often do, delay a process for as long as they want. To save time, I shall give hon. Members just one example, involving a planning application by one of my constituents, who lives beside Belfast lough. I do not know whether this has anything do with the debate, but I got a call from the Environment and Heritage Service yesterday, saying that, after two years, it had finally sorted the matter out. I hope that that illustrates the power of Parliament, but I shall wait to see. If I have planning difficulties in future, however, I might apply for another debate; that might be the way to get things done.</p>
	<p pid="a.209.1/21">The building of Carrick marina changed wave patterns, and the sea wall that bordered my constituent's property was starting to wash away. Every week, he was paying builders to shore it up to stop it and his garden being washed into the lough. He needed to build some armouring, which would have extended 4 ft on to the beach and run 100 yd along it.</p>
	<p pid="a.209.1/22">One of the consultees, the Environment and Heritage Service, rightly took an interest in the matter, because Belfast lough is a special protection area. Over two years, however, the service asked him to do survey after survey. First, he was asked to do a survey of the ducks and seagulls&mdash;a bird survey. When that was done, he was asked to do a seal survey. It then asked him to do a worm survey&mdash;the service called it a benthic invertebrate survey, but I think that means worms. After that, he had to do a model of coastal dynamics to show the macro-effects of the development on the whole north shore of the lough&mdash;the whole north shore of the lough stretches for about 15 miles, and he was going to do some work on 100 yards. He was then told that he was going to have to do a bird-nesting survey. I think that the only survey they did not ask him to do was on the impact on global warning&mdash;and had it not been for this debate, he may have been asked to do that.</p>
	<p pid="a.209.1/23">My constituent spent more than &pound;9,000 on those surveys. He was happy to do so, if that was what was required. However, if the Environment and Heritage Service knew at the start that those were the areas it was concerned about, why did it not ask for surveys on them to be done all at once? Why did it ask for one after another over two years? During that time, he was spending money shoring up the wall. The irony is that, had the sea wall come down and the garden been washed on to the beach, it would not have impinged on to 4 ft of beach; it would have washed across a much larger area.</p>
	<p pid="a.209.1/24">I will not bore hon. Members by giving further illustrations; I am sure that they could give many similar illustrations. However, I could provide further illustrations on the Roads Service, the Water Service, and the landscape division of the Department of the Environment. There does not seem to be any curtailment on how long consultees can hold the process up.</p>
	<p pid="a.209.1/25">Another explanation that has been given is that the number of applications received by the Planning Service has jumped greatly, and that is true. However, that is also true for councils, which have to deal with the building control aspects of any planning application. The odd thing is that, during the period of the increase in planning applications, councils' building control departments have reduced their waiting lists and times, whereas the length of time it takes the planning system to deal with planning applications has increased dramatically.</p>
	<p pid="a.209.1/26">The Minister authorised the employment of 120 new planners&mdash;she can correct that figure if it is wrong&mdash;to supplement those already employed, and to move people off area plan teams and policy making in order to try to deal with the backlog, yet the problem has still not been dealt with. One of the reasons for that is that, although additional planning staff have been introduced, the bureaucracy of the planning system has not been dealt with. It grinds slowly and frustrates the public and their representatives.</p>
	<p pid="a.209.1/27">One of the major sources of delay in recent times has been the practice of sending planning applications back as invalid. I do not know if architects are getting worse, or if, as a result of ageing, they are becoming senile, but I cannot understand why that is happening. Architects' applications used seldom to be declared invalid, but now there is suddenly a big jump in the number of invalid applications. That has added delay to the process.</p>
	<p pid="a.209.1/28">I dealt with one such application in my constituency. A group that had got temporary permission simply photocopied and sent in the same application as the previous year&mdash;an application that had been processed and given permission&mdash;and it was sent back to them as invalid. I could not find out what the reason for that was, and neither could any members of the group. Once I started making inquiries, it was determined that perhaps it was valid.</p>
	<p pid="a.209.1/29">One architect who knew about this debate sent me a letter on five applications he had submitted. All of them were initially returned as invalid, but were subsequently passed after a period&mdash;one after a year&mdash;without any amendment to the documentation or plans. That is another issue that the planners need to address.</p>
	<p pid="a.209.1/30">The second problem is one of accountability. I will deal with only one aspect of that, because I know that I will probably have a disagreement with <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1666" name="Jeffrey M Donaldson">my hon. Friend the Member for Lagan Valley (Mr. Donaldson)</phrase>, who is sitting beside me. Planners have decided that they will consult councils even less than they did in the past. In Northern Ireland, councils are only consultees. They are not the final authority on planning decisions. It rests with the civil servants. So there is a lack of accountability already. We have no chance to question the Minister who makes the decisions directly, although I am sure that the Minister who is here this morning will do an excellent job in responding, because he is a member of the other House. As a result, the channels and communications required for accountability are being stretched.</p>
	<p pid="a.209.1/31">One case study that illustrates that lack of accountability was the decision to permit John Lewis to locate at Sprucefield along with 20 other retail units on the site. I am sure that my hon. Friend will wish to say something about that. The Minister made that decision fairly quickly when he took office and has explained his position by saying that the decision was &quot;a no-brainer&quot;. That major planning decision, which will have an impact on Lisburn town centre, on Belfast and on a number of other town centres was put through.</p>
	<p pid="a.209.1/32">Many people in Northern Ireland welcomed the fact that at least the Minister was prepared to make a decision, even though it was controversial and opposed by many. But one would have expected at least some explanation of why that decision was made, especially as, when the Minister was the Minister for Regeneration in the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister, he stated:</p>
	<p pid="a.209.1/33" class="indent">&quot;But allowing the market to do what it likes risks severe economic, environmental and social consequences&mdash;because investment will tend to gravitate to honey pot areas like affluent suburbia or the edge of towns. Having to burn a pint of petrol to buy a pint of milk . . . because retailers haven't chosen to locate in your area makes no sense whatsoever.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.209.1/34">What was the Minister's first decision when he reached Northern Ireland? He granted an application for one of the largest out-of-town shopping developments in the United Kingdom. It may well be that, when he crossed the water and changed Department, he changed his mind. That is fine, but an accountable planning system ought at least to have had a mechanism to explain that change of heart, especially when it was opposed by a wide range of interest groups. That did not happen. It goes against all the policies on urban densities, sustainable communities, public transport and social exclusion, yet we had no explanation from the Minister.</p>
	<p pid="a.209.1/35">I want to describe some of the things that could be done to improve the current situation. First, there must be an immediate publication of PPS5 and an agreement to update the other planning policy statements that are out of date and causing problems, including PPS2.</p>
	<p pid="a.209.1/36">Secondly, consultees must be put under pressure to respond much more quickly than they do at present, as they are one of the major reasons for planning applications being held back. Whether that is by means of a service level agreement, an indication that, if representations are not received within a certain period the application will be determined without them, or some other arrangement, should be a matter for debate. One set of consultees&mdash;those who are at least allowed some public accountability&mdash;should not be restricted in how long they can delay planning applications while statutory consultees are given carte blanche. That is what happens at present.</p>
	<p pid="a.209.1/37">Thirdly, in parts of England, planning applications have been speeded up by the establishment of business planning zones, where economic clusters are established and where decisions are made quickly on a basis of established planning principles which have been laid down. We should look at that in Northern Ireland, too. Fourthly, additional resources could be made available to the planning system if developers were given assurances that their applications would be fast-tracked if they provided additional resources to buy in some of the expertise that might be needed to do economic impact or environmental assessments, which the planning system does not have the resources to do at present. Some people would say that that compromises the planning system. However, if it were simply a case of developers handing over money to the divisional planning office or the Department for Regional Development to buy in the services, there would be no conflict of interest and it might speed things up. How often have I rung planners who say, &quot;We can't process this because the person who is meant to be dealing with it is working on another job&quot;? If additional resources could come from developers, why not? Many developers would be prepared to provide that, because a quick decision would be less costly than the delay that happens at present.</p>
	<p pid="a.209.1/38">Fifthly, the process of drawing up policies must be reviewed. The Belfast metropolitan area plan, which many people welcomed at the time, was subject to massive consultation&mdash;about four years of consultation. Then when the draft plan was drawn up, what did we get? We got 9,000 objections, which will go through a legal process. Either the consultation method is wrong or the legalistic nature of what happens after the draft plan is published is wrong. One thing is certain: we cannot go on with the present arrangements, which drag things on for ever.</p>
	<p pid="a.209.1/39">With certain safeguards, planning powers could be devolved to councils. I hope that that will happen under the review of public administration. Other hon. Members may want to comment on that.</p>
	<p pid="a.209.1/40">It is significant that until 2002 the Planning Service carried out customer satisfaction surveys. In 2002, it decided that it would aim for 80 per cent. of applicants being satisfied with the way in which their planning applications were determined; that was the target. The figure for the previous year was 64 per cent. The service sent questionnaires to 1,200 applicants. However, only 61 per cent. of respondents indicated that they were satisfied with the service. Rather than going up, the figure went down. The Planning Service promptly decided not to do any more surveys. That is one way of ensuring that there is no dissatisfaction, or at least that it is not expressed. It may indicate the uncertainty that the planners themselves feel about the way in which they deal with planning applications.</p>
	<p pid="a.209.1/41">I am sure that other hon. Members want to make contributions. I look forward to hearing them and the response from the Minister.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-11-01a.215.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1376" speakername="William McCrea" colnum="215"  time="11:28:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051101/halltext/51101h02.htm#51101h02_spnew1">
	<p pid="a.215.0/1">I thank <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1374" name="Sammy Wilson">my hon. Friend the Member for East Antrim (Sammy Wilson)</phrase> for bringing a very important issue before this Chamber today.</p>
	<p pid="a.215.0/2">The Minister will know that there is great dissatisfaction in local authorities about the new arrangements for consulting councils. In fact, there is great anger and frustration at the manner in which the present Minister decided to remove site meetings from councillors. I would rather have five minutes in a site meeting with an officer than an hour in an office to talk about a planning application. The decision furthers the democratic deficit that is felt in the Province. The anger and frustration felt by many elected representatives certainly has been, and will continue to be, expressed until the new policy of so-called modernising planning arrangements is changed.</p>
	<p pid="a.215.0/3">My hon. Friend touched on the issue of statutory consultees. A constituent of mine put in an application for one simple dwelling in the countryside in 2002. The matter was delayed and he got approval in August 2005 for one simple dwelling for his family in the countryside. There was an intervention by the EHS: it put in an objection to the application. A year was taken to respond and then the Department decided that it would consider approving the matter. The EHS was asked for a further letter and it wrote back with the same letter that it had sent a year before. The Department has seemed able to hold back such applications. Had the matter not been deferred, that person would have had a refusal even though he should have had an approval right at the beginning. His application went in in 2005, but it was approved only in 2005. That is totally unacceptable; it was totally in the power of the Departments to deal with the matter. The delay was completely down to them.</p>
	<p pid="a.215.0/4">The removal of proper consultation with district councils and site meetings with district councillors is not only greatly to be regretted, but should be strongly opposed by elected representatives. However, it seems that statutory consultees can keep back planning determinations for as long as they want.</p>
	<p pid="a.215.0/5">Many area plans are in total chaos. My hon. Friend the Member for East Antrim mentioned his area, and there is also the situation in Antrim. The officials have been removed from the Antrim area plan because of 5,000 objections to the Magherafelt area plan. The officials have just been moved over to another area plan, bringing a full stop to the plan in Antrim.</p>
	<p pid="a.215.0/6">The lack of appropriate and proper officers is a problem. The Minister employed more officers to deal with the plans, but the tragedy is that many senior officers retired from the system. Junior officers were brought in their place, but many were totally inexperienced in planning, so the delays happened. We need proper planning arrangements that are effective and realistic.</p>
	<p pid="a.215.0/7">The area plans that are in total chaos need to be dealt with. For example, the Assembly made a great announcement; Mr. Empey came to South Antrim and told us that the jewel in the crown of all industrial bases was going to be a global point in Newtownabbey. Yet many years later, not one building has been put on to that jewel in the crown for industrial development. I asked the Minister why there had been a delay. What answer did I receive the other day? He told me that we had to wait until the Belfast metropolitan area plan was published before anything could be done. That global point was supposed to be the jewel in the crown, but the jewel must have fallen out because the situation is going nowhere. That is disgraceful. The place is decaying and what ought to be the jewel in the crown of industrial development is sitting in absolute disarray and decay because of the delay in, or our waiting for, the Belfast metropolitan area plan. That is totally unacceptable. Did those responsible not know about that plan when they came down to make that precious announcement about the jewel in the crown, which gave the community great hope and anticipation of great industrial things? Yes, they did&mdash;but there seems to be delay upon delay upon delay.</p>
	<p pid="a.215.0/8">I wholeheartedly agree with my hon. Friend the Member for East Antrim on the publication of the retail planning policy. That is an absolute necessity. The policy is already decided; it is sitting on the shelf, gathering dust, and that will be a major impediment to appropriate retail development in Northern Ireland. I am not entering into the debate on the John Lewis stores, because they have nothing to do with me. However, I am saying that my developers and the people in my constituency are demanding that that retail planning policy should be released. If there is a planning situation or court proceedings are in the offing, that is no reason whatsoever for everything else to draw to a stop and for the document not to be published. There is a demand for it to be published.</p>
	<p pid="a.215.0/9">The Minister and the Department have to deal with one of the major problems in planning: a lack of consistency in planning approvals and in the reasons for planning refusals. That has brought more disrepute to the Department than anything else. Not only do matters go outside divisional planning offices or areas, but inside areas there are variations in decisions, approvals and the reasons for approvals</p>
	<p pid="a.215.0/10">Let us consider one of the reasons for refusing build-up. Beauty is in the eye of the beholder. One officer can see build-up, while another officer goes into the same area on another day and accepts that there is no build-up or lack of integration. One officer sees trees, while another sees a bush, as a result of which one gives approval and the other refuses. An officer might not have the guts to say that what was happening was ribbon development so he says instead that there was tendency towards ribbon development. I asked several officers at the Department what that meant and each of them gave me a different interpretation. We are dealing with a sensitive problem and the lack of consistency in planning approvals or refusals brings the whole position into disrepute.</p>
	<p pid="a.215.0/11">As for the Crosshill inquiry, there is great opposition within my constituency in respect of the approval for the asbestos transfer station in Crumlin. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1666" name="Jeffrey M Donaldson">The constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Lagan Valley (Mr. Donaldson)</phrase> runs alongside mine and our constituents are bringing their problems to our attention. The Minister who is here today made the decision about the station. The questions asked by those in our communities have not been answered. A decision cannot railroaded over the heads of the people. Members of the general public need to accept that decisions are made for the right purposes. The Department says, &quot;We have to have an asbestos transfer station somewhere.&quot; I accept that, but it must be situated in the right place, not beside Lough Neagh nor in an area that is zoned for housing and population growth. The station will be a hazard to the well-being of our community. The matter will have to be taken to a judicial review, because the decision was forced over the heads of members of the community.</p>
	<p pid="a.215.0/12">Let us consider the Cottonmont landfill site. It is to take most of the community's rubbish, but it will be situated beside a private development. Approval has been given for many houses to be built on the verge of the area, yet the problems of birds, litter, smell, infestation of rodents, additional traffic beside a school and numerous other hazards will have a detrimental environmental impact on members of the community. The decision has been forced on them. The response is, &quot;Well, the site has to go somewhere&quot;. I agree that a landfill site is necessary, but we must ensure that it is situated in a proper place. The community is again forced into the position in which it must go to court to achieve a judicial review of what is happening. The Department is irresponsible. Such action brings the right of third party appeals closer.</p>
	<p pid="a.215.0/13">Many people in the community consider that decisions are being forced on them. Rights are being given to developers and to others, but no one has a right to appeal against the decision without going to a judicial review. That does not apply in all cases, but what is happening shows that certain cases need to be dealt with by the Department.</p>
	<p pid="a.215.0/14">We have a serious problem with planning in Northern Ireland. I say to my hon. Friend the Member for Lagan Valley that I do not accept that developers have more rights than individuals, just because they have the money and can get matters speeded up. Everyone should be equal under the law and equally subject to the law. I am a great adherent to the principles of the Democratic Unionist party, and I fear that developers are given more rights because they can pay. Naturally, they will be able to pay the money if they receive approval quickly for their developments. I do not want to remove their rights, but I am putting up a marker because individuals with one little planning application in the countryside should have the same rights as everyone else. They have a right to demand approval or to object if they believe that something is against their rights.</p>
	<p pid="a.215.0/15">I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for East Antrim on securing this important debate and I will now let other hon. Members to speak. I trust that the Minister will take note of the points that have been made and, if he cannot reply to them today, that he will write to hon. Members with answers to their questions.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-11-01a.228.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1388" speakername="Angela Smith" colnum="228"  time="12:14:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051101/halltext/51101h02.htm#51101h02_spnew10">
	<p pid="a.228.1/1">Over 5,000. Not just the level of objections, but the level of responses is unprecedented, although some of the responses we get on the plans are supportive.</p>
	<p pid="a.228.1/2">The number of responses to the Ards and Down plan, the Magherafelt plan, the northern area plan and BMAP were well in excess of any received for previous plans. Those pressures are increasing. So, too, are the number of people wanting to participate in the planning process. The transparency of the planning process encourages people to do that. There have been many more applications. All that is happening when the public have a right to expect, and do expect, greater turnaround, response and clarity in the process. That has provided a challenge and makes things more difficult. The Planning Service has done a lot of work to increase capacity to deal with that work load. Hon. Members have recognised that some matters, including the key players giving responses, and some of the processes are outside the control of the Planning Service, which does its best to manage. I will discuss some of those comments in a moment.</p>
	<p pid="a.228.1/3">On short-term actions, the hon. Members for East Antrim, for South Antrim (Dr. McCrea) and for Upper Bann will recognise that we provided additional funding for an extra 125 planners to work in the Planning Service. We are not talking, as the hon. Member for South Antrim suggested, about junior officers replacing senior officers. It may have been newer officers replacing people who had more experience.</p>
	<p pid="a.228.1/4">I endorsed a decision to deploy staff as a short-term measure away from the area plans and on to planning decisions to address that work load. New staff have to get up to speed and to learn the processes. They were junior staff but they did not replace senior officers. They may have replaced more experienced staff. Decisions increased by 11 per cent. in that time. We are talking about the number of decisions increasing by 20 per cent. compared with the equivalent period last year.</p>
	<p pid="a.228.1/5">The hon. Members for East Antrim, for Upper Bann, for South Antrim, and for Lagan Valley specifically mentioned the area plans. There is a need to act on that matter, but there is also political and public pressure to ensure that we have new revised policies. That has an impact on the number of applications that we receive. We must proceed with the reform and modernisation programme, which helps us to address those issues. Many of the deployed staff have returned to work on the area plans, but the pressures in respect of applications remain, and Lord Rooker felt that further short-term measures were needed to cope with the work load and to strengthen the focus on service delivery.</p>
	<p pid="a.228.1/6">The modernisation and reform programme clearly addresses the concerns that the hon. Member for South Antrim raised on accountability. Changes to the modernisation and planning processes are designed to increase accountability and transparency. The aims are to have a much simpler, faster and more accessible planning process to ensure speedier decisions; to reduce regulation where appropriate; to ensure greater community involvement; to develop more streamlined development plan processes; and to produce clear and unambiguous planning policies to underpin decisions on planning applications. That has to be done as a matter of urgency, as Lord Rooker is aware. There are four key areas: reviewing processes and policies; introducing new technology, including e-planning, so that there is far more information and transparency, which is a major step forward; reforming the legislation; and taking forward internal organisational structural changes.</p>
	<p pid="a.228.1/7">One of the biggest challenges is the change programme that is being introduced. It has been designed only to support efficiency in the Planning Service, and that itself creates demand on services that are managed internally. Various initiatives have been aimed at improving the speed of decision making and the performance and monitoring of the new targets. As for procedures, outline planning permission has been reviewed and retained. Guidelines have been published and revised procedures introduced on repeat applications. On plans and policy, procedures are in place to ensure that they are developed in line with the regional development strategy. Increased resources have been put into enforcement, internal guidance has been revised and an enhanced programme of training has been developed.</p>
	<p pid="a.228.1/8">On e-planning, to assist transparency, a new Planning Service internet website has been launched and now provides access to a range of information and advice. The area plans have also been placed on that site to increase transparency. The scope and detail of information on facilities has been increased considerably over the past year, and the website is now being used extensively.</p>
	<p pid="a.228.1/9">Several hon. Members raised the return of invalid applications. The hon. Member for South Antrim gave two examples. I cannot elaborate on those, but if he lets me have the details, I will look into it. However, the purpose of the measures is to ensure that, if an application is invalid, it is returned at an early stage. Previously, were an invalid application submitted, it would be sent back sometimes six months or even a year later with a request for further information. That is a waste of time for the applicant and staff. Invalid applications will be returned as soon as possible to the applicant with a request for the required information.</p>
	<p pid="a.228.1/10">If the hon. Member for South Antrim gives me the details of the group about which he is concerned, we will deal with that. However, I remind him that about 25 per cent. of applications are incomplete as to information, plans and fees, and the weight and pressure that that puts on the system is enormous. A scheme is being piloted in Belfast. If there are concerns about its operation, the Planning Service can examine that. However, it has been supported by the CBI and the Construction Employers Federation as a way of moving matters along more quickly, as it is designed to do.</p>
	<p pid="a.228.1/11">The review of customer service standards is under way, examining how we manage contact with the customer to ensure that they get correct information. Work is continuing with the key consultees in the Roads Service, the Water Service and the Environment and Heritage Service, which was mentioned several times, to improve consultation relations.</p>
	<p pid="a.228.1/12">I shall address the matter of legislative reform. Hon. Members will be aware that, last Friday, Lord Rooker launched a consultation paper on proposed legislation for reform of planning. Members will have an opportunity to give their views on that. However, there are several interesting proposals, particularly the one about temporary stop notices, which the hon. Member for South Antrim recently mentioned to me. They will be used to halt a breach of planning control for a period of up to 28 days, as soon as a breach is identified. There is also a doubling of fines for breaches of advertising control, which will act as a deterrent. There are a number of legislative proposals. One that will be of particular interest is the removal of Crown immunity in the Planning Service.</p>
	<p pid="a.228.1/13">Members mentioned council consultations. No one denies that councils have a key and statutory role to play in the planning process. Ensuring that that process works efficiently and effectively is a shared objective for councils and the Government. The current process has not changed for more than 30 years. On <phrase class="date" code="2005-09-30">30 September</phrase>, there were 6,000 deferrals in the system. The practice of delaying decisions and accepting multiple referrals for site visits has built up over many years. The hon. Member for South Antrim said that site meetings were removed. They were not removed, but they might not be necessary in every case.</p>
