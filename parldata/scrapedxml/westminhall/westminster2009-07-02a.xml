<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-07-02a.149.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1779" speakername="Chris Bryant" colnum="149"  time="014:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090702/halltext/90702h0002.htm#09070259000328">
	<p pid="a.149.1/1">Indeed. There are times when we do not agree, and when there are tensions in trying to achieve a joint position, but that would be true if the EU did not exist at all and we were still trying to build alliances without it. When we share a common position, it has added strength. A classic example relates to Russia and energy security, which is a vital issue for many EU countries. We get only 2 per cent. of our gas from Russia, but 47 per cent. of Europe's gas comes from Russia, so having a strong, reliable and integrated relationship across the European Union with Russia can only be to our benefit.</p>
	<p pid="a.149.1/2">We would like the EU to play a slightly different and enhanced role in relation to Pakistan, Afghanistan and Iraq in particular. We have seen that to some degree in the past year, but because Governments across Europe change their complexion on a fairly regular basis, sometimes there is not perfect continuity of political view.</p>
	<p pid="a.149.1/3">Climate change is another matter in which it is vital that the EU takes a significant role, and we hope that there will be a good outcome from the talks in December. I do not think anyone in the House disagrees about that. Just as we know that the acid rain created by the industries of one country does not necessarily land neatly on the mountain tops of that country but can spread across the whole EU, we know too that we must do all we can to come up with a positive outcome in Copenhagen. Europe has taken a significant lead on such issues, and we hope that the European Commission will also take a lead.</p>
	<p pid="a.149.1/4">It is vital that the Commission should lead not only in the delivery of programmes of skills for the future, but also in trying to ensure that the Europe we build for the future is not simply trying to compete in the bargain basement. Instead, we should try to build on Europe's strengths that add value around the world.</p>
	<p pid="a.149.1/5">Finally, it is a priority and a necessity for the Government to enhance security. There are many threats to people's security, such as international terrorism, antisocial behaviour and everything in between. Obviously, some key elements of those issues can be solved only at local level, let alone at national level. However, greater co-operation has been in our interests in other areas, such as terrorism. As we approach the anniversary of the <phrase class="date" code="2009-07-07">7 July</phrase> bombings, we are painfully aware that the European arrest warrant was significant in helping us to bring to justice the perpetrators of those events. I say to those who tend to adopt a rather ideological position about such issues that that sometimes gets in the way of pragmatic common sense.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-07-02a.157.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1437" speakername="Tobias Ellwood" colnum="157"  time="015:09:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090702/halltext/90702h0003.htm#09070259000352">
	<p pid="a.157.1/1">Taxpayers need to see that the money is well spent, and if the Minister can identify flaws in the system it must be improved, to give better accountability and so that we can see where the money is spent. More important is how it is spent: where it is pushed in. The costs of EU membership are heavier than they should be, and the way the money is spent could be improved. Improvements have been made; proposed new EU laws are now assessed for their impact on jobs and businesses, which did not happen before, but there is still too much red tape coming from Brussels, and too much interference in matters that should be decided by European nation states and not the EU. The working time directive was mentioned earlier, and its effect on our business and public services is potentially serious and damaging. That is why, if the Conservatives win the next election, we shall make it a priority to restore national control of social and employment legislation.</p>
	<p pid="a.157.1/2">We need a Europe that works for the people, not the rulers. There are 27 nations, with a wonderful mix of culture, languages, peoples and heritage. Therefore, there will be a natural threshold for what such a large club can achieve without threatening people's way of life by imposing a bland blueprint or one-size-fits-all stamp that gives no significance or respect to individual nation states' way of life. Also very important is the distancing effect on the decision-makers from those who elect them. I defy hon. Members to go back to their constituencies and find an average voter who can name every single MEP who got elected in the European elections. There is no proper relationship, no matter how hard MEPs work, because of the number of doorsteps that they need to cover.</p>
	<p pid="a.157.1/3">The EU is growing into a bureaucratic nightmare, and we want to take back control of social and employment law, so that EU red tape no longer threatens our competitive labour market. I encourage the Minister to answer my questions if he can, and, if he cannot, I invite him to write to me with the answers as soon as possible.</p>

	<p pid="a.157.2/1">I am very pleased to serve under your chairmanship once again, Mr. Illsley, with a small but select group of MPs.</p>
	<p pid="a.157.2/2">The document that we are discussing is, like many&mdash;perhaps most&mdash;European strategy documents, more of a statement of priorities than a fully worked out strategy. Some mention has been made of its length. I welcome the fact that, at just 11 pages, it is admirably brief. Considering the size of some documents that we receive from Brussels, it is a step in the right direction. I am a great believer in the idea that documents, whether from the EU or this place, are often far too long, and that brevity and clarity of purpose are not valued enough. It is right that we should have the opportunity to debate the priorities, although it is also important to know the mechanism by which the UK position is communicated back, which presumably happens through the Council of Ministers. The mechanism for such responses is not always clear.</p>
	<p pid="a.157.2/3">I welcomed your earlier ruling, Mr. Illsley, that the debate should not turn into one solely about ratification of the Lisbon treaty, because I have sat through various Europe debates that have felt a bit like groundhog day. I imagined that it would come up&mdash;quite rightly, as it is mentioned in the document and is obviously an important, unresolved issue for Europe. Whether it is resolved one way or the other will probably depend on the outcome of the second Irish referendum, which is due this autumn, as the other countries that have not yet ratified it have indicated that they are waiting on the second decision of the Irish people. The Irish may well say no. That would be a shame, but, ultimately, although the Lisbon treaty is a good treaty, it is not earth-shattering. In such circumstances, we would have to use the structures as they are currently formed and try to make them work better.</p>

	<p pid="a.158.2/1">It was mentioned in passing that the Labour party suffered its worst ever electoral result in the European elections. It was surprising, given the collapse of the ruling party's vote, that, as an Opposition party, the Liberal Democrats saw their vote fall. Does she fear that that was because the British people felt betrayed? A promise was made in the Liberal Democrat manifesto to support a referendum on the European constitution. The Lisbon treaty is practically the same, but the Liberal Democrats have failed to honour their promise and have come up with this political fix of a debate on whether we should be in or out, for which no one is asking.</p>

	<p pid="a.161.2/1">The hon. Gentleman raises an important point. In my constituency, there are currently many controversies, not about wind turbines, but about planning on a variety of issues. It is about a lack of democracy. It is frustrating when a whole community is united in a particular objective, and their rights and views seem to be trampled over. There is a balance to be had, because there is sometimes a &quot;not in my backyard&quot; attitude&mdash;although I am not accusing the hon. Gentleman's constituents of that&mdash;which could mean that we never have any renewable technologies anywhere.</p>
	<p pid="a.161.2/2">We need more incentives for communities in the form of benefits that will accrue. The community can see a real benefit when the money and funds for renewable energy projects are put in place. There is, perhaps, even a profit-sharing basis for that. In Shetland, for example, fabulous projects have been put in place by the oil industry. Where there is a community benefit, that can help.</p>
	<p pid="a.161.2/3">We should also recognise that onshore wind is not the only answer. Offshore wind, for example, is perhaps less likely to attract criticism, and many marine renewables are on the sea bed and do not seem to have the same impact on a landscape. Those things need to be developed, because as an island with huge potential&mdash;whether in respect of the Severn barrage proposals, in the Pentland firth or elsewhere offshore&mdash;we need to ensure that we are using the resources.</p>
	<p pid="a.161.2/4">Technology transfer poses a challenge. Page 4 of the document says that</p>
	<p pid="a.161.2/5" class="indent">&quot;both the copyright and the trademark systems should be modernised to make them responsive to the needs of business and consumers&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.161.2/6">That is the sort of statement with which everybody agrees, but there is a real challenge in getting the correct balance. For example, we do not want patents on low-carbon technologies to become a barrier to transferring them to developing countries, where that technology is needed because their economies are growing. If we are effectively saying to those countries, &quot;You can't develop on the same trajectory of carbon emissions that we did&quot;, it is only fair that we give them assistance to enable them to develop low-carbon economies. Equally, with that kind of technology transfer there can be a barrier to investment in new technologies. It is important that such vital measures are not prevented by technology transfer. It is difficult to get it right. The &pound;60 billion fund to assist with technology transfer globally to developing countries, which was proposed by the Prime Minister in his recent speech, could help. A lot of environmental groups have suggested that that does not go far enough, but at least it is a step in right direction.</p>
	<p pid="a.161.2/7"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1437" name="Tobias Ellwood">The hon. Member for Bournemouth, East (Mr. Ellwood)</phrase> mentioned carbon capture and storage. I agree that the Government have not made nearly enough progress on that vital issue, but I disagree with what he said about the feasibility of CCS. As a member of the Environmental Audit Committee, I can say that we have looked into CCS and come to the conclusion that, although there is currently no commercially viable project on the scale that would be necessary, each element of the technology has been tried and tested. It is about having the right incentives in place. If business gets a clear signal that new coal-fired power stations will not be allowed if it does not include CCS, the investment will come. The Government should have been bolder in that regard.</p>
	<p pid="a.161.2/8">We can argue about whether we can achieve Britain's cuts in carbon emissions without CCS. Some would argue that nuclear could help to fill that gap, although I am not a fan of it. However, in respect of other countries, members of the EAC met Government officials in China and heard about the number of coal-fired power stations that they are building and will continue to build. It is clear that there is no way that we, as a planet, will achieve our objectives if we do not have CCS technology. It is important that that technology can be retrofitted to existing power stations, rather than just having technology that is pre rather than post.</p>
	<p pid="a.161.2/9">We have suffered a financial crisis of confidence in the banking sector, with consumers throughout the country not being sure where to put their money and unsure what was going on as everything seemed to collapse. It is important that we consider the competition issues that have been raised by the nationalisation or recapitalisation of the banks and the merger of Lloyds and HBOS, which the Government have waived competition rules to allow. There is a great danger that we set ourselves up to repeat the mistakes from which we have already suffered. The enforcement of competition rules, which are mentioned on pages 3 and 4, is important in aiding recovery.</p>
	<p pid="a.161.2/10">Lloyds now boasts on its website that it has more than 50 per cent. of the UK market share of social bank accounts and Goldman Sachs says that it controls 30 per cent. of the UK banking market overall. I do not see how that can be healthy in the long term. It will be necessary to break up the banks, particularly when they are re-privatised back into the private sector. Paraphrasing Mervyn King's recent statement, if banks are too big to fail, then they are too big. In such circumstances, the Government have to bail out the banks. The lack of competition is a problem, and it is not good for customers, either.</p>

	<p pid="a.163.0/1">There are some questions about whether that decision is politically or commercially motivated. I leave it to the Minister to tell us what the European Commission will say and what the Government will say to it.</p>
	<p pid="a.163.0/2">Climate change is a real success for Europe and we should not be afraid of praising the success so far. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1406" name="Graham Stuart">The hon. Member for Beverley and Holderness (Mr. Stuart)</phrase> will know, because he also sat on the EAC and we produced more than one excellent report on the European Union emissions trading scheme, that although the ETS is not perfect, it has certainly improved in its different phases and is being used as a model by other schemes around the world, notably by the Australians, who have recently, thankfully, woken up to the threat of climate change and want to take action. We have a pioneering scheme and although it has its teething problems, people are learning from it and it will be a crucial part of how we, as a planet, tackle the problem. That pioneering attitude has enabled the EU to have leadership role, which has been lacking from the United States. Even now it is more difficult for the US to lead on the issue, because of the different circumstances within that country, including the views of its population, for example, which relies on cheap petrol.</p>
	<p pid="a.163.0/3">The EU has an opportunity. The regulations on lower-carbon vehicles have helped EU cars to be far ahead of their counterparts in the US. The Tata Nano is being launched in India and the company hopes to launch a similar model in Europe, but before doing so it has to make its carbon emissions much better for it to access the European market. Those regulations will encourage manufacturers from elsewhere in the world to improve their carbon standards.</p>
	<p pid="a.163.0/4">Landfill tax has led to a huge increase in doorstep recycling around the UK. The Government may be tempted to take the credit for improved recycling facilities, but it is important to recognise that the EU deserves some of the credit, because the directive on landfill has played an important role. Too often Governments can take the credit for good things that the EU does and lay the blame on Europe for less popular things, but that does nothing to push the cause for working together with our European counterparts. I shall touch briefly on the common agricultural policy, because its reform is important for sustainability. The strategy notes that 2010 will be the first year of full implementation of the CAP's health check. That is a good and welcome step forward, because subsidies coupled with what farmers produced led to food mountains, wine lakes, and excesses that were not helpful to the environment, nor ultimately to trade with the rest of the world, and caused huge problems for developing countries. That protectionism must be challenged and is being challenged, although not far enough yet. It is good to see progress on reform, but it is important that pressure is maintained to ensure that it continues.</p>
	<p pid="a.163.0/5">Cuts in aid will free up money. The DEFRA summary says that around &euro;479 million will be freed up throughout Europe from aid cuts, and that can be used to invest in renewable energy, climate change measures, biodiversity and so on. What is the corresponding figure for the UK, and how do the Government intend to use those funds?</p>

	<p pid="a.164.2/1">The hon. Gentleman asked to intervene, and then criticised me for taking his intervention. He anticipates my comments on Europe as a world partner. He rightly raised the huge problems that the CAP causes, but it is important to note that progress is under way, and that should be welcomed. The CAP is absolutely unacceptable and, sadly, the outlook is not optimistic for getting rid of the worst protectionism. The French are a stumbling block, although the Government have taken a positive line and tried to push it strongly in the EU, but obtaining agreement from other countries is not always easy.</p>
	<p pid="a.164.2/2">A matter on which I have campaigned, as you will be aware, Mr. Illsley, because you also have a great interest in it, is excessive packaging. I note that the section on climate change and sustainable Europe does not mention packaging, which is a significant omission. The UK's legislation on reducing packaging waste is based on the snappily titled directive on packaging and packaging waste 94/62/EC. The Minister for Energy and Climate Change, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1681" name="Joan Ruddock">the hon. Member for Lewisham, Deptford (Joan Ruddock)</phrase> conceded in April 2008 that the directive's essential requirements do not work, and said that they must be reformed at EU level.</p>
	<p pid="a.164.2/3">I have pursued the matter and have discovered that a review of the regulations was announced in September 2007. In December 2008, it had still not started, and the EU Article 21 Committee said that it expected that it would take between nine and 10 months, so it might finally be ready in the autumn, and I hope that it will recommend some strengthening of the essential requirements regulation. That is an example of the EU when it is not at its best. It announced a review, but it took more than two years for any results to be available. Sometimes, European business moves at snail's pace; a bit more proactivity and dynamism would be welcome. I am keen to see the result of the review, and may seek opportunities to raise it with the Minister or his colleagues in Environment, Food and Rural Affairs questions.</p>
	<p pid="a.164.2/4">The Minister mentioned the Copenhagen negotiations in December, and I agree that they are vital in tackling climate change. It is essential that the EU takes a leading role, and it has tried to do so. Working through the EU and explicit diplomacy on climate change is one of the four objectives of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, and it is welcome that that is written into the FCO's objectives and not hived off to the Department for Energy and Climate change, or the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. World diplomacy is vital, because in many countries there is not the same acceptance or understanding of, or belief in the scientific evidence for climate change, and it is not such a priority because developing countries must deal with a whole host of other issues. We know that if climate change continues on the current trajectory in the long term, its perils will be felt most strongly in developing countries, so it is vital to do all we can as a world community to mitigate it.</p>
	<p pid="a.164.2/5">Adaptation should not be forgotten. We have already had a temperature rise of 0.6&deg;, and scientists predict that it will rise by at least 2&deg; even if we manage to curb emissions rigorously now. That will not be 2&deg; across the planet; it will be higher in some areas, and lower in others. Adaptation measures will be necessary, and we have seen the disruptive effect of just a few days of hot weather in the UK. We see similar disruption when there is flooding, and the effects in other countries will be so much worse.</p>
	<p pid="a.164.2/6">Turning to Europe as a world partner and the point that was raised in an intervention, I was intrigued to read on page 7:</p>
	<p pid="a.164.2/7" class="indent">&quot;The Commission will also pay particular attention to preventing and addressing unfair trade-distorting actions and protectionism in third countries.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.164.2/8">That is hugely ironic, because, as was mentioned, the CAP continues to epitomise those unfair trade-distorting actions and protectionism which the Commission is now saying it is against. I hope that those words can be used to encourage our European partners to move further along the route of getting rid of protectionism, because that is vital.</p>
	<p pid="a.164.2/9">My first Adjournment debate in Westminster Hall was on trade with developing countries in the months after the Make Poverty History march and campaign. A huge number of my constituents were motivated to write to me about it, and I would have thought that all hon. Members would agree that urgent action is needed. Some of that is about money, but some is just about dropping barriers. There has been stagnation in the Doha round, and that beggars belief, because we are not talking just about money, companies, trade and so on; we are talking about people's lives and livelihoods, and whether they have the basics of life that we take for granted. It is vital that our words are made to have real meaning, and that they are not glossed over in statements and policy papers that do not have any teeth.</p>
	<p pid="a.164.2/10">I welcome the statement on page 6 of the strategy document that accession negotiations with Croatia and Turkey will continue. That is important. Despite recent setbacks in the border dispute with Slovenia, Croatia is well on its way to membership, and I hope that the issues can be resolved.</p>
	<p pid="a.164.2/11">Turkey's accession may be further off, but it would be a positive move to include Turkey in Europe. Some human rights issues are outstanding, but it is important to recognise the incentive that EU membership and the accession process can provide. Many countries have been and are keen to join the EU, and that carrot is a great motivator for them to improve their record on human rights and corruption. We perhaps were not firm enough with some eastern European countries about securing action on corruption and so on before they acceded to the EU. That means that some opportunities are lost, because the pre-accession period is the time when the EU's influence is probably greatest in encouraging reform. We do not want to repeat those mistakes, but we do want to continue with those proceedings.</p>
	<p pid="a.164.2/12">I noted the very diplomatic wording on Kosovo:</p>
	<p pid="a.164.2/13" class="indent">&quot;The Commission will also prepare measures to support Kosovo's political and socio-economic development and to help it progress, as part of the region, towards the EU.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.164.2/14">In fact, there is a host of diplomatic difficulties stemming from the fact that some EU states have recognised Kosovo as an independent state and others still have not done so. Last year, I had the opportunity to visit Pristina and Mitrovica and meet various Kosovan and Serb politicians. It was clear to me that huge difficulties remained in that region, even though there is peace. EU membership is perhaps one way out of the problems. The different Balkan states being EU members and then having relationships under the larger EU umbrella is potentially hugely beneficial. Although there are diplomatic difficulties at the moment, I hope that that objective will be pursued.</p>
	<p pid="a.164.2/15">The Commission wants bilateral relations to be deepened with Israel, Moldova, Morocco and Ukraine. That is certainly interesting, but there are areas of concern. Greater co-operation with the EU could be used as an incentive for Israel to fulfil its responsibilities to uphold human rights. I argue that we should not upgrade relations with Israel until it agrees to suspend settlement expansion and shows real commitment to the peace process. We have seen some moves in that direction, albeit small ones, recently. Obviously the situation is very sensitive, but, although in terms of overall diplomacy and influence the US has a far greater role to play than the EU, the EU should use the tools that it has at its disposal to pursue that agenda. That is my representation to the Minister on Israel.</p>
	<p pid="a.164.2/16">The issue of Morocco is not touched on often. There is a strong trading relationship between Morocco and the EU, but Morocco is not co-operating with UN negotiations on the future of Western Sahara. It has not agreed to a referendum on independence for the Western Sahrawis. The Amnesty International report in 2009 entitled &quot;The State of the World's Human Rights&quot; said on Morocco:</p>
	<p pid="a.164.2/17" class="indent">&quot;The rights to freedom of expression, association and assembly continued to be restricted. Criticism of the monarchy or views contradicting the official position on other politically sensitive issues were penalized...Allegations of torture were not investigated, and victims of past human rights violations were not granted effective access to justice.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.164.2/18">Slightly worryingly, it also said that</p>
	<p pid="a.164.2/19" class="indent">&quot;the issue of impunity for torturers was not raised&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.164.2/20">when the EU and Morocco agreed in October 2008 the road map to closer co-operation. I urge the Minister to use what influence he might have in his discussions with EU counterparts on further relations with Morocco to ensure that those issues are not left on the sidelines but are highlighted.</p>
	<p pid="a.164.2/21">It is vital that Britain continues to engage in Europe, and this policy strategy lays out a set of priorities that are well thought out, although there are the issues that I have raised. I hope that whoever wins the next general election, the Government will continue to engage in Europe, so that we have a full role in reviewing the strategy, because it is important for many of the global challenges that we are working hand in hand with our EU partners.</p>
	<p pid="a.164.2/22">My other plea is for us to focus on making things happen. The case for Europe is made best when Europe delivers for people, rather than when we get lost in institutional minutiae. Europe should focus on job creation, investing in a lower-carbon world, trade liberalisation and human rights, and prove just how relevant it is to the people of Europe.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-07-02a.167.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1772" speakername="Mark Francois" colnum="167"  time="016:04:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090702/halltext/90702h0005.htm#09070259000374">
	<p pid="a.167.0/1">It is a pleasure to follow <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1971" name="Jo Swinson">the hon. Member for East Dunbartonshire (Jo Swinson)</phrase> and to speak under your chairmanship, Mr. Illsley.</p>
	<p pid="a.167.0/2">In summing up the debate from the Opposition Front Bench, I note in passing that five Conservative Members have participated in one way or another, one Liberal Democrat Member and, aside from you, Mr. Illsley, as the neutral Chairman, one Labour Member&mdash;the Minister himself. I am somewhat surprised, given his popularity among Labour Back Benchers, that none of them has turned up to support him. I thought that at least one Labour Back Bencher could have been dragged here on a Thursday afternoon to talk about this important document. The Minister may have to reflect on that privately.</p>
	<p pid="a.167.0/3">I shall come to the Minister's contribution, but first I shall talk about some of the other contributions. My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1406" name="Graham Stuart">the Member for Beverley and Holderness (Mr. Stuart)</phrase> raised a number of good points. He pressed the Minister on the position regarding Turkish accession. The policy statement relates to accession in a number of areas. As there has been a lot of media comment about that in the past few weeks, will the Minister give the latest view from the Foreign Office on progress on Turkish accession? I hope he understands that it is a serious question. It would be helpful to hon. Members if he provided us with an update.</p>
	<p pid="a.167.0/4">My hon. Friend also referred to our new grouping in the European Parliament. Since I have been doing this job, for the past two years, I have heard many people, including Labour Ministers, say that we would never do it&mdash;that it could not be achieved. Well, we have done it, and I just say to the Minister that in the European Parliament, there are a number of people in the socialist grouping, with whom Labour MEPs sit, who served in previous communist regimes in eastern Europe that seemed perfectly content to oppress the peoples of those countries. If he wants to talk about democracy, he should be more careful about the company that Labour MEPs keep, because they sit with people who were perfectly willing to suppress it for many years in eastern Europe. I am pleased that some of the people we are allied with resisted that, even under communism. I therefore believe that our grouping will provide an important addition to democratic debate in the Parliament. The President of the Commission, Mr. Barroso, will address our new grouping on <phrase class="date" code="2009-07-07">7 July</phrase>. That is an example of how seriously it is being taken. I thank my hon. Friend for raising that matter.</p>
	<p pid="a.167.0/5">My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1437" name="Tobias Ellwood">the Member for Bournemouth, East (Mr. Ellwood)</phrase> asked a number of specific budgetary questions, and the Minister has had time to seek inspiration on those points, so I hope that we will receive specific answers. My hon. Friend raised in particular Galileo, which, as I think the Minister would concede, has been a controversial programme. When my hon. Friend referred to birds, he was not referring in any kind of slang or colloquial language to pretty young ladies; he was merely using a term widely used in the industry for satellites. Given that only one satellite is in orbit, and a test one at that, will the Minister update us on the Government's view on Galileo&mdash;exactly where the programme now sits, when the next satellite will be launched, what our current budgetary contribution is, and where he believes the programme will go in the next several years? It has come in for a lot of criticism and it is referred to in the documentation.</p>
	<p pid="a.167.0/6">We also heard a speech from the hon. Member for East Dunbartonshire, from the Liberal Democrat Front Bench. It is fair to say that she ranged over quite a considerable number of topics. She mentioned en passant the common agricultural policy and the health check, although she neglected to mention that a few years ago the present Government gave up &pound;7 billion of the British rebate in return for what was supposed to be significant reform of the CAP. That was then downgraded to a health check and, in effect, very little further reform has taken place. We oppose that giving up of British taxpayers' money. It is a discredit to the Government that they negotiated so weakly and did not achieve a creditable outcome.</p>
	<p pid="a.167.0/7">I repeat to the hon. Lady the point that my hon. Friend the Member for Beverley and Holderness made: the Conservative vote increased in the European elections. Regardless of how the Liberal Democrats may have done in the east midlands, which she cited, to have come fourth in the country as a whole, even behind the Government, who had their worst result ever, was not necessarily a terribly creditable performance for the Liberal Democrats overall, and they might want to reflect on whether their European policy has something to do with that.</p>
	<p pid="a.167.0/8">When the 2009 annual policy strategy was debated on <phrase class="date" code="2009-06-12">12 June</phrase> last year, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1381" name="David Lidington">the Member for Aylesbury (Mr. Lidington)</phrase>, speaking from the Front Bench for the Conservatives, said about the document:</p>
	<p pid="a.167.0/9" class="indent">&quot;I could not make up my mind whether it was a strategy document or a work programme. It is something of a cross between a White Paper and a Queen's Speech, but it lacked the precision of the latter and associated documents because it does not tell us in detail exactly which measures of European legislation the Commission intends to introduce in 2009. The strategic analysis and presentation lacks coherence&mdash;it is a bag of all-sorts.&quot;&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="westminhall/2008-06-12.164"><i>Official Report, </i>12 June 2008; Vol. 477, c. 164WH</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="a.167.0/10">That was a perceptive description, and in many respects it holds for the 2010 document.</p>
	<p pid="a.167.0/11">I turn to the document, and I begin with Copenhagen. We welcome a number of the Commission's objectives, particularly the fact that it wants to prioritise the fight against climate change. That is an important priority, and a topical one given that we all hope that international agreement can be reached at the UN summit in Copenhagen in December. Indeed, the House has seen cross-party support for that this afternoon.</p>
	<p pid="a.167.0/12">We all appreciate the importance of the matter, and would like to see a deal done at Copenhagen, if it is possible. Given the importance of such a deal, we welcome the fact that the Commission recognises that the adoption of a climate and energy package and a revised emissions trading scheme should be a priority for 2010. For all its faults, the emissions trading scheme is an important example of how to create an international mechanism to deal with carbon emissions.</p>
	<p pid="a.167.0/13">I move on to the Lisbon agenda, which forms an important part of the document that we are debating this afternoon. The aim, as stated in 2000, was that by 2010 the European Union should be</p>
	<p pid="a.167.0/14" class="indent">&quot;the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world capable of sustainable economic growth with more and better jobs and greater social cohesion&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.167.0/15">Given that that period is nearly at an end, it is worth evaluating the outcome of the last nine years.</p>
	<p pid="a.167.0/16">Frederick Reinfeldt, the Prime Minister of Sweden&mdash;the country assumed the presidency of the EU only yesterday&mdash;and his Finance Minister, Anders Borg, did just that in a joint article on <phrase class="date" code="2009-06-02">2 June</phrase> in the Swedish daily newspaper <i>Dagens Nyheter</i>. Their unfortunate conclusion was this:</p>
	<p pid="a.167.0/17" class="indent">&quot;Even if progress has been made it must be said that the Lisbon agenda, with only a year remaining before it is to be evaluated, has been a failure&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.167.0/18">They then set out their remedies, which they see as based on sustainable public finances, lower taxes and greater participation in the jobs market. They argued that</p>
	<p pid="a.167.0/19" class="indent">&quot;we have in Sweden held stable and sustainable public finances as an integral part in crisis control. A quick glance around Europe strengthens us in the conviction that it is right. The crisis in the United Kingdom doubled the national debt in just a few years.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.167.0/20">When it comes to the Lisbon agenda, the new European Union presidency singled out the UK, under the Labour Government, as a prime example of how unsustainable public finances can hamper sustainable economic growth. I hope that the Minister will reflect on that.</p>
	<p pid="a.167.0/21">Another important matter covered in the Commission's document is the proposed change to the regulation of the financial services industry. A number of my hon. Friends touched upon the fact that the change is vital to this country because of the large number of jobs created and tax revenue generated by the City of London, and other financial centres such as Edinburgh. The Opposition are concerned that the proposals mentioned in the strategy document will have a significant impact on the City's ability to compete globally. For instance, the European system of financial supervisors should supplement and strengthen rather than replace the role of national regulators, such as the Financial Services Authority and the Bank of England.</p>
	<p pid="a.167.0/22">Other proposals include giving the three authorities proposed in stage 2 of the de la Rosi&egrave;re programme legally binding powers over national supervisors, but that would potentially represent a significant transfer of power from member states to the EU in an area where Britain has a great deal at stake. The dangers are more apparent than the advantages. Moreover, the Institute of Directors points out that the distinction the Government seem to draw between financial supervision and regulation in respect of the proposed system is &quot;dubious&quot;. Why are the Government rolling over when they should be doing more to defend Britain's interests? They have been weak, and they deserve to be criticised.</p>
	<p pid="a.167.0/23">Since the last debate on the annual policy strategy, we have witnessed the Russian invasion of Georgia. Today's document devotes a paragraph to support for Georgia and its political system. However, it does not mention any detailed measures on Russia, and specifically whether talks aimed at creating a new EU partnership agreement with Russia should be concluded while Russia remains in breach of the EU-brokered ceasefire, which was successfully negotiated by President Sarkozy when France held the EU presidency. It is important to put that on record.</p>
	<p pid="a.167.0/24">I have asked the Minister this question before, most recently in a European affairs debate, but there was no time then for him to answer. I should be grateful if he would state whether it is the Government's policy not to sign up to a new agreement with Russia while it remains in breach of its ceasefire obligations. There is plenty of time this afternoon. Perhaps the Minister will give us a clear answer to that straightforward question.</p>
	<p pid="a.167.0/25">The documents also say that a special emphasis will be placed on the European neighbourhood policy&mdash;the ENP&mdash;and the new eastern partnership. The eastern partnership was one of the lasting achievements of the Czech presidency. We welcomed it as an example of how Europe could look outwards and continue with the enlargement process. However, when European Standing Committee B debated the matter some weeks ago&mdash;the previous Minister for Europe, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1543" name="Caroline Flint">the right hon. Member for Don Valley (Caroline Flint)</phrase> was there&mdash;I asked how the eastern partnership would be financed, and I am sorry to say that that I did not receive a satisfactory answer. I therefore have some questions for the Under-Secretary about the budget for the eastern partnership, based on the documents before us.</p>
	<p pid="a.167.0/26">At page 11, the strategy document states:</p>
	<p pid="a.167.0/27" class="indent">&quot;EUR 250 million has been earmarked by reprogramming ENPI funds.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.167.0/28">It then goes on to say that</p>
	<p pid="a.167.0/29" class="indent">&quot;The remaining EUR 350 million will come from the unallocated margin under Heading 4&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.167.0/30">Will the hon. Gentleman say more about precisely what is covered by heading 4&mdash;I understand that it acts in part as a reserve&mdash;and whether the redeployment funds will have any effect on future funding for programmes in the Balkans, or as implied in the next paragraph, for areas such as Gaza or other parts of the middle east? It is some weeks since the European Committee debate, and I wonder whether the Minister can provide greater clarify on exactly where the other &euro;350 million will come from, and specifically which other budgets might suffer.</p>
	<p pid="a.167.0/31">One of the greatest challenges for European enlargement is the Balkans, particularly Bosnia and Herzegovina. The European Commission's work in Bosnia is ongoing, and the commitment to accelerate the stabilisation and association agreements in the western Balkans, referred to on page 6, is welcome. However, those agreements will not be able to progress without more European political resolve and initiative. Unfortunately, at least in some countries, that seems to be lacking.</p>
	<p pid="a.167.0/32">As I have said on previous occasions, Bosnia remains in a delicate position. Nationalist rhetoric blows over the fragile central Bosnian institutions, and separatist calls are never far from the surface, yet it is now that the EU needs to show greater resolve in Bosnia than it appears to be showing. Rather than allowing discussion of its closure, the office of the High Representative needs our full backing; likewise, EUFOR is in need of greater European political support. Will the Government support the continued operation of the High Representative and EUFOR? Those are specific policy questions, and I should be grateful if the Minister were to answer them.</p>
	<p pid="a.167.0/33">I want to ask the Minister about a related matter to do with Kosovo. As the UK has reduced its commitment to EULEX in Kosovo partly, it would seem, as a result of the Government's public finance crisis, will he guarantee that British missions to Bosnia are not and will not suffer the same fate?</p>
	<p pid="a.167.0/34">On page 6, the document describes the European Commission's proposals for the implementation of the Lisbon treaty. Those plans not only take the Irish people for granted, but also to some degree the German constitutional court and Parliament. I am sure the Minister is aware that the German constitutional court's ruling of <phrase class="date" code="2009-06-30">30 June</phrase>, in effect, suspended ratification of the treaty in Germany. The court's ruling is remarkable for its honesty. For instance, it states:</p>
	<p pid="a.167.0/35" class="indent">&quot;The extent of the Union's freedom of action has steadily and considerably increased, not least by the Treaty of Lisbon, so that meanwhile in some fields of policy, the European Union has a shape that corresponds to that of a federal state, i.e. is analogous to that of a state&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.167.0/36">That is to be found near the beginning of the judgment, which continued:</p>
	<p pid="a.167.0/37" class="indent">&quot;The transfer of competences...has been increased once again by the Treaty of Lisbon&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.167.0/38">Importantly, the court also noted&mdash;this is of great significance to the UK Parliament, where all the Opposition's attempts to insert legal safeguards were defeated by the Government on a three-line Whip&mdash;that the so-called ratchet clause needs a further legal safeguard. Given that the Minister assures us that he has read the treaty, he will understand exactly what that clause is. The court was specific about that, in the German context, but the need for safeguards has also been taken up in Holland, where the Dutch magazine, <i>Elsevier, </i>noted:</p>
	<p pid="a.167.0/39" class="indent">&quot;What does this judgement mean for the sovereignty of other member states? Should they not also build a guarantee into their own legislation in order to secure their right to self-determination?&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.167.0/40">As the German constitutional court has effectively compelled the German Parliament to insert legal safeguards, should the UK Parliament not also receive at least comparable safeguards to those that will apparently be provided to the German Parliament? That judgment came not from those on what the Minister might call the Eurosceptic fringe of politics, but from the constitutional court of Germany. As he was so keen earlier to refer to the German constitution, will he now be mindful of the decisions of the court that exists to police that constitution? In simple terms, if additional safeguards are good enough for the people of Germany, why should they not be good enough for the people of the United Kingdom? I hope he will address that point when he sums up.</p>
	<p pid="a.167.0/41">Another part of the document that causes concern is the development of the European external action service. Page 6 of the document notes:</p>
	<p pid="a.167.0/42" class="indent">&quot;One of the early and visible outcomes of such an institutional change would be the setting-up of the European External Action Service&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.167.0/43">There have been suspicions that the reason why there would be such an early and visible outcome is that the creation of the EAAS is already under way, notwithstanding the result of the referendum yet to be held&mdash;most likely&mdash;in Ireland. I should be grateful, therefore, if the Under-Secretary could reassure us that no work has been undertaken on setting up the external access service, as envisaged by the Lisbon treaty, given that its ratification has been halted in a number of member states. On that point, I should like to correct him: he said that it had not been ratified in two member states, but actually it has not been ratified in four&mdash;Germany, Ireland, the Czech Republic and Poland. That being the case, will he assure us that no work has been done in the UK to set up the external action service? As he well knows, the treaty is not live. I would like a clear answer to that.</p>
	<p pid="a.167.0/44">In conclusion, the annual policy strategy provides a welcome insight into the work that the Commission will undertake in the year ahead. We support some of the proposals, such as those on climate change, biodiversity and&mdash;largely&mdash;enlargement. However, the EU must be based on the consent of its peoples. Missing from the document is a recognition that political developments cannot be divorced from the people whom they are supposed to represent. If European political leaders and institutions continue to deny the people their say, they should not be surprised if the institutions they build foster, in some instances, a mixture of cynicism and apathy. Instead of talking about implementing the Lisbon treaty and the furtherance of moves towards a federal European superstate, against the wishes of the people of Europe, the document should have concentrated on real outcomes, and only on areas where by working together, Europe can achieve more productively and for the benefit of its peoples. It should not be trying to create a &quot;United States of Europe&quot;, which those peoples do not want.</p>

	<p pid="a.172.2/1">I am grateful that the hon. Gentleman finally recognised the compliment&mdash;I was not meaning to be disrespectful. My respect for him is abundant.</p>
	<p pid="a.172.2/2">The hon. Member&mdash;indeed, my hon. Friend&mdash;for Beverley and Holderness (Mr. Stuart) misunderstands how the European rules on mobile telephony have changed and how enforced standards were imposed on television across Europe. As a result, we have ended up with a much better television system in Europe than the one in the United States of America. There was a shared pressure between the Commission and some member states that was not shared by others. This is a constant process. The architecture of the EU presents some difficulties. Different bodies play different roles, which is mostly misunderstood by members of the public.</p>
	<p pid="a.172.2/3">Why should the public have to spend their time understanding the difference between the Council of Ministers and the Council of Europe, or the Council of Ministers and the European Parliament, and their different responsibilities? The result is a curious democratic deficit in Europe. There is not one European demos holding a single view at any one time and so able to grant a mandate to the whole of Europe. I have long held that view. It is an important principle, but it makes it difficult to get an agreement across Europe, including on matters on which Britain has led the way. The common agricultural policy is a classic example.</p>
	<p pid="a.172.2/4">The Government would much prefer a radically reformed CAP, but if we had no CAP, which was a position advocated at the beginning of the Union, the danger would be that each member state would simply dole out moneys to their own agricultural bodies and farmers, without any regard to what is happening in other countries. That would have had as detrimental effect on farming in the UK as state aid policies in some of the eastern bloc countries would have had had they continued into the modern era. So we have an important balancing act to perform.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-07-02a.177.4" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1779" speakername="Chris Bryant" colnum="177"  time="016:24:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090702/halltext/90702h0007.htm#09070264000103">
	<p pid="a.177.4/1">The hon. Gentleman said &quot;very simple,&quot; but if it were very simple, doubtless we would already have it. There would be an enormous advantage if we gained first-mover status and were able to develop CCS first. The potential value of that to European economies in relation to China and India would be very significant.</p>
	<p pid="a.177.4/2">I generally take on board the hon. Gentleman's points on energy policy&mdash;several questions were asked about it. We cannot put all our eggs in one basket. One of the difficulties that the country faces is having relied on particular forms of energy, we could become more and more dependent on energy from abroad if we do not take the serious decisions that need to be taken on nuclear energy. The hon. Member for East Dunbartonshire and her party are wholly opposed to that, but in the end it will be difficult to establish the future energy security of the UK, let alone ensure that people are able to keep the lights on and the economy running, if we are unable to include it in our package of measures.</p>
