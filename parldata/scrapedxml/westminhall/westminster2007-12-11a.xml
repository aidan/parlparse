	<p pid="a.1.2/1">I am grateful for this second opportunity to debate the future of our canals. As you may know, Mr. Martlew, I was fortunate to win an Adjournment debate on this very subject in April. Now, as then, I declare an interest; I am a member of the Lichfield branch of the Inland Waterways Association&mdash;and, as of a few months ago, patron of the Lichfield and Hatherton Canals Restoration Trust.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.2/2">I am a keen narrow-boater and I have travelled much of the system. Should there have been any doubt about that, last summer I was running down a towpath in dirty shorts and a sweatshirt and holding a windlass, when I literally bumped into one of the directors of British Waterways. If there was any doubt about my narrow-boating credentials, there is none now.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.2/3">At this point, I welcome the Minister to his first debate on canals and waterways. It is to be hoped that he will be more supportive of the waterways than his predecessor, who was a nincompoop of the first order, and whose departure was marked by the popping of celebratory champagne corks up and down the canals; having followed that marvellous series &quot;Monarchy&quot;, I believe that it is called a feu de joie&mdash;a fire of joy. That hon. Gentleman has already gone down in history as being the worst waterways Minister in living memory, and the new Minister, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1491" name="Jonathan R Shaw">the hon. Member for Chatham and Aylesford (Jonathan Shaw)</phrase>, has been warmly welcomed by waterways societies and individuals keen to see a new approach.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.2/4">The Minister has made at least two visits to canals&mdash;indeed, I believe that he may have made four&mdash;and he has met many organisations and individuals and received a glowing welcome in the boating press. He told me last night that he is seeing another delegation this afternoon.</p>

	<p pid="a.2.0/1">The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right. In April's debate, I said just that. To my mind, although inland waterways carry freight&mdash;it could be argued that such responsibility should therefore lie with the Department for Transport&mdash;they attract so much tourism that I believe that such responsibility should be an important part of the work of the Department for Culture, Media and Sport. Sadly, we are left with what we have; at the moment, it is with DEFRA, and any change would be a decision for the Prime Minister.</p>
	<p pid="a.2.0/2">The April debate focused on the debacle within DEFRA that created the need for in-year cuts&mdash;cuts, we were told, that were a one off and not to be repeated. That has a somewhat hollow ring today. We also heard reports from hon. Members from around the country of their and their constituents' concerns about the effects of further funding cuts. I spoke&mdash;with passion, I hope&mdash;saying that our canals are a national treasure not to be cast aside, but to be nurtured by the Government.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-12-11a.7.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1685" speakername="Michael Fabricant" colnum="7"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm071211/halltext/71211h0001.htm#07121143000474">
	<p pid="a.7.1/1">That is a very valid point. I should not underestimate, however, the capital works to maintain the existing canal network. As good as the existing network is, it is a terrible shame that so many canals were filled in 50 or 60 years ago, because they now have to be reopened in order to complete the network and make it a living, interconnected whole, and the cuts will jeopardise that work.</p>
	<p pid="a.7.1/2">The major restoration schemes that came to fruition in the previous decade, notably the Huddersfield narrow canal and the Rochdale canal, did so only when local authorities&mdash;supported by British Waterways, which is the very point that the hon. Gentleman made&mdash;finally saw that the volunteers needed serious backing. Partnerships were then constructed which were able to drive the schemes forward. It seems that in the current climate, much more is expected of the volunteers. What is needed is local council willingness to adopt restoration schemes and push them forward, instead of just cheering on the dedicated amateurs. However, the local government settlement, which the Government have just announced, means that councils are even more starved of cash.</p>
	<p pid="a.7.1/3">Major national projects need major national funding. Canals are for everybody, not just for people lucky enough to have a boat. Restoring the Lichfield and Hatherton canals will bring enormous regeneration potential to the west midlands conurbation, as well as major benefits to much of Staffordshire. If reports prove to be true, the task may be even more difficult, as British Waterways' shortfall has grown even bigger. Over the weekend of 17 to <phrase class="date" code="2007-11-18">18 November</phrase>, we learned from the press that there were to be further cuts throughout DEFRA. Ministers are to be presented with &pound;130 million of immediate cuts to DEFRA's budget, with radical options for another &pound;140 million of savings. Those cuts would affect all the Department-funded bodies, including British Waterways and the Environment Agency, and they would be an addition to the 5 per cent. year-on-year cuts that have already been mentioned.</p>
	<p pid="a.7.1/4">British Waterways is allegedly at the top of the list for further cuts to funding. Although the comprehensive spending review settlement for the Department appeared to present a real increase to the Department's budget, it emerged only later, during evidence to the Select Committee on Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, that a number of new priorities from Downing street had been added to the Department's funding obligations and that their cost would have to be taken from existing budgets because no additional funds had been allocated. One must assume that DEFRA Ministers are shuddering at the thought that they may face further commitments after the Bali conference on climate change. On top of all that, the effects of this summer's flooding and the breach in the Brecon and Abergavenny canal will create further demands.</p>
	<p pid="a.7.1/5">During the floods, British Waterways played a largely unsung role in removing hundreds of millions of gallons of water from canals and rivers throughout the country&mdash;water that would otherwise have significantly increased the number of towns and villages affected and the depth of the flooding. The programme cost more than &pound;10 million. Is that not an obvious case in which the Treasury should allocate additional funds to waterways managers to cope with such disasters? It was outside the managers' control. That was the very point that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1677" name="David Taylor">the hon. Member for North-West Leicestershire (David Taylor)</phrase> made.</p>
	<p pid="a.7.1/6">I have several additional questions for the Minister to address. I have given him notice of them, so I hope that he will be able to give full answers. Is it morally right that those people who had no involvement in the outbreaks of foot and mouth disease, bluetongue and bird flu should pay the costs? Have Ministers managed to bridge the departmental funding gap without resorting to raiding other agencies' budgets? Have they made an application to the Treasury for increased funding to cover the unexpected costs incurred because of flooding this summer? If they have made such representations, what were the results of their efforts?</p>
	<p pid="a.7.1/7">Does the Minister agree that our canals are a shared resource that we all enjoy, and that costs should not fall disproportionately on the few&mdash;the boaters, who are just 3 per cent. of people who actually enjoy the canals? Has the new cross-departmental committee met, and if so has the Minister been successful in obtaining financial support from other Departments that benefit from our waterways? Has the status report on British Waterways been delivered to Ministers, and if so, what were its conclusions? How is the financial shortfall that I mentioned going to be met? Is the Minister hopeful for the future of our canals, and will he be the champion, who is so desperately needed, in the Government?</p>
	<p pid="a.7.1/8">I hope that the Minister will answer my questions positively. Our inland waterways are too important to be treated in that cavalier manner. The two previous Secretaries of State have both gone on to become Foreign Secretary, leaving a trail of trouble behind them. The first of the two, in particular, deserved to be sacked, not promoted. However, that pattern of career progression should not be relied on; certainly the Minister's direct predecessor did not enjoy that perverse reward.</p>
	<p pid="a.7.1/9">I hope that the new waterways Minister will stand up for our canals and inland waterways and leave them in a better state than he found them in. He can do that only if DEFRA owns up to its responsibilities instead of lurching from one disaster to another. Rather like the Prime Minister, the Minister will find that his good press and good will will rapidly evaporate otherwise.</p>

	<p pid="a.11.1/1">Again, I ask for short speeches.</p>
</speech>
<gidredirect oldgid="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-12-11a.11.2" newgid="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-12-11b.11.2" matchtype="changes"/>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-12-11a.11.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1444" speakername="Roger Williams" colnum="11"  time="010:11:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm071211/halltext/71211h0002.htm#07121143000483">
	<p pid="a.11.2/1">I, too, congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1685" name="Michael Fabricant">the hon. Member for Lichfield (Michael Fabricant)</phrase> on securing the debate and on his continuing interest in the canals and British Waterways. He mentioned the issue to which I wish to refer briefly: the breach in the Monmouthshire and Brecon canal. It is more accurately called that rather than the Abergavenny-Brecon canal.</p>
	<p pid="a.11.2/2">Yesterday, I visited the breach, which is in the constituency of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1719" name="David Davies">the hon. Member for Monmouth (David T.C. Davies)</phrase>. The canal runs from Brecon to Pontypool; it used to run to Newport. Its purpose originally was to take limestone to the steelworks and bring back slag and other materials for agricultural use in the more agricultural areas. It had fallen into disrepair by the 1930s, and only through the intervention of British Waterways and the Brecon Beacons national park was brought back into use. That is an example of the partnerships that British Waterways makes use of so well.</p>
	<p pid="a.11.2/3">Unfortunately, the breach is a catastrophe for the tourism of the area. A huge amount of material came down the hillside and, as the hon. Member for Lichfield said, it blocked the road and caused great distress to local people. The net result is that the canal has been dewatered from the Ashford tunnel to Pontypool, although water remains in it from the Ashford tunnel up to Brecon. The lack of water obviously affects private boat owners, but it also affects commercial operators such as Dragonfly Cruises and Cambrian Cruisers. In particular, I would like to mention Mr. Lewis of Llangattock, who invested a considerable amount of his own money to construct a marina that now sits on a canal that, as far as he is concerned, has no water. That has a major impact on his income.</p>
	<p pid="a.11.2/4">When I met with British Waterways officials yesterday, I was impressed with their reaction to the situation. To deal with the emergency, the organisation is putting in resources that normally would be used in other parts of its operation. An engineer from Birmingham showed me around. I believe that the hon. Member for Lichfield said that dealing with the breach would probably cost &pound;1.5 million, which is a huge sum, given the annual budget of British Waterways. Far more important is the fact that British Waterways believes that the whole of the section from the breach to Pontypool needs to be improved to ensure that it will be fit for purpose, and the cost of that could be between &pound;10 million and &pound;20 million. One can see what a huge dent that would make in the budget of about &pound;50 million that British Waterways has at its disposal.</p>
	<p pid="a.11.2/5">British Waterways has done a grand job in keeping everybody informed as to the development of its understanding of the situation. On <phrase class="date" code="2007-12-19">19 December</phrase>, it will convene a meeting in Crickhowell where the major stakeholders will come together, and it will set out its plan to deal with the situation. It anticipates that the canal will be shut along the major part of its length for between a year and 18 months. The effect on the local economy will be serious indeed. Not only commercial boat owners, but the pubs and hotels that benefit from usage of the canal will be affected. Therefore, I ask the Minister to visit the canal. I know that he will receive many invitations to visit canals, but I believe that this case is important.</p>
	<p pid="a.11.2/6">For some reason that I do not really understand, but which became apparent to me when I was a member of the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Committee when it carried out the inquiry on British Waterways, the Welsh Assembly Government do not fund British Waterways at all, as opposed to the Scottish Parliament, which does. However, I can tell the Minister that the Assembly Member who represents my constituency has made a request to the Welsh Assembly for funds to try to deal with the problem, and none of us will be backward in trying to find other funding from the national park, local authorities and whatever sources are available.</p>
	<p pid="a.11.2/7">I impress it on the Minister that the situation is serious for the local economy and the tourist season that will begin in the spring. I ask him to visit the canal. Such a visit would indicate the seriousness with which the Government take the situation and be greatly appreciated by local people.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-12-11a.14.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1380" speakername="David Heyes" colnum="14"  time="010:24:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm071211/halltext/71211h0003.htm#07121143000485">
	<p pid="a.14.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1685" name="Michael Fabricant">the hon. Member for Lichfield (Michael Fabricant)</phrase> on securing this debate. He has a proud record as a champion of waterways.</p>
	<p pid="a.14.0/2">I share his concerns and those of other hon. Members about the impact that another round of funding cuts will have on our inland waterways. My constituency has a rich canal history. In the centre of Ashton-under-Lyne, the Portland basin is a vital hub in the national canal network at the confluence of the Ashton, Peak Forest and Huddersfield narrow canals. The Ashton canal runs through Droylsden to Manchester to meet the Rochdale and Bridgewater canals, forming part of the Cheshire ring. In recent years, we have seen the successful refurbishment or restoration of all those canals and, most recently, millennium funding has enabled the restoration of the Rochdale canal through Failsworth in the Oldham part of my constituency. That investment has been a key driver in the regeneration of urban spaces alongside those canals throughout my constituency. I am still optimistic that the long-derelict Hollinwood branch canal will be reopened, but I should declare an interest as a member of the Hollinwood canal society.</p>
	<p pid="a.14.0/3">These debates are becoming too frequent, and this is yet another to deplore the level of cuts imposed on British Waterways because of events and issues elsewhere in the portfolio of the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. We had similar debates in December last year and, as the hon. Member for Lichfield reminded us, in April this year.</p>
	<p pid="a.14.0/4">This year, the pressures came from foot and mouth disease, bird flu, blue tongue and, of course, the dreadful flooding in so many parts of the United Kingdom. Those were serious matters and, unfortunately, they may be repeated. The waterways were also affected by the floods, sustaining damage and incurring costs running into millions of pounds.</p>
	<p pid="a.14.0/5">Surely, there is a limit to how much planned and unplanned budget-cutting the waterways can absorb without reversing the significant progress made between 1999 and 2004. The hon. Member for Lichfield was right to acknowledge that the Government were making good progress until recent times. A DEFRA review published in 2005 highlighted much improvement by British Waterways and referred to</p>
	<p pid="a.14.0/6" class="indent">&quot;a step change in the condition, management and reliability of its inland waterway infrastructure and the elimination of the safety backlog.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.14.0/7">It also referred to the following:</p>
	<p pid="a.14.0/8" class="indent">&quot;Completion of six major restoration schemes, costing &pound;177m, creating over 200 miles of new navigation and associated urban and rural regeneration.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.14.0/9">That progress and investment is now at risk.</p>
	<p pid="a.14.0/10">Even with all that investment, some maintenance and repair work never reaches the top of the priority list. Some six or seven years ago, a retaining wall beside the Ashton canal near Ashton-under-Lyne town centre was in danger of collapse. British Waterways made a temporary repair with a large volume of stone chippings piled against the wall. Unfortunately, those stone chippings completely blocked the towpath and part of the waterway. My earliest correspondence with the Ashton-under-Lyne Civic Society and British Waterways on this matter dates back to July 2002. A letter from British Waterways to the civic society dated <phrase class="date" code="2002-08-17">17 August 2002</phrase> states:</p>
	<p pid="a.14.0/11" class="indent">&quot;I would hope that we would be in a position to start works in the Autumn 2003.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.14.0/12">However, a rider states:</p>
	<p pid="a.14.0/13" class="indent">&quot;Please bear in mind that this may change depending on other priorities that are required nearer the time&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.14.0/14">The pile of stone chippings is still there, and the temporary repair is still blocking the towpath, just a short distance from the splendidly restored Portland basin. During my most recent correspondence with British Waterways in October this year, it stated:</p>
	<p pid="a.14.0/15" class="indent">&quot;Unfortunately, we have so many areas in need of works, we must programme all jobs based on priority.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.14.0/16">It continued:</p>
	<p pid="a.14.0/17" class="indent">&quot;Significant cuts in funding have resulted in tight budgetary constraints which have led to further scrutiny on the jobs that we can and cannot complete within the foreseeable future.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.14.0/18">It must surely be clear that while funding for British Waterways remains solely with DEFRA, it will always be the poor relation in the Department with its funding pot being reduced year on year and, even worse, being reduced in-year when events such as flooding and bird or animal diseases impact on DEFRA.</p>
	<p pid="a.14.0/19">We have heard that there is a strong case for other Departments to make a direct contribution to British Waterways' funding to reflect the contribution that it makes to those Departments' agendas. I thought that that was an eminently sensible suggestion, but the Government's response was lukewarm. They said:</p>
	<p pid="a.14.0/20" class="indent">&quot;Other Government Departments have the flexibility to fund the inland waterways sector direct where it can help deliver specific policy requirements.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.14.0/21">If this remains the position, more must be done to protect and to increase DEFRA's funding for British Waterways. Much of the inland waterways network is more than 200 years old, and if funding continues to fall the significant progress earlier in this decade will be undone, the money spent on it will have been wasted, maintenance will fall behind, and it will not be long before there is a safety backlog on the waterways. The pile of stone chippings in Ashton looks set to remain, blocking the towpath for the foreseeable future. I am confident that that testament to the short-sighted view that accords our waterways such low priority will not characterise our new Minister's approach.</p>

	<p pid="a.23.1/1">My hon. Friend remembers that he is the chairman of an organisation, unlike the hon. Member for Lichfield.</p>
	<p pid="a.23.1/2">My hon. Friend suggested that he is hard-up; I am sure that he will get a lot of sympathy in the House and in the wider community for that. The issue of licences relates to the issue of boat owners paying the costs. It is important to get the matter in perspective. Boat owners pay around 10 per cent. of the costs. The rest is paid for by all of us&mdash;by the taxpayer.</p>
	<p pid="a.23.1/3">On a serious note, my hon. Friend talked about regeneration opportunities. There has been &pound;7 billion-worth of waterside regeneration in recent years&mdash;I stress &pound;7 billion. I have seen it at first hand, and my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1380" name="David Heyes">the Member for Ashton-under-Lyne (David Heyes)</phrase> mentioned his area. My hon. Friend the Member for Derby, North mentioned industrial heritage, and was right to point out that the wonderful roof at St. Pancras was made by a former constituent of his.</p>
	<p pid="a.23.1/4">When hon. Members get involved in local projects, I urge them to ensure that the projects offer opportunities for skills training. It is vital that the opportunity to pass skills down is taken, so I encourage engagement with learning and skills partners.</p>
	<p pid="a.23.1/5">My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1834" name="Charlotte Atkins">the Member for Staffordshire, Moorlands (Charlotte Atkins)</phrase>, who has a proud track record of championing the waterways, mentioned funding, and talked about opportunities for regeneration projects and the impact of the floods. Many hon. Members mentioned the unsung heroes, and I am sure that BW staff will be grateful for their comments. It has made representations to the Pitt review, which is designed to learn lessons from the floods. It will look at how the Government dealt with floods across the board, and BW is a central part of it. On funding, as I said, we need to put BW on a sustainable footing. There is a review group with which we are working closely to ensure that that happens, so that we can meet more of the aspirations that we and our constituents have for the waterways.</p>
	<p pid="a.23.1/6"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1783" name="Susan Kramer">The hon. Member for Richmond Park (Susan Kramer)</phrase> mentioned the need for long-term funding, the opportunities presented by the Olympics and for taking freight on our waterways. She said that it is a Cinderella service, but I do not accept that. DEFRA has many delivery bodies, but BW does not receive the smallest amount. It might interest her to know that it gets more than some of the national parks, which have enjoyed and welcomed a considerable increase in funding in this year's budget. Like the national parks, waterways have a contribution to make in delivering on sustainability. She also referred to the fact that Tesco and Sainsbury's put freight on canals.</p>
	<p pid="a.23.1/7"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1896" name="Anne McIntosh">The hon. Member for Vale of York (Miss McIntosh)</phrase> asked me to be open and honest about funding. I hope that I have done so and that I have provided some insight into the difficult discussions that all Departments have at this time of year. The Department is committed to British Waterways, to establishing better relations, and to ensuring that stakeholders have a say on how the network is developed. We want to meet the aspirations of the thousands of people who enjoy the waterways and the rich heritage that they bring to communities up and down the country.</p>
	<p pid="a.23.1/8">I am grateful to the hon. Member for Lichfield for initiating the debate. I am proud to be the Minister with responsibility for waterways, and I look forward to working with hon. Members in the months to come.</p>

	<p pid="a.28.1/1">I thank my hon. Friend for that intervention. Let history be the judge is all that I can say.</p>
	<p pid="a.28.1/2">We in this country have a tradition of showing gratitude to our veterans for their services, and celebrating their achievements, yet veterans of the Malaysia campaign are not allowed to wear the PJM. To add insult to injury, the HD Committee agreed in March 2007 to review its original decision but concluded that it should be upheld. In answer to a parliamentary question, my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1533" name="Margaret Beckett">the Member for Derby, South (Margaret Beckett)</phrase>, then Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, said:</p>
	<p pid="a.28.1/3" class="indent">&quot;After examination of the issues involved, the policies underpinning the operation of the UK honours system and particular application of these policies in the case of the PJM, it concluded that the original decision to allow exceptions to two of the major principles of the British Honours System&mdash;the double medalling rule and the five year rule&mdash;should be upheld.&quot;&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2007-03-23.1223"><i>Official Report</i>, 23 March 2007; Vol. 458, c. 1223W</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="a.28.1/4">My God, if I could close my eyes, I could imagine Sir Humphrey saying that in &quot;Yes, Minister&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.28.1/5">I raised the matter with my right hon. Friends the Prime Minister and the Foreign Secretary. I am grateful for their keen interest in the matter, but I have to say that, so far, I have received the same old tired responses. I was told that it has been a long-standing policy to say that</p>
	<p pid="a.28.1/6" class="indent">&quot;the wearing of non-British awards will not be approved or permitted for events or service that took place more than five years before initial consideration or in connection with events that took place in the distant past.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.28.1/7">Again, who says that &quot;Yes, Minister&quot; is not the training manual for the civil service? My right hon. Friend the Prime Minister, whom I greatly admire and support, is a radical man. He wrote an excellent biography on the great socialist James Maxton, in which he quoted Maxton talking about poverty:</p>
	<p pid="a.28.1/8" class="indent">&quot;Poverty was manmade and was therefore open to change.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.28.1/9">I have no doubt that my right hon. Friend's Government have little sympathy with those who want Britain to cling to outmoded and antiquated systems that belong in the 19th century, not the 21st.</p>
	<p pid="a.28.1/10">To paraphrase James Maxton, the system that denies our Malaysia veterans the right to wear the PJM is man-made and therefore open to change. The only conclusion that I can draw from the attitude of the HD Committee is that it seems more important to uphold the British honours system than to honour British servicemen and women, some of whom have laid down their lives for our country. Those soldiers faced some terrible conditions. One can only imagine what it was like fighting in the jungles in those times, so how must they feel when they hear about the attitude that we have taken and our refusal to allow them to wear the PJM?</p>
	<p pid="a.28.1/11">One veteran wrote to tell me that he had been advised by a MOD civil servant that he could stuff his PJM back in his Kellogg's packet, because the medal status meant nothing to him. Shame on any official who speaks to a veteran in that way. Many of those lads are now in their 60s and 70s, and they grow fewer in number each year. The time is right to make a decision and rightly allow them to wear this honour. All they ask is to be able to wear with pride the medal that they earned, alongside other veterans who parade across Britain on Remembrance Sunday.</p>
	<p pid="a.28.1/12">I have met many of these men and I pay tribute to their campaign. Their quiet dignity is in stark contrast to the actions of civil servants who are hiding behind the actions of some shadowy Committee. I have tried to find out how this Committee operates. I am told that the main Committee meets just twice a year, and its minutes are not made public. The idea of transparency and open government do not apply there.</p>
	<p pid="a.28.1/13">There are also stories circulating that the Committee often takes decision not by members meeting each other, but by them telephoning or e-mailing each other. It is a good thing that we did not have e-mails in 1957 when some of those conscripted might have not turned up to fight, but sent an e-mail of support. Where would we have been then?</p>
	<p pid="a.28.1/14">I know that many Malaysia veterans have lobbied parliamentary colleagues, the HD Committee itself and Ministers, and still we are no further forward. The veterans have been left confused and disenchanted by the whole process. They deserve far better, and I believe that we have to deliver that for them. Those veterans have done their bit. We should honour them and recognise that the medal they have been given is not some second-class award, but an award given by an ally and friend in recognition of service provided by British servicemen and women. Their cause is honourable: they simply wish to receive fair and even-handed treatment from the British Government and to be afforded the same right as their comrades in other Commonwealth countries to wear the medal that they have earned.</p>
	<p pid="a.28.1/15">I also know that if the HD Committee changes its mind, we will be told that that is setting a precedent. I am sure that I am not alone in this Chamber in thinking that, throughout my political life, I have been warned that if I said this or that, or did this or did that, I would be setting a precedent. I am sure that when the first human being stood up and began to walk on two legs rather than crawl around on all fours, there must have been a group of Neanderthals, not unlike the HD Committee, who tut-tutted, wrung their hands and said, &quot;This is setting a precedent.&quot; That is precisely what I am asking my hon. Friend the Minister to do now.</p>
	<p pid="a.28.1/16">My hon. Friend the Minister is a good man and we know each other well. I am extremely fond of him and I hold him in high regard. He is at his best when he is most eloquent, and his most persuasive when he says what he thinks, although from time to time, that has got him into trouble, as I well know. May I invite him to tear up the notes that his officials have given to him and speak from what he feels inside&mdash;from what he knows to be right. He will not be alone, because I have received many e-mails from across Britain and from across the world from people who are saying, &quot;We must do something to put this injustice right.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.28.1/17">When there is some outrage of this sort, people look to Parliament for a solution. Something so shameful as the way that the Malaysia veterans have been treated deserves our attention. The British people look to this place, the Parliament of Great Britain, to right an obvious wrong. We are privileged to be the elected representatives of the people. If Parliament turns its back on the legitimate claims of the Malaysia veterans, where can they turn after that? In this day and age, we cannot allow a Committee with no ministerial involvement, that appears to meet in secret, that is not transparent and that appears not to be accountable to Parliament to take such arbitrary decisions that affect so many of our brave men and women.</p>
	<p pid="a.28.1/18">I say this to my Government&mdash;no, I say this to our Government, because whatever our persuasion, they are the Government of the whole United Kingdom: if the members of the HD committee will not change their mind and advise Her Majesty the Queen that the medal can be worn, sweep them aside and ignore them. Like the Governments of Australia and of New Zealand, advise Her Majesty the Queen that the medal should be worn.</p>
	<p pid="a.28.1/19">This is the Government who had the courage to pardon those who were shot at dawn during the first world war. I appeal to the same Government to demonstrate the same sense of justice by allowing the Malaysia veterans to wear the PJM. Then we could send a message to those who served our country in the past, but also to those who are serving our country now in Iraq, Afghanistan and other areas around the world. They would understand that we will always honour, cherish and care for them. We must grasp this chance to deliver justice for the Malaysia veterans.</p>

In my opinion, he was one of the best Veterans Ministers, and I congratulate him on the work that he did during his tenure of that post and on the commitment that he has shown to veterans ever since.</p>
	<p pid="a.38.0/2">My right hon. Friend seldom makes Ministers' lives trouble-free and harmonious, and he certainly has not done so in this debate. As he pointed out, I have been in great difficulties many times&mdash;as a climber, on the great north walls of the Alps, and as a swimmer I have swum too far out to sea. I also got into difficulties on picket lines outside power stations and pits a quarter of a century ago. I have been in grave difficulties in this place many times, as well. However, this is the most difficult case I have had to argue against&mdash;I am not sure that I am up to it really.</p>
	<p pid="a.38.0/3">I know only too well that debating Chambers in the Palace of Westminster can be very inhospitable for Ministers. Indeed, my right hon. Friend and hon. Members have contributed in a fine way to the debate, and I find myself confronting as effective a resistance to the continuation of established Government policy as I have faced on any issue. It is very difficult to construct an argument that resists their case in defence of servicemen being allowed to wear the Pingat Jasa Malaysia medal alongside other awards that they may have won for courage and tenacity displayed in circumstances far more dangerous than any climbing route, swimming adventure, picket line or, indeed, Dispatch Box that a Minister might stand next to.</p>
	<p pid="a.38.0/4">Let us remind ourselves that it is a great testimony to our veterans that His Majesty the King of Malaysia, the Malaysian Government and people wanted to honour them with that medal. The veterans played a valorous role supporting Malaysia&mdash;Malaya, as it then was&mdash;in its early days. Our veterans provided the support that the Malayans so desperately needed in the 1950s and early 1960s, and it was only a short time before some were back there supporting the newly independent Malaysia in her armed conflict with Indonesia, which ended finally in 1966.</p>
	<p pid="a.38.0/5">In the past 50 years since Malaysia's independence, our bilateral relations have gone from strength to strength. We have extensive and positive links on a range of issues, from education and climate change to sustainable development and defence. We have a shared history and culture, and many Malaysians have developed extensive links with the United Kingdom. I am delighted that His Royal Highness the Duke of York represented the United Kingdom at Malaysia's celebrations of its half century of independence in August this year.</p>
	<p pid="a.38.0/6">I am also delighted that a large number of British veterans attended the celebrations, and that an exception was made to our rules, as laid down by the Committee on the Grant of Honours, Decorations and Medals, to allow those veterans to accept His Majesty the King of Malaysia's generous gesture in awarding the PJM. Those people who were able to travel to Malaysia for the 50th anniversary celebrations were, as my briefing puts it, exceptionally permitted to wear the medal in Kuala Lumpur. However, I fear that there are no plans&mdash;I am told this by the HD committee&mdash;to allow unrestricted wear of that medal, which, it argues would be contrary to some important rules governing the acceptance and wearing of honours and decorations, which have been long-standing practice in this country. That is what I want to consider in the time left to me, because I have got to try to explain why it is so.</p>
	<p pid="a.38.0/7">I am informed that allowing the PJM medal to be accepted required the HD committee to agree a special exception to two principles governing the acceptance and wear of foreign awards. The first, which we have heard about, is double medalling, whereby a British award has been given for the same service. The second is the five-year rule, which does not allow medals to be accepted for events that took place more than five years ago.</p>
	<p pid="a.38.0/8">The following point struck me when <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1724" name="Julian Lewis">the hon. Member for New Forest, East (Dr. Lewis)</phrase> spoke. I do not know the exact date when British soldiers went to Afghanistan, but it must be getting on for six&mdash;certainly five&mdash;years ago. It was probably February 2002. That is almost as long as the second world war, and although some acts of valour will have been rewarded already, it might be a long time before some of the ongoing events there receive full recognition. The question of the time span is important, and we must consider it in the future. Indeed, we must consider much else besides.</p>
	<p pid="a.38.0/9">Both rules&mdash;it is argued&mdash;long standing and fundamental to the integrity of the British honours system. The five-year rule, and an earlier two-year rule, date back to 1855, and the double medalling rule is also long standing. I was very grateful to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1922" name="Andrew Murrison">the hon. Member for Westbury (Dr. Murrison)</phrase> for his compelling description of why some rules are in place. He gave us a fair and balanced description.</p>
	<p pid="a.38.0/10">The British honours system&mdash;I am told&mdash;has a long history of recognising meritorious service and of preserving the integrity of Crown servants. It guards against something that the HD committee calls medal proliferation&mdash;a very interesting term. The committee should go to some of the countries that I go to occasionally if it wants to see medal proliferation. I understand that the tradition has been upheld by numerous reviews. As my right hon. Friend told us, our practice differs from that of some other countries. The British honours system is truly meritorious. Honours and decorations are highly valued, and the system is administered scrupulously, as the hon. Member for Westbury told us. However, I have also been led to understand that it allows flexibility for special circumstances. My right hon. Friend gave us some examples, such as allowing veterans of the Malaysian campaign to accept but not to wear the PJM medal.</p>
	<p pid="a.38.0/11">In my view, that situation adds an anomalous variable to an equation that is already extremely difficult to understand. The HD committee's argument is that the vast majority of the veterans who have received the PJM medal have also been awarded the British general service medal for the risk and rigour of their service in Malaysia. I do not know whether this will provide an answer to the hon. Member for New Forest, East, but there was only a short period, from 1960 to 1962, when the risk and rigour in Malaysia was not deemed&mdash;by those who do the deeming&mdash;sufficient to award a medal to British troops stationed there. For the rest of the period covered by the PJM medal, between 1957 and 1966, those who were thought to merit recognition by the award of a medal, and who fulfilled the appropriate time criteria, were awarded the general service medal with the appropriate clasp, the Malaya bar.</p>
	<p pid="a.38.0/12">The qualifying periods were different for service afloat and service on land. Some naval personnel did not receive a naval general service medal for their time served off the coast of Malaysia, and they do not consider receiving the PJM medal to be double medalling, because they do not have a British medal for their service. I am told that the qualifying periods were carefully considered at the time, and there were obviously good reasons for making the naval qualifying period longer. However, the HD committee argues that the absence of a general service medal should not, in itself, mean automatic qualification for a foreign award.</p>
	<p pid="a.38.0/13">The HD committee advises Her Majesty the Queen on all honours matters.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-12-11a.51.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1467" speakername="Ivan Lewis" colnum="51"  time="012:43:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm071211/halltext/71211h0008.htm#07121143000540">
	<p pid="a.51.1/1">It is unacceptable to place older people in inappropriate settings. The decisions should be focused on the needs of individuals and their care requirements. I recently issued new guidance, which took effect on <phrase class="date" code="2007-10-01">1 October</phrase>, on the funding of continuing care, because we know that many primary care trusts have been attempting to abdicate their responsibility and to define particular care packages as social care when they clearly include a nursing element. I hope that the new guidance will begin to change some of the practices that the hon. Gentleman has in mind, but equally, we must be clear about what high-quality commissioning really is. Part of it is a question of removing business from providers that do not offer quality to older people.</p>
	<p pid="a.51.1/2">Yesterday, we made announcements on reform of adult social care, including giving far more power and control to older people and their families, with personal budgets and a choice about where they want their care to come from; that is another powerful way of influencing the system. If those people have maximum control, it is far more likely that they will choose care providers who can offer what they need and want, rather than homes that do not provide good standards. Another element of yesterday's announcement was making it clear that we see advocacy as very important for older people who do not have a family member to support them in making choices about their care services.</p>
	<p pid="a.51.1/3">I agree entirely with the hon. Gentleman about human rights. The current state of affairs is an anomaly, and neither Government nor Parliament intended that publicly funded residents living in private sector establishments would not be covered by the Human Rights Act 1998. That is an unintended consequence, and we need to put it right. The Government have decided that the appropriate time to do that is when we consult on the new rights and responsibilities Bill, in the context of a new constitutional settlement, on which the Ministry of Justice will lead. The change that the hon. Gentleman seeks will be part of the process; we must put the anomaly right.</p>
	<p pid="a.51.1/4">I agree with the hon. Gentleman about complaints, too. Publicly funded residents have the right to go through local authority complaints processes if they are dissatisfied with the way in which an individual home has dealt with their complaint. The problem is that self-funders, of whom there are an increasing number, have nowhere to go if they are dissatisfied with the way in which the provider investigates their complaints. The regulator, as things now stand, does not investigate individual complaints. On receipt of such a complaint, the regulator can visit the home, examine practices there and take action, but they cannot investigate the individual complaint. That is an important distinction. I am committed to considering how that can be put right. In a modern care system, it is unacceptable that self-funders should not have the protection that other residents have of being able to rely on an independent element in the process, if they are dissatisfied with the handling of a complaint by the very home that they are complaining about.</p>
	<p pid="a.51.1/5">I have been leading a campaign in the past year to put respect for the dignity of older people at the heart of all care services, be they on NHS wards, in residential and nursing homes or, as is increasingly the case, in home and day care services. That is crucial. Some of the issues are about culture and attitude. We must make it clear that it is non-negotiable that, as a minimum, older people have the right to maximum dignity. Too often in various care settings, dignity is being disregarded. I shall continue and extend our national dignity campaign, and I shall be making announcements in the coming period about how we intend to do that. There is an important role to be played in every community by dignity champions&mdash;individuals, whether professionals or volunteers, in a variety of communities and care settings who are saying that we must prioritise the dignity of older people. The hon. Gentleman referred to dementia, and we are working with people in the health and social care worlds on producing the first ever national dementia strategy, which we shall publish next year. Many of the issues that he raised will be covered in that strategy.</p>
	<p pid="a.51.1/6">Finally, the care system does not function in a vacuum, apart from the rest of society; there are cultural and attitudinal factors in our view of older people. When I said that I want us to be as outraged by the abuse of an older person as we rightly are by the abuse of a child, I meant it. I do not think that we are at that point yet, and that should be a matter for concern. However, cultural and attitudinal change takes a long time. There is no one solution and no magic wand. Such change requires us all, at national and local level, in families and communities, to take responsibility. That is one of the great issues faced by society, because more and more people must make incredibly difficult choices for ageing parents and elderly relatives. Thankfully, more and more of us will live longer. Now, from the margins of public policy, the issue has become one of the great challenges that Government and society face; it is a demographic challenge. We must be up to the mark and ensure that older people have the quality of life, dignity and protection that they deserve in a civilised society.</p>

	<p pid="a.53.1/1">I am grateful for the opportunity to debate Cadbury's proposed closure of its Somerdale factory at Keynsham in north-east Somerset.</p>
	<p pid="a.53.1/2">The only way that we can properly understand the huge impact and significance of the proposal is to look briefly at the history of chocolate making in the area. It is fair to say that Bristol has led the UK, and arguably the world, in chocolate manufacture. In the mid-1700s, chocolate was being manufactured in the many small factories in the city. Many of those factories amalgamated to form J.S. Fry &amp; Sons, which, after the first world war, amalgamated with Cadbury's, the other well known chocolate manufacturer.</p>
	<p pid="a.53.1/3">Following that amalgamation in 1919, the company moved to its Somerdale site in Keynsham in about 1935. The site was specially chosen and purpose built, and it reflected the values and ethos of the Quaker families who owned and ran both Fry's and Cadbury's. It was a large site of many hundreds of acres. The idea was that the workers were not only units of production, but complete human beings. It was not only morally right to treat them well; it ended up being good business practice.</p>
	<p pid="a.53.1/4">Of course, many people will be familiar with brands such as Cream Eggs, Mini Eggs and, perhaps most famously, Crunchies, which are made at Somerdale. Amazingly, someone calculated that a week's production of Crunchies would stretch to the moon and back. That is how prolific the company is in making that famous product and others.</p>
	<p pid="a.53.1/5">It must also be understood that changes in chocolate manufacture over the years have resulted in greater production with fewer people. At its peak in the 1950s, Somerdale employed about 5,000 workers. Ten years ago, that had fallen to 1,000, and there are currently 500. Of course, for those directly affected, the proposal to close the factory in 2010 is a great shock and a worry, which I am sure we appreciate.</p>
	<p pid="a.53.1/6">Cadbury's says that it proposes to close Somerdale because it faces an increasingly competitive global market&mdash;arguably, confectionary is one of the most competitive businesses. Cadbury's looked at competitors such as Mars at Slough, Terry's, formerly of York, and Nestl&eacute;, and saw that they had reduced their UK work force and moved production abroad. Although Cadbury's is one of the last to reduce its work force in that way, it says that such action is inevitable if it is to remain competitive and secure the jobs of UK workers in future.</p>
	<p pid="a.53.1/7">The company accepts that it is terribly sad to lay people off. It has had to close three factories around the country in the past five years and prides itself on working hard to provide good redundancy packages and training. Cadbury's says that recent history shows that, by the time of closure, more than 90 per cent. of the work force will have found new jobs. It argues that, in a constituency such as mine, which in recent years has had the lowest unemployment in the UK, it is possible to ensure, with considerable effort and concern, to ensure that the impact is minimal, although what is happening is sad, regrettable and awful.</p>
	<p pid="a.53.1/8">We must also understand that the proposed closure, as well as being a terrible blow for those who will be directly affected financially by it, will also be an economic blow to the town of Keynsham. Small business people in particular are concerned that the factory closure will have an impact on their businesses, and they fear that they may end up closing or losing much of their trade. The truth is that about a quarter of the work force live in Keynsham, so the issue goes wider than my constituency. It affects part of greater Bristol, Bath and much of north-east Somerset. Indeed, the whole west country could be described as having an involvement with the Cadbury's factory at Keynsham.</p>
	<p pid="a.53.1/9">The proposal is alarming for people in the area. The number of workers has gradually fallen over the years, but previous staff reductions were dealt with through voluntary redundancy or by people deciding to take early retirement. Although just fewer than half the work force are aged 50-plus and might therefore benefit considerably from the packages on offer for early retirement, it would be wrong to underestimate how big a blow the closure will be to Keynsham, north-east Somerset, Bristol, Bath and the west country as a whole.</p>
	<p pid="a.53.1/10">The social impact of the proposed closure needs to be emphasised. The terrific traditions of the Quaker families who ran Cadbury's and Fry's&mdash;I should declare an interest in that I come from a Quaker family and understand their values&mdash;meant that the company provided sport and leisure facilities for its work force. In fact, those facilities were not only for the work force; they were available for use by the local community and people further afield.</p>
	<p pid="a.53.1/11">Indeed, Keynsham relies heavily on those facilities for sports such as cricket, hockey and football. In fairness to Cadbury's, it has indicated to me that it intends to keep the Fry club&mdash;the on-site sporting and social centre&mdash;so that it can be used even if the factory is closed. That is welcome relief to those who pursue sport and leisure activities at the site, but it does not take away the pain and discomfort for those who are economically reliant on the factory.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-12-11a.55.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1904" speakername="Dan Norris" colnum="55"  time="013:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm071211/halltext/71211h0009.htm#07121143000545">
	<p pid="a.55.1/1">I thank my hon. Friend for her helpful intervention. I am not sure whether the figure is 98 per cent., but the vast bulk of the production will certainly come back to the UK. It beggars belief that that is an environmentally sound thing to do.</p>
	<p pid="a.55.1/2">When I asked Cadbury's about that, it said that the new plant in Poland in which it proposes to invest will be so efficient that it will offset the carbon footprint of transporting all that chocolate to the UK. However, having said that, surely the environmental impact or benefit would be that much greater if Cadbury's invested in Somerdale. I think that Cadbury's somewhat undermines its own argument.</p>
	<p pid="a.55.1/3">The two key concerns are the short-termism of Cadbury's economic thinking plus the environmental aspects. Cadbury's argues that this is all necessary because of the competitive market in which it operates and that it fears that if it does not stay competitive, like the other confectionary companies that it competes with directly, it risks being bought out by some other company from abroad.</p>
	<p pid="a.55.1/4">Cadbury's wants to ensure that, by having a leaner, smaller work force, it is more robust in respect of such challenges in the years ahead and that it remains a well-known, world-renowned British name. I have to hope that Cadbury's calculations are right and that its thinking is right, although, for the two key reasons I have mentioned, I am not happy.</p>
	<p pid="a.55.1/5">I recognise that the Government have done wonderful things with the economy. The management of the economy under the Labour Government for the past 10 years has been hugely impressive&mdash;it is the envy of the western industrialised world in respect of unemployment figures&mdash;but we have low unemployment not because we do not have factory closures or redundancies or whatever, but because we can create more jobs than are lost. Clearly, that is a vital part of why Britain is thriving economically in the world, even with the global challenges that we face. We are in a better position to face those challenges because of the past 10 years, but nothing is omnipresent and totally consistent. I ask my right hon. Friend the Minister for Competitiveness to think about that.</p>
	<p pid="a.55.1/6">Although we must consider the nation's overall benefits and what gains there need to be for the economy, and one thing and another, when thinking about a factory such as Somerdale, which is so well known and so well established and which has been profitable throughout its existence, it is hard to understand why closure might be the right thing, particularly if people are directly affected, but even if they are not.</p>
	<p pid="a.55.1/7">I am sure that my right hon. Friend the Minister will be thinking carefully and constantly reviewing the Government's strategy in relation to this matter, but people find the proposed closure hard to understand, particularly when there is such a long and great tradition. Chocolate making has been happening in Bristol since the mid-1700s and it is worrying to think that there could be no chocolate manufacturer in the area.</p>
	<p pid="a.55.1/8">We had a foretaste of this situation some years ago&mdash;in the constituency of my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1455" name="Kerry McCarthy">the Member for Bristol, East (Kerry McCarthy)</phrase>, I think&mdash;when Elizabeth Shaw shut its factory. I cannot remember when that was, although I think it was more than 10 years ago. Although we had that foretaste, I do not think that anyone ever thought it would apply to Somerdale, which was considered a much bigger, much more established factory.</p>
	<p pid="a.55.1/9">I want to thank various people who have been active in the campaign opposing the proposal to close the factory. Not least, I want to thank the Bristol <i>Evening Post</i> and its editor, Mike Norton, who has shown that local and regional newspapers can go back to the traditional values of in-depth reporting and explanation. In particular, I also praise Julie Harding, the senior reporter on the <i>Evening Post</i>, whom I have known for 25 years. She has written some amazingly illustrative and insightful pieces about the proposal to close the site. It is encouraging to see the detail being put out there so that people can make their minds up and make an informed decision about what Cadbury's is doing.</p>
	<p pid="a.55.1/10">I want to thank Unite the Union, which has organised many events and continues to do so, and has strong views, which it makes clear. I am grateful to it. However, most of all, I thank the work force&mdash;not just those Somerdale, but other Cadbury workers all over the country who have attended various rallies and events to show their complete opposition to the proposed closure.</p>
	<p pid="a.55.1/11">I also thank the community of Keynsham and the surrounding area, where people have collected petitions. I am conducting a survey by questionnaire, as well. Lots of people have done sterling work because they feel so passionately and strongly about this subject.</p>
	<p pid="a.55.1/12">I invite my right hon. Friend the Minister to come to the Somerdale factory, if he can possibly do so. Failing that, perhaps he will invite a delegation from the factory to see him. I appreciate that he is very busy, but it would be great if he could get a feel for the site by visiting it. I want him to hear from the workers and those directly affected, because they have a passion that is impressive and insight that will inform him. I should like to think that, after meeting those people directly and hearing from them, he would be minded to talk to Cadbury's board about its proposals to close the site and not least work through my two key criticisms of the short-termism of this plan, as well as the environmental impact.</p>
	<p pid="a.55.1/13">The closure proposal is terrible, but it would be even worse if Cadbury's and the rest of the Keynsham community were to look back and say that the decision was utterly and completely wrong but was still pushed forward. That would be a tragedy of Shakespearean proportions.</p>
	<p pid="a.55.1/14">We all hope and continue to fight to keep the factory open, but whatever happens the community of Keynsham is resilient and tough and will overcome the hurdles facing it. However, I hope that it will not be necessary for it to deal with the loss of an iconic brand, Fry's, and the closure of a factory that has been hugely significant for the whole community for many a long year and has affected many generations.</p>
	<p pid="a.55.1/15">When Cadbury's comes to make its final calculations and assessment when the formal consultation finishes in the middle of next month, I hope that it concludes that there are other ways to make the competitive savings that it needs without needing to close this wonderful factory and lay off the wonderful workers at Somerdale who have been a dedicated staff for many years, produced profits for Cadbury's and deserve to be treated better than to face a proposed closure.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-12-11a.57.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1563" speakername="Stephen Timms" speakeroffice="The Minister for Competitiveness"  colnum="57"  time="013:18:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm071211/halltext/71211h0009.htm#07121143000546">
	<p pid="a.57.0/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1904" name="Dan Norris">the Member for Wansdyke (Dan Norris)</phrase> on securing the debate. His concern about the potential loss of jobs in manufacturing will be shared by many colleagues throughout the House and it is shared by the Government. I pay tribute to him for his campaigning on this issue and for the way in which he has presented his case today and throughout the campaign.</p>
	<p pid="a.57.0/2">I vividly remember the dismay in my constituency when a long-established factory from the same group&mdash;a Trebor factory&mdash;was closed 25 years ago. Today the company name is still prominently displayed on the building, but that is all that is left. I understand very well the degree of alarm that my hon. Friend has described among those who work in the factory, following the announcement in October, and I want to express sympathy for everybody affected. I well understand the strong local concern, which he has expressed, about the impact on the local economy and the local community in Keynsham and north-east Somerset, especially when chocolate making on the site remains profitable, Crunchie bars remain popular and chocolate making in the area goes back so many years.</p>
	<p pid="a.57.0/3">In October, the House received a very large deputation from the Unite manufacturing lobby. My hon. Friend was among those hon. Members supporting manufacturing at that event. There is also concern about the state of UK manufacturing more generally.</p>
	<p pid="a.57.0/4">Manufacturing still accounts for one seventh of our national wealth in the UK, more than half of our exports, and three quarters of our business research and development. About 3 million people work in manufacturing, and manufacturing continues to be essential to the continuing health of the British economy. Since the summer, a string of reports from the Engineering Employers Federation and others have underlined the extent to which, after some very hard times, manufacturing in Britain is doing well. For example, last year we made almost twice as many cars in Britain as we did 25 years ago and we exported more UK-made car engines than ever before.</p>
	<p pid="a.57.0/5">In recent months, I have visited a number of manufacturing companies in Hull, Sussex, Wales and, last week, in Sheffield, and I have been impressed by their strong commitment to, and confidence in, competing successfully with the best in the world. It is striking that the manufacturing sector is characterised by intense commitment and pride among those who work in it. My hon. Friend drew attention to the commitment and pride in the work force at the factory in his constituency.</p>
	<p pid="a.57.0/6">Food and drink is the biggest single part of the manufacturing industry. It accounts for about one sixth of the total sector. If one includes manufacturers, retailers, food service and wholesalers, it accounts for a total estimated gross value added of around &pound;70 billion, and almost 9 per cent. of national full-time employment.</p>
	<p pid="a.57.0/7">We have an increasingly globalised and competitive environment. Companies have to be allowed to decide the most profitable way in which to run their businesses in order to grow. My hon. Friend referred to the fact that some of the company's main rivals, including Nestl&eacute; in York, Terry's, and Mars in Slough have decided to relocate production to other countries. At the same time, however, I would like to underline that many companies from outside the UK have decided to set up and develop their businesses within Britain with foreign direct investment. We are the world's second largest recipient of foreign direct investment by overseas companies, creating many UK jobs.</p>
	<p pid="a.57.0/8">As part of its restructuring, Cadbury Trebor Bassett announced the proposed closure at the beginning of October. The restructuring proposals within UK chocolate manufacturing are intended to achieve greater supply chain efficiencies. It is welcome that the company is committed to investing in UK manufacturing. My hon. Friend cited the example of Bourneville. The company, led by Unite, is currently talking to employee representatives. It is committed to consulting fully on its proposals and has provided the full business case for the proposal and all the relevant details requested by the consultative representatives. I know that the group has met on five occasions, with a further three meetings planned before the end of the consultation. We are about halfway through now. There has been contact with others locally, including the local authority.</p>
	<p pid="a.57.0/9">I agree that it is important that the company reflects carefully on its decision. It must look at all the factors that my hon. Friend highlighted before it finalises its conclusion, including transport costs, the likely future carbon costs&mdash;increasingly the cost of carbon is factored into commercial costs, which was underlined by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1455" name="Kerry McCarthy">the Member for Bristol, East (Kerry McCarthy)</phrase>&mdash;and the fact that the vast majority of production will be consumed in the UK. There is still a strong attachment to UK-made products in the UK market.</p>
	<p pid="a.57.0/10">My hon. Friend the Member for Wansdyke asked me to visit the factory. I will check my diary in response to that invitation. It will be difficult to make that visit before the end of the consultation period, but I will gladly meet a deputation from the factory in Westminster if he can arrange that. Also, I will discuss any concerns that arise with the company.</p>
	<p pid="a.57.0/11">Cadbury Trebor Bassett describe investing in the community as a &quot;business imperative.&quot; In the event of the closure going ahead, I welcome its commitment to provide resources to help employees find new jobs, to retrain those who wish to learn new skills, to provide independent financial advice and to support the maintenance of the Fry Club in Keynsham.</p>
	<p pid="a.57.0/12">If the closure goes ahead, my Department, through the Government office for the south-west, will work closely with the local authority and other regional and local agencies to ensure that there is a co-ordinated local response to assist those who are faced with redundancy to find new jobs and to secure redevelopment of the site to bring in new employment. We would establish a taskforce, and the efforts of Jobcentre Plus would be very important in helping Cadbury employees find alternative work and to consider options for retraining. The taskforce would include representatives of a number of Departments or agencies, including Jobcentre Plus, the Learning and Skills Development Agency, the South West of England Regional Development Agency, the local business link, the Government office for the south west and the local authority.</p>
	<p pid="a.57.0/13">The taskforce would work closely with the rapid response service of Jobcentre Plus, which helps people to identify transferable skills and training needs, to obtain training and certification that is linked to the local labour market and to overcome barriers to taking up specific job offers. I know that the district employment engagement manager has already been in touch with the company. There has already been a meeting with the local Jobcentre manager to discuss how Jobcentre Plus might help if the decision to proceed with the closure is made. The South West of England Development Agency will also be very active on potential future development and future investment in the surrounding area. As my hon. Friend said, the context is a very successful economy in and around Bristol with a lot of inward investment, including a &pound;500 million retail development in central Bristol, which I gather is due to open next year, creating up to 4,000 new jobs at big retail developments in Bath. The overall economy of the Bath and Bristol area is one of the strongest outside London.</p>
	<p pid="a.57.0/14">On <phrase class="date" code="2007-11-22">22 November</phrase>, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State announced that we will review the Government's current manufacturing strategy and establish a new ministerial advisory group on manufacturing to help us with that review. I can confirm that the food and drinks sector, which is a very important part of the overall manufacturing sector in the UK economy, will be represented.</p>

	<p pid="a.60.0/1">The Minister mentioned the food and drinks industry in the UK. There are really only four world-class manufacturers of confectionary. He mentioned Mars and Nestl&eacute;. There are also Kraft Jacobs Suchard, for which I was briefly the UK tax manager, and Cadbury's. Cadbury's is the only brand that is still British owned and predominantly British produced. Obviously, one could not prejudice a future inquiry, but <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1904" name="Dan Norris">the hon. Member for Wansdyke (Dan Norris)</phrase> mentioned competitiveness and fear of takeover. I would be very surprised if the Competition Commission would allow Cadbury to be taken over by a foreign competitor that is owned abroad.</p>

	<p pid="a.60.1/1">My understanding is that the company has every intention of continuing to thrive and succeed. Indeed, after recent changes, it is the world's leading confectionary manufacturer. Our intention, not least through the work of the review of our manufacturing strategy, is to ensure that we continue to have a very successful manufacturing industry in the UK. Prospects are looking up for the sector. I want that to be the case in the food and drink part as well&mdash;</p>

	<p pid="a.61.1/1">I am grateful for an opportunity to debate the latest draft timetables for train services on the west coast main line. I apologise to the Minister that I was not able to get my notes to him far in advance. I was working on them, and putting together what I wished to say, only late last night.</p>
	<p pid="a.61.1/2">What I wish to say today is, I believe, totally supported by Cumbria county council and the local committees that it has set up, the Cumbria transport forum executive, Cumbria Tourism, Cumbria Vision and the Cumbria strategic partnership. We all acknowledge the considerable investment in the west coast main line that is leading to more reliable services and reduced journey times to London. Our expectation had been that the new service pattern to be introduced in December 2008/January 2009 would lead to an overall improvement in the economic performance of Cumbria by reducing its relative isolation and improving accessibility to the county for residents and visitors. Our comments on the proposed timetable reflect the importance of meeting those crucial objectives. As the Minister may know, Cumbria is the poorest-performing economy in the whole of the United Kingdom and is among the five poorest in the whole of the EU. We are therefore disappointed that the current draft timetables do not give Cumbria the economic opportunities that it desperately needs.</p>
	<p pid="a.61.1/3">Our general conclusions reiterate previous representations made to the Department for Transport in 2006 and at various DFT forums. The loss of through-journey opportunities from Cumbria and the north-west to the south coast and the south-west under the new cross-country franchise represents a significant reduction in the attractiveness of rail for longer-distance travel to and from the county. We do not agree with the approach that maximises reductions in journey times to London and that results in a significant reduction in local service delivery because there are inadequate train resources.</p>
	<p pid="a.61.1/4">I plead with the Government: please do not be so obsessed with cutting the journey time to Glasgow. I can lop half an hour off the London to Glasgow time if the train stops nowhere else in between, and I appreciate that there is potentially a big market to capture from air travel. However, those of us in Cumbria, Lancashire and all the other counties between London and Glasgow want a train service that is relatively fast to London but that stops in our county and picks up passengers. Therefore, although the headline figures that show reduced overall journey times to London are welcomed, we look to the Department to ensure that other aspects of the strategy are delivered. For example, we will require additional car parking at Penrith and Carlisle; that will be essential to accommodate the extra demands.</p>
	<p pid="a.61.1/5">The Department should consider the existing use of west coast rail services in Cumbria. In particular, it should address specific gaps in service provision and how those will be accommodated in the future. It should address how the comments on interchange in the stakeholders briefing document of October 2006 for the new cross-country franchise will be translated into practical action plans by the train and station operators, recognising the needs of passengers who will be obliged to change trains en route to destinations that currently have through services.</p>
	<p pid="a.61.1/6">We also reiterate comments made over the years regarding the importance of west coast trains providing local services to Penrith and Oxenholme to the south, as well as to Lockerbie, Wigan and Warrington. The stopping pattern for services should reflect not only the need to move between those towns and other key destinations, but the role of services in meeting the needs of commuters, especially to the city of Carlisle and to Penrith. I am concerned today with Penrith, but my colleague John Stevenson, the Conservative candidate in Carlisle for the next general election, has contacted me to say that it is vital that the 16.30 service from Euston include a stop at Carlisle. He points out that that train will have to creep slowly through the station; it will not whizz past it at 150 mph. He says that it will take only two more minutes to stop at the platform there and to provide an excellent service.</p>
	<p pid="a.61.1/7">Today, I want the Minister to consider the timetabled stops at Penrith and Oxenholme to achieve a better distribution of London services, and particularly a rebalancing of the split between Glasgow and Edinburgh services throughout the day. It is apparent that there is no regular pattern to the skip-stops between those two stations, and Penrith, in the new pattern, will lose four train stops a day.</p>
	<p pid="a.61.1/8">Penrith is not only an important town; the station is also a gateway to the Eden valley and the North lakes and it is a railhead for parts of west Cumbria. Penrith will suffer the greatest net loss of services in Cumbria in the 2008-09 timetable, losing four southbound services and six northbound services each day. In the morning peak, the London service is to be reduced from three trains to two, with a gap from 05.56 to 07.59, followed 22 minutes later by an 08.21 train. There is also only one service after 13.02 to London, at 18.05, so there is a five-hour gap between the 1 o'clock train and the 6 o'clock train, during which trains are whizzing through Penrith but do not stop there. That is unreasonable. It is a significant reduction in London services.</p>
	<p pid="a.61.1/9">The northbound Penrith services also exhibit an imbalanced pattern, with no morning departures to Edinburgh at all and a gap in Glasgow departures between 12.29 and 17.48. That skewed departure pattern, similar to that for Oxenholme, which is not in my constituency although it is the next station south, will require additional interchanges at Carlisle to transfer between services. The commuter service to and from Carlisle has a reduction in choice in both directions for work in Carlisle, with arrivals only at 07.50 or 08.25. Although those are comparable to the current arrival times of 07.19 and 08.30, the next northbound arrival, at 09.01, does not pick up at Penrith and would arguably be an attractive option, particularly as the next stopping service does not arrive until 10 o'clock. The evening southbound service now has a 90-minute gap between 16.05 and 17.35, compared with only 46 minutes at present, between 16.35 and 17.21.</p>
	<p pid="a.61.1/10">Eden district council, in my constituency, believes that those are negative steps for several reasons. The first relates to tourism. With the increase in responsible tourism, particularly among those involved in outdoor activities, there is a real opportunity to encourage visitors to arrive by rail via Penrith. The reduced options not only reduce that opportunity but are likely further to increase car journeys into the already overcrowded Lake District national park and increase pollution. Penrith station is called &quot;the northern gateway to the lakes&quot;; if the trains are not stopping there, it is not much of a gateway in that sense.</p>
	<p pid="a.61.1/11">Secondly, the new university of Cumbria&mdash;part of its campus will be based in Newton Rigg, one and a half miles outside Penrith&mdash;needs to encourage increased student numbers and they need easy access to both Penrith and Carlisle to attract them to the area. We have waited years&mdash;decades; centuries, one could even say&mdash;for a university in Cumbria. To have part of the campus based near Penrith with the main headquarters in Carlisle is a significant boost to the Cumbrian economy. We desperately need it. We are grateful to the Government that the opportunity has now arisen, but unless those students&mdash;the staff as well but particularly the students&mdash;have access to some commuter rail travel, it will not work to its full potential. Similarly, reduced transport access to London will not support that vital new educational establishment, which could attract new young talent to our district.</p>
	<p pid="a.61.1/12">The third reason relates to the environment. The reduction in trains stopping at Penrith and further north will only encourage people to continue to use their car for long journeys and increase pollution and traffic congestion. Increased investment in the railway network should support improved rural access not just in the south-east, but in the north of England.</p>
	<p pid="a.61.1/13">Let me give the Minister a personal example. Often, personal examples are not apposite, but this one is. At weekends from October to April or May, I never use Penrith station, a few miles down the road, because I am not prepared to spend seven hours travelling via Cardiff or Bristol as the west coast main line is fixed. I cannot afford the pain of sitting for that long on a train, so I pop across to Darlington on the A66 and take the wonderful GNER service. It is ironic that by driving 100 miles across the Pennines, I can get from my house in Cumbria to my flat in London four hours faster on weekends than by using the Virgin service. That is not Virgin's fault; it is due to the wonderful repairs being done on the west coast main line.</p>
	<p pid="a.61.1/14">Hundreds of other people make that decision, as well. If we are prepared to drive along the A66 and catch a train at Darlington, more and more of us will make that decision when the connections we want do not stop at Penrith. If I have to get to Westminster at a reasonable time and I cannot pop out on a Monday morning and catch that connection, I am not going to get up two hours earlier. Many people more important than me&mdash;business men and women&mdash;who also must make that decision will simply drive over the Pennines to Darlington. It is wonderful for GNER or the new franchise holder and great for the east coast main line, but it is not good for the environment, for the A66 and for train services on the west coast main line.</p>
	<p pid="a.61.1/15">What do we want? London Euston services are being reduced from nine in each direction to five southbound and six northbound in December 2008. That will encourage people to drive along the A66 to use the east coast main line. We want that decision to be reversed. The five-hour afternoon gap in direct services to Euston between 13.05 and 18.05&mdash;three trains stop at Oxenholme during that period, by the way&mdash;is not acceptable. We cannot have that huge gap, and we cannot have people driving 25 miles south from the Penrith area through Shap and Kendal to Oxenholme, which has no parking facilities, to catch trains there. That would be madness.</p>
	<p pid="a.61.1/16">Many of the trains that do stop at Penrith do not stop at Oxenholme or Lancaster, which makes it extremely difficult for local travel between stations from Carlisle to Preston. One can catch a train at Carlisle, but not at Oxenholme or Penrith. One can catch a train at Penrith, but it does not stop at Oxenholme or Lancaster. It is nonsense. We need some trains to stop at those important stations in between to provide connections to Barrow-in-Furness and Windermere.</p>
	<p pid="a.61.1/17">All seven trans-Pennine express services to Manchester airport stop, but only five from the airport do. As they are hardly inter-city trains, with a maximum of only 100 mph, surely those services should stop at all stations. I had assumed that when the little trans-Pennine express splinter trains came in, they would stop at all stations. I am surprised that they do not. The general reduction in trains stopping at Penrith from 24 southbound and 25 northbound in December 2007 to 19 in both directions in December 2008 is not good for Penrith, the county, the environment or train travellers.</p>
	<p pid="a.61.1/18">I shall give the Minister the timetable that we would like. For southbound services, we would like the 17.40 from Glasgow to Euston, which will whizz through Penrith at approximately 19.03, to stop at Penrith. We would like the 13.40 from Glasgow to Euston to stop at about 15.03. That would plug the five-hour gap. If nothing else comes out of this debate&mdash;if we cannot get our four trains stopping&mdash;we must have the 13.40 from Glasgow stop at Penrith at about 3 o'clock for a couple of minutes. Even I can board in one minute; I am sure that my fitter constituents can get on even faster. We need the 16.00 from Glasgow to Birmingham to stop at Penrith at about 17.22 so Penrith commuters can return. We need the 18.52 from Edinburgh to Birmingham to stop at Penrith at approximately 20.20. That is the last train from Edinburgh to Birmingham, and it would plug a two-hour gap.</p>
	<p pid="a.61.1/19">As for trains heading north from London or Birmingham, we would like the 06.20 from Birmingham to Edinburgh to stop at Penrith at approximately 08.50, please. It would provide an early service to Edinburgh and an additional commuter service to Carlisle. We would like the 08.00 from Manchester airport to Edinburgh to stop at Penrith at approximately 09.48. All other airport services stop, and it would be an excellent additional service. We would like the 17.30 from London Euston to Glasgow, a very important train, to stop at Penrith at approximately 20.33. It would be an important returning train for business people, who would be able to conclude business in London by half-past 4 and catch that train home. Otherwise, they will have to take diabolically late trains. We would like the 16.00 Manchester airport to Edinburgh train to stop at Penrith at approximately 17.50.</p>
	<p pid="a.61.1/20">Those are all our demands for the timetable. I am not asking for four additional services; I am asking that the services that we have should not be cut. We all support the improvements to the west coast main line, and we read in the headlines that one day a Eurostar from Glasgow will whizz through London&mdash;one will be able to board at Glasgow and not get off until it arrives in Paris, and enjoy the nightlife and the clubs. Some of us in Penrith would like to board that train occasionally, as well. We are not asking for ludicrous services or making unreasonable demands; we are saying that our county is in dire straits. It is one of the poorest performing areas. We need fast train services to London, but more importantly, we need reliable ones. We need train services that are not delayed unreasonably. We need trains that stop, giving our business people a good, reliable service. I appreciate that the Minister will not be able to give me those assurances today, but I hope that in the coming months, he and his officials will consider the proposed timetables carefully and conclude that they are not good for Cumbria, the environment, rail travellers or our future rail strategy.</p>
