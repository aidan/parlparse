<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-03-29a.249.6" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1465" speakername="Janet Dean" colnum="249"  time="009:31:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060329/halltext/60329h01.htm#60329h01_spnew2">
	<p pid="a.249.6/1">I am pleased to open today's debate under your experienced chairmanship, Mr. Benton. This opportunity to discuss the success of the Staffordshire ambulance service and the concern of all who live in Staffordshire that our excellent service should be retained, is timely, given that last week saw the end of the consultation period on the reconfiguration of ambulance services.</p>
	<p pid="a.249.6/2">During the past few months, there has been much activity aimed at ensuring that my hon. Friend the Minister and her colleagues in Government are aware of the desire of Staffordshire people to ensure that our superb service is retained. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1834" name="Charlotte Atkins">My hon. Friend the Member for Staffordshire, Moorlands (Charlotte Atkins)</phrase> secured a debate on that issue in Westminster Hall in November. There have been other debates on the issue, as well as questions, early-day motions, petitions and meetings with Ministers, including the Prime Minister.</p>
	<p pid="a.249.6/3">I am pleased to see so many Staffordshire Members <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2015" name="Patrick Cormack">here. I understand that the hon. Member for South Staffordshire (Sir Patrick Cormack)</phrase> would have been here but for a previous engagement. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1833" name="David Kidney">My hon. Friend the Member for Stafford (Mr. Kidney)</phrase> has a constituency engagement, but tells me that he spoke to Lord Warner in advance of today's debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.249.6/4">Through representations and the large number of responses to the consultation, the Minister will be aware of the strength of feeling among people in Staffordshire, who believe that nothing should be done to undermine the first-class ambulance service that we enjoy. Indeed, we would like the achievements of Staffordshire to be echoed around the country.</p>
	<p pid="a.249.6/5">Staffordshire has the best response times and resuscitation standards in the country. We also have the most economic service. Staffordshire's results are not just the best&mdash;they are outstanding. In the early 1990s, changes were made by Roger Thayne, the chief executive of the Staffordshire ambulance service. The first ambulance station proposed for closure was in Uttoxeter. That brought opposition, not least from me and other councillors. The system that was introduced positioned ambulances around the county according to the demand predicted on the basis of how the service had been used historically. However, without the introduction of community paramedic officers, piloted in Uttoxeter by Neil Phillips, such areas of the county could have had worse protection, although overall response times would have improved with the new system.</p>
	<p pid="a.249.6/6">Staffordshire's powerful results come from a combination of policies. The command and control software programme VisiCAD has allowed extremely accurate predictions to be made about the likelihood of an emergency call emanating from a certain area at a particular time of day or day of the week. The process is known as system status management. Ambulances can thus be placed to meet demand, and community paramedic officers operating in cars are positioned strategically around Staffordshire, sometimes using new ambulance posts.</p>
	<p pid="a.249.6/7">Some of the more rural areas of the county could never hope to have ambulances or community paramedic officers based close enough to reach emergencies in eight minutes, so Staffordshire ambulance service developed community first responder groups. There are now 17 such groups of volunteers in the county. I am very proud of the Mayfield and Ellastone first responders, who serve the residents in the northern area of my constituency, and the Abbots Bromley first responder group, which covers the area of my constituency that borders that village.</p>
	<p pid="a.249.6/8">Recently, I had the pleasure of presenting a petition from the people of Mayfield and Ellastone in support of their first responder group. It called on the Government to guarantee the high standards of medical care enjoyed at present and to ensure that the community first responders would be allowed to continue to attend all the types of incidents that they attend now, without any reduction in the drugs that they are empowered to administer or in the equipment that they are allowed to use to help patients or to protect themselves. The petitioners also asked the Government to exclude Staffordshire ambulance service from the proposed reconfiguration programme until such time as its high standards were matched across the remainder of the proposed west central region.</p>
	<p pid="a.249.6/9">Staffordshire is not unique in having volunteer community first responders, but ours are far better trained and empowered than those in other parts of the country. In Staffordshire, community first responders are not first aiders with a defibrillator; they are trained for nine months to the level of accident and emergency ambulance technicians. Mayfield and Ellastone first responders have two fast-response vehicles, one of which was recently purchased at a cost of &pound;31,000. Half that sum was raised from the local community, the rest from grants.</p>
	<p pid="a.249.6/10">The first responder groups in Staffordshire, all volunteers, provide cover 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year. They are allowed to attend any emergency to which an ambulance would go, and use blue lights and sirens, as do full-time crews. They are allowed to administer oxygen and drugs such as glyceryl trinitrate, aspirin, adrenalin and glucagons. Indeed, I understand that the volunteers in Staffordshire are able to use more drugs than some ambulance technicians in other ambulance trusts.</p>
	<p pid="a.249.6/11">The Mayfield and Ellastone first responder group has attended more than 700 cases in three years. Those first responders are understandably proud of what they do and do not want to lose any part of their role. They want to continue to treat people of all ages, including children, in all emergencies. I am aware that other ambulance services have adopted different aspects of the systems and practices used by Staffordshire ambulance service, and no doubt Staffordshire will be able to learn some things from other services. However, Staffordshire's results are so outstanding that I believe that its service should be used as an exemplar for others.</p>
	<p pid="a.249.6/12">A combination of innovative measures such as the use of system status management, community paramedics and community first responders and the use of clot-busting drugs has produced such outstanding results. The people of Staffordshire believe that lives will be lost if the county's ambulance service is forced to join a west midlands service. They understand that a rate per 1 million of the population of 231 returned to spontaneous circulation from cardiac arrest and maintained to hospital compares exceptionally well with the NHS average of 52.</p>
	<p pid="a.249.6/13">Given such results, the Minister will understand why there is so much concern in Staffordshire and why people there will not accept any change that worsens their service. Having taken on responsibility for out-of-hours care, Staffordshire ambulance service is also leading the way in bringing health care to the patient. Staffordshire is successfully treating nearly 50 per cent. of all emergency patients in their own homes, significantly reducing pressure on the local accident and emergency and other hospital services.</p>
	<p pid="a.249.6/14">I know that the Minister wishes to raise standards in the ambulance service&mdash;indeed, throughout the health service&mdash;to the best possible level. However, that cannot be achieved at this time through the amalgamation of Staffordshire with the other services in the west midlands.</p>
	<p pid="a.249.6/15">Take the protocols that the ambulance service adopts for community first responders. At the public consultation meeting held in Burton upon Trent, no guarantee could be given by the representative of the strategic health authority that Staffordshire's protocols would be adopted by any new west midlands-wide service. There would be a tendency to dumb down, so that other ambulance services could meet the requirements of the protocols. Similarly, the use of system status management could not be introduced overnight in areas outside Staffordshire, so the two systems&mdash;the traditional one and Staffordshire's system status management&mdash;would not mix.</p>
	<p pid="a.249.6/16">I urge the Minister to consider a way forward that will protect our service in Staffordshire while offering more collaboration between Staffordshire and the rest of the west midlands service. There could, for example, be some shared back-office services. However, I firmly believe that Staffordshire ambulance service should remain operationally independent until such time as it can be guaranteed that the protocols and management system used in Staffordshire will be maintained in a merged regional service. In order to remain independent it will be essential for there to be separate boards.</p>
	<p pid="a.249.6/17">If Staffordshire ambulance service is allowed to remain outside the merged service in the west midlands at this time, there could be a period of working towards a fully merged service. Staffordshire could join in with the new ambulance radio technology, while, of course, retaining the Staffordshire control room. That is essential to maintain the use of medical advice, which is an integral part of the management system.</p>
	<p pid="a.249.6/18">Staffordshire would, of course, retain its current operation management system and the community first responders would operate with their current protocols. There could be collaboration between Staffordshire and a west central ambulance service in the development of SSM throughout the region, as well as in clinical audit and the evaluation of patients' experiences.</p>
	<p pid="a.249.6/19">I hope that Ministers will accept the pleas from Staffordshire and allow its ambulance service to remain independent at this time. It would be possible to set a date for a future review&mdash;for example, 2010&mdash;or to accept that it should be left to both boards to come forward if they felt that amalgamation were right.</p>
	<p pid="a.249.6/20">It has been said that the result of the consultation is a foregone conclusion. I was saddened by the decision of Roger Thayne and his deputy, Dr. Anton van Dellen, to resign from the Staffordshire service and to take up positions in Wales. However, I believe that the Staffordshire system that they have developed is strong enough to continue with new senior management.</p>
	<p pid="a.249.6/21">I know that the Minister will not be able to announce any decision today, but I hope that she will be able to take away my suggestions and those of my colleagues about a way forward that will show that the voices of Staffordshire residents have been heard by Government.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-03-29a.252.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1685" speakername="Michael Fabricant" colnum="252"  time="009:42:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060329/halltext/60329h01.htm#60329h01_spnew5">
	<p pid="a.252.2/1">One of the charming things about Staffordshire is that its Members of Parliament, regardless of party, often agree on what they think is best for their constituents. All 12 of its Members of Parliament, of which nine are Labour and three are Conservative, are unanimous in their agreement that the Staffordshire ambulance service provides a uniquely powerful service that saves lives in England and in <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1465" name="Janet Dean">our county. As the hon. Member for Burton (Mrs. Dean)</phrase> said, we strongly believe that if it is merged with the west midlands service, the service in Staffordshire will be diminished; it will be done down to a lower common denominator.</p>
	<p pid="a.252.2/2">I congratulate the hon. Lady on securing the debate. As she says, it follows up a long series of debates and meetings on this subject with Ministers and the Prime Minister. We feel strongly that there will undoubtedly be blood on the Government's hands if the Staffordshire ambulance service is not allowed to continue as it is at present.</p>
	<p pid="a.252.2/3">The hon. Lady pointed out a statistic on resuscitations. On a rate per million of population, 231 recover from heart dysfunction in Staffordshire compared with a national average of 52. What she did not say was that in the west midlands, with which the merger is being proposed, the corresponding result is even less than 52; it is only 48. By my some quick arithmetic, that represents a factor of roughly one fifth. In other words, if someone has a heart attack in the west midlands, they have only one fifth of the chance of surviving of someone who has one in Staffordshire.</p>
	<p pid="a.252.2/4">I will not rehearse arguments that I have presented in other debates. Friends of mine, who both they and I thought were extremely fit, have had sudden heart attacks and have been rescued by the Staffordshire ambulance service coming to their door. It has a response time of just four or five minutes. The service has paramedics, defibrillators and other equipment, and decoagulant clot-busting drugs, which are used to save lives. Those friends of mine are alive today, and I have no doubt that if such situations had occurred in the west midlands that would not have been the case.</p>
	<p pid="a.252.2/5">The response times in Staffordshire are tremendous. The Government rightly specify that for a 999 call in a life-threatening situation the ambulance should arrive within a response time of eight minutes. Staffordshire ambulance service achieves that 88 per cent. of the time. In the west midlands the figure is only 75 per cent. of the time, and its service is not always equipped with defibrillators, paramedics and the drugs that are needed to save lives. In the less serious type of emergency call, the response rate within eight minutes in Staffordshire is 85 per cent., compared with just 46 per cent. in the west midlands.</p>
	<p pid="a.252.2/6">We all believe that if the Staffordshire ambulance service could merge into a larger regional service and maintain its standard while bringing everyone else up to that standard, that would be a good thing. The problem is that none of the professionals believe that is possible, which was one of the main reasons why Roger Thayne, the chief executive of the Staffordshire ambulance service, resigned. He just felt that standards would be lowered in Staffordshire. I have not met a single professional in the national health service who believes that Staffordshire would not be affected by the changes.</p>
	<p pid="a.252.2/7">Given the United Kingdom's first-past-the-post system, which I support, our duty is to our constituents. My duty is to the constituents of Lichfield. The duty of all of us who are present today is to the constituents of Staffordshire. I cannot think of a more important thing than ensuring that when they fall ill, they are rescued and treated, and that lives are saved in the best possible manner. We can rejoice in the fact that the Staffordshire ambulance service enjoys the best response times not just in the United Kingdom, but in the whole of Europe. To damage that state of affairs would be appalling and there would be blood on the Government's hands.</p>
	<p pid="a.252.2/8">I admire <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1706" name="Gerald Kaufman">the right hon. Member for Manchester, Gorton (Sir Gerald Kaufman)</phrase>. I remember that in 1994 or 1995, when things were going wrong for the John Major Administration, he said to me, &quot;Michael, when things are going wrong don't do anything. Don't legislate. Don't make changes. When things ain't broke, don't try to fix them.&quot; Well, he did not put it in quite that way, because he is far too well spoken. I say to the Minister that the Staffordshire ambulance service, far from being broken, is a beacon to other ambulance services. To do anything to endanger that situation would be very wrong.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-03-29a.254.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1834" speakername="Charlotte Atkins" colnum="254"  time="009:48:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060329/halltext/60329h01.htm#60329h01_spnew6">
	<p pid="a.254.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1465" name="Janet Dean">my hon. Friend the Member for Burton (Mrs. Dean)</phrase> on securing this important debate, because although the formal consultation has ended, the fight very much continues.</p>
	<p pid="a.254.0/2">We all regret the resignation of chief executive Roger Thayne, but we must protect his legacy. Staffordshire still has his uniquely successful operating system and we must ensure that it continues to work in Staffordshire while he rolls it out to Wales. The Staffordshire ambulance service is Roger's vision, but it does not depend on just one man. The operating system that he has developed&mdash;systems status management&mdash;can deliver without him, but only if it is headed up by someone who shares his vision and commitment.</p>
	<p pid="a.254.0/3">During our previous debate on this issue, on <phrase class="date" code="">2 November</phrase>, I focused on the remarkable performance of the Staffordshire ambulance service: some 88 per cent. of all emergency calls are met within eight minutes compared with a national average of 62 per cent. The rate of successful resuscitations from cardiac arrest has already been mentioned. Innovation and improvement are part of the Staffordshire ambulance service's day-to-day life.</p>
	<p pid="a.254.0/4">In this debate I want to focus on another unique feature of the Staffordshire ambulance service: our community first responders. I know that other ambulance services have them, but none of them has them all trained to ambulance technician standard. They are called to every type of life-threatening emergency, including paediatric and maternity cases, and road traffic accidents. They are all volunteers, but they are not just gifted amateurs&mdash;they are professionally trained to take control of a broad range of medical emergencies. They work closely with the Staffordshire ambulance service and are familiar with all its procedures and equipment. Their vehicles are donated by local businesses or are paid for by community fundraising, and they are fully kitted out&mdash;they have all the emergency equipment that they need.</p>
	<p pid="a.254.0/5">Community first responders are not an add-on. There are 355 of them&mdash;450 if we include all who are now trained. There are more of them than there are front-line Staffordshire ambulance personnel. They are an essential part of the Staffordshire ambulance service emergency response, and because they are local, they get to where they need to go in five minutes&mdash;not eight minutes. That is remarkable. No wonder Staffordshire ambulance service excels in saving lives by resuscitating people in cardiac arrest. The responders get there in five minutes because they can use sirens and flashing blue lights.</p>
	<p pid="a.254.0/6">However, this could all be stripped away from <phrase class="date" code="">1 July</phrase>. Why? Because in some areas community first responders generally operate on the first-person-on-the-scene protocol, where the most advanced level that they work to only allows them to administer oxygen and Entonox therapies. No other drugs are given, not even aspirin; there are no patients under 12; and there are no calls to road traffic accidents and only limited calls to trauma incidents. That might be acceptable to those who live in a town. However, Staffordshire, Moorlands has remote communities, including Flash, the highest village in Britain. It is rugged farming, walking and climbing country, with unpredictable weather and hordes of visitors, particularly in the warmer months.</p>
	<p pid="a.254.0/7">Community first responders have consistently sought an assurance that they will be able to operate at their current level if a merger takes place, but no assurance has been given, so they fear the worst. If their protocols are watered down they will find that they are unable to give the treatment that they are trained to administer; for example, to a patient with a life-threatening asthma attack or a severe chest pain. As a result, their usefulness to the Staffordshire ambulance service would be reduced, leading to fewer call-outs, less hands-on practice and a severe loss of motivation. They would be less able to serve their communities, and it is inevitable that many volunteers would give up out of frustration. The result would be the end of a vibrant volunteer scheme that has the full support of local communities and has made a genuine difference to people in Staffordshire.</p>
	<p pid="a.254.0/8">Testament to that is provided by the petition of nearly 4,000 signatures&mdash;which were collected in only a few hours&mdash;that I delivered to the Prime Minister last Monday. It is entitled &quot;Save Staffordshire ambulance service community first responders&quot;, and it reads as follows:</p>
	<p pid="a.254.0/9" class="indent">&quot;It is indisputable that Staffordshire Ambulance Service NHS Trust is the best in the UK. One of the key elements in this outstanding performance, in the rural areas, is the high level of Training and Skills of the volunteer Community First Responders.</p>
	<p pid="a.254.0/10" class="indent">We, the undersigned, oppose any changes to the existing management structure of Staffordshire Ambulance Service and the Clinical Protocols and Procedures affecting Community First Responders. Any moves to limit what the First Responders are currently authorised to do will lead to a poorer service in the rural areas of Staffordshire and lives would be affected and potentially lost.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.254.0/11">I shall refer to two case studies from my bulging postbag to highlight the sort of work that they do. Mrs. Sheldon from Biddulph Moor writes:</p>
	<p pid="a.254.0/12" class="indent">&quot;In 2001, my husband was the first person in England to receive the clot-busting drug at home. The first responder was with us in approximately four minutes and the ambulance arrived some five minutes later.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.254.0/13">Consultant cardiologist, Dr. John Davies, said:</p>
	<p pid="a.254.0/14" class="indent">&quot;Getting this drug into him so quickly could have saved his life.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.254.0/15">It was administered by first responder, Andy Sparkes. Mrs. Sheldon said:</p>
	<p pid="a.254.0/16" class="indent">&quot;My husband and I have very good reason for wanting to retain&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.254.0/17">the Staffordshire ambulance service exactly &quot;as it is.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.254.0/18">Another case involved Mr. and Mrs. Bowyer of Leek, who found their daughter had died of sudden adult death syndrome. Mrs. Bowyer writes:</p>
	<p pid="a.254.0/19" class="indent">&quot;The first responders arrived in her bedroom within five minutes of the phone call. They stayed with us several hours, they kept me on a heart monitor for an hour. They made sure my husband, a diabetic, was okay and their counselling skills were wonderful, getting us through our initial shock.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.254.0/20">Therefore, they do not just save lives; they also deal with the situations they find. This proves that the community first responders make a real difference.</p>
	<p pid="a.254.0/21">As Labour politicians, we talk a lot about empowering the individual citizen to take control of their lives. We rightly praise the role of the voluntary sector, and all it does. The Staffordshire ambulance community first responders deliver on both those fronts. They are volunteers&mdash;very committed volunteers, whose commitment to their community leads them to undergo extensive long-term professional training, and to dedicate many hours to their service and to saving lives.</p>
	<p pid="a.254.0/22">Community first responders are not just an add-on; they are integral to the Staffordshire ambulance service, which is a service that presses all the buttons that we would want a public service organisation to press. It has a uniquely successful management system, it is efficient and cost-effective, and its performance is exemplary, not only in terms of response times, but also in terms of saving more lives before people get to hospital.</p>
	<p pid="a.254.0/23">It also already delivers on a new initiative recently announced by the Secretary of State to reduce emergency admissions and to save the NHS money. Staffordshire ambulance service treats 40 per cent. of emergency and urgent responses at home, saving &pound;100 per hospital visit. That amounts to &pound;9 million per year in Staffordshire. It also avoids unnecessary and stressful ambulance journeys to hospital, and prevents the hospital from being clogged up with patients who are better off at home.</p>
	<p pid="a.254.0/24">When the Under-Secretary of State for Health, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1414" name="Liam Byrne">my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Hodge Hill (Mr. Byrne)</phrase>, responded to my Adjournment debate on <phrase class="date" code="">2 November</phrase>, he described</p>

	<p pid="a.254.0/27" class="indent">&quot;need for local call centres and local management autonomy and flexibility&quot;.&mdash;[<i>Official Report, Westminster Hall</i>, <phrase class="date" code="2005-11-02">2 November 2005</phrase>; Vol. 438, c. 315WH.]</p>
	<p pid="a.254.0/28">Nothing less than full operational independence will do. It is vital that Staffordshire ambulance service maintains its system status management operating system, and its high level of clinical protocols and procedures, including those for the community first responders. We want no dumbing down, no compromise on response times and no ending of innovation and development of staff skills.</p>
	<p pid="a.254.0/29">Staffordshire ambulance service should be used as an academy of excellence for other ambulance services to work alongside and follow. Let other areas benefit from Staffordshire's trailblazing. What matters is what works, not rigid regional structures, which will kill off Staffordshire ambulance service and cost lives.</p>

	<p pid="a.257.2/1"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1685" name="Michael Fabricant">The hon. Member for Lichfield (Michael Fabricant)</phrase> began his remarks by saying accurately that all Staffordshire Members had been working together closely on this issue. However, a few weeks ago the Conservative party had an Opposition day debate in the Commons that was a general attack on all mergers in the health service. As is the way on such occasions, the Conservative party voted for its motion, and the Government voted for their amendment. That is fine; that is how we do things. The problem is that the Conservative party propaganda machine then converted that into the statement that the Labour MPs for Staffordshire had voted for the merger of the Staffordshire ambulance service. That was an outrageous slur and I ask that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1567" name="Stephen O'Brien">the hon. Gentleman and the hon. Member for Eddisbury (Mr. O'Brien)</phrase> to repudiate that in this debate, because it not only undermines all that we have done over the years in Staffordshire to work together on a cross-party basis, but damages our common endeavour to fight for Staffordshire ambulance service. These are important matters&mdash;far too important to play political games with.</p>
	<p pid="a.257.2/2">If we found a public service that was cheaper to run and delivered outstandingly better outcomes than any comparable public service, what would we do with it? Would we cherish and nurture it, and use it as a beacon for others&mdash;an exemplar for the rest of the public services&mdash;or abolish it? I cannot overstate the extent to which the people of Staffordshire understand what an outstanding public service they have in their ambulance service. It is not often that people rally to their public services in the way that they have rallied to the defence of the Staffordshire ambulance service. They have done so not because they have been asked to, and not for any political reason, but simply because, from their direct experience and that of their families, they know that the service is outstandingly successful.</p>
	<p pid="a.257.2/3">Those of us who go back a few years can remember exactly how the ambulance service became so successful. I remember witnessing its transformation at first hand. It was proposed that, instead of ambulance staff sitting around in ambulance stations waiting for accidents to happen somewhere out there, the service should be redesigned from top to bottom; that was thought outrageous at the time. The service decided to get the ambulance men and the ambulances out of the ambulance stations, to plot where accidents were most likely to happen, and to station ambulances there. That does not seem a staggeringly original idea now but, my goodness, 10 years ago it was. The effects were dramatic. At the time, the changes were quite naturally greeted with extreme apprehension by those who worked in or used the service. Ten years on, those who work in the service are intensely proud of what they have achieved. The buzz and the pride in that service has to be experienced to be believed. The feeling on the ground, from the people who use it, is unlike the feeling for any other public service that I know about.</p>
	<p pid="a.257.2/4">In Staffordshire's case, it simply makes no sense to alter a service that is working so well. In some areas, it may well be sensible to merge ambulance services; somewhere down the track, when other ambulance services have reached Staffordshire's standard, it might even be sensible to consider making further efficiency savings by amalgamation. However, that is not the position now. The people of Staffordshire and the county's MPs would find it incomprehensible if the merger was to go ahead at this time. In terms of the Government's philosophy of public service reform, there is no reason at all for proceeding with the merger.</p>

	<p pid="a.258.2/1">And the youngest looking.</p>
	<p pid="a.258.2/2">It is important that we take stock of the changes that have been made to Staffordshire ambulance service. Let me set out one of my concerns. Roger Thayne came to Staffordshire ambulance service and, as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1478" name="Tony Wright">my hon. Friend the Member for Cannock Chase (Dr. Wright)</phrase> said, set about changing things. Many of us, including <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1834" name="Charlotte Atkins">my hon. Friend the Member for Staffordshire, Moorlands (Charlotte Atkins)</phrase>, have referred to the fact that those changes were opposed in some quarters because change is uncomfortable and is not easy. Staffordshire ambulance service, under the leadership of Roger Thayne, met that change head-on. The service worked with people; it explained, it informed and it then developed its different standards. The service is now far more able to cope with health problems in Staffordshire.</p>
	<p pid="a.258.2/3">Rather than looking to merge Staffordshire into a bigger ambulance service, the Government should consider how what we have can help them in bringing about change across the board, not just in ambulance services, but in health services more widely. Over the past 18 years or so, I have had meetings with Roger Thayne, Secretaries of State for Health and senior Ministers, and it has been incomprehensible to me why we have not seized the opportunity of using Roger Thayne's expertise&mdash;much of which goes into strategic planning&mdash;to drive forward the agenda for change. I ask the Minister to please look at how we can roll that out.</p>
	<p pid="a.258.2/4">I am conscious that I have very little time, but I have one other point to make. Members who have spoken so far are really concerned about rural areas or towns in Staffordshire. I represent Stoke-on-Trent, the part of Staffordshire where health inequalities are greatest, and where disease and illnesses are worst. In Staffordshire, a model has developed to meet the needs of not only the rural, isolated areas, but the urban areas with the biggest health problems. Those urban areas face a great challenge in making change, because of our particular situation as regards overspend across our hospital trusts and at our university hospital. I say to the Minister, quite sincerely, that if we merge Staffordshire ambulance service into a west midlands service, we will end up with a far worse service. We would be completely drummed down. We should be looking at how our ambulance service, with its operational independence, can help and can be part of a partnership dealing with the change that we need. In my constituency, we really have to meet more health care needs in the home, and we have to consider how we will deal with change.</p>
	<p pid="a.258.2/5">I am mindful of the time, but just want to add that consultation has to mean what it says&mdash;it has to involve listening, not least to the views of Members of Parliament, who represent so many people across our county and cities, as my hon. Friend the Member for Staffordshire, Moorlands said. I am looking at the timetables for the Government review of the consultation. I do not know how many days or weeks it will be before we get a firm outcome, but today I ask the Minister to consider how what has been achieved under Roger Thayne's leadership can be rolled out across the west midlands, and to please listen, especially to the people of Staffordshire.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-03-29a.259.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1843" speakername="Robert Flello" colnum="259"  time="010:08:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060329/halltext/60329h01.htm#60329h01_spnew13">
	<p pid="a.259.0/1">I will keep my comments brief, as I am sure you will be delighted to hear, Mr. Benton. I, too, begin by thanking <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1465" name="Janet Dean">my hon. Friend the Member for Burton (Mrs. Dean)</phrase>. Many excellent speeches have been made, and I do not want to rehearse points that have already been put so eloquently, but I want to raise a couple of points that have not been addressed.</p>
	<p pid="a.259.0/2">The first point is about the excellent work that Staffordshire ambulance service does in respect of the M6 motorway, which runs through the county. As many hon. Members will know, surprisingly enough, from time to time there are traffic jams on the M6, even though there is a relief road. Often, people are caught up in their vehicles and become unwell&mdash;perhaps they are diabetic, or perhaps the stress of the long, tiring journey brings on other ailments and illnesses. Staffordshire ambulance service operates an excellent service in those circumstances, rescuing drivers and passengers from vehicles, bringing insulin to them, and so on. I understand that that has not been taken into account when considering the service standards of different ambulance services, so I would like to make sure that that is on the record.</p>
	<p pid="a.259.0/3">The other point that has not been mentioned so far is the star ratings of the ambulance services. Staffordshire ambulance service has the highest three-star rating&mdash;if four or five-star ratings were available, Staffordshire would be at the top of those. That can be compared with the west midlands service, which I understand has a one-star rating. It is worth stressing that that is not a reflection of the quality of the people in the west midlands service. I am certain that they do the best job they can in the wider west midlands region, but they do not have certain drugs or the systems, equipment or protocols in place to use them. The ratings reflect the systems and what is available, not the quality of the people, although I must say that in Staffordshire we have some fantastic ambulance crews and first responders.</p>
	<p pid="a.259.0/4">Why would the people of Staffordshire want to have anything less than the excellent service that they have now? Why would somebody who had grown used to being able to phone the emergency services and request an ambulance, knowing that in the vast majority of cases one will come in less than eight minutes, want to change that for a system that was not so reliable, could not prescribe the drugs and was not so close to where an incident had taken place?</p>
	<p pid="a.259.0/5">I echo <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1842" name="Joan Walley">the comments made by my hon. Friend the Member for Stoke-on-Trent, North (Joan Walley)</phrase>. I, too, represent a part of a Stoke-on-Trent, an area that has long been overlooked. Historically, health has been a great challenge there, with issues arising from people working in the mines and the steel works, and in the pottery industry, which thankfully we still have. People in the area have come to expect a high standard and have a great need for high quality health care. That is reflected well in the fact that although there are different views on police mergers and primary care trusts mergers, there are not different views on the ambulance service merger. The people of Stoke-on-Trent and of wider Staffordshire speak with one voice on the issue: the ambulance service is the best service and we do not want to lose it. That sentiment is illustrated well by a small group that meets at Longton town hall for a tea dance on a Monday afternoon that, between its members, managed to come up with a petition of 400 signatures. That is the strength of feeling from one small group.</p>
	<p pid="a.259.0/6">It is quite right that we should want to improve the ambulance service throughout the country, but the proposal that my hon. Friends have put forward in this debate is a better way forward. Let us make Staffordshire a shining light to guide others towards excellence in the ambulance service.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-03-29a.264.4" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1830" speakername="John Pugh" colnum="264"  time="010:28:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060329/halltext/60329h01.htm#60329h01_spnew29">
	<p pid="a.264.4/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1465" name="Janet Dean">the hon. Member for Burton (Mrs. Dean)</phrase> on introducing this important date and all Staffordshire Members who have been tigerish in defence of their cause. As an external observer, may I comment that one thing that can lessen the force of that cause and disfigure it is political division, when there should be unity in this place and on the ground in Staffordshire. From my experience of past health campaigns, I offer a friendly word of advice: that sort of behaviour leads to poor results for the people we serve.</p>
	<p pid="a.264.4/2">The debate is timely. The Minister will make a statement and may pull the rug from under us, or a rabbit out of the hat, whatever the appropriate metaphor is. I shall start with a few general comments.</p>
	<p pid="a.264.4/3">No one wants to have much to do with ambulance services on a personal basis, although there are occasions when we are all desperate to see one. Our fundamental requirement is that the service should be quick, efficient, effective, high tech and well resourced. It should be human and sympathetic because it is in the front line and the public use it in situations of high stress.</p>
	<p pid="a.264.4/4">Most of those remarks probably apply to the non-blue light service as well, but emergency patients are not normally much interested on such occasions in the name or structure of the trust that serves them, the badges on the ambulance, the origin of the ambulance or any of the minor administrative details. None the less, the administrative structure is not completely unrelated to delivery. I am sure that you are familiar with the situation in my constituency, Mr. Benton. There are two hospitals near each other, and the path between them is divided by two ambulance trusts. It is a woefully inefficient arrangement, and empty ambulances often cross one another on the same road. They could be using their resources far more effectively.</p>
	<p pid="a.264.4/5">There is a question about the optimal size of an administrative unit&mdash;obviously, the more units and boundaries a trust has, the more issues it has to deal with in respect of boundaries&mdash;and there are questions about efficiency. There is not much of an issue in respect of the democratic accountability of ambulance trusts. There have been many debates about why a primary care trust or an acute trust is not properly democratically accountable, but there is not the same level of comment about ambulance trusts. Yet there is a genuine issue around making ambulance services efficient.</p>
	<p pid="a.264.4/6">You will be aware, Mr. Benton, that the ambulance service that serves our area, the Mersey regional ambulance trust, has been accused of being less than efficient and has recently taken steps to be more effective. However, decisions on reorganisation must not be taken on the basis of temporary factors&mdash;who happens to be running the ambulance trust at the time and what the current performance data are. They should be responsive to what might be considered to be permanent changes.</p>
	<p pid="a.264.4/7">For example, there has been a significant change in the skill level and competence of ambulance crews over the past few decades. They are far more competent and able than they were years ago. There is a prevalence of co-responding and looking across the piece at how emergency services integrate that did not exist before, and, with satellite navigation and so on, there is less concern about fixed bases and where ambulances are located.</p>
	<p pid="a.264.4/8">That leads to certain presumptions. There is a rational and reasonable presumption, for example, in favour of co-terminosity of emergency services. There is a presumption in favour of economies of scale, as bigger units often possess better resources and have lower overheads, but it is not an absolute presumption. It needs to be tested empirically, not dogmatically, and that is what the contributions to this debate have helped to do.</p>
	<p pid="a.264.4/9">There are other strong presumptions. One that I believe we all have, to some extent, is that locally based services are more locally sensitive. Another one, which has already been mentioned in the debate, is that we should not endeavour to fix something that is not broken, and it is clear that the Staffordshire ambulance service is not broken at all.</p>
	<p pid="a.264.4/10">It would be easy to get out of the dilemma by spouting the usual clich&eacute;s&mdash;we should not go for one size fits all, we have to consider whether things are fit for purpose&mdash;and in a minute or two I could find myself using words such as &quot;step change&quot; and the kind of gobbledegook that tends to cloud these debates. What we have here, and what has been argued sensibly by hon. Members, is a good prima facie case against change.</p>
	<p pid="a.264.4/11">Certain factors make it a good case. Extraordinary statements have been made by the chief executive and deputy chief executive of the Staffordshire ambulance service that would not have been made were there not a genuine and serious concern. Extraordinary efforts have been made by all local MPs, and that is reflected by the number of them involved in this debate. There are stark statistical contrasts between Staffordshire and the surrounding areas with which it is intended to merge, and there have been some serious accusations that the approach is completely dogmatic, relatively unreasoned and resistant to evidence.</p>
	<p pid="a.264.4/12">The Government must satisfy us by demonstrating that there has been real consultation, and that the decision is evidence-led and responsive. They must be totally up front about what they are prepared to leave to local democratic decision making&mdash;or even just local decision making. If decisions are not to be made locally, if some template is to be writ large across the country, they may as well say so now. If not, perhaps we could review the criteria that are being used for this exercise and get an independent evaluation of how fairly and objectively they are being applied.</p>
	<p pid="a.264.4/13">In a nutshell, the trust is making a decent, reasonable and rational case to remain a beacon of good practice. It has not been said in this debate, but I presume that there would be no detriment to surrounding areas if it did so, and that, in essence, is the case that the Minister must answer.</p>

	<p pid="a.266.0/1">It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Mr. Benton.</p>
	<p pid="a.266.0/2">I believe that everyone in the Chamber feels genuine gratitude to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1465" name="Janet Dean">the hon. Member for Burton (Mrs. Dean)</phrase> for having secured this debate, which is not only important but extraordinarily timely, following the discussions in the House.</p>
	<p pid="a.266.0/3">We have heard from many hon. Members who represent Staffordshire. I would like to confirm <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2015" name="Patrick Cormack">the apologies of my hon. Friend the Member for South Staffordshire (Sir Patrick Cormack)</phrase> who, but for a prior engagement that he simply could not avoid, would have been here. He supports the unanimous view expressed by Staffordshire MPs on both sides of the House.</p>
	<p pid="a.266.0/4">In this age of consensual politics, I am sure that we would agree on what a perfect ambulance trust would look like. It would consistently achieve a three-star rating. Year after year, it would improve its response rates and achieve well above the eight, 14 and 19-minute targets, at both categories A and B, and the GP urgent call targets. It would be the best at resuscitation, it would balance its books&mdash;especially during this time of Government-precipitated crisis in the NHS&mdash;and it would be the most economic. In fact, within its budget, it would invest in innovative techniques and extra protocols above and beyond the statutory ones. It would employ more doctors than any other trust, its chief executive and staff would have the best interests of the trust at heart, rather than being focused on assuring their pensions. Such an ambulance trust would be looked up to by other services around the world. Indeed, its chief executive would, no doubt, travel to other countries to speak to ambulance services personnel.</p>
	<p pid="a.266.0/5">Hon. Members may be surprised to learn that all those attributes of the perfect trust are, in fact, attributes of the Staffordshire ambulance service NHS trust, which serves all the people of Staffordshire. Who on earth, be it a Government or a Minister, would seek to change or scrap that if they were in their right mind?</p>
	<p pid="a.266.0/6">I ask that with some feeling. Like <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1830" name="John Pugh">the hon. Member for Southport (Dr. Pugh)</phrase>, I suffer from being in the area of the Mersey regional ambulance service, which has had a disastrous time. The ambulance service of Cheshire, a proud county, was perfectly adequate until it was rammed into Mersey against local will. What has happened? The service once had a number of stars, but it has collapsed to a nil rating. There is no surprise there, except to deaf Ministers, who were warned. They cannot pretend that it is somebody else's fault, or that it was an unintended consequence of a wider, benign idea that was dreamed up in the halls of new Labour. The change was intended, it happened, Ministers are accountable, and we all share in their shame.</p>
	<p pid="a.266.0/7">Staffordshire is about to be precipitated into exactly the same crisis unless the lesson of the Mersey regional ambulance service is learned and at last the Government listen to the speeches, sincere and full of integrity, of hon. Members on both sides of the House. It is not easy for a Government Back Bencher or representative to have to find a distinction between the Government whom they have been elected to support and their decisions.</p>
	<p pid="a.266.0/8">The West Midlands ambulance service, with which the Government are trying to merge the Staffordshire ambulance service, has dropped from three stars to one star since 2002. It only just makes its targets, and at month six it was running a deficit of &pound;1.1 million&mdash;part of a deficit in our NHS that is so embarrassing for the Government that they continue to withhold up-to-date figures. The situation may be worse than I have just cited.</p>
	<p pid="a.266.0/9">It is also widely agreed that a merger of Staffordshire ambulance service would cause a cut in patient care. The&mdash;sadly&mdash;former deputy chief executive, Dr. Anton van Dellen said:</p>
	<p pid="a.266.0/10" class="indent">&quot;The trust has been notified that the clinical protocols will migrate away from Staffordshire protocols to national protocols from March 2007. This will result in a decrease in the quality of care available to patients in Staffordshire&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.266.0/11">The Staffordshire ambulance service operates 36 protocols above the national statutory ones. There is not even a great cost. Dr. van Dellen calculated that it was &pound;11.2 million in the first year and &pound;5.1 million in years three, four and five&mdash;all done within budget. Even the strategic health authority officials admitted at the Birmingham city council health overview and scrutiny committee on <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-11">11 January</phrase> this year that</p>
	<p pid="a.266.0/12" class="indent">&quot;the proposals could have a major adverse effect for the rural areas&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.266.0/13">That point was made strongly by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1834" name="Charlotte Atkins">the hon. Member for Staffordshire, Moorlands (Charlotte Atkins)</phrase> and others. It is a point I strongly relate to, having a rural constituency myself.</p>
	<p pid="a.266.0/14">Many groups&mdash;health and oversight committees, the women's institute, local councils and local campaigners&mdash;are united in their condemnation of any plan to merge Staffordshire ambulance service. As we can see from today's debate, Opposition and Labour Members have united in common cause. There has been a bit of an edge in one particular area. I would give a tiny word of advice to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1478" name="Tony Wright">the much respected hon. Member for Cannock Chase (Dr. Wright)</phrase>&mdash;and I share that respect&mdash;who has been particularly aggrieved by the normal fare of parliamentary activity during Opposition-day debates. If anything has been proved during recent weeks, it is that the Government pay heed only to the squeaky wheel. It appears that rebellions can count, and it would have been interesting to think about that as a political tactic on that occasion.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-03-29a.268.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1567" speakername="Stephen O'Brien" colnum="268"  time="010:35:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060329/halltext/60329h01.htm#60329h01_spnew34">
	<p pid="a.268.3/1">I am not going to repudiate it on the basis that the way in which people interpret the way things are done in this House&mdash;the motion is on the record&mdash;is a matter for them to deal with in their local campaigns. There is genuine and principled opposition from the official Opposition to the crass approach taken by the Government to try to ram together, by means of a regionalisation dogma, organisations that run perfectly well, whether they are part of the NHS, the police, the fire service or local authority representation. Staffordshire ambulance service is probably the biggest victim because it so excellent and such a beacon. If one can only relate, for political cover, to the particular, instead of recognising that this is taking place under a general principle advocated officially by a Government with Executive power, that is naive. I put that on the record as a counter to what has been an unfortunate edge in this argument.</p>
	<p pid="a.268.3/2">Furthermore, nothing is more transparently weak and disingenuous than saying as an excuse that we are waiting for a final decision to be made. That excuse was even made by the Prime Minister at Prime Minister's questions, when he said:</p>
	<p pid="a.268.3/3" class="indent">&quot;the outcome of the consultation exercise is not a foregone conclusion.&quot;&mdash;[<i>Official Report</i>, <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-15">15 March 2006</phrase>; Vol. 443, c. 1451.]</p>
	<p pid="a.268.3/4">We are all keenly aware that the final decision was probably made some months ago in the minds of Ministers and Whitehall bureaucrats. Indeed, it was hinted at earlier. Why else would the NHS Appointments Commission have advertised for, and appointed, a pool of nine people to be heads for the new regional ambulance services? I have had a letter from Roger Moore, chief executive of the commission, stating that it</p>
	<p pid="a.268.3/5" class="indent">&quot;began this recruitment at the request of the Department of Health&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.268.3/6">Why else would the Government be misrepresenting the findings of Peter Bradley? He recommended a reduction from 31 trusts to 28, which was coterminous at that time with the number of strategic health authorities. There was no suggestion of a change down to nine, 11, 12 or whatever it may be. Ministers have used that as an excuse to reduce the number of ambulance trusts to nine, 10 or 11, just as they have invented the idea of the reconfiguration of the SHAs after the Bradley report. That is sleight of hand, it is an abuse and there is no evidence base whatever&mdash;not in Bradley's report&mdash;to support the Government's reconfiguration of ambulance trusts to regional remote bodies, which will level down to the performance of the lowest common denominator. Anyone with a scrap of management understanding knows that benchmarking to raise all to the level of best practice requires people to be separately configured, rather than merged and diluted into one.</p>
	<p pid="a.268.3/7">In conclusion, we know that Staffordshire ambulance service is one of the best in the world. That is largely due to the hard work of Roger Thayne, and his deputy Dr. Anton van Dellen, to whom we pay warm tribute. Mr. Thayne felt his integrity would be impugned if he did not step down, citing among his reasons the desire</p>
	<p pid="a.268.3/8" class="indent">&quot;not to land the trust with a bill of &pound;200,000&quot;,</p>
	<p pid="a.268.3/9">and the premature</p>
	<p pid="a.268.3/10" class="indent">&quot;appointment . . . of the transitional chief for a regional trust&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.268.3/11">He has been effectively forced out by a process designed and managed by Ministers.</p>
	<p pid="a.268.3/12">If the service is merged into a regional trust, the 36 extra protocols will be dropped. Staffordshire delivers those protocols within budget and they save lives. Trust and SHA officials have said that that will lead to a downgrading in patient care. The Secretary of State has presided over a sham national consultation, deliberately spinning Bradley's findings to support the Government's regionalisation agenda and appointing chief executives before the consultation has even finished. Unsurprisingly, that has destabilised a wonderful chief executive that has shown the way for everyone else.</p>
	<p pid="a.268.3/13">If the Minister presides over the end of the Staffordshire ambulance service, she will prove that the consultation is a sham, taking into account neither the excellence of the service nor the wish of the people. The best possible single-word speech the Minister could make to every single man, woman and child in Staffordshire, and every constituent of the Members here today, is to say yes to the question I shall put to her. For the Minister, after the so-called consultation, the game is up. If she is to have a shred of credibility, she knows that the only speech she can give is yes in answer to my question. Will she confirm that the Staffordshire ambulance NHS trust will remain as it is: unmerged, independent, excellent and delivering services that the rest of the country would be proud to match?</p>

	<p pid="a.270.0/1">It is a great pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Mr. Benton.</p>
	<p pid="a.270.0/2">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1465" name="Janet Dean">my hon. Friend the Member for Burton (Mrs. Dean)</phrase> on securing <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1567" name="Stephen O'Brien">the debate, which, as the hon. Member for Eddisbury (Mr. O'Brien)</phrase> said, has by and large been constructive. He used the word integrity in describing many of the speeches that have been made. I agree with <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1830" name="John Pugh">the hon. Member for Southport (Dr. Pugh)</phrase>, however, that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1844" name="William Cash">the behaviour of the hon. Member for Stone (Mr. Cash)</phrase>, who came in late and made a speech that broke what has been quite a good consensus in the debate, was extremely unfortunate. I completely understand the fears and distress of Labour and, I suspect, Conservative Members that that approach has not helped the debate. It does a disservice not only to the hon. Gentleman's constituents but to those of my hon. Friend the Member for Burton. It is no wonder that they feel disturbed by that approach.</p>
	<p pid="a.270.0/3">We are talking about an excellent ambulance service. I know that, because I visited Staffordshire ambulance service with my hon. Friend the Member for Burton. I was extremely impressed as we walked through the tents and into the hall and met so many of the members of staff, who were clearly incredibly committed to providing such an excellent service.</p>
	<p pid="a.270.0/4"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1478" name="Tony Wright">My hon. Friend the Member for Cannock Chase (Dr. Wright)</phrase> talked about changes that had been controversial. In my own constituency, after some of the changes were put in place, ambulances were not necessarily in the ambulance station, but in different parts of the area. As he said, those changes have been accepted. Staffordshire has led the way with a three-star rating, as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1843" name="Robert Flello">my hon. Friend the Member for Stoke-on-Trent, South (Mr. Flello)</phrase> noted. It is a tribute to the work that has been done.</p>
	<p pid="a.270.0/5"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1842" name="Joan Walley">My hon. Friend the Member for Stoke-on-Trent, North (Joan Walley)</phrase> said that we must consider how we can transfer best practice to different areas. That is what we have been doing. I visited Staffordshire when I had ministerial responsibility for ambulances, and I feel strongly that there has been almost a revolution in the way in which ambulance services are delivered. We considered them closely, because they had an impact on waiting times in accident and emergency departments. The ambulance services are much more integrated with the general emergency services, and so much a part of the way in which we ensure the transfer of best practice to other areas. I agree with my hon. Friend that we must do that.</p>
	<p pid="a.270.0/6">NHS ambulance services handle about 6 million 999 calls each year, and spending on ambulance services has increased by about 75 per cent. Response times and patient care have improved significantly, and some revolutionary changes have been made. We need to build on those achievements. We needed to consider how we could review ambulance services to ensure that improvements in service delivery were consistent throughout the country. That is why we published a service review last year.</p>
	<p pid="a.270.0/7">The implementation of that review will be one of the biggest transformations of the service for more than a decade, and I think that it will deliver good services to patients in terms of the range and quality of care that they receive. To support those improvements, the way in which ambulance trusts are structured and managed needs to change. We must consider the capacity to plan for tomorrow, as well as to deal with today. They could do that if some of the perceived artificial barriers were removed. We must consider how to improve regional resilience, integrate planning and service delivery and ensure that there is co-terminosity with other service providers.</p>
	<p pid="a.270.0/8">In that context, I turn to the point of order raised by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1685" name="Michael Fabricant">the hon. Member for Lichfield (Michael Fabricant)</phrase> about the written ministerial statement. The Secretary of State for Health published it at half-past 9 this morning. Essentially, it confirms that the strategic health authorities will submit reports on the consultations on ambulance trust reconfiguration proposals by <phrase class="date" code="">5 April</phrase>. Decisions will be announced as soon as possible after that, with the intention that new ambulance NHS trusts will be established from <phrase class="date" code="">1 July</phrase>. I have copies of the written statement. I did not want to hand them round earlier, but with your permission, Mr. Benton, I should be perfectly happy to do so.</p>

	<p pid="a.273.1/1">The stimulus for this important debate was my recent visit to the Carlton brickworks in Grimethorpe in my constituency. Grimethorpe is my place of birth, and I am proud to be associated with such a great place.</p>
	<p pid="a.273.1/2">I remember Grimethorpe in the 1970s and 1980s, when everything in the village revolved around the colliery. Not only did we have the pit; we had a Coalite plant, and a power station provided electricity not just for the pit but for the local communities. The area was powered not by the national grid but with local coal. We also had a fluidised bed plant, a clean-coal technology technique that was then funded by 20 countries. It is a pity that we did not keep that plant open, and now, with the present energy situation, we are reaping the results of the mis-advice that led to its closure. Also, of course, we had the Carlton Main Brickworks. Altogether, there were more than 4,000 jobs in Grimethorpe, a village with a population of about 6,500.</p>
	<p pid="a.273.1/3">The only industry to survive from that era is the brickworks. It opened alongside Grimethorpe colliery in the mid-1890s, and has been producing quality bricks for well over a century. Indeed, Carlton Brick is the largest independent brick manufacturer in the United Kingdom, producing approximately 5 per cent. of all British bricks. It produces 34 million bricks a year, in more than 30 styles. An average house requires about 10,000 bricks.</p>
	<p pid="a.273.1/4">The brickyard currently employs about 80 staff, and for the past 30 years or so the kilns have used gas rather than the original heat source of coal. Therein lies the main reason for today's debate. It can be summed up succinctly in the letter that I recently received from Carlton Brick, thanking me for my recent visit. Oliver Stevenson, the company chairman, wrote to me on <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-30">30 January</phrase>. He said:</p>
	<p pid="a.273.1/5" class="indent">&quot;It was a pleasure to show you around the factory and to introduce you to so many of our staff; the feedback has been very positive! We also appreciated the time you gave us in the office, when were able to describe to you our concerns over the cost of Energy and Gas. As you know, this has become a major problem for the brick industry, as well as for all sectors of energy-intensive manufacturing. We feel very threatened by European competitors who manufacture in a much more benign environment. As we discussed, it is not only the high of Gas that is causing us trouble, but also the volatility of the market, which has rendered planning almost impossible.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.273.1/6">Before expanding further, I want to explain why bricks are so important to British manufacturing and the British economy. Bricks have been used since ancient Egyptian times, so they are a very old construction product. Bricks are the most reliable fundamental building material; they stand the test of time; they do not deteriorate; and they improve with age. They do not biodegrade, unlike other construction products such as timber. They are reusable if salvaged well, and they are ecologically neutral. Their life expectancy is greater than any other building product. They have a good thermal mass, so they provide good heat and sound insulation. Brick houses are built to last, especially compared with the timber-clad and vinyl-clad houses in New Orleans which were seen floating away in the floods after hurricane Katrina last year. Bricks are adaptable. They can be used successfully with all other construction materials, including concrete, glass and timber. Bricks will work in the future.</p>
	<p pid="a.273.1/7">The UK brick industry employs more than 6,500 people in its factories. On top of that are the plant and machinery manufacturers, subcontractors and truck drivers, plus 115,000 bricklayers. Only yesterday I was speaking to my good friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer. When he asked what I was doing, I said that I was going to the Library to put the finishing touches to my speech on the future of the brick industry. He said, &quot;It's funny you should say that, because I was at Battersea power station yesterday talking to a group of young women who have trained as bricklayers.&quot; Even the Chancellor is on board.</p>
	<p pid="a.273.1/8">I return to the problem of energy prices. In November 2005, the price of gas quadrupled, and since then the market has been volatile. The cold weather in March and the supply problems caused by the shut-down of the Rough gas field have made the price rocket again, and on <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-15">15 March</phrase> we saw the highest day-ahead price of 227p per therm. The high cost of gas has been crippling for all industries, not just for brick companies. Manufacturers in the energy-intensive sector have raised their prices in order to combat those increased commodity prices. I shall not confine myself to the brick industry. The problem affects also the steel and glass industries. The latter is important to the future of Barnsley, as a number of big glass manufacturers operate in the area&mdash;not, unfortunately, in my constituency but in that of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1384" name="Eric Illsley">my hon. Friend the Member for Barnsley, Central (Mr. Illsley)</phrase>. The cost of energy is just as important to the glass and steel industries as it is to the brick industry.</p>
	<p pid="a.273.1/9">One method of combating the energy crisis is to reduce production, and therefore the consumption of gas. That is bad news for the UK's GDP, and also for local employees who have seen their hours and wage packets reduced accordingly. The wild swings in price from one day to the next have put industry into a new environment, where planning for the future has become nearly impossible. Those swings in price mean that we are unsure of how to plan costing and pricing budgets.</p>
	<p pid="a.273.1/10">Capital investment planning is difficult because of the uncertainty caused by that volatility. It is known that larger companies with multinational manufacturing plants now prefer to invest in their European factories rather than in Britain. The greatest cause of concern is that the problems of the UK gas market are not being experienced by our European counterparts. That environment has seriously disadvantaged our industry, and it is known that bricks have been successfully imported from Europe, where the manufacturing cost base is less onerous.</p>
	<p pid="a.273.1/11">Why has this been happening? The reason for the high prices in the UK is that our gas market has been liberalised in a way that the European markets have not. This means that third parties such as banks and traders are able to buy and sell gas speculatively, and the price is driven up and down according to the sentiments of the day. Those sentiments may be based on fundamental facts, such as cold weather forecasts and shortages in the gas fields, as in the Rough field to which I referred earlier, or they may be based on rumours such as forecasts of very cold winters, as was the case last November. It is of paramount importance that the market becomes more appropriate to the needs of industry, including the needs of the electricity producers; it should also be more in line with the markets of our European counterparts.</p>
	<p pid="a.273.1/12">Industry is struggling to deal with the European emissions trading scheme legislation. That fits on top of our legislation dealing with the emissions that our factories send out into the environment. We are ahead of the rest of Europe in implementing that legislation, but we are doing it without first removing our own legislation. As a result, our industry is likely to be faced with two legislative hurdles rather than one. Furthermore, the burden of bureaucracy being placed on manufacturers is hard to bear.</p>
	<p pid="a.273.1/13">Many brick companies are struggling to deal with that extra work, as it takes an ever larger proportion of management time. Not only that, but elements of the European emissions trading scheme are not fair; for instance, it puts great pressure on companies to reduce their emissions and, perversely, it is an incentive for companies not to reduce emissions before the legislation kicks in. Furthermore, if a large company such as Ibstock shuts an inefficient plant but at the same time starts up a new state-of-the-art brickworks, the new brickworks cannot adopt the emission permits of the old works.</p>

	<p pid="a.275.0/1">Ibstock village is right next to my village. We are a major construction products constituency. As my hon. Friend said, gas prices quadrupled in November from 31p to 128p per therm, and have since gone up further. Does he agree that if the Minister does not reply to this point today, he should approach his ministerial colleagues to tackle the disfunctionality in the European energy market, not just in terms of liberalisation, but in terms of the mergers and takeovers that have taken place, which mean that the market is damaging important firms such as Ibstock in my constituency, and Heather, my home village?</p>

	<p pid="a.275.1/1">I thank my hon. Friend for making those salient points. I hope that the Minister was listening because I shall certainly reinforce them later.</p>
	<p pid="a.275.1/2">The Carlton Bricks of this world are much smaller than the Ibstocks. The brick industry is a broad church. We want to ensure that it remains so, and that it can maintain brick manufacturers of the size of Ibstock as well as smaller manufacturers such as Carlton Brick.</p>
	<p pid="a.275.1/3">In a recent report commissioned by Centrica, Global Insight calculated that users of gas in Britain will pay an extra &pound;10 billion this year because energy markets in continental Europe are failing to liberalise fully. That figure is half of the total gas supply bill for the UK. The report said that since the opening of the European gas interconnector, British Gas spot prices have been highly influenced by movements in European gas contract prices, which were directly linked to changes in oil and oil product prices. Trevor Sikorski, the lead author of the report, said:</p>
	<p pid="a.275.1/4" class="indent">&quot;Our analysis shows that there can be little doubt that UK consumers are paying the price for Europe's failure to sufficiently open its energy markets as we become increasingly dependent on gas imports.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.275.1/5">The Minister knows that I wrote to his colleague, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1523" name="Malcolm Wicks">the Minister for Energy, my hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, North (Malcolm Wicks)</phrase>, about this problem on <phrase class="date" code="2005-12-06">6 December 2005</phrase>. I am grateful for the Minister for Energy's response, dated <phrase class="date" code="2006-02-20">20 February</phrase>, which intimated some of the initiatives that the Department has embarked on to try to resolve this issue, including the establishment, in 2004, of the gas prices working group, which is chaired by the Secretary of State. I know that the Minister for Energy met representatives from the industry at No. 10 on <phrase class="date" code="2005-11-09">9 November 2005</phrase>. His letter states that</p>
	<p pid="a.275.1/6" class="indent">&quot;at the end of November, Ofgem announced the steps it was taking to ensure that the causes of recent movements in wholesale gas prices reflect changing supply and demand factors rather than market abuse or other distortions.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.275.1/7">The letter then details those steps, the first of which is</p>
	<p pid="a.275.1/8" class="indent">&quot;writing to the European Commission asking them to investigate why the interconnector has not been flowing at full capacity when UK gas prices are much higher than those in Europe&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.275.1/9">The second step is</p>
	<p pid="a.275.1/10" class="indent">&quot;asking the Commission to look at market arrangements in other countries that may be distorting trade&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.275.1/11">in gas.The third step is</p>
	<p pid="a.275.1/12" class="indent">&quot;asking National Grid to make sure that arrangements are in place to allow other companies to deliver&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.275.1/13">gas</p>
	<p pid="a.275.1/14" class="indent">&quot;through the Isle of Grain if the companies who bought capacity at the terminal are not using it.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.275.1/15">The last step is</p>
	<p pid="a.275.1/16" class="indent">&quot;asking Interconnector UK to provide us with information about who holds import capacity this winter to assist our ongoing analysis.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.275.1/17">EU energy market liberalisation has to be a key priority as we become a net importer of gas. We need fair network access and greater integration of national energy markets, including more cross-border infrastructure to establish a level playing field across the whole of Europe. I hope that in his response, the Minister will expand on what progress is being made in this regard and what further steps need to be taken.</p>
	<p pid="a.275.1/18">I opened the debate by talking about the industries in Grimethorpe that were closed under the Conservative Government: the pit, the Coalite works, the power station and the fluidised bed plant clean-coal technology. In its last six weeks of production in 1993, Grimethorpe colliery made an operating profit of a quarter of a million pounds. Clearly, that pit was closed because of political dogma rather than economic necessity. There are 60 million tonnes of known workable coal deposits embedded in the ground beneath Grimethorpe, which, hopefully, will be used at some point in the future. It would be ironic if the one long-established industry left in Grimethorpe which survived the Thatcher years were to close under a Labour Government because we could not establish a properly regulated, competitive energy market across the European Union. I look forward to hearing the Minister's response.</p>

	<p pid="a.277.0/1">It is a pleasure to speak under your chairmanship, Mr. Benton, which is benign but strict, as ever.</p>
	<p pid="a.277.0/2">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1385" name="Jeff Ennis">my hon. Friend the Member for Barnsley, East and Mexborough (Jeff Ennis)</phrase> on securing this debate. I should refer to him as the hon. Member for Grimethorpe, as he has conjured up images of the industrial skill and hard graft for which that area is famous.</p>
	<p pid="a.277.0/3">I appreciate the difficulties faced by companies in the brick manufacturing industry. As my hon. Friend acknowledged, many parts of UK industry have experienced significant energy price increases. Domestic and industrial energy prices have an impact on both fuel poverty and international industrial competitiveness. We can take a certain amount of pride from the way the liberalisation and deregulation of the gas and electricity markets and the introduction of full retail competition have enabled market mechanisms to ensure competitive prices in the long term. However, there are some immediate problems, to which my hon. Friend has rightly referred.</p>
	<p pid="a.277.0/4">Clearly, energy prices are linked to the competitiveness of industry. The Government share concerns about the potential loss of jobs and investment, but we must view the spike in prices that was experienced in the latter half of 2005, and the current pressures on the energy market in the UK, in the wider context. The Secretary of State for Trade and Industry and the Minister for Energy, who is taking forward the energy review, take the situation seriously, as do I, especially in relation to the industrial sector and the building industry. We are seeking solutions that reduce the impact on industry, especially energy-intensive users such as brick manufacturers.</p>
	<p pid="a.277.0/5">My hon. Friend will acknowledge that as we become a net importer of energy&mdash;there has been an acceleration of that process in the past few years with gas in particular, which was faster than anticipated&mdash;we need to consider energy supplies in the long term. That is the underlying theme of the energy review policy, which the Minister for Energy is taking forward vigorously. That needs an intelligent debate. The slogans that come from some quarters&mdash;that nuclear is the total answer, that nuclear needs to be excluded, or that wind power is an answer and so on&mdash;are not helpful. We need an objective, well-informed debate. I know that my hon. Friend and many other Members, on this side of the House at least, want such a debate.</p>

	<p pid="a.281.1/1">Welcome to the Chair, Mr. Benton; it is a privilege to appear before you this afternoon.</p>
	<p pid="a.281.1/2">I am delighted to have secured this important debate. I refer hon. Members to my declaration in the Register of Members' Interests and draw their attention to my claim during the last election to have been the champion of the countryside. I said then that I would campaign to promote farming in the countryside; I invite the Minister to state what similar claims he made at the last election.</p>
	<p pid="a.281.1/3">I shall give a little history to put the debate in context. On <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-09">9 March</phrase>, the Under-Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1548" name="Jim Knight">the hon. Member for South Dorset (Jim Knight)</phrase> assured me in the House that the bulk of payments under the single farm payments scheme 2005 would be paid by the end of March. That has clearly not been the case. Before that, on <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-07">7 March</phrase>, the Under-Secretary, in response to my written question, stated that he was</p>
	<p pid="a.281.1/4" class="indent">&quot;pleased to report that the first Single Payment Scheme (SPS) payments were released from the Rural Payments Agency (RPA) on <phrase class="date" code="2006-02-20">20 February 2006</phrase>. RPA is continuing in its efforts to make the bulk of payments by the end of March, and all payments are expected to be made before the <phrase class="date" code="">30 June 2006</phrase> regulatory deadline.&quot;&mdash;[<i>Official Report, House of Commons</i>, <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-07">7 March 2006</phrase>; Vol. 443, c. 1258W.]</p>
	<p pid="a.281.1/5">In the interim, the Secretary of State announced that the fiasco of the non-payment had led to the removal of the RPA's chief executive, who would be replaced, and that the review would be overtaken. As recently as Monday of this week, the House learned that as yet the Government do not seem to understand the gravity of the situation and the distress that it causes. That is the issue that I wish to explore.</p>
	<p pid="a.281.1/6">The Government have presided over an unprecedented crisis of confidence in all sections of the countryside, from the foot and mouth epidemic to the latest fiasco of the non-payment of single farm payments in North Yorkshire and throughout England. The Government seem incapable of legislating on and administering farm matters.</p>
	<p pid="a.281.1/7">The Royal Payments Agency is based in Reading, and that speaks volumes. I have nothing against Reading or its inhabitants, but how can someone who lives and works there be expected to have an understanding of and sympathy with the issues that concern those living in rural North Yorkshire? It beats me.</p>
	<p pid="a.281.1/8">A number of my right hon. and hon. Friends who served with distinction in the then Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Fisheries are in the Chamber. I have consistently argued that since that Ministry was replaced, any person starting work at the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, or one of its agencies such as the RPA, should work in a trainee capacity for at least three months in every aspect of farming. They should visit auction marts, haulage firms, abattoirs and farmers markets and also supermarkets to see how the end products are sold.</p>
	<p pid="a.281.1/9">Those officials are immensely powerful. They advise Ministers about what rules can and should be passed in both Westminster and Brussels. We now know the extent to which EU directives can be and are being ultimately embellished and gold-plated by quite low-placed officials. On top of that, they can never be contacted easily. Like every other Government agency&mdash;the Inland Revenue with its tax credits and the Child Support Agency with its child support payments&mdash;the RPA has descended into such a shambles. The Secretary of State had to sack the RPA chief executive.</p>

	<p pid="a.284.2/1">I grateful that the hon. Lady has been incredibly courteous in giving way so often.I do not want to pile on the agony for my hon. Friend the Minister, who I know is a conscientious and diligent man. However, I must ask the hon. Lady whether, in addition to the catalogue of errors that she is listing, there has not also been a woeful absence of common sense in dealing with these problems. May I draw her attention and that of the Minister to the case of one of my constituents who has been engaged in a protracted negotiation with the RPA about a tiny amount of land? The difference between them is 0.02 hectares, which makes a difference in the payment of &pound;4.40. The protracted wrangling over such a tiny sum cannot be cost-effective for the Department and it is stopping my constituent receiving any payment whatsoever. Surely common sense could be applied in such cases and some payment could be made.</p>

	<p pid="a.286.1/1">The hon. Gentleman has rightly identified why the scheme is so complicated. Our constituents would be happier if we reverted to a system that was more akin to the devolved Administrations, so perhaps the Minister could throw some light on that.</p>
	<p pid="a.286.1/2">Fewer than 2,500 farmers in England had been paid their allocation by the end of February 2006, whereas the Scots farmers had been paid in full. A well known local farmer, Mr. Woodhead of Felixkirk, has asked me to raise a case of which the Minister is perhaps not aware. There are number of auction marts in North Yorkshire, not least the one in Thirsk, where the single farm payments have led to an unacceptable distortion of the market. The Scots and the Welsh farmers are outbidding our local farmers because they have cash in hand from the farm payments.</p>

I appreciate that he has perhaps taken his eye of the ball, but now&mdash;<i>[Interruption.]</i> The Minister says that that is not his fault&mdash;&quot;It's not me, guv&quot;&mdash;but that is often the cry of people in such circumstances.

	<p pid="a.286.5/2"><i>Farmers Weekly</i> of <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-24">24 March</phrase> said that farm debt had broken the &pound;10 billion mark.

Farmers are struggling financially to keep their businesses afloat and the knock-on effect on the agricultural supply trade is dire. Farmers still have to pay bills as they come in but they have received no payments for up to a year and face growing debt with emotional and financial pressure on all concerned. That is particularly so for tenant farmers who are unable to borrow because they have no assets against which to borrow.</p>
	<p pid="a.286.5/3">I want to share with the Chamber representations from the agricultural industries confederation, which is the trade organisation for the agricultural supply industry. It wants us to be mindful of the need for farmers to fund the purchase of inputs ranging from animal feeds to sprays and fertilisers when they face a major hole in their cash flow due to the lack of single farm payments. To date, DEFRA does not seem to have grasped the seriousness of that.</p>
	<p pid="a.286.5/4">A rule of thumb in the view of the confederation is that the industry has a month-on-month level of indebtedness of around &pound;50 million. That figure was established with some certainty at the time of the foot and mouth outbreak in 2001. It relates to bills that farmers have outstanding at any one time in normal monthly credit arrangements. During the foot and mouth epidemic, that monthly figure rose to &pound;80 million and the confederation believes that there has been a 35 per cent. increase in the level of indebtedness between farmers and their suppliers since the end of 2005. That is in addition to the increased level of borrowing reported by clearing banks. Lloyds TSB recently estimated that increased borrowing due to delayed payments was costing the agricultural industry around &pound;8 million a month. That scale of increase inevitably will place severe pressure on the agricultural industry's fundamental ability to operate and the agricultural supply industry is concerned that that artificially created situation will inflict lasting damage on the UK's agricultural industry and the livelihoods of those working in it.</p>
	<p pid="a.286.5/5">I want to ask the Minister a number of questions reflecting what right hon. and hon. Members have said this afternoon. Why did Ministers not act sooner to address the problems at the Rural Payments Agency? We and a number of stakeholders gave information on a number of occasions, not least from the Select Committee report onwards. Will Ministers now apologise to farmers for the real stress and financial costs of the delays? What lessons will be learned from the announced RPA review and why is the review not examining what went wrong over the past year? What assurances can be given that the same mistakes will not be made again? Why is there no stakeholder representative from the industry on the review team and why is the chairman of the review someone from DEFRA rather than an independent person outside government? Will the review be published in its entirety and promptly when it is finished and will Parliament have the opportunity of debating it?</p>
	<p pid="a.286.5/6">The Government must ensure that farm payments are paid immediately and in full. An interim payment of 80 per cent. in the next three weeks would be particularly welcome. It is disappointing that the Secretary of State in response to an urgent question from <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1477" name="James Paice">my hon. Friend the Member for South-East Cambridgeshire (Mr. Paice)</phrase> this week did not promise interim payments and has so far stated only that windows for payments remain open until the end of June. Will the Minister confirm that there will be immediate payments or that the payments will be made in full? It is unacceptable, but inevitable, that tens of thousands of applicants will have unvalidated entitlements from the 2005 single farm payments and not be paid by the time they must apply for 2006.</p>
	<p pid="a.286.5/7">Farmers feel badly let down. The Government gave an undertaking that 96 per cent. of the first single farm payments would be paid by the end of March. Farmers consequently budgeted on that promise and have been very badly let down.</p>
	<p pid="a.286.5/8">Possible solutions, which I hope the Minister will share with us this afternoon, are that payments will be made immediately and, if necessary, the Government will override the computer system so that payments can be made manually. Emergency measures are required and payment within the next three weeks is vital. At the very least, the Government should consider paying interest for the delayed loans. Many farmers owe the banks serious money because of the chaos.</p>
	<p pid="a.286.5/9">I am delighted to have secured this debate and I look forward to hearing what my right hon. and hon. Friends, other hon. Members and particularly the Minister have to say.</p>

	<p pid="a.288.1/1">I shall be brief because I have rehearsed the two points that I want to make.</p>
	<p pid="a.288.1/2">This has been a disaster and the hybrid idea should never have been allowed to be taken forward. To be fair, the hybrid did not come from the Government. It came because farming organisations looked at compromises in the systems that apply to different parts of the industry. I well remember receiving representations one week from the potato committee of the National Farmers Union which was desperate to have area payments in place. The following week I received representations from my dairy farmers who were desperate, particularly those in the south-west, to keep the historic model in place.</p>
	<p pid="a.288.1/3">I think the Government made a mistake. Fudges never work and this fudge has, with the benefit of hindsight, been an unmitigated disaster. I hope that we shall learn from that.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-03-29a.290.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1735" speakername="Keith Simpson" colnum="290"  time="015:32:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060329/halltext/60329h03.htm#60329h03_spnew39">
	<p pid="a.290.3/1">Yes. To be fair, instead of amateurs like us, a body such as the Public Accounts Committee should have a look at the issue.</p>
	<p pid="a.290.3/2">I would not mind so much if the problem had not been flagged up years ago. In fact, I participated in the Committee wherein the old intervention boards were abolished and the Rural Payments Agency was set up. The verbatim account of that Committee indicates that other hon. Members and I put forward two sets of questions to the then Minister, now the Minister for Climate Change and the Environment. The first was about who was accountable. The Minister said that it was, of course, the chief executive of the RPA, but that responsibility and accountability ultimately lay with Ministers. So let us not have any shuffling off of responsibility. I am not getting at the Minister who happens to be sitting in the seat on this, but there is a case for ministerial accountability.</p>
	<p pid="a.290.3/3">Secondly, we flagged up the whole business of whether the RPA could manage the computer system. The Secretary of State got the wrong end of the stick when I made this point during the urgent question. She said that we were dealing with an entirely different system that had to be brought in because of the single farm payment, but she missed the point. Five years ago, we were raising questions about a relatively simple system, not a complex one. I agree with <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1850" name="David Drew">the hon. Member for Stroud (Mr. Drew)</phrase>. I believe that there is something in the culture not just of Whitehall but of DEFRA that needs to be examined. It could not manage even a simple system.</p>
	<p pid="a.290.3/4">I would have thought&mdash;there are colleagues here who have been Ministers&mdash;that, given that track record, just out of self-preservation, they would have asked some difficult, hard-nosed questions. It is not enough for the Secretary of State to say that she has taken responsibility by sacking the chief executive. That is not my definition of taking responsibility. After all, she introduced the single farm payment scheme, and she is ultimately responsible.</p>
	<p pid="a.290.3/5">I would like to put a few brief questions to the Minister, very much along the lines of those asked by my hon. Friend the Member for Vale of York. As we all know, the key issue is that the payment window closes at the end of June 2006, yet when pressed on that in the urgent question, the Secretary of State stated:</p>
	<p pid="a.290.3/6" class="indent">&quot;I cannot give him&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.290.3/7">that is, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1477" name="James Paice">my hon. Friend the Member for South-East Cambridgeshire (Mr. Paice)</phrase>&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.290.3/8" class="indent">&quot;a pattern of payment between then and now.&quot;&mdash;[<i>Official Report</i>, <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-27">27 March 2006</phrase>; Vol. 444, c. 545.]</p>
	<p pid="a.290.3/9">The question is, why not? At what stage does the timeline run out? We are discussing not just the livelihoods of thousands of farmers but the wider rural community, and, as hon. Friends have said, we are running up against next year's scheme as well. There is a timeline, and Ministers must have some idea. Perhaps they could share that with the House.</p>
	<p pid="a.290.3/10">The second issue&mdash;non-validated interim payments&mdash;has already been raised. It has been put to me by many farmers in my constituency. Once again, the Secretary of State's comments during the urgent question were inadequate. She stated:</p>
	<p pid="a.290.3/11" class="indent">&quot;We are not ruling out the potential for interim payments, but we are reluctant to make interim payments if there is any possibility of their jeopardising the time scale for making full payments.&quot;&mdash;[<i>Official Report</i>, <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-27">27 March 2006</phrase>; Vol. 444, c. 545.]</p>
	<p pid="a.290.3/12">When will the Minister know that the timeline has been passed? Officials in the RPA must have some idea. My fear is that they will realise that the system will not work but will be unable to make interim payments in time to stop many farmers from going bankrupt. We all have large numbers of such cases in our constituencies.</p>
	<p pid="a.290.3/13">What conversations and discussions have Ministers had with the major banks about tiding farmers over during this period? Evidence has already been produced by my hon. Friend the Member for Vale of York that the deadline was <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-25">25 March</phrase> for the half-yearly payment for a large number of tenant farmers. We really are up against the wire.</p>
	<p pid="a.290.3/14">The Minister is carrying out a review, but what confidence can we have that the IT will be able to cope with the mapping, which now seems to be the key issue? It is not something that will make any difference to the current crisis, but it is something that we must get right.</p>
	<p pid="a.290.3/15">My final comment is from Mr. William Brigham, a farmer in my constituency who e-mailed me. He spoke briefly about the e-mail, paper and telephone chase that he had been having over the past few months. He was not angry. I believe that he is like an old soldier&mdash;he just expects such problems. He concludes by stating:</p>
	<p pid="a.290.3/16" class="indent">&quot;It is interesting to note that our area&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.290.3/17">mid-Norfolk&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.290.3/18" class="indent">&quot;is covered by the Northallerton office, we sent our application to Carlisle, and all the latest contact is with Exeter.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.290.3/19">I rest my case.</p>

	<p pid="a.292.1/1">The debate has quite rightly focused on payments, but as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1735" name="Keith Simpson">my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Norfolk (Mr. Simpson)</phrase> said, we must have some focus on mapping. Many farmers still cannot get at the payments until the mapping is sorted out. In a typical case, one farmer in my constituency has had 10 different sets of maps sent to him&mdash;all inaccurate&mdash;and has been threatened with prosecution because 0.01 error is alleged against him. That is crazy.</p>

	<p pid="a.292.2/1">I acknowledge that. I spent three decades in the world of information and communications technology and large-scale systems. We do not have the time to deal with that but my fellow rapporteur, whom I shall call <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1444" name="Roger Williams">my hon. Friend the Member for Brecon and Radnorshire (Mr. Williams)</phrase>, looked in particular detail at that when we went to Reading.</p>
	<p pid="a.292.2/2"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1850" name="David Drew">My hon. Friend the Member for Stroud (Mr. Drew)</phrase> made the point that the complexity of the system is at the very heart and root of the problems experienced, which is partly true. It was always possible for the Government to have a hybrid system where in year one the historic element was 100 per cent. In other words the transfer and increase in area payment could have started in year two. That was always a possibility and it was always likely that there would be problems in such a system on the scale we have seen.</p>
	<p pid="a.292.2/3">It is easy to be wise after the event, but I have never encountered such a large-scale system, in which the estimates of resource required were taken directly from the volumes of people in receipt of historic payments. It would have been professionally desirable or even expected to take small samples of land holdings in various parts of the country, analyse the expected volume and complexity expected to arise and then extrapolate from that. That would have produced a far more accurate picture of what the RPA was facing, so I do not accept that the hybrid element is necessarily at the root of the problems.</p>
	<p pid="a.292.2/4">It is very much a human tragedy for some farmers. I quote from an e-mail that I shall anonymise:</p>
	<p pid="a.292.2/5" class="indent">&quot;At a recent NFU meeting at Oaks in Charwood (where there were around 120 farmers) not one farmer had had their payment and not one had had a validated entitlement form either!&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.292.2/6">The e-mail continues:</p>
	<p pid="a.292.2/7" class="indent">&quot;I have had to take out more borrowings from the bank to bridge the difference in my cashflow, and to keep my business afloat. I am not on my own. I have outstanding invoices from other farmers dating back from last November as they cannot afford to pay me.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.292.2/8">A particularly incestuous spiral is being pressed down because of the enormous amount of inter-trading that goes on in agriculture.</p>

	<p pid="a.294.0/1">The hon. Gentleman is speaking with characteristic candour and clarity about the matter. Farmers in my constituency, such as Tony Gent and Robert Congreve, have also been in touch, and I wonder whether farmers in his constituency are pressing him in a similar way to ask the Government for a timetable for what is about to happen. Spring is coming up with all its associated costs, such as farmers input costs, rent charges and so on. It is vital that we get action and a timetable for action quickly because cash-flow problems beset our farmers. Has the hon. Gentleman received such representations?

	<p pid="a.296.5/1">The hon. Gentleman speaks with some authority on that subject, as he is chairman of the all-party group on hill farming, on which I have the pleasure to serve. I completely agree. That issue must be addressed, and I hope that the Minister will pick up on it in his winding-up speech.</p>
	<p pid="a.296.5/2">Several hon. Members have discussed the fact that this is a critical time for the business viability of farms. Tenant payments and fertiliser payments are due, and hon. Members must remember that the single farm payment relates to the entirety of 2005. For many farmers, their support payments have been pushed back and back, year in, year out. People used to receive their payments in November. Then it was pushed to December, then it became January, then we were told March, and now I am told by somebody who attended the NFU meeting last evening that the talk is of August. At that point, the Government shall incur significant EU penalties. I hope that they do not go down that route.</p>
	<p pid="a.296.5/3">I should like to touch on the human consequences of this tragedy, because they are not purely financial. Last week, I hosted in this House a meeting of the Rural Stress Network, chaired by the former Bishop of Hereford, in whose diocese my constituency lies. The network covers five rural counties in the west midlands: Shropshire, Herefordshire, Worcestershire, Warwickshire and Staffordshire. The caseload of that group, which is staffed almost entirely by volunteers, is rising dramatically. Farmers are under particular pressure at this time of year, with lambing and calving as well as land work, and the financial situation is giving rise to severe stress and mental concerns.</p>
	<p pid="a.296.5/4">The network brought to my attention a particularly tragic case. Less than a month ago, a farmer in north Herefordshire, who lived not far from where I farm, got in touch with the network, because of his increasing distress over the non-arrival of his payments. I am afraid to have to tell the House that he committed suicide at the end of February. A female Rural Payments Agency officer who was in touch with him was, understandably, extremely distressed by the consequences of her discussions with him. If DEFRA cannot offer farmers any apologies or support, will the Minister at least give some assurances that RPA personnel get support for the circumstances with which they have to contend?</p>
	<p pid="a.296.5/5">I should like to ask the Minister a few quick questions. First, we have already heard that, in Wales, interim payments of 80 per cent. were made on the basis of historic entitlements, and that 94 per cent. of them were paid by <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-02">2 March</phrase>. We learn today that all have now been paid. Will the Minister, as a matter of extreme urgency, now authorise immediate payments to those farmers in England who have had their entitlements validated? Secondly, will he instruct payment of an interim award of 80 per cent. of historical entitlements to the vast majority of farmers whose claims have been returned as unvalidated?</p>
	<p pid="a.296.5/6">Thirdly, does the Minister recognise that the failure to make those payments for 2005 is having a serious knock-on effect for the whole rural economy, much of which depends on the cash flows generated by farmers? Does he agree that it is appropriate to pay compensation to farmers who have suffered additional substantial interest payments? Finally, when will the appropriate Minister take responsibility for this fiasco?</p>

	<p pid="a.297.0/1">I, too, congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1896" name="Anne McIntosh">the hon. Member for Vale of York (Miss McIntosh)</phrase> on securing this debate at such an appropriate time.</p>
	<p pid="a.297.0/2">For once, I can speak about agricultural matters without declaring an interest, because payments in Wales have already been made, so I am unaffected by the problem. However, it does not in any way lessen my concern for the farming community in England, which has been so badly served. Indeed, a series of mistakes has been made not only by DEFRA but by the Rural Payments Agency.</p>
	<p pid="a.297.0/3">The Minister may say that other countries have used other systems, but Ireland has paid 98 per cent. of its farmers. In historic terms, Austria has paid 100 per cent. of its farmers, Belgium has paid nearly 100 per cent. of its farmers and Sweden, which uses a hybrid system, has paid 90 per cent. of its farmers. Germany, which presumably uses a dynamic hybrid system similar to DEFRA's, paid 80 per cent. of its farmers by December, and Denmark has paid 98 per cent. of its farmers. I have not heard of riots in France, Spain or Italy. I do not have figures for those countries, but I assume that the farmers there have received the majority of their payments.</p>

	<p pid="a.300.2/1">No, the hon. Gentleman did not. However, it seems that many chartered surveyors will have made a lot of money. That dilutes the money available to the farming community, a point made by the hon. Member for Stroud.</p>
	<p pid="a.300.2/2">The Government have a duty, because of their complicity in the problem, to ensure that farmers are adequately compensated for the money that has been taken from their accounts in interest and o<phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1696" name="Philip Dunne">ther fees. As the hon. Member for Ludlow (Mr. Dunne)</phrase> said, there is a huge amount of stress in the farming community. There is also the question of how we can encourage young farmers into the industry if they see the Government failing to deliver. They are always asked to provide business plans, yet they are confounded when the Government, let alone the various organisations, do not produce the money. The Government have failed English agriculture, and they have a duty to recompense farmers.</p>

	<p pid="a.300.3/1">I shall try be brief because the Minister has a large number of questions to answer. I know that he looks forward to doing his best.</p>
	<p pid="a.300.3/2">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1896" name="Anne McIntosh">my hon. Friend the Member for Vale of York (Miss McIntosh)</phrase> on the excellent way in which she introduced what has been a sombre and serious debate&mdash;and a timely one. She set the tone by highlighting the long history of problems, of which many hon. Members were fully aware before the proverbial hit the fan earlier this month. One of the great mysteries of this issue is why the Government and Ministers appear to be unaware of problems about which hon. Members were fully aware because they were told about them many months ago by farmers in their constituencies.</p>
	<p pid="a.300.3/3">This has been a good debate with interesting contributions. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1850" name="David Drew">The hon. Member for Stroud (Mr. Drew)</phrase> was critical of the hybrid scheme that the Government chose to adopt. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1735" name="Keith Simpson">My hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Norfolk (Mr. Simpson)</phrase> said that he flagged up these issues many months ago, and talked about something going wrong in the culture of the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. He also raised the vital issue of the banks, which are yet again being prevailed upon to be tolerant. They are being tolerant, but there is a limit to the tolerance that we can continue to expect of commercial banks.</p>
	<p pid="a.300.3/4"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1677" name="David Taylor">The hon. Member for North-West Leicestershire (David Taylor)</phrase> made a moving contribution in which he spoke about a local farmer who has severe financial problems. There are such cases across <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1696" name="Philip Dunne">the country. My hon. Friend the Member for Ludlow (Mr. Dunne)</phrase> spoke about the tragic consequences that can occur as a result of financial hardship and other pressures on the farming industry.</p>
	<p pid="a.300.3/5">Ministers have recognised that this is a serious problem, but have not said what exactly the problem in the Rural Payments Agency is. We all know that there is a problem and are seeing the consequences of it, but it would help if the Minister told us precisely the nature of the problem; he owes that to the House.</p>
	<p pid="a.300.3/6">We have heard moving stories about the difficulties caused to the farming community, which has borne with enormous fortitude, over many years, the accumulating problems posed by declining farm incomes, the chill wind of globalisation, and the relentless pressure from supermarkets on one hand and increasing EU regulations on the other.</p>
	<p pid="a.300.3/7">This debacle illustrates the important point that there is a lack of even-handedness in the way in which the Government deal with the farming industry. Whenever a farmer makes a small mistake, the weight of authority comes down on them and they are penalised, but when the Government make a large mistake, they seem to go unpunished. The current situation is that the Government have made a serious mistake, the exact nature of which is unclear, but who is paying for it? The farmers, not the Government. That raises disquieting moral questions about how DEFRA has conducted its affairs for many years. Indeed, it goes back to before the creation of DEFRA, to the old culture of the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.</p>

	<p pid="a.301.3/1">The Secretary of State made that point earlier in the week. If there are genuine problems of that kind, they need to be taken into account. Whether or not interim payments are made, there is a strong case for making interest payments on money that rightfully belongs to farmers and not the Government. I hope that the Minister will reconsider the Government's position on that.</p>
	<p pid="a.301.3/2">I want to touch on the question of ministerial accountability and responsibility. We accept that Ministers can work only with the information that they receive, but it is an important part of their job to make sure that the quality of information being provided is sound and accurate. There are no fewer than five former Agricultural Ministers present on the Opposition Benches who will know that that is an important task for any Minister. That is part of the Minister's job. Ministers cannot be absolved from all responsibility when things go wrong.</p>
	<p pid="a.301.3/3">The Secretary of State's remark earlier in the week should go down in the annals of history about ministerial responsibility. In answer to a question asked by my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Norfolk, she said, &quot;As for Ministers taking responsibility, I am taking responsibility, which is why I removed the chief executive.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.301.3/4">We Opposition Members are fair-minded people, but I cannot understand how Lord Bach can expect on this issue to command the respect of Parliament or, more importantly, the farming community with whom he must have day-to-day contact. It always seems, with this Government, that when something goes wrong, it is someone else's fault. Lord Bach should consider his position, and if he is not prepared to do that, the Prime Minister should consider it for him.</p>

	<p pid="a.303.1/1">I shall come to that point in a little while, but my noble Friend has already responded to that point.</p>
	<p pid="a.303.1/2">I was about to extend my sympathy&mdash;I am sure that hon. Members will join me in this&mdash;to the family of the constituent of the hon. Member for Ludlow, about whom he told the Chamber a terrible story. I also want to reassure the hon. Gentleman regarding the support being given to Rural Payments Agency staff. I have been involved only on the edges of this issue because it is not my area of responsibility, but one of the first questions that I asked when this blew into a major crisis two or three weeks ago was whether the RPA staff were feeling more demoralised. I urge hon. Members on both sides not to add to any possible demoralisation. The staff have done a fantastic job in difficult circumstances.</p>
	<p pid="a.303.1/3">As accusations and challenges have been made regarding my noble Friend in the other place, I remind hon. Members of the sequence of events that preceded the decision on <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-15">Wednesday 15 March</phrase> to remove Johnston McNeill, the chief executive of the Rural Payments Agency, from his post. Ministers had repeatedly been assured that it would be possible to implement the English model of the single farm payment scheme within the EU's payment window. As long ago as early 2005, the RPA announced that it would commence payments this February, and that 96 per cent. of payments would be made by the end of March. In mid to late January, the RPA advised that the 96 per cent. figure would not be achievable by the end of March due to &quot;unforeseen complexity&quot; in validating the claims, but that the worst case scenario was that the bulk of payments would be made by the end of March.</p>
	<p pid="a.303.1/4">On <phrase class="date" code="2006-02-20">20 February</phrase> payments began to flow as had been forecast. However, on <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-10">Friday 10 March</phrase>, after fellow Ministers had requested a qualified update of actual payments being made, the RPA still advised that 51 per cent.&mdash;one could argue that that represented the bulk&mdash;would be made by <phrase class="date" code="">3 April</phrase> and that 96 per cent. would be made by the end of June. Just four days after that, on <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-14">Tuesday 14 March</phrase>, at a meeting with the Secretary of State, the RPA chief executive reported for the first time that the forecast of the bulk of payments being made by the end of March would not be met. He reaffirmed that 96 per cent. of payments would be made by the end of June. The next day, on the advice of the DEFRA permanent secretary, Mr. McNeill was removed from his post.</p>

	<p pid="a.303.3/1">The reason, as I understand it, was that although the payments had begun, the speed of the payments could not be ramped up because of the complexity of the task. I will come on to some of the action points that have been taken to rectify that since.</p>
	<p pid="a.303.3/2">On the following day, <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-16">Thursday 16 March</phrase>, the decision to remove Mr. McNeill was announced, along with the appointment of the new acting CEO for the RPA, Mark Addison, a senior DEFRA civil servant. He was our acting permanent secretary for several months recently and is a man with extensive experience of delivery in both the public and private sectors.</p>
	<p pid="a.303.3/3">Within four days of his appointment, by <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-21">Tuesday 21 March</phrase>, Mr. Addison had compiled an initial report that recommended a number of actions aimed at speeding up payments while retaining proper regard for the dispersal of large sums of public money. Those actions were set in train immediately. They were outlined in the answer given by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State to Monday's urgent question, and I will remind hon. Members briefly of them.</p>
	<p pid="a.303.3/4">First, disproportionate checks will be removed from the payment authorisation system in order to speed up the flow of payments once claims have been validated. Secondly, the validation of claims will be prioritised to release the maximum value of payments as quickly as possible as opposed to the maximum number of individual claims, which will mainly benefit the large number of middle-sized historic customers. I am afraid that I cannot give <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1677" name="David Taylor">the exact figure to my hon. Friend the Member for North-West Leicestershire (David Taylor)</phrase>. The farming industry does not want the figures given out either, because the figures are not rigid. We do not want people to expect their payments to happen quickly and for them not to happen.</p>
	<p pid="a.303.3/5">Thirdly, key mapping work associated with clearing validation at the Reading office will be centralised. Fourthly, the RPA's capacity will be strengthened in key areas and its structure will be changed to streamline command and control.</p>
	<p pid="a.303.3/6">Mr. Addison gave his second progress report to Ministers yesterday evening. It showed that payments had reached more than 13 per cent. of the total value or 23 per cent. of the number of payments.</p>

	<p pid="a.304.1/1">I will come to the mapping system in a moment. If the hon. Lady is asking about the immediate review by Mark Addison, the new chief executive, he was appointed because the Secretary of State, on the advice of the permanent secretary, thought that he was the best man for the job. In the meetings that I have had with him on the issue, although it is not my area of responsibility, and in the meetings that he has had with the industry, the feedback has been very positive. He is an excellent public servant and the actions that he has already put in place have shown that he is getting to grips with the challenges that he faces.</p>
	<p pid="a.304.1/2">I was about to tell the Chamber that Mr. Addison's figures mean that, under the latest payments, &pound;119 million has been paid out in the past seven days, compared with only &pound;85 million in the first four weeks after payments started on <phrase class="date" code="2006-02-20">20 February</phrase>. That shows significant progress. Mr. Addison, having managed in less than two weeks in the job to visit every RPA office in the country and listen to front-line staff, had a number of further recommendations that he made to Ministers last night that have now been approved. They will address, I hope, some of the concerns raised during the debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.304.1/3">First, RPA processes should be reformed to deliver greater customer focus by dedicating teams of staff to work on individual claims in their entirety. That was the point raised by the hon. Member for Ludlow. That would replace the task-based approach, which meant that bits of paper were being sent round from one office to another.</p>
	<p pid="a.304.1/4">Secondly, as part of that change, processing staff should be allowed to contact applicants directly on the telephone, to work through any outstanding issues. Thirdly, a discrepancy tolerance of 2 hectares, or 3 per cent. of the total area claimed, whichever is lower, should be implemented for the validation of claims. Fourthly, the over-pedantic quality checking processes should be stopped so that staff can concentrate on processing the claims.</p>
	<p pid="a.304.1/5">Fifthly, the people who do the mapping work should be in the same office as those who process the claims so that they can talk to each other when there is a problem. Sixthly, where mapping correspondence is outstanding, payments should be made on the basis of the information that the RPA already has from farmers. There will be further discussion with the industry on the mapping issue next week.</p>

	<p pid="a.305.1/1">I want to get to the end of my list, and then I will give way to my hon. Friend. I still have a lot of questions to get through. I have lost count, but Mr. Addison's next recommendation was that a senior manager should be appointed to take charge of the delivery of 2006 claims, another area for concern that has been raised. Finally, the potential obstacles in the current employment procedures of the RPA that would prevent the retention of experienced staff should be addressed.</p>

	<p pid="a.305.5/1">No, I will not. I have only four minutes left to cover a great many questions, and I would rather get through as many as I can.</p>
	<p pid="a.305.5/2">A number of hon. Members have called for partial or interim payments. The Government have made it absolutely clear that we do not rule out the possibility of the need for such payments if there is no alternative. I remind hon. Members&mdash;t<phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1857" name="Peter Ainsworth">his was acknowledged by the hon. Member for East Surrey (Mr. Ainsworth)</phrase>, I think&mdash;that that has potential disadvantages, including the impact on the 2006 payment timetable. I would like to add that at every turn in the past two weeks the industry has been kept fully informed. My hon. Friend, Lord Bach, and Mr. Addison met the industry leaders last Wednesday. They met again earlier today to take stock of the situation and to discuss the actions points that I have just announced. After today's meeting, I am told, the industry said that it welcomed the steps that had been taken. It thought that they would be helpful.</p>

Member for Vale of York (Miss McIntosh)</phrase>, and a number of others, raised the question of whether the way in which we have chosen to pay the single farm payment was part of the problem. They are right to say that we adopted a different system in England, but I would describe it as more sustainable rather than more complex, as some have described it. The system was supported during the debate on Monday's urgent question by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1477" name="James Paice">the hon. Member for South-East Cambridgeshire (Mr. Paice)</phrase> as a system that was chosen correctly.</p>
	<p pid="a.305.5/4">The hon. Lady was right to point out that Scotland and Wales have chosen different historic systems but, as she and other hon. Members will be aware, a number of member states chose to adopt the historic system and are beginning to wonder whether they made the right decision. In 10 or so years' time, would it be sustainable for farmers to be paid money based on what they had received 10 years before? We made the judgment that would not be sustainable, which was supported by the official Opposition Front Bench if not by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1850" name="David Drew">the hon. Lady and my hon. Friend the Member for Stroud (Mr. Drew)</phrase>. However, we still think that that was the right system.</p>
	<p pid="a.305.5/5">The hon. Member for East Surrey asked for my judgment of the problem with the RPA. As a Minister who has come to the subject relatively fresh in the past few days, nearly having to stand in for the Secretary of State on Monday and having to answer to today's debate, my judgment is that it was a problem of leadership trying to manage a complex organisation and a real problem of aversion to risk.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-03-29a.308.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1719" speakername="David Davies" colnum="308"  time="016:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060329/halltext/60329h04.htm#60329h04_spnew3">
	<p pid="a.308.1/1">When the Minister winds up, perhaps she will tell us the average time for a life sentence and comment on the case in which a convicted rapist on a life sentence was released after a short period. That was reported in <i>The Sunday Telegraph</i> this week.</p>
	<p pid="a.308.1/2">My proposals will bring honesty back into the sentencing process by ensuring that every sentence is served in full. They need not necessarily mean longer prison sentences, because if a judge feels that somebody's crime merits seven months in prison they would currently have to sentence them to two years' imprisonment.</p>
	<p pid="a.308.1/3">My proposals would allow the judge to make a decision about what they think would be an appropriate time for someone to spend in prison and to state clearly and openly what that sentence will be. That will give the public the confidence that when they read about a sentence being passed they know that that sentence will be served. They will not be deliberately misled, as currently happens.</p>
	<p pid="a.308.1/4">I have heard two major arguments against my proposals. The first is that prisoner behaviour would deteriorate if early release was ended. Even if that were true, it would still not be an argument for releasing prisoners earlier. Such an argument effectively says that these people are so bad that the best we can do is to let them loose on the general public instead of keeping them under lock and key because that will make life easier for the prison system. That is nothing more than a form of appeasement.</p>
	<p pid="a.308.1/5">I do not accept that ending early release would necessarily automatically lead to a decline in prisoner behaviour. It is possible to maintain incentives for good behaviour by giving more or less access to privileges such as Sky television, PlayStation and the other recreational facilities with which our prisons are increasingly being filled. It should also be expected that where offences are committed by people in prison, the offender should be charged, brought back to court and, if convicted, should have extra time added to their sentence.</p>
	<p pid="a.308.1/6">Incidentally, to go off at a tangent, I shall discuss something in relation to people who are either under supervision in prison or outside under the supervision of the probation service, which is a bit of an oxymoron. On the subject of tagging, according to the Minister there have been nearly</p>
	<p pid="a.308.1/7" class="indent">&quot;700 cases of offenders on Home Detention Curfew who had damaged their electronic monitoring equipment. Any offender who is found to have deliberately caused such damage will be in breach of his or her licence conditions and recalled to prison.&quot;&mdash;[<i>Official Report, House of Commons,</i> <phrase class="date" code="2006-02-14">14 February 2006</phrase>; Vol. 442, c. 1980W.]</p>
	<p pid="a.308.1/8">Yet, when I asked the Minister on <phrase class="date" code="2006-02-28">28 February</phrase> how many of the 700 people who had damaged their tags had been recalled to prison she was unable to say because the information was not available centrally.</p>
	<p pid="a.308.1/9">The second argument against my general proposal is cost. I would be the first to accept that if all forms of early release were ended, there would, in the short term, be a need for more prisons to be built and that that would impact on cost. Speaking as a Conservative supporter of low taxation, I can honestly say that I would not mind in the least paying a little more in taxation if it meant that I could walk the streets of London at night without peering over my shoulder every minute wondering whether I am about to be attacked or mugged.</p>

	<p pid="a.312.0/1">I am glad that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1719" name="David Davies">the hon. Member for Monmouth (David T.C. Davies)</phrase> raised this matter, because I share his view that it is very serious. Indeed, I share his view that there is an absolute obligation on the state to protect the public. I also share his perturbation that figures of 0.6 or 0.4 per cent. for serious further offences committed could be regarded as a success; they are not a success. We have started with the matters on which we share a view, but now let us focus on facts and evidence.</p>
	<p pid="a.312.0/2">The first fact that I should like to bring before the House is that we are less likely to be victims of crime now than at any time in the past 20 years; that is an important thing to know. The second fact is that offenders actually spend longer in prison than they used to. The third fact is that the only change, in terms of reduction of sentences, is the introduction of the home detention curfew to which the hon. Gentleman referred. I, too, am concerned about some of the ways in which that scheme works, and I will address the matter in a moment.</p>
	<p pid="a.312.0/3">We agree that public protection is the first duty of the Prison Service. That is one reason I am very proud that for nearly a decade now there have been no category A escapes; we are actually increasing the security of our prisons. We should feel good about that. Also, it is important that we make sure that we protect the public by reducing reoffending. That is absolutely at the heart of our five-year strategy. The hon. Gentleman claims that rehabilitation is all that we are concerned about, but he is quite wrong; the first thing that we are concerned about is public protection, and that is one of the reasons for our focus on escapes. The second thing that we are concerned about is reducing reoffending. There are two ways that we do that: partly by the way in which we reduce the likelihood of an individual's reoffending, and partly by ensuring appropriate sentences and sentencing behaviour for the prisoners who are most likely to offend and those who are most dangerous.</p>
	<p pid="a.312.0/4">Let me first turn to the home detention curfew scheme. The hon. Gentleman claimed that the fact that we did not collect figures on how we deal with breaches suggested that we did not deal with them; he is wrong about that. The scheme is devised for suitable low-risk offenders. Release under the scheme can provide opportunities for successful resettlement by enabling offenders to resume employment or training earlier. It can be one of the first steps in helping offenders to lead a law-abiding life by enabling them to take responsibility for their lives and support themselves and their family.</p>
	<p pid="a.312.0/5">I agree with the hon. Gentleman that for some people there has been a failure in doing that. We need to ensure that we have better systems in place to identify those who are at the greatest risk. Shortly after we introduced the scheme, we identified a series of offences that automatically deem people unsuitable for it. I could read the list, but I see that the hon. Gentleman wants to intervene.</p>

	<p pid="a.314.1/1">What is important is that anyone who is serving a determinate sentence of 12 months or more will serve the first half in custody and the whole of the second half on probation supervision, during which time they will be liable to recall. They will not serve up to two thirds; they will serve the whole of the second half. That compares with the previous system in which the last quarter of the sentence was served without supervision and without conditions.</p>
	<p pid="a.314.1/2">There are 679 offenders who have been sentenced to the indeterminate public protection sentence that I referred to. In addition, there is the extended public protection sentence, which is for other sexual and violent offenders whose offences are not so serious but who are considered to present a risk to the public. That requires them to undergo extended periods of probation supervision. Of those sentences 679 have been passed since April this year.</p>
	<p pid="a.314.1/3">Those sentences are better sentencing with just one strand in delivering effective public protection. We are also committed to delivering better assessment of risk and better risk management using the offender assessment system, OASys, and other systems to identify risk.</p>
	<p pid="a.314.1/4">It is shocking that we do not always successfully identify risk. It is horrific that people who have been offenders go on to offend again and that so far we have not sufficiently protected the public from them. That is why we must continue to improve our assessment of risk and the quality of reports to bodies such as the Parole Board to ensure that they are excellent in every case and to ensure that the risk to the public is the paramount issue considered by the Parole Board and any other releasing body before allowing people to be released into the community.</p>

	<p pid="a.316.1/1">I am pleased to have the opportunity to bring to the attention of the House the situation in respect of the current public consultation being promoted by the Greater Manchester strategic health authority, &quot;Making it Better&quot;, which concerns proposed changes to health care services for children and young people, parents and babies in Greater Manchester. My interest is particularly and understandably in the hospital that serves my constituents, Fairfield hospital in Bury, but I want to make some remarks that spread a little more widely.</p>
	<p pid="a.316.1/2">In the north Manchester area at present we are going through a considerable period of change within the NHS. For example, the chief executive of the Bury primary care trust will retire this weekend and a new chief executive will be appointed in due course. The chairman of the Pennine Acute Hospitals NHS Trust resigned some weeks ago. We have a temporary chairman, and a permanent chairman will be appointed in due course. The chief executive of the Pennine trust will be leaving his position in a few weeks' time. The merger of primary care trusts is moving forward and a number of neighbouring PCTs will be amalgamated in the near future.</p>
	<p pid="a.316.1/3">The Greater Manchester strategic health authority, which has driven the process of consultation, will be abolished in the near future. The current chief executive and chairman will be moving to new positions or to pastures new and the Greater Manchester SHA will be absorbed into a new regional strategic health authority. Given the scale and pace of change in structural organisation in Greater Manchester, and of changes of leadership in the primary care trust and north-east sector and in many neighbouring primary care trusts, is this the right moment to embark on an additional, radical phase of reform, some elements of which have not been thought through in sufficient detail?</p>
	<p pid="a.316.1/4">Fairfield hospital is the hospital in which the vast majority of my constituents were born. Most families in Bury will have seen relatives die in that hospital. I was born there. Many of my relatives were born there and have worked there, and most of my relatives have died <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1431" name="David Crausby">there. My hon. Friend the Member for Bolton, North-East (Mr. Crausby)</phrase> was also born in Fairfield general hospital, as were his children and the children of the constituency assistant of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1636" name="Jim Dobbin">my hon. Friend the Member for Heywood and Middleton (Jim Dobbin)</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.316.1/5">You understand, Mr. Benton, the close personal interest that my colleagues and I have in the future of the maternity services at Fairfield. Our interest is enhanced by many distinguished people having being born there, not least the Prime Minister's wife. She was born in Fairfield a number of years after me. We were delighted that Mrs. Blair was able to reopen the new, refurbished and enhanced maternity unit just five years ago. To most members of the public and to most of my colleagues, suggesting that a unit that was reopened merely five years ago should now be closed and transferred to another hospital makes little sense.</p>
	<p pid="a.316.1/6">The current consultation process is the third attempt in six years to consider the future of maternity and paediatrics. The first attempt was stifled at birth, because it took the form of an internal report by the former regional health authority, before the Greater Manchester SHA was established. That came to the conclusion that the Fairfield hospital should maintain its maternity and paediatric service.</p>
	<p pid="a.316.1/7">That report did not see the light of day, but the debate continued until mid-2004, when a public consultation was launched with a different set of recommendations. In particular, it was suggested that Fairfield should lose its maternity and paediatric services but that Rochdale infirmary, the second of the four hospitals in the Pennine acute trust, should maintain its services. That public consultation was withdrawn following criticism by me and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1467" name="Ivan Lewis">my hon. Friends the Members for Bury, South (Mr. Lewis)</phrase>, for Heywood and Middleton and for Rossendale and Darwen (Janet Anderson) concerning the lack of detailed information supporting those conclusions.</p>
	<p pid="a.316.1/8">Following the withdrawal of that consultation, there was a further period of informal consultation from early to mid-2005, which culminated in the publication of the current consultation document in January 2006&mdash;it was launched on <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-12">12 January</phrase>. Fortunately, it has been extended for an additional month, to mid-May, so today's debate is very timely, as we are moving towards the final weeks of consultation.</p>
	<p pid="a.316.1/9">The thrust of the proposals in the document are in many respects welcome and entirely in line with the views of most Greater Manchester Members and large sections of the general public. We are talking about a major expansion in primary care, and we welcome hugely the proposal to build 35 new primary care centres throughout Greater Manchester, seven of which will be in the borough of Bury and four of which will be in my constituency of Bury, North. The general drift of the proposals for primary care and the improvement of services outside hospitals is completely to be welcomed.</p>
	<p pid="a.316.1/10">We recognise the need for rationalisation in maternity and paediatric services and units. Most people accept the need to reduce the number of separate units. We are not arguing against the principles underlying the consultation. We are arguing against the specific choice of Fairfield hospital as one of the hospitals that will lose its maternity and paediatrics in-patient services.</p>
	<p pid="a.316.1/11">When the first consultation was launched in 2004, there was considerable public reaction in Bury: a major petition was launched and a march was held. The best part of 5,000 people marched through the centre of the town to express their opposition to the proposal. That was in early 2005. Next Saturday, another march will be held in the centre of Bury, and I imagine that several thousand people will march against the proposal to close the maternity unit at Fairfield. In addition, at least 30,000 people have signed a petition supporting the retention of maternity services at Fairfield.</p>
	<p pid="a.316.1/12">I stress again that the general direction of the proposed reforms has considerable public support. We are all in favour of the expansion of primary care, and we recognise the need for rationalisation following the closure of two of the older children's hospitals and the formation of the new tertiary children's hospital in the centre of Manchester. Change has to take place.</p>
	<p pid="a.316.1/13">We recognise the imperative of the working time directive and the pressure on doctors' rotas. We recognise the problems that will be caused by a shortage of midwives&mdash;or problems with their age profile, as a considerable number will be retiring in the not too distant future. We understand all the pressures on maintaining a well-staffed and safe service across a large number of sites, and Greater Manchester is fortunate in having a larger number than many regional cities. Nevertheless, we argue that it is wrong to choose to close Fairfield.</p>
	<p pid="a.316.1/14">I shall outline some of the reasons for our opposition. The process through which the consultation has developed was questionable in one key respect: it started with the designation of sites. Once the sites that should continue had been designated, criteria were established to test the validity of that choice. That puts the process the wrong way around; it puts the cart before the horse. In a normal decision-making process, one would reasonably expect to establish criteria before making a decision about the options. In this case, the SHA has chosen the options before agreeing the criteria. Subsequent to the options being chosen, they were tested against the criteria, but certain options that were excluded from the start might also have satisfied the criteria that were agreed. It is important to stress that there is a serious flaw in the process that was established earlier. Owing to that, our hospital has not been given the full opportunity to demonstrate its case against the agreed criteria.</p>
	<p pid="a.316.1/15">The consultation document published this year is detailed. One could not criticise the SHA for not attempting to provide a substantial amount of information. The document is not completely accessible, and aspects of the layout and the presentation of the information could have been done better, but by and large we have no criticisms.</p>
	<p pid="a.316.1/16">In addition, a considerable amount of information has been published on the website. The information is relevant to the process, the choice of options, the establishment of the criteria and the pre-consultation carried out, and it contains details of clinicians' internal meetings and the arguments made. The SHA has gone out of its way to offer considerable information to the general public to help formulate their decision.</p>
	<p pid="a.316.1/17">However, certain key areas of information are neither included in the consultation document nor properly presented on the website. For example, one element of the website deals with staffing. It identifies for all hospitals in Greater Manchester the numbers of whole-time equivalent staff in paediatrics, for example, so that we can find out how many paediatricians or whole-time equivalent paediatricians work at each hospital. However, we do not get the same information for midwifery and nursing staff, so there is a significant gap in the information on staffing. There is also no information about how the proposals for the new reduced number of maternity units would be staffed. Again, that is a significant gap, and it limits the extent to which people can form a reasoned judgment about whether the series of proposed options is workable and justifiable.</p>
	<p pid="a.316.1/18">As I recall, one item on the website says that the work force strategy and action plan, which will presumably determine how the proposed new units are staffed, will be presented to the task force in April. If the consultation has been under way for the best part of two years, and the current phase was launched in early January, but the decisions about the work force strategy are not to be taken until April, there seems to be something wrong with the time frame of the process.</p>
	<p pid="a.316.1/19">Another gap in the background information on the website is the revenue and capital cost implications of the proposals. It is not just a gap; it is a hole. There is no information about those implications. Evaluating whether it would be better to maintain services at Fairfield general or another hospital&mdash;</p>

	<p pid="a.319.2/1">I shall attempt to continue seamlessly from the point at which I left off. I was discussing the question of revenue and capital costs in the consultation document, or, more accurately, their absence from it.</p>
	<p pid="a.319.2/2">If we consider on the website the papers relevant to paediatrics and maternity for the Pennine acute trust, there is literally a gap when we come to the proposals for maternity. There are no financial costings, just a simple comment that the</p>
	<p pid="a.319.2/3" class="indent">&quot;Pennine (and the constituent hospital sites) are working up a variety of schemes that encompass a range of outcomes from the NE and Children's consultations.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.319.2/4">That seems to me an interesting comment on the view of the possible sites from within the Pennine acute trust itself.</p>
	<p pid="a.319.2/5">To many of my constituents, one of the biggest contradictions in the proposals seems to be on the question of choice. My hon. Friend the Minister knows what great emphasis the Government have placed in recent years on patient choice in developing their policy. That featured prominently in our general election manifesto and, more recently, in the document &quot;Creating a Patient-led NHS&quot;. It will be appreciated that for thousands of people in my constituency who have been born in Fairfield, and who continue to expect that their children and grandchildren will be born there, the idea of patient choice rings a little hollow if the overwhelming choice expressed about the hospital in which they wish to give birth is taken away from them.</p>
	<p pid="a.319.2/6">I stress the point that if we, as a Government, are serious about patient choice then it makes no sense whatsoever to take away what is an enormously popular choice for many people in my constituency, Bury North, and its neighbouring districts, especially in significant parts of Rochdale, Heywood, Middleton and Rossendale.</p>
	<p pid="a.319.2/7">In the district that Fairfield supports, everyone would accept that Fairfield and Rochdale infirmary are both smaller hospitals. We also accept that Bury and Rochdale are two of the smaller towns within the Greater Manchester conurbation. However, to deprive both hospitals of their maternity and in-patient paediatric services would leave a gaping hole in the north of that conurbation, unique when every other part of it would remain well served in maternity and paediatrics by local hospitals. We find that gaping hole unacceptable; for local people, it would result in severe deterioration of both services in and accessibility to the NHS.</p>
	<p pid="a.319.2/8">We also know that while Bury and Rochdale are two of the smaller towns, their combined population&mdash;with the neighbouring district of Rossendale&mdash;is greater than that of the city of Manchester, which brings me to my final point. The consultation document offers four options for the future, none of which include Bury or Rochdale. I believe that to consider an amalgamation of Bury and Rochdale's in-patient paediatric and maternity service on the Fairfield site would be an ideal fifth option, and one which is increasingly supported by wide numbers of local people, and particularly by clinicians, nursing staff and doctors working in the Pennine acute trust.</p>
	<p pid="a.319.2/9">That amalgamation would have several advantages. First, it would create an in-patient service and maternity unit large enough to deliver the economies of scale and critical mass of patient through-put to ensure that staff working in the unit were faced with the full range of clinical problems that they would need in order to maintain the quality of their clinical practice. Were we to amalgamate Bury and Rochdale it would, by dealing with the necessary critical mass of patients, mean that we would be talking broadly of 13 births per day compared, for example, to 12 in the neighbouring hospital at Bolton or seven at North Manchester. If talking of maternity outpatients we would be talking of over 400 compared, for example, to 100 at North Manchester or 310 at Oldham. I could go through a long list of figures to demonstrate that merging the two units would create a more than viable single site.</p>
	<p pid="a.319.2/10">A second point is that in terms of choosing between the two locations, given that Fairfield hospital is the last building in my constituency and immediately adjacent to the border with Rochdale&mdash;if it were moved 50 yards further to the east it would be in the borough of Rochdale&mdash;it is ideally suited to serve the population of my constituency and other parts of the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Bury, South, and also most parts of Rochdale and the district of Rossendale to the north. The central geographical location of Fairfield hospital is also a powerful case for my fifth option.</p>
	<p pid="a.319.2/11">We welcome the consultation document published by the strategic health authority and the considerable amount of work that has gone into it. We recognise the serious attempt to hold an open and transparent consultation; we value the information that has been provided; we support the general direction of policy in the rationalisation of the total number of units and the concentration on centres of excellence and the massive expansion of primary care. However, we think that the SHA has made the wrong decision in the choice of site and therefore I, and a considerable number of my constituents&mdash;I mentioned the 30,000 who have already signed the petition, and several thousand will demonstrate on the streets of Bury on Saturday&mdash;will support the fifth option, the amalgamation of in-patient paediatric and maternity services in Fairfield hospital in Bury.</p>

	<p pid="a.321.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1466" name="David Chaytor">my hon. Friend the Member for Bury, North (Mr. Chaytor)</phrase> on securing this debate on maternity services. He advanced a powerful argument. I thank him for bringing the debate to the Floor of the House and for his consistent argument with Ministers on behalf of his constituents off the Floor of the House. I want to put on record <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1467" name="Ivan Lewis">my thanks to my hon. Friend the Member for Bury, South (Mr. Lewis)</phrase>, the Economic Secretary to the Treasury, for his contribution to the debate. My final words of thanks are to the <i>Bury Times</i> and to the <i>Manchester Evening News</i>, which have consistently kept the debate, and the facts, in front of the local community. Their approach to the subject showed again that they are effective voices for local people.</p>
	<p pid="a.321.0/2">The starting point of the debate is the extraordinary changes that have happened in the national health service in the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Bury, North since 1997. They have happened not by accident, but because we doubled, and are on our way to tripling, health service investment, which has meant more than 360 extra consultants, 2,500 extra nurses and 3,700 more health care assistants for Greater Manchester since 1997. As a result, waiting times for the health service in his part of the country and in the rest of England have fallen dramatically. In 1997, about 18,000 people had to wait more than six months for in-patient treatment in Greater Manchester, but today that figure has come down to none&mdash;no one waits longer than six months.</p>
	<p pid="a.321.0/3">The improvements in the NHS generally are also true for maternity services. Last year, we achieved our target of recruiting an extra 2,000 midwives. The vacancy rate for midwives throughout the country has come down from about 3.3 per cent. in 2000 to 1.8 per cent. My hon. Friend mentioned some concerns about the number of midwives who are coming up to retirement age. I am pleased that there has been a 44 per cent. increase in the number of students entering training to become midwives, which is great news.</p>
	<p pid="a.321.0/4">It is no surprise, therefore, that the vast number of women&mdash;80 per cent.&mdash;who use the NHS when they have a baby are overwhelmingly satisfied with maternity services. The satisfaction rate for men is not equivalent, but it is not far off. As someone who has three children aged five and under, I have spent some time in maternity wards in the not-too-distant past, and the service is first class.</p>
	<p pid="a.321.0/5">The most important figure is that of infant mortality. We now have the lowest ever rate of infant mortality in England&mdash;5.1 deaths per 1,000 live births&mdash;because of the big investment we have made. As my hon. Friend said, reform has to go alongside that new investment over the months and years ahead. I am grateful for his measured presentation of the arguments in his part of the country.</p>
	<p pid="a.321.0/6">Fairfield hospital is part of the Pennine Acute Hospitals NHS Trust, which is involved in two of the biggest health improvement programmes in the country. The geography of my hon. Friend's area is unique. The pattern of mill towns that developed there over the 19th century has meant that many of the hospital services are small and unique in their configuration. My argument is that, although those services worked extremely well in the past, in the 21st century, they have to change.</p>
	<p pid="a.321.0/7">Part of the change must be to the organisation of maternity and obstetric services. The reorganisation is not proposed for the sake of reform; it reflects three important principles. I am referring to principles that we set out in the White Paper on health and social care, to which my hon. Friend alluded. That is important because, in the 21st century, people want an NHS that is available not only around the clock, but around the corner. We therefore have far more to do on moving in-patient services out of hospitals&mdash;their traditional location&mdash;into the community. Quite significant services can be moved into the community, where they are far more convenient, particularly for people from more deprived communities, who often lack access to public services in general and to services such as transport in particular.</p>
	<p pid="a.321.0/8">The position that I have described has an important bearing on how maternity services will be organised in my hon. Friend's constituency. In particular, we will ask PCTs to go about developing and implementing the national service framework for maternity services quickly. At the last election, we knocked four or five years off the deadline for implementing that framework. We now have plans in place for its implementation and we hope to see a big expansion of community-based midwifery services. They are particularly important to ensure that people from all corners of the community have access to early antenatal care, which is vital to the future baby's health and to the mother's health. Dr. Foster estimates that about 40 per cent of births are unassisted and could be safely delivered in a midwife-led unit or at home. That is the first issue.</p>
	<p pid="a.321.0/9">The second issue is the pattern of 24-hour in-patient services, which are spread quite thinly across the hospital sites in Greater Manchester. That results in pressures on staffing. I understand that maternity units across the review area were closed on 90 separate occasions over a 12-month period to March 2006. Those closures ranged from a few hours to an entire day.</p>
	<p pid="a.321.0/10">Thirdly, it is important to create strong 24-hour in-patient services, because they allow a critical mass of patients to come together and they allow clinicians to develop particular types of expertise. Why is that important? The infant mortality rate in central Manchester is eight per 1,000 babies&mdash;I am referring to babies who die before their first birthday&mdash;compared with a rate of only two per 1,000 in mid-Surrey. There are great inequalities in the infant mortality rate, and we must reflect that in the services that we organise.</p>
	<p pid="a.321.0/11">Those are all big questions, and that is exactly why the consultation is so important. I am especially grateful to my hon. Friend for highlighting fresh and innovative proposals that were not put on the table in the consultation. I will personally write to the chief executive of the strategic health authority to make sure that those proposals are taken into account as the consultation unfolds.</p>
	<p pid="a.321.0/12">My hon. Friend made a central point about criteria being developed after the configurations were proposed. I will look into that and write back to him on it. He also made some important points about gaps in information. I am grateful for his thanks for the way in which a lot of detail was presented but, if there are gaps in information, I will see what we can do to remedy that. He mentioned that there is an ongoing debate that has captured the attention of the entire community, and I understand that there are marches this Saturday. I want to make it clear that, where there are petitions and where there is a public response of that kind, we will absolutely make sure that those voices are heard as the consultation draws to a close.</p>
	<p pid="a.321.0/13">I wanted to make one final point. I know that there has been some debate about&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.321.0/14" class="indent">It being fifteen minutes to Six o'clock, the motion for the Adjournment of the sitting lapsed, without Question put.</p>
