	<p pid="a.1.4/1">Thank you, Mrs. Humble, and a happy new year to you and to other hon. Members. I thank Mr. Speaker for granting us permission to hold this important debate on NHS dentistry, the Minister for attending and those hon. Members who intend to contribute. I thank also Dr. Alisdair McKendrick, a local dentist in Kettering and the Northamptonshire representative of the British Dental Association, with whom I have had many discussions during recent months. I wish also to thank all the dentists in my constituency of Kettering who provide an extremely professional and enthusiastic service to many thousands of local residents.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.4/2">There is a major crisis in NHS dentistry not only in Kettering, but throughout the country. That is a particular shame because in 2000, just over five years ago, the Prime Minister promised that everyone would have access to an NHS dentist within two years. I regret to say that that was all talk. Throughout the country, particularly in Kettering, fewer people are registered with an NHS dentist than was the case seven years ago. According to Government figures published in response to a parliamentary question that I tabled, since 2002, almost 7,000 local residents in the Kettering constituency have been thrown off the list of NHS dentists. Fewer people are registered with an NHS dentist in the constituency than at any time since the Government came to power.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.4/3">Indeed, throughout the county of Northamptonshire, only 47 per cent. of local residents are registered with an NHS dentist.</p>

	<p pid="a.1.6/1">I will, after I have read out a letter from a constituent&mdash;one of the victims who have been thrown off the NHS list. Last September, Katherine Clay from Channing street, Kettering, wrote:</p>
	<p pid="a.1.6/2" class="indent">&quot;Dear Mr Hollobone . . . I am writing to make you aware of the appalling situation where it is impossible to get an NHS Dentist.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.6/3" class="indent">I have been registered with my dentist for a while as an NHS patient and have kept up my regular appointments. This week I received a letter saying that I was now being removed from their list and if I still wanted to receive NHS treatment I would have to find another dentist.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.1.6/4">Mrs. Clay goes on to say:</p>
	<p pid="a.1.6/5" class="indent">&quot;As far as I was aware Britain has a National Health Service&mdash;that is a free, or subsidised medical service. Increasingly this is no longer the case. People are being forced into paying for medical insurance out of the fear of not being able to get treatment when they need it, or the frustration of having to wait for long periods of time, often in pain, for routine or vital operations.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.6/6" class="indent">I am a single person on a reasonable income but with having to pay a mortgage etc I find that I would be in a difficult position had I to pay a monthly premium for dental treatment that I would perhaps never need (and pay on top when I did actually visit the dentist).&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.1.6/7">Sadly, Katherine Clay's experiences are all too typical in the Kettering constituency.</p>

	<p pid="a.3.1/1">No, it is not all doom and gloom, but it is pretty gloomy out there. I would suggest that the hon. Gentleman might like to spend rather more time talking to thousands of his constituents who are suffering from lack of access to NHS dental care. He and his colleagues ought to take the issue far more seriously than the interventions heretofore suggest.</p>
	<p pid="a.3.1/2">There are two fundamental problems with NHS dentistry. The first is an appalling lack of Government investment. To be fair, that is not entirely down to this Government, as the trend has gone on for far too long, although it is accelerating under the current regime. According to the National Audit Office, since 1990&ndash;91, overall spending on the NHS has gone up by 75 per cent., but overall spending on NHS dentistry has gone up by just 9 per cent. I am afraid that we are beginning to see the result of that lack of investment, which is being accelerated under this Government.</p>
	<p pid="a.3.1/3">The other problem is that the contracts offered by the Department of Health to dentists for working as NHS employees are not attractive enough to retain them. This is a question not just of remuneration, but of the work load with which dentists have to struggle and the amount of quality time they can offer their patients.</p>
	<p pid="a.3.1/4">One of the big myths is that dentists' main motivation for staying in the private sector is that they can earn more. That is certainly not the motivation for dentists in Kettering who leave the NHS. They are leaving because the new contracts offered to them do not reward them for the work, and the quality of work, that they want to offer their patients. I am afraid that as a result, despite the pledges, an important part of the health service is being privatised. There is no getting away from that.</p>
	<p pid="a.3.1/5">The Government need to consider different ways to encourage the establishment of new dental practices. A gentleman from my constituency has approached me with a very innovative scheme to set up a new dental practice in Kettering, but because he is not a dentist he is finding it very difficult to get the appropriate funding and permission.</p>

	<p pid="a.4.0/1">I am incredibly grateful to my hon. Friend, who is being generous in giving way. He is summing up the problems of NHS dentistry in an articulate and expert manner.</p>
	<p pid="a.4.0/2">The point that my hon. Friend has just made is perfectly good. In Shipley, I have the same problem. Mr. Bostock, a local man, wants to set up an NHS dental practice and import dentists from other countries to run it, yet is unable to do so because he is not a dentist. He does not want to put his equipment into people's mouths&mdash;he is happy to employ experts to do that&mdash;but he is prevented from setting up the practice because he is not a dentist. Surely that anomaly should be addressed immediately. I have written to the Government about the issue, which provides a perfect example of what could be done quickly to help to resolve the crisis in NHS dentistry.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-01-10a.6.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1850" speakername="David Drew" colnum="6"  time="009:49:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060110/halltext/60110h01.htm#60110h01_spnew16">
	<p pid="a.6.0/1">I am delighted to be here at the start of the new year, and happy new year to you, Mrs. Humble. I am not sure whether this Chamber will change the nature of these debates, but I fear that we have started with a slightly more adversarial issue.</p>
	<p pid="a.6.0/2">I should tell <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1661" name="Philip Hollobone">the hon. Member for Kettering (Mr. Hollobone)</phrase> that I share many of his worries. We Labour Members are not complacent about the issue. I wrote to a dentist in my constituency yesterday, and this is probably the most difficult issue that I face there. I am largely an optimist, and always try to look at the best side of things, but in my eight years as MP for Stroud, the most difficult meeting that I have had was with my dentists in the town of Stroud. However, that does not necessarily reflect the situation in the whole constituency. In that meeting, I was completely disabused of what I went into the meeting thinking would come out of it&mdash;that is, reaffirmation of a belief in NHS dentistry. Most of those dentists had gone private, some entirely so, and they made things clear to me.</p>
	<p pid="a.6.0/3">I welcome the Under-Secretary of State for Health, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1414" name="Liam Byrne">the Member for Birmingham, Hodge Hill (Mr. Byrne)</phrase>, and I will be gentle with him because this matter is not part of his brief. I have already raised it with the Minister of State, Department of Health, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1544" name="Rosie Winterton">the Member for Doncaster, Central (Ms Winterton)</phrase>. Those dentists made it clear that they did not really see any future in NHS dentistry, certainly not NHS dentistry as I take it to be. The meeting took place two years ago, at the start of the negotiations on the new contract, and the dentists saw the negotiations as setting a benchmark in relation to which they would improve their conditions. I got depressed as a result of that meeting. It is always a delight to see <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1718" name="Paul Beresford">the hon. Member for Mole Valley (Sir Paul Beresford)</phrase>, and no doubt he will give us his view as a practitioner.</p>
	<p pid="a.6.0/4">I will give an overview of my area. I live in a constituency that could be parodied as including this country's Berlin wall, in that it is divided. In the south of my constituency, most dentists are NHS. They believe in NHS dentistry and want to stay in the NHS. Those in the north, who are mainly based in and around the town of Stroud, have gone private. I do not know how we can bring them back. I have to hope that the new contract will assist with that, but there are difficult times ahead.</p>
	<p pid="a.6.0/5">One of my dentists, Mr. Richard Gwyer, wrote to me and raised an issue, which I will raise in a series of questions to my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary, concerning the three new bands and what my constituent sees as a tax, although I do not see it that way. He thinks that there is an inflation of charges&mdash;a dramatic inflation of some charges. There has been a conflation of the different charges in this system, which I do not think anyone, including dentists, can understand because there are so many. Charges for some operations that dentists undertake will go up and some will go down, but some increases will be dramatic.</p>
	<p pid="a.6.0/6">The other thing that utterly depressed me was the way that some dentists used the threat of deregistering children as an inducement to the parents to stay with them and to sign up to their particular private plan, whether it be Denplan or something else. I do not think that that approach is acceptable. One of the depressing things about the issue is that it involves people who were trained and paid for by the NHS, because in those days there were no tuition fees. Such people have an obligation to the NHS.</p>
	<p pid="a.6.0/7">One thing that I would lay down&mdash;this has not yet been formally proposed&mdash;is that anyone who goes through dental school as a UK citizen should have an obligation, whether in the form of contract or not, to do a number of years for the NHS come what may. That should be laid down to recoup some of the substantial investment that is made in training dentists. I hope that the Government take the issue forward.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-01-10a.7.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1850" speakername="David Drew" colnum="7"  time="009:49:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060110/halltext/60110h01.htm#60110h01_spnew20">
	<p pid="a.7.3/1">Expenditure on GPs is relatively small, compared with the overall NHS budget, but I have some sympathy with what the hon. Gentleman says. Learning from history and hindsight, the changes could have been done differently.</p>
	<p pid="a.7.3/2">The problem is that GPs look at people such as dentists: the hon. Gentleman is right&mdash;this is not just about money, it is about quality of life&mdash;but those two things go together. If people get more money, they can to some extent determine their quality of life and quality of working patterns much more easily. I am afraid that GPs have considered dentists and there was, among some, a view that there was life outside the NHS.</p>
	<p pid="a.7.3/3">I shall return to my questions, although I do not want to speak for long because other hon. Members want to contribute to this important debate. It would be helpful if the Department ran a briefing session on charges with MPs&mdash;or at least made it clear what the three bands consist of&mdash;and justified the enormous operation inflation, where that has happened. Dentists raised with me the additional costs of dentures, which seem to have led to a dramatic increase. Likewise, it would be helpful if the Department gave some proof of which charges have decreased, given that the overall sum involved seems to have been reduced.</p>
	<p pid="a.7.3/4">There is also the issue of those who have taken part in professional dental service contracts. There does not seem to have been a seamless move from the old contract to the new. We are changing the nature of the contract in respect of units of dental activity, but if we are to gain anything from the dental service contracts, we need to recognise those loyal servants of the NHS in dentistry, who have worked hard.</p>
	<p pid="a.7.3/5">I name, among others, Steve Clarke, who runs a big practice in Dursley in my constituency and who has made clear his commitment not just to stay in the NHS, but to train new NHS dentists. He wants to build his practice and see NHS dentistry flourish there. The question is, how is someone who has been on a professional dental service contract, worked through with the PCT, to do that? I also need to mention Chris Morton, the operative in the PCT with whom I have had a lot of dealings. I am thankful to the Minister of State, because we got an additional dentist into the practice through the work of Chris Morton, but I am not sure how PDS translates into the new contract.</p>
	<p pid="a.7.3/6">There is also the issue of list sizes, which relates to one of the sticking points in trying to get some help for my dentist, David Rees. There was a problem with how the Department defines list sizes. With the best will in the world, particularly if someone joins a new practice from abroad, the idea that a dentist can immediately step up to some of these numbers is not necessarily a good one. I know that there is a notion that dentists can have a list of about 2,000, but the Department was somewhat unrealistic in considering how quickly a dentist, particularly one from abroad, could take on the numbers necessary to make the figures balance.</p>
	<p pid="a.7.3/7">I hope that my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary will take up those issues, although, as I said, this is not his brief. The issue is crucial, however, and I hope that all sides will work together. I hope that the BDA comes back to the negotiating table and, in a sense, becomes more representative of dentists. I am having a go not at the BDA, but at what has happened to dentistry. Dentistry has moved away from being represented by a collective body because many dentists have chosen to go along the private route. I want them back in the NHS.</p>
	<p pid="a.7.3/8">Dentistry is part of the NHS. Dentists have always had some private aspects to their work&mdash;even people who work almost exclusively for the NHS have done some private work&mdash;but, in the main, dentistry should be an NHS provision and it should be carried out by NHS providers.</p>

	<p pid="a.12.1/1">I agree&mdash;not one dentist in my constituency has opened its list for NHS patients. The dentist at the Balderstone surgery, John Booth, who has been a dentist for 14 years, said that</p>
	<p pid="a.12.1/2" class="indent">&quot;it has got to the point where we are having to see up to 50 patients each a day. We're just herding them through.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.12.1/3">I accept that that happened under the old contract, but, importantly, this is what he says about the new contract:</p>
	<p pid="a.12.1/4" class="indent">&quot;The new contract does focus on prevention which means spending more time with patients but more talking means less work&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.12.1/5">The subtext to that is less money, for which nobody will vote.</p>
	<p pid="a.12.1/6">The Minister says that for two years the amount of money that dentists get will remain the same, but that will not solve the problem, nor will it bring more dentists into the system. My local PCT told me that another eight dentists are needed in my constituency, but we are not getting them. Unless the Government can do something to bring dentists into the system, things will go from bad to worse.</p>
	<p pid="a.12.1/7">I would like the Minister to consider three issues, and I am surprised that new Labour is not considering the first. It seems that there can be privatisation everywhere else in the NHS. My mother, a 73-year-old pensioner, no longer has a dentist, and many people do not see a dentist regularly. Why cannot the Government, on a short-term basis, buy in the services of some private dentists to cope with the problem?</p>
	<p pid="a.12.1/8">The amount of money under the new contracts was announced before Christmas, and, as the regulations have been prayed against, we shall be discussing the figures. I am concerned about whether the money allocated will be historical and whether it will do something to address areas such as Rochdale and Wigan, which the Minister has admitted are black spots for dental provision. Will more money be allocated to those areas to ensure that local PCTs can provide more dentists?</p>
	<p pid="a.12.1/9">In July last year, the Greater Manchester strategic health authority stopped allowing new PDS contracts, which meant that three dentists in my constituency who wanted to open a practice were not able to do so. I want assurances from the Minister that there will be not just this contract, but long-term investment in dentistry and, as the hon. Member for Stroud said, real commitment to NHS dentistry. If the Government will not provide that, they may as well admit to doing what the Conservatives would do anyway and privatise things. <i>[Interruption.]</i> I am sorry, but the Conservatives' record is not one that I can condone.</p>
	<p pid="a.12.1/10">If the Government believe in NHS dentistry, there must be commitment. Yes, we had a promise from the Prime Minister in September 1999, but it is yet to be delivered. In my book, two years&mdash;from 1999 to now&mdash;represents an awfully long time on the new Labour clock.</p>

	<p pid="a.13.0/1">I apologise again to colleagues for arriving late. I shall be brief. I thank <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1661" name="Philip Hollobone">the hon. Member for Kettering (Mr. Hollobone)</phrase> for securing this debate. We all look back to the good old days of dentistry, but dentistry has moved on. I have heard <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1718" name="Paul Beresford">the hon. Member for Mole Valley (Sir Paul Beresford)</phrase> refer to that. Cosmetic dentistry is only one additional aspect of dentistry, which has gone way beyond the drill-and-fill and extractions of the past.</p>
	<p pid="a.13.0/2">As colleagues are aware, dentistry, like all other NHS matters, is devolved in Scotland, and as far as I am concerned this issue rests with the Scottish Parliament, but it is just as well to share with hon. Members exactly what is happening north of the border. I take no consolation from the fact that my area is the second worst in this respect in the whole of Scotland. Only Aberdeenshire fares worse than Dumfries and Galloway.</p>
	<p pid="a.13.0/3">It is right to say that not all dentists are the same. People's hearts lie in different areas, and some people still work hard within the NHS. I have never been one who has advocated that the NHS system that we have all grown to love over many years is in any shape or form right for today. In each of the last three weeks before the general election, a dental practice in my constituency went private, and I have to ask whether something political was going on. The Scottish Parliament's Minister with responsibility for dentistry was to visit a dental practice on the Tuesday. On the Saturday morning, the patients of that dental practice received a letter stating that a new, exciting and innovative service was being introduced for them.</p>
	<p pid="a.13.0/4">Many people whose dental practices have gone private have received such a letter. This was a long letter containing complaints about everything that was wrong. There were complaints about Governments&mdash;not just this Government&mdash;and at the end of the letter the patients were informed that if they wanted to sign up to the new service that the practice would be running, they should bring their bank details with them.</p>
	<p pid="a.13.0/5">This is all about the laws of economics&mdash;about supply and demand. Some people have seized upon that. I have been condemned in my local press by certain individuals for calling dentists greedy, but I stand by those comments as some dentists have become too greedy. If we were to ask some retired dentists about what is going on across the country, they would shudder. They would never have carried out their business&mdash;we must keep it in mind that these are private businesses&mdash;in such a manner. People are being turned on to the street and asked to queue.</p>

	<p pid="a.14.0/1">I am not sure whether I was right to take that intervention, but I will back up my claim about greed to the hon. Gentleman. It is only of late&mdash;and with some reluctance, I think&mdash;that the British Dental Association has condemned the practice of some dentists of turning people out on to the street and asking them to queue for hours to sign up.</p>
	<p pid="a.14.0/2">I appreciate that this is not part of the Minister's brief, but I am not convinced that the new NHS dental contract will provide solutions to the problems that we face. Dumfries and Galloway health board has turned to an organisation called Integrated Dental Holdings to provide NHS dentists for the area I represent, albeit those dentists will come from overseas. The board turned to IDH because it has operated in Shropshire for the past seven or eight years. In seeking information on IDH, I turned to two of the four Conservative Members whose constituencies are served by Shropshire county primary care trust. They told me that they had a problem in 1997, and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1818" name="Owen Paterson">the hon. Member for North Shropshire (Mr. Paterson)</phrase> said that he got a significant haranguing in the run-up to the general election of that year. IDH came along and provided a service that meets the needs of the people of the area, and I hope that it will provide answers to some problems that my area faces.</p>
	<p pid="a.14.0/3"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1784" name="Paul Rowen">The hon. Member for Rochdale (Paul Rowen)</phrase> asked why the Government do not buy into what is happening. Dumfries and Galloway health board approached some dental practices that have gone private, and it would take a king's ransom to get any of them to do any NHS work. The cost would be exorbitant in the extreme&mdash;almost a waste of money in trying to get them back on board.</p>
	<p pid="a.14.0/4">I use the word &quot;greed&quot; because this matter boils down to the fact that different dental practices in different parts of the country operate different payment systems. I have spoken to colleagues in the House. Some said, &quot;Yes, I am with a private dental practice, and I pay for my treatment when I receive it.&quot; Others are signed up to a dental plan, which they pay for monthly. They do not have to pay for treatment when they receive it. However, I have to tell you, Mrs. Humble, that in my area the vast majority of dentists ask people to make a monthly payment of between &pound;12 and &pound;22 per month, and they are then asked to pay for their dental treatment on top.</p>
	<p pid="a.14.0/5">I ask the Minister to consider a simple calculation: if a dental practice asks people to pay &pound;12 a month and takes on 1,000 patients, that equates to more than &pound;140,000 a year. Even if the best part of a third of that is offset, that dentist will receive &pound;100,000 per annum on top of what he earns. That is why I have made my point.</p>
	<p pid="a.14.0/6">I am not convinced that any NHS dental contract will bring those people back into the fold. Regrettably, the answer comes back to the law of supply and demand. Flooding areas with dentists&mdash;albeit, I suspect, most will come from overseas&mdash;is the only way in which dentists will suffer pain. I discovered from Shropshire primary care trust that private dentists were not happy when IDH arrived on the scene. I suspect, and to some degree hope, that the same will happen when IDH arrives in my area.</p>

	<p pid="a.15.0/1">I respect your desire for brevity, Mrs. Humble.</p>
	<p pid="a.15.0/2">Last Friday, all three Members of Parliament who represent the London borough of Hillingdon met members of the local dental community and the message could not have been clearer: in the words of the chairman of the local dental committee, the contract as it stands is a disaster. Many of the themes will be all too familiar to the Minister, and I am sure that they will be elaborated on in Front-Bench exchanges.</p>
	<p pid="a.15.0/3">I would like to focus on three issues that particularly concern local dentists. The first is chronic underfunding of dentistry; the second, to pick up the comments made by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1850" name="David Drew">the hon. Member for Stroud (Mr. Drew)</phrase>, is the ability of the local primary care trust to handle new responsibilities; and the third, to pick up the comments made by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1783" name="Susan Kramer">the hon. Member for Richmond Park (Susan Kramer)</phrase>, is the future of orthodontics.</p>
	<p pid="a.15.0/4">On funding, a 46-year-old dentist made the point that his fee for fitting a crown on a posterior tooth was higher when he qualified than it is now. The point was also made that there is no London weighting in the contract. I would be grateful if the Minister explained whether consideration was given to London weighting and the reason for the apparent dismissal of that option.</p>
	<p pid="a.15.0/5">Another major concern over funding is loss of the ability to charge for failed appointments. I have read the Minister's response on that and have not been convinced. If payment is to continue on the basis of payment for units of dental activity and if a dentist does not have the opportunity to deliver a UDA because a patient does not turn up, the dentist loses UDA points and income through no fault of their own.</p>
	<p pid="a.15.0/6">I note the Minister's willingness to review the situation in the event of what is described as a sudden and dramatic change in the pattern of appointments and cancellations. It would be helpful to have some clearer parameters of what constitutes sudden and dramatic change.</p>
	<p pid="a.15.0/7">The second area of major concern in Hillingdon lies in the PCT's ability to manage the change. That concern is reinforced by the PCT's announcement in August that no new orthodontic referrals to Hillingdon hospital would be paid for. The background of that decision&mdash;if that is what it is&mdash;is the severe financial difficulties of the PCT. It is not alone in that and is wrestling with a &pound;31 million deficit. Cuts are the order of the day, and orthodontic referrals come first because they are deemed to be low priority and are lumped together with treatments such as homeopathy.</p>
	<p pid="a.15.0/8">There was no consultation on the announcement, nor any apparent effort to understand the true nature of such referrals. Around 250 people are involved and we are not talking about cosmetic orthodontics. They are referred to Victor Crow because he does work that no one else in Hillingdon can do. I have seen pictures of the burdens that his patients must carry around and they are horrific, involving terrible facial deformities, clefts and so on. The message to those patients from Hillingdon PCT and the system it fronts seems to be to put up or pay up. That could be an irreversible decision if Hillingdon hospital responds to the drop in funding by closing a department that is recognised as doing unique and excellent work in the area. When it has gone, it is unlikely that we will get it back.</p>
	<p pid="a.15.0/9">What is the saving to justify that loss of service? An estimated net &pound;40,000 a year. That is false economics in the context of a &pound;31 million deficit. This is not a local, parochial point. Hillingdon MPs have received representations from outside Hillingdon expressing concern that this is setting an alarming precedent for cash-strapped PCTs throughout the system, thereby doing irreversible damage to the future of orthodontics in this country. I urge the Minister to make inquiries about that initiative to ensure that any decision is fully informed, supported by cost-benefit analysis and taken with due regard to statutory procedure.</p>
	<p pid="a.15.0/10">The wider point is that the initiative by Hillingdon PCT reinforces concerns about the ability of the PCT to handle new dental responses in just three or four months from now. If it can make such a mess over the &pound;80,000 for which it is responsible today, what will it do with &pound;10 million and what will happen to that money once the three-year ring fence is over? Just three or four months away from implementing new contracts, the leadership of the PCT is distracted by financial problems and has a short-term outlook, governed by uncertainty as to its own future. It appears not to have taken steps to access the expert advice needed to help it to shoulder that responsibility.</p>
	<p pid="a.15.0/11">For my constituents who rely on NHS dentistry, the implication is bleak. The problem here is that the discontent is not the voice of Government employees. Dentists are independent agents over whom Government have few levers in a market with so much private provision. In truth, they will continue to migrate from the NHS. National statistics bear that out&mdash;dentists are leaving the NHS in roughly the same numbers as the Government are recruiting them. We are running very hard to stand still, but for me the local evidence is building.</p>
	<p pid="a.15.0/12">The chairman of the Hillingdon local dental committee recently took a straw poll of 10 surgeons in my constituency who provide NHS care for patients. Seven of the 10 stated that, as of <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-01">1 April</phrase>, they would be withdrawing from the NHS, leaving just three surgeries to cope with all the pressure from the PCT. How long before those three are also forced to go private? I expect the voice of my constituents to be raised then, asking exactly what the Government meant in saying that they were</p>
	<p pid="a.15.0/13" class="indent">&quot;firmly committed to making high quality NHS dentistry available to all who want it by September 2001&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.15.0/14">In commenting on the reform, Dr. Lester Ellman, chairman of the BDA general dental practice committee, said:</p>
	<p pid="a.15.0/15" class="indent">&quot;This is the Government's last chance to get this right: there will be no second chance for NHS dentistry.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.15.0/16">Based on the evidence that I see in Hillingdon, the Government are getting it wrong.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-01-10a.19.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1567" speakername="Stephen O'Brien" colnum="19"  time="010:40:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060110/halltext/60110h01.htm#60110h01_spnew36">
	<p pid="a.19.2/1">My hon. Friend makes an important and valuable contribution to the debate. If the fundamental issues are not addressed, no amount of patching up will address adequately patient and public health need. That point has not been over-emphasised during our discussion.</p>
	<p pid="a.19.2/2">The ill thought out and untested regulations that we are discussing will only exacerbate the shift away from the NHS. The Government's record on NHS dentistry has been one of abject failure. I will not chide the Under-Secretary too often, not least because the Minister of State in his Department with real responsibility for this issue&mdash;<phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1544" name="Rosie Winterton">the hon. Member for Doncaster, Central (Ms Winterton)</phrase>&mdash;has chosen not to attend; he is here in her place and we welcome him. However, I remind him that on <phrase class="date" code="1999-09-28">28 September 1999</phrase> the Prime Minister, as has been mentioned, promised that everyone would have access to an NHS dentist within two years. I should say for the record that that promise expired in 2001. The Government's failure to address the issue since then is a damning indictment of a succession of Ministers who never took the initiative to make the Prime Minister's wish a reality.</p>
	<p pid="a.19.2/3">The new contract should have been in operation for almost a year, but it has twice been delayed&mdash;first until October last year, and now until April this year. In December 2004, the British Dental Association walked out of negotiations in disgust. The Government's response was to publish the new contractual arrangements last year for information only; there was no consultation and no negotiation. The Under-Secretary may seek to chastise the previous Government for the 1990 general dental services contract, but he should remember that that was at least agreed by the profession, and that, after all, it was a generation ago. I hope that the Under-Secretary acknowledges that being in office for eight and a half years brings certain responsibilities for the present situation.</p>
	<p pid="a.19.2/4">We are now faced with the miserable situation of dentists being unable to negotiate a contract because of departmental intransigence and with the prospect of dentists walking out in disgust at what they are being offered. Responses to the dental charges consultation&mdash;dentists were at least consulted on those proposals&mdash;were negative in the extreme: 56 per cent. of respondents felt that the proposed charging system was unfair and 41 per cent. thought them unworkable.</p>
	<p pid="a.19.2/5" class="indent">&quot;Uncertainty surrounding the start date of the new contract&mdash;not to mention the contract's terms and conditions&mdash;has created a climate where dentists have been unable to plan for their practices in the long-term&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.19.2/6">Those are not my words, but the words of the Dental Practitioners Association. The business uncertainty created by the Department of Health is worthy of the Treasury. Maybe the Under-Secretary is lining up for preferment under the Chancellor's leadership. How else will he defend the Government's treatment of our dental practitioners? We should remember that dentists are business men and women as well. It is appalling that the Government encouraged dentists to negotiate new PDS contracts as late as eight months before they are scrapped and without making dentists aware of their intentions. What little goodwill that dentists had towards the Government has surely now been squandered. After all, they have to live in the real world. Like the rest of us, they have bank managers, who will demand that they have a business model that looks sustainable.</p>
	<p pid="a.19.2/7">The Government's penchant for constant meddling is reflected in the Department's &quot;pile it on&quot; attitude to PCTs. In the last three years PCTs have been given primary care medical services, out-of-hours services and community pharmacies. They will shortly be given responsibility for general ophthalmic services, whilst having to juggle the implementation of the choose-and-book system, practise-based commissioning and payment by results. At present, and in addition, virtually every single PCT in the country is set to be merged. Into this mix is thrown the commissioning of primary care dental services. PCTs are even now attempting to juggle responsibility for GP out-of-hours care and pharmacies alongside their other obligations. I wonder whether PCTs will be able to keep all these balls in the air at once. Before the Under-Secretary demands to know whether we would slow the pace of reform, I remind him that he put so much on to PCTs' plates by delaying the implementation of the contract not once, but twice.</p>
	<p pid="a.19.2/8">It is not as though the Government have not been warned. The NAO previously cast doubt on the ability of PCTs to commission dental services, saying in its report of <phrase class="date" code="2004-11-25">25 November 2004</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="a.19.2/9" class="indent">&quot;Primary Care Trusts . . . have little experience of high street dentistry.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.19.2/10">They</p>
	<p pid="a.19.2/11" class="indent">&quot;have limited capacity and . . . will need to develop new expertise in dentistry.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.19.2/12">They</p>
	<p pid="a.19.2/13" class="indent">&quot;will need to ensure that priority is given to delivering appropriate contracting arrangements, including providing sufficient expertise and resources.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.19.2/14">As far as I can tell, Ministers have not heeded the warnings, as highlighted in the helpful and important contribution by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1792" name="Nick Hurd">the Member for Ruislip-Northwood (Mr. Hurd)</phrase>. Perhaps the Under-Secretary would explain how he expects PCTs to manage the commissioning of primary care dental services without any acceptance of the NAO's conclusions and without offering PCTs any idea of how the system might work in practice. The Government have no idea of how the system will work because they did not pilot it. The NAO explained that no other country in the world had attempted to structure primary care dental services in the way that the Government have proposed and perhaps&mdash;just perhaps&mdash;piloting would have been advisable, as we urged.</p>
	<p pid="a.19.2/15">The basis of the new contract is the meta-currency of NHS dentistry, the unit of dental activity or UDA. Like the new charging system, which according to the BDA seems little more than a cynical revenue-generating exercise, UDAs will be awarded in bands. As with the charging system, that results in a number of anomalies. For example, a dentist will get the same number of UDAs for taking a tooth out&mdash;20 minutes of surgery time&mdash;as for saving the tooth by root filling it&mdash;one to one and a half hours of surgery time. I can see how dentists may want to offer preventative advice&mdash;the avowed aim of the new contract&mdash;in the former case, but I have difficulty seeing how any dentist would choose to offer it in the latter. That simply costs too much in terms of chair time.</p>
	<p pid="a.19.2/16">UDAs do not have a fixed price attached to them. I had assumed, like my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1922" name="Andrew Murrison">the Member for Westbury (Dr. Murrison)</phrase>, another member of the shadow health team, that UDAs would have a fixed national price attached to them. This would be consistent with operating a national tariff for other types of care. I was interested to learn that PCTs would have to determine the value of UDAs individually. Maybe setting a UDA price became too much of a headache for the Government.</p>
	<p pid="a.19.2/17">I would be interested to learn the Under-Secretary's views on whether PCTs have the administrative capacity to negotiate their way around such a complex system. We should not forget that many of them are in deficit, with some, like Cheshire West PCT, having very big deficits. Surely this will eventually result in some sort of postcode&mdash;or PCT&mdash;lottery, with the Government again deliberately building in unfairness.</p>
	<p pid="a.19.2/18">It is true that the Government's reforms seek to move away from the old so-called drill-and-fill culture engendered by having earnings fixed to the number of treatments provided, but the new system of UDAs will actually pave the way for a new drill-and-fill treadmill where dentists must chase a pre-agreed number of UDAs in a year. When the Minister of State was challenged last month, she said that it was inconceivable that a dentist would be able to achieve his or her number of UDAs in, say, nine months and then shut up shop for three months, because that would indicate serious flaws in the ability of PCTs to commission dental services. That is exactly the scenario that we and the National Audit Office have been trying to warn the Government about. It is surely conceivable, even possible, given that PCTs are novices at commissioning dentistry, that dentists may overperform against their contracts and shut up shop, or underperform. If either happens, where is the flexibility in the contract? Can dentists renegotiate their contract if they are likely to underperform? There is a tolerance figure of only 4 per cent. Admittedly, that has been doubled from the original 2 per cent., but it is still very narrow. Dentists are likely to overcompensate rather than risk a breach notice. Surely the Minister can see that, if dentists are not able to receive adequate payment for providing more treatment, that will hasten their exit from NHS dentistry. That would be a continuing disaster for the important matter of public health and public oral health in particular.</p>
	<p pid="a.19.2/19">The new regulations are unpopular, untested and unsound. They will solve neither the problem of falling NHS dental provision nor that of the drill-and-fill treadmill. Dentists and dental organisations have scorned them and the NAO has deep concerns about them. The Department appears to be seeking to wash its hands of the problem, shifting the responsibility and blame on to PCTs, which do not have the expertise, the resources or the time to deal with dentistry.</p>
	<p pid="a.19.2/20">As we heard, five years ago the Prime Minister said:</p>
	<p pid="a.19.2/21" class="indent">&quot;everyone within the next two years will be able once again to see an NHS dentist&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.19.2/22">I fear that the new contract will make NHS dentists an even rarer breed. Given the explicit warnings to the Government&mdash;not least in this excellent debate&mdash;whatever the Under-Secretary now says, he and the Government cannot disclaim full responsibility for the consequences of their actions.</p>

He has taken an interest in dentistry since his arrival in the House. There must be no complacency in this debate. It is vital that we recognise the precise point from which we start. We have increased the number of dentists, but not by enough. Since 1998, the number of dentists practising in this country has increased by only 22 per cent.&mdash;from 16,000 to about 20,000&mdash;but, of course, some of those dentists will have gone private. A 22 per cent. increase is good news, but is it enough? No, it is not. We have increased the number of adult NHS dentistry registrations since 1997, after a calamitous fall between 1992 and 1997, but by only 200,000. That is not enough. We need to do a lot more, which is precisely why the Government have put in place a three-point programme of action, which I shall explain this morning.</p>
	<p pid="a.22.0/3">The first point relates to investment. The Government have increased investment in NHS primary care dentistry by about 20 per cent. or &pound;250 million. For 2006&ndash;07, we are investing a further &pound;65 million, before taking account of the uplift for pay and prices. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1915" name="Peter Bone">The hon. Member for Wellingborough (Mr. Bone)</phrase>, who voiced concern about his poorest constituents, must support that investment. I know that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1932" name="David Cameron">the hon. Member for Witney (Mr. Cameron)</phrase> has thrown a great deal of Conservative policy up into the air and I hope that he will take the opportunity of that review to argue against the formula that says that the proceeds of economic over the next two or three years will be shared between tax cuts and public investment. Tax cuts will mean one thing for NHS dentistry: a programme of cuts.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-01-10a.26.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1856" speakername="Chris Mullin" colnum="26"  time="011:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060110/halltext/60110h02.htm#60110h02_spnew0">
	<p pid="a.26.1/1">First, and with all due respect to the Minister present, may I say that I regret the absence of the Minister of State? I know that government is seamless, but over the years I have noticed that some Departments are more seamless than others. Secondly, I commend the debate pack prepared by the Library. It is relevant to the debate and contains a lot of information that hon. Members with an interest in this subject might find useful.</p>
	<p pid="a.26.1/2">I have taken an interest in asylum and immigration policy for some time, both during my four years as Chairman of the Home Affairs Committee and in my two years as entry clearance Minister, among other things, at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. I wish to make it clear from the outset that I am generally supportive of the Government's tougher stand. It cannot be right to leave decisions about who enters the country to people traffickers and other criminal networks. I support the measures that have been taken over the years to speed up the process, to reduce the number of fraudulent claims and, when practically possible, to remove those whose claims have failed. I welcome the fact that in the past few years, thanks to the efforts of the Prime Minister and successive Home Secretaries, we have begun to get to grips with what once seemed an intractable problem.</p>
	<p pid="a.26.1/3">I have said that to demonstrate that I am not a soft touch on asylum policy. However, I believe in combining a robust approach towards asylum with basic human decency, especially when young children are involved; that is the point of the debate. For some years I have been worried about the fact that we are removing, to countries where they could face destitution, families with young children who, because of past failures in the processing system, have lived here for many years. I referring not to children from countries where, although living standards might be low, there is a degree of stability, but to children from places such as Congo, Angola or southern Sudan, large parts of which have seen their social fabric disintegrate entirely.</p>
	<p pid="a.26.1/4">I am not talking about recent arrivals, either. I am talking about children who know no other life than ours&mdash;children who, in some cases, were born here and have grown up alongside our children, played with them and shared the same classrooms. Whatever the sins of their parents, those children are entirely innocent and have no inkling of the fate that awaits them. They disappear from class without even a chance to say goodbye to their teachers and friends, and in many cases they are never heard of again. Sometimes the children reappear because of a hiccup in the removal system, only to disappear again a few months later. Who knows what becomes of them? On rare occasions there is a letter or a phone call about what happened next. Sometimes the news is good; at other times it is not. Usually, however, there is only silence.</p>
	<p pid="a.26.1/5">To those of us who are&mdash;or were&mdash;members of the Government, the children tend to be only numbers. In a previous incarnation, I attended meetings at No. 10 and the Home Office where there was talk of targets and tipping points. When it is sensible to do so, I have no problem with setting targets. Indeed, given the failures of the past, I am sure that it is necessary. However, we should not lose sight of the fact that we are dealing with human beings. Members of Parliament, especially those who represent areas such as mine, to which asylum seekers have been dispersed, have to look such people and their children in the eye, and to us they are not statistics.</p>
	<p pid="a.26.1/6">I recall, as I expect we all can, some moving cases. Let us consider the little boy who was plucked from school in mid-term and who, in the hour that was left to him while his parents were hastily packing their meagre belongings and immigration officers were waiting to take them away, made out a will in which he wrote, &quot;I leave my Pok&eacute;mon cards to so and so, and my Lego to so and so.&quot; It was found on his bed a few days later when friends came to find out why he had disappeared.</p>
	<p pid="a.26.1/7">I once successfully intervened on behalf of a young woman who was from southern Sudan originally, but who had come from a refugee camp in northern Kenya. She faced removal despite having been in the UK for some years and having given birth to a boy who was two years old by the time she was threatened with removal. As it correctly says on the Foreign Office website, the war in southern Sudan is over. However, anyone who has seen at first hand, as I have, the state of refugees returning to the south of Sudan, and the absence of facilities to cope with them, will know that to send there people who have tasted our lives here would be an act of great cruelty. I dread to think what would have become of that woman and her child had she been returned.</p>
	<p pid="a.26.1/8">I am currently doing what I can to help a family who came from Angola in April 2001. The case prompted me to ask for this debate. The family have two boys. One is now aged eight, but he was three and a half when he came here. He is blind in one eye; according to his mother, that happened while she was being beaten with the buckle end of a belt by soldiers who were searching for his father. The boy was said by his teachers to be traumatised when first enrolled at a local school. The other son, who is now aged four, was born in the UK and knows no other life but ours.</p>
	<p pid="a.26.1/9">After years of delay, the parents' claim for asylum has failed and they may now be returned to Angola at any time. They are well aware of the fate that awaits them there and are unlikely to be persuaded to return voluntarily. So far as I can see, the intention is just to drop them off at Luanda airport and wish them good luck. We are talking about people with few, if any, resources. The woman and the older boy were camped in a church when they were last in Angola, and the father was in hiding. What will become of them? Presumably they will join the millions of anonymous, displaced people in that tragic country.</p>
	<p pid="a.26.1/10">I know that it says on the Foreign Office website that the civil war in Angola is over, but it lasted for 27 years and much of the country is in ruins. The Angolan Government are unwilling or unable to provide even the most basic services for their citizens. Where such services do exist, they are mainly provided by foreign NGOs or United Nations agencies. Only about half of Angolan children receive any form of education, and the country is ranked third in the world for infant mortality. Much of the population, including many people in the capital, is destitute or living on the edge of destitution. Violence and lawlessness are rampant, and justice is non-existent or arbitrary. The few functioning institutions are riddled with corruption.</p>
	<p pid="a.26.1/11">Sending there young children who have tasted our life and who, as in the case of the older boy, know of no other life than ours, is an act of unpardonable cruelty. Needless to say, I have put all this to my hon. Friend the Minister for Immigration, Citizenship and Nationality&mdash;and he is unmoved. In a letter dated <phrase class="date" code="2006-11-22">22 November</phrase> he wrote:</p>
	<p pid="a.26.1/12" class="indent">&quot;It would frustrate the proper and necessary object of immigration control in the more advanced states if people could not, save in the most exceptional circumstances, be returned to the less developed countries of the world.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.26.1/13">That is not, of course, what I am arguing, and I agree with what he says; I accept that just about all failed asylum seekers come from countries poorer than ours, and that it would be nonsense to argue that no one should be returned to such a country.</p>
	<p pid="a.26.1/14">My point is a narrower one. First, I am talking about families with young children who have lived in the UK for years and who, in some cases, have been born here and know no other life. Secondly, I am talking about removals to a handful of the world's most dysfunctional countries, where living standards are not merely lower but catastrophically so, and where hunger and destitution awaits those children. As I have mentioned, child mortality in Angola is the third highest in the world.</p>
	<p pid="a.26.1/15">Thirdly, I am arguing that if we must return families to such countries, we should take some interest in what happens to them after they have disembarked. That might involve putting some money in their pockets, employing an NGO to see them safely through the airport and back to where they came from, and perhaps a little help with reintegrating. I do not argue that that should happen in every case, but only when young children are involved, and are at risk.</p>
	<p pid="a.26.1/16">The Minister of State rejects that idea too. He wrote:</p>
	<p pid="a.26.1/17" class="indent">&quot;We do not normally give returnees money, nor do we arrange for their reception in their country of nationality, or liaise with Non-Governmental Organisations as regards their future welfare.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.26.1/18">My question is: why not?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-01-10a.30.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1655" speakername="Jeremy Corbyn" colnum="30"  time="011:17:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060110/halltext/60110h02.htm#60110h02_spnew5">
	<p pid="a.30.0/1">I welcome the debate, and congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1856" name="Chris Mullin">the Member for Sunderland, South (Mr. Mullin)</phrase> on securing it. The House spends far too little time discussing the effects on families, and the human cost of our refugee policy.</p>
	<p pid="a.30.0/2">My hon. Friend spoke about Angola. I am chair of the all-party group on Angola, and last year I visited it with an Inter-Parliamentary Union delegation. What he says about the breakdown of civil society is correct. The problem is that, for whatever reasons, Angola has been through 30 years of the most appalling war, and there are an enormous number of orphan children. It is wrong to deport children back to that situation when there is no adequate follow-up, and no means by which the British embassy could find out what was happening to those children, even if it wanted to. My hon. Friend has drawn attention to that important point.</p>
	<p pid="a.30.0/3">I represent an inner-London constituency with a large number of asylum seekers&mdash;a place from which many people from all parts of the world have traditionally sought asylum over decades, stretching back for most of the last century. People have traditionally sought asylum from inner-London areas. Indeed, many later leaders of African countries have lived in that part of London.</p>
	<p pid="a.30.0/4">My constituency asylum and immigration case load, like that of my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1902" name="Neil Gerrard">the Member for Walthamstow (Mr. Gerrard)</phrase> and a number of other Members, is enormous. One is faced with families who have sought asylum in this country and have been here for a considerable time. As my hon. Friend the Member for Sunderland, South correctly said, the children have grown up in this society and know nothing other than the multicultural society of inner London. For them suddenly to be told that they have got to go, and to be taken almost forcibly away and deported to a society that they have only heard about from their parents, is cruel in the extreme, heartless and damaging&mdash;and they are then often placed in enormous danger. What kind of message does it send to other children in their school about justice, and about the society in which they are growing up, if it appears that such arbitrary justice can take place?</p>
	<p pid="a.30.0/5">Although people who flee from places of danger and seek a place of safety in our country using the Geneva convention do so primarily for their own security, we should also remember that they are enormous contributors to our country. Asylum seekers want to work if they can, and those of them who have gained the right to work tend to work extremely hard and make an enormous contribution. We should be positive about that, as well as just saying that they are&mdash;understandably&mdash;seeking a place of safety.</p>
	<p pid="a.30.0/6">I could cite many quotes from many bodies, but I shall refer to one organisation in particular. The Medical Foundation for the Care of Victims of Torture is a long-standing organisation whose offices are in my constituency. It was set up to help victims of the Nazi system's brutality to the Jewish people in the 1930s and 1940s, and it has now developed into a highly respected and effective organisation that provides support, care and counselling for the victims of torture. I am very pleased that its new building and counselling centre are in my constituency; I am proud that it is located there, and of the work that it does.</p>
	<p pid="a.30.0/7">That organisation has put a number of points to me. It says:</p>
	<p pid="a.30.0/8" class="indent">&quot;It is the Medical Foundation's position that all decisions ultimately to remove must only take place after:&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.30.0/9" class="indent">full and anxious scrutiny of the asylum and human rights grounds to remain in the UK</p>
	<p pid="a.30.0/10" class="indent">by a properly trained and competent decision-maker</p>
	<p pid="a.30.0/11" class="indent">only after access to an in-country right of appeal</p>
	<p pid="a.30.0/12" class="indent">to an independent appellate court</p>
	<p pid="a.30.0/13" class="indent">with the benefit of competent legal representation.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.30.0/14">It also says:</p>
	<p pid="a.30.0/15" class="indent">&quot;Proper preparation and presentation of a family's case, whether initially as an asylum claim or against removal on human rights grounds, must in our view include an understanding of the experiences of the children of the family. Too often the dependant child's experience is ignored or overlooked.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.30.0/16">Asylum applications are often dealt with entirely on the merits of the case for one or other&mdash;or possibly both&mdash;of the parents to remain in the country, but any understanding of the children's emotional needs, desires and wishes is completely forgotten. Some such children grow up in a frightened atmosphere. We in this House have a fairly secure existence; we know where we live and what we do, and where we will be next week and next year. All that many children of asylum-seeking families in this country hear their parents talking about is whether the Home Office will ever reply to their letter, whether they will be secure in this country, or whether their children will still be in school next month or next year. That has a debilitating effect on such children's lives; it is damaging to them.</p>
	<p pid="a.30.0/17">Something should be done about the speed and competence with which the Home Office deals with issues. I hold enormous advice bureau sessions, and I have lost count of the number of people who come along and ask, &quot;When is the Home Office ever going to reply to any letter that has been sent by anybody?&quot; A joke goes around about the letter that states that there will be a reply within 13 weeks: is that within 13 weeks this year, next year or the year after that? Such uncertainty has a grave effect on people. I look forward to the Minister assuring me that things are improving in that respect.</p>
	<p pid="a.30.0/18">The UK Government placed reservations on the UN convention on the rights of the child. I would be grateful if the Minister could say whether those reservations will be withdrawn. The British Government are, understandably, determined to improve human rights around the world, and it is not good for them to keep a reservation in place in respect of that convention.</p>
	<p pid="a.30.0/19">My hon. Friend's debate is labelled as being about children, but I am not sure how one defines children. I suppose that the legal definition is people up to the age of 18. However, there is a serious problem to do with older children, such as young people in their late teens, or even in their early 20s&mdash;almost adult children who, when their families are removed, may be able to stay. That too has a debilitating effect on them. I have watched the effects of family break-up in the Somali community and in others, when parents have been removed and older children have been left behind. That situation must be analysed as well, because it represents a serious problem in several cases and in several places.</p>
	<p pid="a.30.0/20">My hon. Friend mentioned the Children's Commissioner's statement, and it is important to quote from it. The commissioner calls on the Government</p>
	<p pid="a.30.0/21" class="indent">&quot;to make sure that asylum-seeking children and young people are treated as children by those involved at every stage of the asylum process&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.30.0/22">The statement goes on to raise specific concerns about</p>
	<p pid="a.30.0/23" class="indent">&quot;the fairness of the asylum determination process, particularly in respect of unaccompanied children&quot;,</p>
	<p pid="a.30.0/24">about detention, and about the way in which unannounced raids and other activities have taken place. I hope that when the Minister replies, he can provide us with some hope and reassurance about those matters.</p>
	<p pid="a.30.0/25">There are many disturbing stories in the papers about the fast-tracking of asylum decisions. I have complained about the delays in responding to inquiries and dealing with ongoing cases. I do that because I want the system to be seen to be working fairly and efficiently; at present, I do not think that it is. However, to try to get round the problem by suddenly introducing a fast-track system might create more injustices and dangers.</p>
	<p pid="a.30.0/26">Maeve Sherlock, the chief executive of the Refugee Council, expressed her concerns, saying:</p>
	<p pid="a.30.0/27" class="indent">&quot;The casework system is good in principle, but justice and speed can pull in opposite directions. To work properly, the new asylum model will need well-trained staff, legal advice on the spot and a more open mindset. Asylum seekers need to know what's happening to them and why.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.30.0/28">Again, I look forward to hearing what the Minister says about that, because it appears that as many as one third of all asylum seekers could face detention under the fast-track procedure. That will undoubtedly have a serious effect on children.</p>
	<p pid="a.30.0/29">I presume that Barnardo's has sent many Members its report about the situation facing children. That report describes confusion and concern, and it is critical of how section 9 of the Asylum and Immigration (Treatment of Claimants) Act 2004 operates. If we want people to live decently in our society, children to achieve well in school and their parents to contribute, why on earth do we operate section 9, which is designed to leave numbers of people in destitution? It cannot be good for anybody.</p>
	<p pid="a.30.0/30">There is a big campaign concerning the Sukula family, from the Democratic Republic of Congo, who live in Bolton. That is just one case in which a campaign is ongoing. Many other cases are ongoing at the same time on the same issue.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-01-10a.33.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1655" speakername="Jeremy Corbyn" colnum="33"  time="011:17:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060110/halltext/60110h02.htm#60110h02_spnew7">
	<p pid="a.33.1/1">I thank my hon. Friend for that intervention, and I agree with him. There is a campaign surrounding that case, and I support the family and the campaign, as I am sure he does. They are not the only family and theirs is not the only case; there are others who unfortunately do not have the benefit of campaigns to support them. It is heartless, cruel and unfair to remove from this country, children who have known nothing other than being born and brought up here. It is damaging to them&mdash;and, as I said earlier, to other children. The scheme in the north-west is a pilot, and I would be grateful if the Minister said something about its progress and whether it will end or be extended.</p>
	<p pid="a.33.1/2">My final general point&mdash;I know that other hon. Members want to speak&mdash;concerns countries to which families with children are deported. After an assertive campaign the Government finally stopped all deportations to Zimbabwe, and I understand that that is the current situation. My constituency includes people from all parts of the world, and I am particularly concerned about two countries to which removals take place. The first is Congo and the second is Somalia.</p>
	<p pid="a.33.1/3">The war in Congo has had less coverage than almost any other conflict anywhere in the world, yet 3 million people have died there in the past decade. That is a level of casualties on a par with the first world war. Congo has a transitional Government, but the war is clearly continuing, particularly in the east of the country. There is a collapse of civil society and of any supportive environment, and it is impossible to follow what happens to any individual family that returns to Congo. I hope that the Minister recognises that it cannot be fair, right or just to deport anyone to Congo until there is some measure of peace there. Taking a child out of a school in Britain and dropping them in Congo with no follow-up whatever cannot be right, fair or just.</p>
	<p pid="a.33.1/4">Likewise, there is continuing grave instability in Mogadishu in south Somalia. I am not clear whether there are removals to Somalia and I would be grateful if the Minister could resolve that question one way or the other. I have objected when removals have been threatened against my constituents, but I am not clear whether there is a policy on that.</p>
	<p pid="a.33.1/5">My last point is about following up what happens to those who are removed from this country. The Home Office has its own in-country assessment unit, the Foreign Office makes a diplomatic assessment of the situation in any one country, and Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, the United Nations and a number of other organisations make their own assessments of what goes on in various countries. Except in Kosovo, to which my hon. Friends the Members for Sunderland, South and for Walthamstow referred, I am not aware of any adequate follow-up in any other country when removals take place.</p>
	<p pid="a.33.1/6">If someone has sought safety or asylum in this country and the application fails, for whatever reason, or a human rights application fails, for whatever reason, and a family are deported, we have at least a moral responsibility to ensure that they are in some degree of safety when they return to their society. If children who are growing up and attending school in this country are suddenly removed to a place of great danger, they deserve at least to be monitored so that we can try to help them and perhaps review deportation policy in specific cases. The way in which children are treated in many parts of the world is appalling and terrible. We contribute to much of that if we take children away from a place of safety in this country to a place of danger, and then pretend that it has nothing to do with us after that. It has everything to do with us, and my hon. Friend the Member for Sunderland, South has done the House a service in securing this debate.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-01-10a.35.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1989" speakername="John Robertson" colnum="35"  time="011:34:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060110/halltext/60110h02.htm#60110h02_spnew10">
	<p pid="a.35.1/1">I agree, but in defence of the Minister of State, I must tell my hon. Friend that he has been to Glasgow on several occasions. On one prolonged recent visit he took considerable time to talk to Members of Parliament and the people most affected by the removals. I will commend him for doing that, while chastising him for not being here today.</p>
	<p pid="a.35.1/2">It is pleasing to see <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2006" name="Alistair Carmichael">the hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland (Mr. Carmichael)</phrase> and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1973" name="Stewart Hosie">the hon. Member for Dundee, East (Stewart Hosie)</phrase> here today. It would be even more pleasing if those Members went back and asked their local councils to take on board the job that Glasgow city council took on in allowing asylum seekers to come to our friendly city, where I believe that they are looked after better there than in any other city in the country. It would be more pleasing if the rest of Scotland, instead of getting on board the discussion on asylum, got on with trying to look after those people&mdash; giving them a home and welcoming them into society. That is my little plea for Glasgow and against the rest of Scotland.</p>
	<p pid="a.35.1/3">A lot of press coverage north of the border, including the extracts in the excellent information pack that has been put together for today's debate, mentions Glasgow in particular. Yet some press statements that are emerging, by people who have been shouting the most against what has been happening to asylum seekers in the Glasgow area, are, unfortunately, from outside that area. Sad as it is, they have done very little to help alleviate the problem.</p>
	<p pid="a.35.1/4">There are many points on which we can agree. We all agree that, as my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1655" name="Jeremy Corbyn">the Member for Islington, North (Jeremy Corbyn)</phrase> said, we have a moral obligation to look after refugees&mdash;genuine refugees, that is. We need to adjust the asylum process to establish who is entitled, and everybody undergoing that process must be treated fairly and have access to a full range of services. Everyone who meets the asylum criteria must be welcomed fully into our society. My hon. Friend the Member for Islington, North did not actually say those words, but I am sure that is what he meant in saying that those people offer much to the multicultural development of the UK. They add many of their cultures to ours and will make the UK a better place in the long run; it is to be hoped that parties such as the British National party will then find no place in our society.</p>
	<p pid="a.35.1/5">What should happen to people who have been through the process and failed in their application? Have they no right to be in the country? How should they be returned to their country of origin? Or, as some would say, should they be allowed to remain here no matter what the circumstances? Those are the questions that we must raise in this debate. They have already been raised in certain ways, and I hope to add to that debate in my short contribution.</p>
	<p pid="a.35.1/6">It is clear that the asylum system needs to be examined and improved. None the less, many people who come to this country to seek asylum make applications that are utterly unfounded. They seek to use the system to remain here, and eventually to benefit from an amnesty. I am against the amnesties that have been called for. As a result of amnesties&mdash;which have caused me many problems as an MP trying to deal with asylum cases&mdash;many people suddenly come out of the woodwork, as it were, and try to stay here when they should never have been allowed to stay in the first place. They had disappeared into the country, when they should probably have been removed at the outset.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-01-10a.36.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1989" speakername="John Robertson" colnum="36"  time="011:34:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060110/halltext/60110h02.htm#60110h02_spnew12">
	<p pid="a.36.1/1">I thank my hon. Friend; he has put that much better than I did, and he is absolutely correct. There was no general amnesty as such, but there was certainly a slackening of the rules to allow people who have been here a long time to stay.</p>
	<p pid="a.36.1/2">I can understand the arguments of immigration officials. I have been to the immigration service in Glasgow with asylum seekers many times to talk to officials and try to alleviate the misunderstandings created&mdash;in some cases, maliciously&mdash;between people seeking asylum and the immigration service. Unfortunately, there are those in our society who seem to want to use the subject of asylum for their own political ends, and I find that totally abhorrent. Whenever I can, I denounce those parties. They know who they are; they are on the extreme right or extreme left of our society, and as far as I am concerned, they have no place in British politics. I hope that we shall weed them out. They do no service to people who genuinely seek asylum, and who ask their MPs to solve their problems and help them to remain in the country.</p>
	<p pid="a.36.1/3">By the time the media take control, they have totally distorted the actualities of the case. By the time the case gets to the Home Office, the Home Office has been put in an intolerable position. Eventually the people concerned are removed, although in some cases I know that I could probably have saved them if they had got to me first, and had not got involved in a series of lies and stories given to them by certain people. That has to be investigated&mdash;but the Home Office and its officials, too, have to think seriously about the information that they give out.</p>
	<p pid="a.36.1/4">I appreciate that many of the details that the Home Office receives are personal and should not be revealed to the general public, but if someone goes to the press and gives their whole life story, as they see it, in support of their case for remaining here, I feel that the Home Office should be entitled to give the story as it sees it, too. It is also important that it should give the hows and whens of the enforced removals. We want to know why people have been removed at a particular time, after having been four, five or six years in this country, as my hon. Friend the Member for Islington, North has described.</p>
	<p pid="a.36.1/5">I commend Drumchapel high school in my constituency. The students there have won many awards, and many of them are from asylum-seeking families. They have done work to promote and campaign not just for themselves and their families but for other children from such families, and they should be commended. It is pleasant to see children taking an interest in what happens in everyday life, rather than just worrying about whether they will get the new PlayStation or Xbox or whatever, which is all that some young people care about. It is a pleasure to see that they care about each other and their fellow pupils. Long may it continue, and long may the students keep giving me a hard time. They come to my office and ask me why this happens and why that happens.</p>
	<p pid="a.36.1/6">We politicians need to look at ourselves, too. I have a quote from one of my colleagues from Glasgow who is a Member of the Scottish Parliament. In a statement about a family who were allegedly thrown out of their home in a so-called dawn raid, he said:</p>
	<p pid="a.36.1/7" class="indent">&quot;Police should not wear body armour&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.36.1/8">The report adds the comment:</p>
	<p pid="a.36.1/9" class="indent">&quot;despite the fact that one officer in England has been killed carrying out such duties.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.36.1/10">Norrie Flowers of the Scottish Police Federation said:</p>
	<p pid="a.36.1/11" class="indent">&quot;They don't really understand the issue. We are asked to go along in these situations in order to assist immigration officers. The bottom line is that we don't know what we are walking into. It can go from being very quiet to a frantic affair with minutes and they therefore wear protecting clothing for that.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.36.1/12">I totally agree with him.</p>
	<p pid="a.36.1/13">That is the kind of information that the Home Office should give us. They must tell us what happened when they removed a family. I want to know if the removal was easy or hard, what kind of force was needed and why, how many people were there, and what time it was. That is simple information, which any Member of Parliament would want to know about something that had happened in their constituency. If I found that something had gone wrong, that would give me the opportunity to try to do something about it. I would be grateful if the Minister would take that on board, talk to his officials and try to get something done about it.</p>
	<p pid="a.36.1/14">Talk of children being handcuffed is very distressing. However, I have been to the immigration service and heard some of the horror stories from its side, of parents hurling children at officers who are there to remove them. The question would then be: should we take the children from the parents in the first place? Are those responsible parents? Sometimes such questions are addressed, and it does happen that children are removed from asylum-seeking parents. Those children are now part of our society, because the parents were incapable, or did not want to look after them in the first place.</p>
	<p pid="a.36.1/15">We need to be told about such things. There are people in our society who are living and working, have been part of the system and are happy to be here. We may not want to know who they are, but we certainly want to know the numbers of such cases. The story is not always bad news.</p>
	<p pid="a.36.1/16">I would be grateful if the Minister, in describing the procedures, could put some more meat on the bones of the thought behind the removals&mdash;although of course, he may not know about that. Why, after four and a half years, do we suddenly come to the decision that a family must be removed today?</p>
	<p pid="a.36.1/17">The hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland talked about a more responsible way of removing people. Surely there must be a more humane way. I do not think that there is a humane way of removing any family that has been here for such a long time, but there must be a better way. I understand why the early morning visits happen. They may not be dawn raids as such, but people certainly go early in the morning and, if they go back, I know that that is because they can be sure that the family is in situ in the house at the time. I understand that.</p>
	<p pid="a.36.1/18">Part of the main problem is that&mdash;as many have said here today&mdash;children are the innocent bystanders. They just happen to be there, or happen to be born, yet they bear the brunt of the removals. We should show some kind of sympathy, but the parents have to take the responsibility. It is not the Government's fault that people are here illegally. They have been told, I am assured, on many occasions that they can have an assisted passage back to their country of origin or they can make their own way back. They are told almost from the moment that they arrive in the country that if they refuse to do so, at the end of the process they will be removed. It is unfair to say that those people&mdash;those parents&mdash;did not know that they would be removed. They did know.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-01-10a.40.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1973" speakername="Stewart Hosie" colnum="40"  time="011:56:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060110/halltext/60110h02.htm#60110h02_spnew19">
	<p pid="a.40.1/1">I am pleased that this debate was requested and granted. My worries about removals are similar to those of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1989" name="John Robertson">the hon. Member for Glasgow, North-West (John Robertson)</phrase>. The process is causing great consternation in Scotland. One of the questions posed continually during the recent tranche of high-profile removals involving children to which reference has been made was about enhanced disclosure through Disclosure Scotland for the immigration and police officers. Obviously, enhanced disclosure is required from Disclosure Scotland for anyone who works closely with children or vulnerable adults categorised in a certain way&mdash;and, in the case of asylum seekers with children, where there are the mental and psychiatric difficulties that have been described. I hope that the Minister can tell us whether the immigration and police officers in attendance were covered by enhanced disclosure from Disclosure Scotland.</p>
	<p pid="a.40.1/2">Has the Minister been advised about the guidelines for the number of uniformed immigration and police officers required in such circumstances? I shall come to what Norrie Flowers of the Scottish Police Federation said about the use of body armour, but if the reports are to be believed, the number of immigration and police officers in attendance is in the high teens, which may seem excessive for a routine removal.</p>
	<p pid="a.40.1/3">We can only imagine the trauma experienced by young children when woken in their own beds by a uniformed officer, not by their parents, and finding a large number of uniformed people in the bedroom. Will the Minister explain the rationale behind the removal of different family members in separate vehicles? Children see their fathers and perhaps older siblings being removed in separate vehicles. What about the use of handcuffs? I hope that he can contradict me, but the use of handcuffs for adult men and boys in their late teens appears to be routine; if he tells me that that is not the case, I shall be delighted.</p>
	<p pid="a.40.1/4">It would also be useful if the Minister could explain the procedures for the use of handcuffs in such circumstances. Has the Department has done any assessment of the overall impact on children involved in the process? If so, could it be made available? The hon. Member for Glasgow, North-West suggested that we needed more information from the Home Office about the procedures and protocols of the removal process&mdash;concerning the separate vehicles, the body armour, the handcuffs and so forth. That would be helpful for us all.</p>
	<p pid="a.40.1/5">The processes that I have described have been well documented and well reported, although in some cases with a little hyperbole in certain quarters. I shall not repeat the more hysterical remarks that have been printed in the press. None the less, the process and the removals have upset a great many people. They have led the children's commissioner for Scotland, Kathleen Marshall, to suggest that the process terrorises children. I mention that because she is a sane, rational, intelligent professional woman doing a particular job. This is her role. I am not quoting some of the maddies on the ultra-left, but someone in a very specific position.</p>
	<p pid="a.40.1/6">Dr. Marshall said:</p>
	<p pid="a.40.1/7" class="indent">&quot;I've become increasingly distressed by the inhumane methods of removal of children and families from Scotland. What can happen is immigration officers and police, big groups of them, 11 to 14, go to a family's house at seven o'clock in the morning, sometimes earlier, and waken the children in their beds. The officers in bullet proof vests&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.40.1/8">I suspect she means stab vests, but never mind&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.40.1/9" class="indent">&quot;waken the children, not the parents, they handcuff the parents in front of the children and then they remove them by van on long journeys down to these prisons, basically to other detention centres or to holding centres.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.40.1/10">Those are genuine and legitimate concerns for the children's commissioner, and they led the Lib-Lab First Minister in Scotland, Jack McConnell, to seek an asylum protocol. The BBC reported that he had asked the Home Office to involve Scottish education and social services when it deports and removes the families from their homes. I would add that the children's commissioner should be involved in any discussions about the procedures and processes for the removal of families, particularly those with children.</p>
	<p pid="a.40.1/11">The best description of the fear that the families face was by an Algerian lady, who in advance of the process said:</p>
	<p pid="a.40.1/12" class="indent">&quot;We are scared all the time . . . every morning I get up between 5 and 6 o'clock and get . . . dressed . . . I don't want to be in my night clothes when they bring the door down. I want to be ready so that I don't get shocked and so my children don't get frightened . . . what happens to children of 7 and 3, they could not stand the shock of doors being brought down, seeing my husband being handcuffed, being separated from their mother.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.40.1/13">To be that afraid for one's children, or to be a child oneself and consider the possibility of that happening&mdash;particularly if it has happened to one's school friends, as it has in certain parts of the country&mdash;must be quite horrendous.</p>
	<p pid="a.40.1/14">I welcome this debate and am delighted to have had the opportunity to contribute to it. I agree with <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1856" name="Chris Mullin">the hon. Member for Sunderland, South (Mr. Mullin)</phrase>. He said that he broadly supported the immigration and asylum system, but that the issue was about specific countries. Like him, I would support a case-by-case review of certain cases in certain circumstances. I hope that the Minister will take on board the genuine anxieties felt by many people awaiting removal and deportation. Their Members of Parliament have anxieties, and many other people feel concerns about the process. I hope that the Minister will be able to answer some of the questions that I have put to him.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-01-10a.45.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1379" speakername="Damian Green" colnum="45"  time="012:10:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060110/halltext/60110h02.htm#60110h02_spnew27">
	<p pid="a.45.1/1">The hon. Gentleman specifically suggested doing that on the basis of countries.</p>
	<p pid="a.45.1/2">Will the Minister tell us how many children are covered by the amnesty in its current form? How many extra children would be covered if it were extended by one or two years? I appreciate that he may not have the exact figures to hand, but they could be provided for him.</p>
	<p pid="a.45.1/3">According to the Home Office press release of <phrase class="date" code="2006-11-22">22 November</phrase>, the five nationalities accounting for the most removals are Serbia and Montenegro, Afghanistan, Iraq, Turkey and Pakistan. Are those also the countries to which most children are being removed? If not, to which countries are children most likely to be removed? With which of those countries does the Minister think that we have satisfactory reception arrangements when children are returned? That is particularly important for unaccompanied children, but it applies to children as part of a family as well.</p>
	<p pid="a.45.1/4">The next question relates to those not covered by the amnesty. The Government's estimate of those living here illegally is a fairly elastic figure. The central figure is 430,000, but I understand that it could be 310,000 or 570,000. How many of those are children, according to the Government's best estimate? That is perhaps the most important number for all concerned with the issue, because without it we can have no real feel for the scale of the problem. We all agree that every individual forced removal of a child is a desperately hard case in which emotions will run very high, so it is vital that we develop policy on a factual basis.</p>
	<p pid="a.45.1/5">The point at which the desire to run a properly managed asylum and immigration system runs directly into the natural instincts of common humanity and generosity of spirit is precisely the issue raised by this debate. I genuinely have sympathy for the Minister and his colleagues, who have to make the decisions, but the underlying problem will be solved only if the system works efficiently. It has not worked well enough in the past few years, and as long as it does not work, there will be more hard cases. Each hard case that involves the removal of children threatens to become an individual tragedy, so simply carrying on as before is not acceptable.</p>

	<p pid="a.50.1/1">I welcome you to the Chair, Mr. Gale, for this debate on the Kentish fruit industry, about which you no doubt know a great deal. I also welcome the Minister and thank him for taking the time to respond to this short debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.50.1/2">By way of introduction, let me say that I represent what I believe is the only remaining constituency in Britain in which fruit farming is the predominant type of agriculture. The county of Kent owes its reputation as the garden of England to that industry. I made my maiden speech on the subject in July 2001, when the Minister and I entered the House together, and since then I have served as secretary of the all-party group on the fruit industry. I asked for this debate, in the tradition of Westminster Hall, on behalf of my constituents, but it deals with concerns affecting the entire fruit sector.</p>
	<p pid="a.50.1/3">Why is the seasonal agricultural workers scheme so important? To put it bluntly, without labour there is no means of picking the fruit that we grow. Labour accounts for between 40 and 60 per cent. of a fruit farmer's cost base and almost all the labour comes through SAWS. It follows that if the scheme is restricted in any way, the UK fruit industry will collapse. That will have enormous consequences for the wider local economy because there are jobs all over Kent in transport and marketing related to the fruit industry and in tourism. It will have enormous consequences for the environment, both locally, where orchards will be grubbed up, and nationally and internationally as alternative produce is sourced from abroad. It will have considerable consequences for Government policy, as well. The Government have launched schemes such as the healthy eating initiative, the five-a-day scheme and the fruit for schools scheme. Finally, it will have consequences for SAWS students, who benefit enormously financially and from the knowledge and experience that they gain of living and working in Britain. Almost none of them abscond at the end of the scheme.</p>
	<p pid="a.50.1/4">This debate takes place against a backdrop of a Home Office review and I believe that a decision is due at the end of January. My aim this morning is to convince the Minister of three key points, the first of which is that fruit farming needs to be encouraged. It is important for the local economy, it produces high-quality produce close to the marketplace that is vital to a healthier diet and so on, and it is good for the environment. It deserves our support. Secondly&mdash;this is crucial&mdash;SAWS is not an immigration or asylum issue and should not be confused with either. Finally, SAWS is a welcome success story. It is a well managed and trouble-free scheme, which brings enormous benefits to the United Kingdom and, critically, to the students who participate in it. It needs to be encouraged and improved in the years ahead.</p>
	<p pid="a.50.1/5">The SAWS scheme was set up after world war two to encourage European workers to take up short-term employment in agriculture and horticulture. It has always been aimed primarily at students at agricultural colleges or who have experience of the agricultural sector. In 2004, 25,000 students from outside the EU visited the UK to work on our farms and to learn our language and about our culture. Sadly, that number was reduced to only 16,000 in 2005 and the future of the scheme is now being reviewed as the Home Office launches a five-year plan to simplify the immigration system. The concern felt by many of my fruit farmers is that some people in government believe that the recent enlargement of the EU will provide a sufficient pool of low-skilled labour to replace SAWS students. That is emphatically not the case for the following five reasons.</p>
	<p pid="a.50.1/6">First, SAWS is a well established and successful scheme. The model of students visiting the UK and gaining work experience and understanding of Britain has worked well for more than 40 years. SAWS is well managed, all operators are licensed by the Home Office and all participating farms are carefully monitored. The Home Office administers the scheme without difficulty and there is a simple fee to cover the costs. The fact that all the participants are students means that they have to return to their own country to complete their studies at the end of their time here. A parliamentary written answer tabled recently revealed that less than 1 per cent. of SAWS students ever abscond, so the scheme does not present any threat to immigration and asylum policy.</p>
	<p pid="a.50.1/7">Secondly, there is a proven need for exactly that type of temporary labour force. Quite apart from what I said about the need to encourage fruit farming, the Government recognise the importance of the scheme. In 2002, the Home Office White Paper on managed migration, &quot;Secure Borders, Safe Haven: Integration with Diversity in Modern Britain&quot;, stated:</p>
	<p pid="a.50.1/8" class="indent">&quot;There is a clear need for short-term casual labour. Although this comprises only a small proportion of all employment in the UK, it is important in industries such as agriculture. We will look again at the operation of the long-standing Seasonal Agricultural Workers' Scheme (SAWS) to see how it might better meet the needs of the agricultural sector. We will build on its principles to meet the demand for short-term casual labour in other sectors of the United Kingdom economy.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.50.1/9">A couple of years ago, the Curry report recommended that the number of places on the scheme be increased to 50,000&mdash;double the peak of 25,000 in 2004. The White Paper suggests a mechanism for any sector to prove the need for labour, entirely based on SAWS. SAWS is popular with farmers and workers alike. Demand from UK farmers for reliable, well motivated SAWS students continues unabated and applications from students wishing to participate in the scheme outstrip demand by a ratio of 2:1. In short, there is a proven need among UK farmers and the students for SAWS to continue in Government policy.</p>
	<p pid="a.50.1/10">Thirdly, developments in the EU labour market will increase the pressure on UK farmers and reinforce the need for SAWS. France, Germany and Italy have imposed restrictions on workers from the accession countries that are due to be lifted by 2007; indeed, by 2011 all restrictions of any sort will be lifted. Given that by then the UK is likely to be less favoured than some other EU countries as a work destination, due to its climate, geographical isolation and the resulting higher travel costs, it is premature to conclude that workers from the A8 accession countries will fill the demand presented by SAWS. We need to retain SAWS until we are sure that our agricultural labour requirements can be met by other means. My view is that they never will be.</p>
	<p pid="a.50.1/11">Fourthly, it is most unlikely that EU workers will fill the void. Workers from elsewhere inside the EU want permanent jobs rather than the seasonal ones available in agriculture, and they will quickly move on to better paid opportunities here or in their own countries as their economies improve. If the Minister doubts that, he should consider the present lack of UK students working on farms during the summer vacation compared with 20 years ago, when I was at university. Most UK students would greatly prefer to work in, for example, the hospitality industry, and workers from other EU countries replicate that pattern precisely. In short, workers from the other EU countries cannot fill the void that is currently filled by SAWS students.</p>
	<p pid="a.50.1/12">Fifthly and finally, the cultural and educational elements of the SAWS scheme set it apart from immigration and asylum issues. It is a remarkable testament to the success of the scheme that the Polish Agriculture Minister, Mr. Kowalski, is a former SAWS student. The experience gained by students in production technology, food and retailing plays an important part in helping their own economies when they return home. Furthermore, while they are here they benefit the local economy in the UK, as many local shops and pubs know well. Some students even earn enough money while they are here to buy their own land and set themselves up when they return home. One student I met two summers ago on a farm in my constituency had been coming here for three years while doing his medical studies and reckoned that if he returned for a further two years he would be able to pay off the mortgage on his flat in Belgrade.</p>
	<p pid="a.50.1/13">In conclusion, I hope that I have convinced the Minister of the three key points that I set out at the start of my speech. First, fruit farming deserves our support. It produces high-quality produce, which accords with Government policy on healthy eating; it produces it close to the marketplace and it is good for the environment, particularly in areas such as the garden of England. However, the sector is under extreme pressure: costs are rising for farmers, which is set against the downward pressure on prices exerted by the supermarkets, while the demand for land in the south-east is growing fast. The availability of a capable seasonal labour force is a key issue. Without it, many fruit farms will sadly fold. Secondly&mdash;the key point&mdash;SAWS is not an asylum and immigration issue. It is a means for students from non-EU countries to visit Britain for up to six months and then return home. It has nothing to do with the immigration and asylum issues that cause so much public and political concern. Third and finally, SAWS is a success story. Less than 1 per cent. of SAWS students ever abscond; the majority return home enriched by their experience of Britain and considerably wealthier. Put simply, there are no losers.</p>
	<p pid="a.50.1/14">It is apparent to me that SAWS has an obvious home in tier 4 of the new system proposed in the Home Office White Paper. Can the Minister reassure my constituents and the wider fruit sector that he understands the issue and is able to make the necessary recommendations and representations inside his Department?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-01-10a.53.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1678" speakername="Andy Burnham" speakeroffice="The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department"  colnum="53"  time="012:41:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060110/halltext/60110h03.htm#60110h03_spmin0">
	<p pid="a.53.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1583" name="Hugh Robertson">the hon. Member for Faversham and Mid-Kent (Hugh Robertson)</phrase> on securing the debate. He is right to say that the fruit sector is important to our economy. I believe that the whole country is indebted to his constituency for the vast amount of fine produce that emerges from it. I am unsure how many people on the SAWS scheme are involved in hop picking, but if they are I certainly pay tribute to the fruits of their labour.</p>
	<p pid="a.53.0/2">The hon. Gentleman is also right to say that the industry depends upon seasonal labour and is under pressure. We all know from the debate we see in the media that pressure is being exerted on agricultural producers in this country by price competition among supermarkets. Although that has been good for consumers in that the prices they pay have come down, it has made the pressure on domestic agriculture more severe. While celebrating the lower prices, we must understand what that equation means. He is also right to say that we would like local produce to be used in schools in pursuit of the five-a-day initiative. We would all want to unite behind that; I am pleased that he made reference to it.</p>
	<p pid="a.53.0/3">I listened carefully to the three key points that the hon. Gentleman outlined and the arguments that he used to substantiate them. I agree with two of the three and disagree with one, but that is not to say that there is an unbridgeable gulf between us. I hope that he will find some cause for comfort at the end of my remarks.</p>
	<p pid="a.53.0/4">The hon. Gentleman's first point was that the industry deserves support. As I have said, I agree. There is a long tradition of fruit farming in his part of the world. We obviously listen to the industry's concerns, to ensure that it is supported and that the people who depend on it can continue to do so. Of course, the industry is operating in a changed market. I picked strawberries in my youth, between A-levels and university, and it is certainly not glamorous work. Such work is not on the increase among the domestic work force, so I understand that there are pressures on the industry. Since the economy has expanded in different ways, people have alternative ways to make money. We have to understand how the industry operates in a changed environment and we have to provide support.</p>
	<p pid="a.53.0/5">I agree with the hon. Gentleman's third point, that SAWS has been well managed and is a success. In some senses it is a win, win scheme. SAWS has been successful and has provided great benefit to those who have taken part in it and to our domestic agricultural industry over a number of years. He is right about that.</p>
	<p pid="a.53.0/6">I disagree with the hon. Gentleman's second point, however. He says that SAWS is not an asylum or immigration issue. True, it is not an asylum issue, but it is an immigration issue. That is why I am answering the debate today. I respect his point about the cultural exchange elements of the scheme; none the less, SAWS deals with people coming to this country to work. That makes it an immigration issue and we have to consider it as such within the broader context of the Government's immigration policy. I shall discuss how that context is changing and how SAWS is affected.</p>
	<p pid="a.53.0/7">The hon. Gentleman made the reference himself, but let me emphasise that the debate takes place against the backdrop of the development of a points-based system for managed migration, the consultation on which finished last year. The Home Office has consulted extensively with industry on developing the new scheme. Our aim is to move away from myriad, complicated niche schemes for immigration towards a much clearer, transparent scheme, where the public can have clear information about who is allowed into this country and why. The points-based system is not about letting fewer people or more people in; it is about letting enough people in to help the economy of this country at any given time and, in so doing, allowing the public to see clearly the reasons why people have been allowed to enter. Central to the rationale for the points-based scheme is that it is not intended to run at the same time as the range of niche schemes, such as SAWS and the working holidaymakers scheme. The whole point is to move to a more transparent system. That is the basis of today's debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.53.0/8">The Government's five-year strategy on asylum and immigration stated that existing, quota-based, low-skilled migration schemes would be phased out over time. As I have said before, the basis of the decision in relation to SAWS is not that we think the scheme is flawed&mdash;on the contrary, SAWS has been successful. What we question is whether it is still required, given that the expansion of the European Union has given growers access to a larger pool of workers who are free and, on the evidence, willing to meet seasonal labour needs in the agricultural sector.</p>
	<p pid="a.53.0/9">In July 2005 the Government published a consultation document, &quot;Selective Admission: Making Migration Work for Britain&quot;, which set out in more detail our proposals for a new system to regulate economic migration. Stakeholders in the agricultural sector have been fully involved in the consultation process. I hope that the hon. Gentleman recognises that there has been detailed discussion with companies throughout the country, including in his own constituency. We are considering the responses to that document and we will publish our response, including what we intend in relation to SAWS, in due course. I am not in a position today to state precisely what we intend to do in relation to SAWS, but I will go through some of the issues that are shaping our thinking.</p>
	<p pid="a.53.0/10">In 2003 nationals of countries that have since acceded to the European Union accounted for 60 per cent. of the 20,430 workers admitted under the scheme in that year. Romania and Bulgaria, which should accede to the European Union in the near future, accounted for a further 12 per cent. In 2004 we decided to cut the SAWS quota from 25,000 to 16,250 in light of levels of take-up of the scheme by nationals of the accession states. Since their accession, nationals of the new member states have taken up employment in the agricultural sector in significant numbers. Since <phrase class="date" code="2004-05-01">1 May 2004</phrase>, some 36,621 nationals from the eight accession countries have registered as employed in the agricultural sector under the worker registration scheme. The distribution of applications suggest that many are coming to do seasonal work. I can tell the hon. Gentleman that in the second quarter of 2005 there were 9,283 registrations, compared with 3,996 in the first quarter. That suggests that the expansion of the European Union and granting the nationals of the eight accession countries access to our labour markets has resulted in people continuing to come to do agricultural work.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-01-10a.55.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1678" speakername="Andy Burnham" colnum="55"  time="012:41:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060110/halltext/60110h03.htm#60110h03_spnew2">
	<p pid="a.55.1/1">I understand, and I take that point on board. I can understand the attractions for the agricultural sector of a scheme that is tied in that way. The figures that I gave suggest that people are coming to work in the agricultural sector. I know that the hon. Gentleman believes in the free market, in market enterprise, and in people being able to offer their labour where they can get most return for it, but if there is the pressure that he describes, people will have to look harder at how to retain the staff that they want, which is not necessarily a bad thing. One of the strengths of EU enlargement is that people can come and work in a range of sectors. The effect that the hon. Gentleman describes will be considered when the points-based system is developed, but it must be balanced against allowing people to contribute fully and to use all their skills, rather than being tied to a particular sector. That is particularly true of EU nationals, who should have that freedom.</p>
	<p pid="a.55.1/2">Let me pick up on a point that the hon. Gentleman made about the rest of the EU beginning to open its labour markets to nationals. He mentioned that there was greater competition to attract people to work here. That might be true, and we have to respond to that, which raises the issue of how easy we make it for people to come here and work. I do not accept his point about Britain not being an attractive place for students to gain work experience. It is an extremely attractive destination and will continue to be so.</p>
	<p pid="a.55.1/3">There may be more A8 nationals employed in the agricultural sector than the worker registration scheme statistics suggest. The National Farmers Union and the Association of Labour Providers consistently tell us that the WRS under-records the number of accession state nationals employed in the agricultural sector. If so, one reason for the under-recording may be that the WRS requires workers to be registered only if they have worked for a particular employer for a month. Seasonal agricultural work is no doubt more transient than other types of work, and many workers&mdash;research suggests almost half&mdash;may stay with a particular employer for less than one month, so it is possible that those people are moving to other employers within the agricultural sector.</p>
	<p pid="a.55.1/4">The Government's view is that the availability of workers from an expanded EU calls into question the continued need for SAWS. It is not simply that an alternative source of labour is available; it is also a question of the robustness of the scheme. SAWS is a temporary migration scheme. Participants who are students are expected to return overseas at the end of their six-month stay. The evidence is that participants from eastern Europe have traditionally complied with that requirement. We are, however, responsible for upholding the integrity of the immigration system, and if SAWS were to continue alongside accession country migration, participants would necessarily be recruited from further afield and possibly from countries whose nationals have less incentive to return at the end of their stay. That is why this is an immigration matter&mdash;I must take issue with the hon. Gentleman on that point. SAWS must be seen within the context of the changing picture of immigration more generally.</p>
	<p pid="a.55.1/5">There are two principal objections to a policy of relying on EU labour. The first is that employers in the agricultural sector have difficulty retaining workers who are free to take more attractive employment. I understand and accept that point, although the evidence does not entirely bear that out. We have examined WRS applications and have found that 50 per cent. of those who initially registered as employed in the agricultural sector and then changed employment changed jobs within the sector. As I said, the hon. Gentleman's claim has some basis in fact, but it is not entirely accurate. Individual employers may have problems retaining workers, but that is not necessarily true of the sector as a whole. If the retention of workers in this sector is an issue, however, we must find long-term solutions other than temporary migration schemes.</p>
	<p pid="a.55.1/6">Secondly, as the new member states prosper, they will cease to provide a source of workers who are prepared to take unattractive jobs in the UK. That may well happen and we will need to monitor the situation, but there is little to suggest that it is happening now. Furthermore, the drying up of the new member states as a source of workers for low-skilled jobs may occur in tandem with the further expansion of the EU, which will compensate.</p>
	<p pid="a.55.1/7">The role of temporary migration schemes in meeting the need for temporary workers in the agriculture industry needs to be put into context. SAWS is designed to meet a seasonal need for labour rather than any endemic labour need, but the evidence is that labour need in the agricultural sector is increasingly a year-round phenomenon. Research commissioned by the Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and the Home Office suggests that demand for temporary workers, the majority of whom are engaged in packing and grading, peaks in the winter rather than in the picking season. If agriculture increasingly needs a year-round work force, it follows that that need is best met by relying on those with the freedom to enter the labour market rather than relying on seasonal immigration schemes.</p>
	<p pid="a.55.1/8">We need to be realistic about how far migration, or at least specific low-skilled, temporary migration schemes, can or should meet the labour needs of the industry. The objection that removing such migration routes would lead to an increase in illegal working in the sector also needs to be put into perspective.</p>
	<p pid="a.55.1/9">The research that I just mentioned suggested that the total number of temporary workers employed in agricultural, horticultural and collocated primary processing businesses was between 420,000 and 611,000. Only 3 per cent. of businesses in that sector that use temporary labour use the seasonal agricultural workers scheme. Some of those businesses may be concentrated in particular parts of the sector, but the seasonal agricultural workers scheme is quite marginal to the overall labour needs of the sector.</p>
	<p pid="a.55.1/10">The number of workers admitted under SAWS is also small compared with the total number of migrants admitted to the UK in other categories and who are free to work some or all of the time. The figure was approximately 450,000 in 2003, and no doubt some of those migrants work in the agricultural sector. One way forward where needs emerge may be to encourage those who enter under other categories, such as youth mobility schemes, to take work in the agricultural sector. We continue to consider those issues as we develop the points-based system.</p>
	<p pid="a.55.1/11">The Government are taking measures to address illegal working in the agricultural sector. In particular, the Gangmasters (Licensing) Act 2004 will require the licensing of labour providers in the sector and compliance with conditions set by the Gangmaster Licensing Authority, including compliance with the law on illegal working.</p>
	<p pid="a.55.1/12">As I have said, no decision on the timing of phasing out SAWS has been taken, and we will want to take account of the views of the industry in taking that decision. We will also take account of the views expressed by the hon. Gentleman today. It remains the Government's view that opening up our labour market to the new member states should remove the need for temporary migration schemes to meet labour shortages at low-skill levels. The Government hear what the hon. Gentleman says. We are working to develop a system that responds to the needs of the industry and gives us an immigration system in which we can all have confidence.</p>

	<p pid="a.66.1/1">I am pleased to have the opportunity to discuss a matter of importance to the present and future success of the United Kingdom science base. I note that the <i>Hansard </i>record is not full of previous debates on the topic. I am pleased that you are in the Chair, Mr. Gale, as I know that you take an active interest in all matters relating to the future of the UK science base. I also welcome the Under-Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1446" name="Barry Gardiner">the hon. Member for Brent, North (Barry Gardiner)</phrase>. The Minister for Science and Innovation, Lord Sainsbury, sits in the House of Lords, so it is the role of the hon. Gentleman, who is also a Department of Trade and Industry Minister, to substitute for him in this place, which he does ably. It seems as though it was only the other day that we were discussing scientific publications and open access in another Adjournment debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.66.1/2">The people we are discussing&mdash;post-doctoral researchers or post-doctoral students&mdash;are scientists who have got a good result in their degree, which has enabled them to get funding for and then to complete a doctorate, and the majority of whom have gone on to work in what is called contract research. There are tens of thousands of them and they are some of the brightest people our higher education system has produced. They have the potential to help to make great discoveries through science, pure research and applied; through the application of experimental techniques and the basic knowledge taught to them at university during their degree courses and doctorates; through interactions with other people in their laboratories and work areas as well as internationally through collaborations and conferences; and through their reading. It is my contention that they feel undervalued and that we are not making the best use of them, because many of them are leaving.</p>
	<p pid="a.66.1/3">That is not a new concern. In fairness, it must be said that the Government have recognised the problem, as have the higher education funding councils, research funders, and the Wellcome Trust and other charities that are members of the Association of Medical Research Charities. The questions now are: has enough been done, are the initiatives working, and do the Government have mechanisms in place to determine whether the initiatives are working? I shall set out what post-doctoral researchers hold the problems to be, examine some of the initiatives that have been put in place, question how well we are measuring the outcomes, and then address what next steps the Government can take&mdash;or help to catalyse, because responsibility in this area does not lie with Government alone, although the Government have an important role, as they are the major source of public funding for schemes and have a role in quality assurance in science and in personnel and human resource policies.</p>
	<p pid="a.66.1/4">I am grateful to the individual post-doctoral researchers who have told me their views. In my roles as Liberal Democrat science spokesman and as a member of the Science and Technology Committee, I visit institutions and I take the opportunity to ask to meet with post-doctoral researchers on a group basis, without senior management or heads of department being present. Heads of department usually provide excellent hospitality on such visits and they tell us about their strategies and the progress that is being made, but, speaking as one who is particularly interested in the careers of scientists, I believe that there is no substitute for asking them individually and in groups, and in the absence of their bosses, what they really think of their lot. One of the questions I wish to discuss is to what extent the high-level bodies that look at research careers are directly in touch with the views of the people who are affected.</p>
	<p pid="a.66.1/5">Post-doctoral researchers, whether they have jobs in rigorously selective research departments of high reputation or in other research departments also doing excellent work, report their concerns to me. The concerns are not specific to the departments that may be seen to be struggling in terms of the research assessment exercise, or to those who feel that they are not the brightest and the best of a very bright and effective group of people. We are talking about some of the top people who are still not happy, who are leaving and who are encouraging people not to stay in this role.</p>
	<p pid="a.66.1/6">I am grateful to Cancer Research UK in particular, to Universities UK and to the British Heart Foundation for their briefings. I pay tribute to the work of people in the Wellcome Trust such as its director, Mark Walport, who has looked into this issue, and those who have served in the Research Careers Initiative, particularly Professor Sir Gareth Roberts, whom I was pleased to meet just last week at the Association for Science Education conference in Reading. He has gone beyond the call of duty in what he has sought to do. He has not only taken the thorny crown of dealing with the research assessment exercise which has a bearing on this subject, but, with his report &quot;SET for Success&quot;, he looked at the supply of scientists to the UK science base and then chaired the Research Careers Initiative and the Research Careers Committee of the Research Funders' Forum, which flowed out of it. I pay tribute to his work and I was pleased to have the opportunity, albeit brief, to talk to him in advance of this debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.66.1/7">Cancer Research UK describes the position well. It says that post-doctoral researchers are a valuable asset to UK research but that the lack of job security and clear career structure is a disincentive for scientists to stay in research. Let me explain what the real issue is. We are talking about people who have completed their undergraduate training, accumulating debt on the way. The Minister knows that I think that that is a flawed policy because it deters people who could benefit from it from going into higher education. In particular it deters those who graduate with debt, particularly those from debt-averse backgrounds, from going into less well-paid public sector jobs, which are highly valuable to this country's economy and certainly as valuable as better paid jobs in the City and in industry. Those people emerge from university with debts and they then do doctorates. I acknowledge that the stipend for doctorates has been increased, which I welcome, but it is also not sufficient to enable them to even think about living independently. They then go on to get three-year contracts which do not pay well compared with the earnings of people who are likely to be as bright as them, but who took their degrees in other subjects and are now working in the private sector. The people we are discussing are often earning between &pound;20,000 and &pound;30,000 three, four or five years after getting their doctorates.</p>
	<p pid="a.66.1/8">We are talking about people in their late twenties and early thirties who may still be in debt from their student days and who have no prospect of being able to buy a house on their own or even with their partners. They are stuck with the prospect, particularly in high living cost areas such as my constituency, Cambridge and London, of sharing a house, just as they did in their student days. When people ask them whether they would encourage others to go into their career, they often reply, &quot;What career? There is no career. There is a job. There is a pretty poor salary. It has been improved recently and there are some career development opportunities. There may be sources of more advice but fundamentally things have not changed.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.66.1/9">Post-doctoral researchers play a crucial role in UK academic research and losing people of their valuable experience is a real problem. Let us consider what happens if someone with great experience of how a lab works and the experimental techniques in the broad area in which the work is being undertaken leaves because his funding runs out. The university cannot retain him because it has not been able to attract the grant that it requires to keep on an experienced person, or it is more likely to receive funding if within the grant application it substitutes an experienced post-doctoral salary for a more junior post-doctoral salary even though the junior person does not share the experience of the person who has done the good work that has enabled the university to renew the grant or explore new areas. In those circumstances, who will be left in the lab to supervise the students? As the Minister knows, the principal investigator is often not around to do the hands-on supervision and training of students. Often, the result will be either demoralised doctoral students or poorly less incisively done science. The role of the laboratory expert with experience must be recognised, cherished and nurtured. I fear that that is not happening at the moment.</p>
	<p pid="a.66.1/10">Despite the initiatives that the Minister will no doubt describe, the position is not getting better. Although I welcome the initiatives, in recent years the proportion of research funding that universities receive in the form of fixed-term grants has gradually increased. The type of funding that promotes short termism has increased, as a result of which the proportion of researchers on short-term contracts has also increased markedly. Currently, more than half of post-doctoral researchers in United Kingdom universities are funded through short-term contracts, and that proportion is increasing. We are now left with a growing number of people who have a lack of job security as a result of working on multiple short-term contracts, which is a strong disincentive for scientists to remain in academia. Researchers can end up spending many years on short-term contracts, each lasting for only two to three years, but as their experience grows they become more expensive to employ, and ultimately they may be priced out of the market in favour of young, less experienced scientists on a lower pay scale.</p>
	<p pid="a.66.1/11">It is a matter of chiefs and indians. I am not arguing that every post-doctoral researcher should be given a job for life and tenure. No one would argue that, but there must be ways to enable the best of the post-doctoral researchers who are not in a position to take on lectureships or principal investigator roles to convert to open-ended contracts. Some people are simply not interested in doing that and are interested only in doing the work that they love. They recognise that that will limit their lifetime earnings, but there must be a way to allow them to convert to open-ended contracts.</p>
	<p pid="a.66.1/12">Another problem engendered by the present culture is that researchers are constantly moving every two to three years; research projects have little continuity and suffer as a consequence, making it less likely that research goals can be reached. I accept that we cannot be too purist about such matters because it is necessary for researchers to be mobile at an early stage in their career if that suits the area that they are exploring. They must be able to look at different groups, try different techniques and have the opportunity to move around. I am not saying that there are no benefits in mobility, but it is not the case that those benefits cannot be achieved&mdash;indeed, I believe that they can be best achieved&mdash;from the basis of an open-ended contract that people can move from because they have the confidence to put everything into their scientific career without worrying about whether they ought to consider training in something else in order to have some form of career that will give them the job security that they need as they enter their 30s.</p>
	<p pid="a.66.1/13">There is also concern that the training received by post-doctoral researchers on short-term contracts does not meet all their development needs. It often relates specifically to their research fields and does not provide them with transferable skills. I am pleased that there are initiatives to provide a certain number of sessions and funding to go with that to tackle the problem, but has the evaluation been done?</p>
	<p pid="a.66.1/14">I am not the first person to raise the issue. It has been raised in the main outside general parliamentary debate. It has certainly been investigated in Science and Technology Committee reports&mdash;there have been Lords and Commons reports into such issues. Sir Gareth Roberts' report &quot;SET for Success: The supply of people with science, technology, engineering and mathematics stills&quot; clearly stated several points. It said that research councils and other research sponsors should significantly increase starting salaries for post-doctoral researchers. Some of that has now been done through the initiative in the higher education sector to tackle issues of equal pay for work of equal value, which has generally tended to uplift salaries, but no one could argue that that solved the problem&mdash;the difference between people of the same age in different jobs who are and are not clinically qualified is enormous&mdash;or that that current post-doctoral research salaries are satisfactory. Sir Gareth also pointed out that unattractive career structures, including short-term contracts and low levels of responsibility, are responsible for deterring postgraduates from pursuing a career in science.</p>
	<p pid="a.66.1/15">The final report of the Research Careers Initiative, which stemmed from the work of Sir Gareth Roberts and his colleagues, recommended that various issues be taken forward by the Research Funders' Forum and dealt with in the promulgation of a new protocol to renew the old protocol on setting higher standards for post-doctoral research. I should like to ask the Minister what point that work has reached, because the timetable set in the report appears to have slipped drastically. No help is found in the minutes of the careers research sub-committee of the Research Funders' Forum, because the only minutes available on the website are of what appears to be the first meeting, held on <phrase class="date" code="2004-10-01">1 October 2004</phrase>. That talks about reporting to the Research Funders' Forum in April 2005, and states that it is intended that work on the replacement for the concordat will be completed by July 2005 and presented to the Research Funders' Forum in autumn 2005. I should like the Minister to tell me what has happened.</p>
	<p pid="a.66.1/16">Finally, I should like to touch on the European working time directive on short-term working. The EU fixed-term contract directive is designed to protect workers by preventing employers from using successive contracts as a means to avoid making employment permanent. To comply, Governments and the member states must introduce measures that specify</p>
	<p pid="a.66.1/17" class="indent">&quot;(a) objective reasons for justifying the renewal of such contracts and relationships;</p>
	<p pid="a.66.1/18" class="indent">(b) the maximum total duration of successive fixed-time contracts or relationships;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.66.1/19">and&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.66.1/20" class="indent">(c) the number of renewals of such contracts or relationships.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.66.1/21">Crucially, the directive requires that fixed-term workers</p>
	<p pid="a.66.1/22" class="indent">&quot;shall not be treated in a less favourable manner . . . because they have a fixed-term contract or relation unless different treatment is justified on objective grounds.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.66.1/23">It is unclear what the impact of that has been in this country. I shall be grateful if the Minister clarifies what work is being done to identify whether&mdash;in contrast to what we hear from Cancer Research UK&mdash;there has been a move towards universities giving people open-ended contracts funded by the prospect and prediction of grant income, which is one of the key ways forward. Post-doctoral researchers tell me that that directive means only that they get a few hundred pounds in redundancy money; it does not change the situation on the ground.</p>
	<p pid="a.66.1/24">Finally&mdash;recognising that we do not have time for a full debate about all the issues&mdash;I remind the Minister that one of the key points about the treatment of this group of people is the differential and disproportionate affect that it has on women and ethnic minorities in science. That message runs throughout the reports&mdash;it is not directly dealt with, but is certainly referred to in almost every report&mdash;and the Government clearly recognise it. If the Government's commitment to promoting science as a career for women and promoting the careers of women in science is to mean anything, they must tackle the problems of short-term contract working, a demoralised work force, and the loss of expertise and the waste of talent and investment that results from people leaving science because of unsatisfactory career prospects for those who are good at science and who would otherwise want to continue. I look forward to the Minister's response.</p>
