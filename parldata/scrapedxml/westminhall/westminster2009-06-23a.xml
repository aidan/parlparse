	<p pid="a.175.2/1">It is a great pleasure to appear before you, Mr. Martlew, at what is perhaps the start of a new era, with our new Speaker. It appears that our Conservative comrades are outside, already plotting for the next one.</p>
	<p pid="a.175.2/2">I speak as chairman of the all-party group on coalfield communities, a post that I took up three or four months ago. The group's secretariat is supplied by the Alliance, which represents 70 local authorities in the traditional industrial areas of England, Scotland and Wales and was brought together from the Coalfield Communities Campaign and Steel Action. The Alliance promotes the case for traditional industrial areas and recognises problems that have not gone away 30 years after the huge deindustrialisation programme carried out by the Opposition, who are not opposite us today.</p>

	<p pid="a.175.3/1">May I also note that there is not a single Tory Front Bencher or Back Bencher present for the debate? That speaks volumes about the Conservative party's attitude to older industrial areas.</p>
	<p pid="a.175.3/2">Does the hon. Gentleman agree that although the Government deserve enormous praise for their work on apprenticeship schemes, those schemes should be more traditional and work-based to help to get essential skills back into the areas that we are discussing?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-06-23a.175.4" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1427" speakername="David Anderson" colnum="175"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090623/halltext/90623h0001.htm#09062367000412">
	<p pid="a.175.4/1">As a former apprentice, I could not agree more. There should be more traditional apprenticeship schemes, but there can be modern apprenticeship schemes in the modern world.</p>
	<p pid="a.175.4/2">The Alliance will make available a report called &quot;What a Waste&quot;, giving detailed information about what is happening on the ground to people who are trying to find work in the modern world, but have been left behind by 20 or more years of problems. In many ways, things are now worse for those people than they were even 20 years ago because we face a much more global marketplace. The only answer is to give people in such communities the skills they need to face those challenges. I realise that the Government are focused on that, but I make no apology for saying that the people we are talking about are a special case, given the situation that they have faced for so long.</p>

	<p pid="a.175.5/1">Does my hon. Friend agree that we need not only training and apprenticeships, but the creation of jobs? Does he agree that regional development agencies have an important role in creating job opportunities for people in older industrial areas?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-06-23a.176.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1427" speakername="David Anderson" colnum="176"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090623/halltext/90623h0001.htm#09062367000414">
	<p pid="a.176.0/1">I agree with my hon. Friend. I first met the Prime Minister years ago, when the demand was for education, education, education, which I agreed with. However, he said that what we really needed was jobs, jobs, jobs. That is the key, because if people do not have work, everything else is a problem.</p>
	<p pid="a.176.0/2">The RDAs are doing a great job and have been a fantastic success, even though there have been problems. However, the Tories are committed to destroying the RDAs if they get back into power&mdash;I hope that the day never comes. Again, the Conservatives are not here to answer for themselves.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-06-23a.176.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1677" speakername="David Taylor" colnum="176"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090623/halltext/90623h0001.htm#09062367000415">
	<p pid="a.176.1/1">Like my hon. Friend, I represent a former coalfield area and am a member of the all-party coalfield communities group.</p>
	<p pid="a.176.1/2">Although my constituency has been in the lowest quartile of seats for unemployment for much of the past 12 years, there has been a significant surge of unemployment lately. One problem that older people face in going back to work is age discrimination, especially in areas such as ours. Many lack the self-confidence to retrain or to submit themselves for different occupations. How does my hon. Friend think that we can tackle that? Will proposed legislation be effective in tackling age discrimination in employment?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-06-23a.176.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1427" speakername="David Anderson" colnum="176"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090623/halltext/90623h0001.htm#09062367000416">
	<p pid="a.176.2/1">I agree with my hon. Friend's comments and will come on to how we can help people to get back to work. I welcome the proposals on age discrimination, but they will be good only if they work in practice. We must ensure that we have direct contact with the people concerned.</p>
	<p pid="a.176.2/2">I was an apprentice for the National Coal Board. There was a good training system for people who worked for the nationalised industries in the '60s and '70s. People were well educated and supported by their employers. The vacuum left by the demise of such bodies because of deindustrialisation has never been filled. In the communities we are discussing, there have been high levels of sickness, of people going on invalidity and incapacity benefits and not being encouraged to come off them, of serious mental health problems and of social problems. In the early 1990s in the area that I come from, people who had not had their car stolen or their house burgled were not the norm. Drugs came into areas that had never had such problems before. There were endemic housing problems, which have still not been addressed properly.</p>
	<p pid="a.176.2/3">That background frames the educational needs that we are discussing. We are still trying to recover from the loss of major employers in the coal mining, steel, textiles and engineering industries. That problem is found in many parts of England, Wales and Scotland. It impacts on individuals, their families and the economy. Employers now require a work force with different skills and workers who are able to adapt to change. In the new economy, there are fewer opportunities for men and women with no formal qualifications. It is all well and good, and proper, for our Government and society to aspire to a world in which a university degree is the norm. However, we must accept that this country has at least 6 million unskilled workers.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-06-23a.176.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2007" speakername="Jim Sheridan" colnum="176"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090623/halltext/90623h0001.htm#09062367000417">
	<p pid="a.176.3/1">Unfortunately, I will be unable to stay for the whole debate because I am serving on a Committee at 10.30 am.</p>
	<p pid="a.176.3/2">The promise of the '80s was that the old industries, such as coal and ship building, would be allowed to run down and would then be replaced by new industries. In my constituency, Hewlett-Packard, the new electronics firm, has just informed 700 of its workers that they will be sacked. In my view, the only reason is that the manufacturing base is being transferred to the Czech Republic. Such modern employers are taking advantage of the employment legislation in this country, which means that they can sack unskilled and unqualified workers. The UK is the easiest place in Europe to get rid of workers.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-06-23a.177.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1427" speakername="David Anderson" colnum="177"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090623/halltext/90623h0001.htm#09062367000418">
	<p pid="a.177.0/1">It is a shame that my hon. Friend will not be here for the rest of my speech. I will ensure that he gets a signed copy of the transcript when it is finished.</p>
	<p pid="a.177.0/2">My hon. Friend's point is correct. It is more important than ever that we tackle this issue because in the global marketplace, employers will act in the manner that he describes. They will go where the work can be done cheapest. If we do not recognise that, the 6 million or more unskilled people in this country will be left even further behind, as will people who have the skills but nowhere to work. As my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1386" name="Michael Clapham">the Member for Barnsley, West and Penistone (Mr. Clapham)</phrase> said, skills and jobs must go together.</p>
	<p pid="a.177.0/3">There is a huge mismatch between the unemployed and job vacancies, with older industrial areas being disproportionately affected. People in such areas have been reliant on manual work and skills. Younger generations often miss out on opportunities because employers have chosen not to go into such areas. The shortfall in skills and qualifications has therefore become intergenerational. Even in times of prosperity, men and women with low skills or no formal qualifications struggle to get work. Although I hope that we are starting to move out of the recession, it has given cause for even greater concern.</p>
	<p pid="a.177.0/4">Low skills have a negative impact on the economy and industry. If we cannot compete, we will not have a decent economy that employers want to come to. Having large numbers of low-skilled workers is a barrier to economic development. Employers in high value-added industries that require high skills generally look elsewhere. Few employers are keen to train workers from the start. They want to hire skilled and experienced people from the local area, and they certainly do not want to confront shortfalls in basic literacy, numeracy or computing. If we truly aspire to be a world-leading economy, we have to ensure that as many citizens as possible can contribute to the wealth of the nation.</p>
	<p pid="a.177.0/5">Many streams of Government funding are aimed at men and women with lower skills who are already in work. Such initiatives are absolutely correct, but they fail to meet the needs of those who are most socially excluded. In the meantime, initiatives to address shortfalls in basic skills remain the poor cousin&mdash;the funding is patchwork and the delivery is piecemeal. Engagement is a key issue. Although many individuals want to improve their skills, their previous experience of education often deters them from engaging with learning, and those types of learners are the hardest to reach. Many people's experience of school and education involved them being told that they were doomed to failure. Once such people have failed, they do not want to go back into education. Such a situation, and the fact that they are often not encouraged to go back into education, means that we have been left with problems.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-06-23a.178.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1677" speakername="David Taylor" colnum="178"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090623/halltext/90623h0001.htm#09062367000419">
	<p pid="a.178.0/1">Does my hon. Friend agree that further education, in particular, is one of the ways in which people can return to work more speedily? In my area, we have Stephenson college, which was named after the great George Stephenson, who was born in Wylam, just across the river from his constituency. Does my hon. Friend fear, as I do, that if the Conservatives were to return to power, they would repeat their track record on further education and it would be neglected in a way that would damage the sort of people we represent? I hope that the spokesman for the Conservatives, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1825" name="John Hayes">the hon. Member for South Holland and The Deepings (Mr. Hayes)</phrase>, will give us a birthday present&mdash;seeing as it is his anniversary today&mdash;and say that they have recanted their attitude in that regard from the 1980s.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-06-23a.178.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1427" speakername="David Anderson" colnum="178"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090623/halltext/90623h0001.htm#09062367000420">
	<p pid="a.178.1/1">There is absolutely no doubt that further education colleges are some of the unsung heroes. They do tremendous work in my area&mdash;the brand new college in Gateshead is an example&mdash;but there is still a need to help those who are hardest to reach. My hon. Friend's concerns are real. It is clear that the Conservative party did not put any money into further education structures before 1997. From what we are now hearing, the Conservatives will cut what money has been made available, and there are real worries that the future will be a rerun of the past. We must do our best to ensure that the Conservatives are not allowed to return us to such a situation.</p>
	<p pid="a.178.1/2">Professionals who work with adult learners agree that pre-engagement work is essential. That usually involves intensive one-to-one mentoring. People who would like to cross a school or college threshold can be persuaded back into education through more informal channels. However, once an individual has engaged with the learning process, there is a need for ongoing support. That type of initiative fits in well with the Government's aspiration to move the economically active away from welfare and back into work. However, such initiatives never seem to get the priority they deserve.</p>
	<p pid="a.178.1/3">What is the size and scope of the problem? First, we must accept that most skill levels are not evenly spread. The report that I mentioned sets out that the percentage of people with no formal qualifications ranges from less than 10 per cent. in the south-east and south-west to, for example, 17 per cent. in the west midlands. All the regions of the north, the midlands, Scotland and Wales have an above average share of adults with no formal qualifications. There is a clear regional divide between the more industrial areas and the more prosperous half of England, which is south of a line from the Severn to the Wash.</p>
	<p pid="a.178.1/4">The challenge that we face was spelled out clearly in the Leitch report. If we are to have a chance of filling the skills gap, we have four targets to reach by 2020. First, we need to achieve 90 per cent. functional adult literacy and numeracy, which would be an increase from a 2005 level of 85 per cent. for literacy and 79 per cent. for numeracy. Secondly, more than 90 per cent. of adults need to be qualified to at least national vocational qualification level 2, which would be an increase from the 2005 level of 69 per cent. Thirdly, we need to shift the balance of intermediate skills from NVQ level 2 to 3 and boost the number of level 3 attainments to 1.9 million. As <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2038" name="Bob Spink">the hon. Member for Castle Point (Bob Spink)</phrase> mentioned, we also need to increase apprenticeship numbers to 500,000 a year. Fourthly, we need to exceed the figure of 40 per cent. of adults qualified to NVQ level 4 and above, which would be an increase from 29 per cent. in 2005.</p>
	<p pid="a.178.1/5">How big is the gap in the specific areas about which I am talking? Let me go through some of the figures in the report&mdash;I will need to put my glasses on to do so. Nationally, an average of 54 per cent. of the adult work force are at or below NVQ level 2. However, the figure is 70 per cent. in Corby, 70 per cent. in Merthyr Tydfil, 64 per cent. in Easington in the north-east, 60 per cent. in Sunderland, 59 per cent. in Blyth Valley, 56 per cent. in Carmarthenshire, 58 per cent. in South Tyneside, and 67 per cent. in Stoke. There is a huge gap, and for every 100 people looking for jobs, at least 13 and sometimes 26 people will not have even a chance.</p>
	<p pid="a.178.1/6">The percentage of adults with no formal qualifications whatsoever is even more worrying. The average for Great Britain is 13 per cent., but that figure is 24 per cent. in both Newcastle-under-Lyme and Knowsley. The figure for my constituency in Gateshead is 17 per cent., and it is 21 per cent. in Blaenau Gwent and 14 per cent. in Durham county. Work that has been done there shows that deprivation is almost endemic. Unless we challenge this problem, we will not put that right.</p>
	<p pid="a.178.1/7">The report makes a start at dealing with the problem, and the policy and actions that the Alliance believes need to be pursued are set out in it. I shall pick up on a few of those points. We need to get to grips with the issue of low-skilled adults and we need to build adult skills. A large number of adults without NVQ level 2 qualifications are in the middle and later part of their working lives&mdash;they are the over-35s and, especially, the over-50s. The Government's focus on improving workers' skills has led to a concentration on funding skills at levels 2 and 3 for the under-25s. That is fine, but it leaves less funding for other forms of learning and for older groups.</p>
	<p pid="a.178.1/8">Current Government policies encourage providers to seek out quick wins that guarantee funding. Sadly, that disadvantages many adults with low-level skills, who often need time to develop motivation and confidence before they commit to a formal training course. The education and training system does not address the needs of those socially disadvantaged adults.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-06-23a.179.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2007" speakername="Jim Sheridan" colnum="179"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090623/halltext/90623h0001.htm#09062367000421">
	<p pid="a.179.0/1">My hon. Friend paints a bleak picture. Does he agree that the Government should be complimented on introducing the modern apprenticeship scheme? He may recall, as I do, that after leaving school at 15, we had between the ages of 15 to 16 to get a trade. If people did not do so, they were destined for a life of unskilled work. Will he comment on the positive aspects of the modern apprenticeship scheme?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-06-23a.179.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1427" speakername="David Anderson" colnum="179"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090623/halltext/90623h0001.htm#09062367000422">
	<p pid="a.179.1/1">There is no doubt that the modern apprenticeship scheme has been a success, as have many other schemes that the Government have introduced. In particular, I note their encouragement of things such as union learning reps. Again, we have tried to find out whether the Conservatives support that. It will be a sad day if they ever come back into power, but if they do, will they continue such schemes? It has been shown clearly that individual support from someone people know and can relate to is much welcomed in the areas I have mentioned. The Government's work has been good&mdash;I am not denying that&mdash;but we are talking about a core group of people who have been left behind. We have to make that journey to ensure that they catch up. Part of that is renewing the focus on hard-to-reach low-skilled adults.</p>
	<p pid="a.179.1/2">The national investment in education and training is now enormous, but the multiplicity of funding regimes is still a significant problem. The number of funding streams that come through so many different Departments means that it can be difficult to identify the funding that can be obtained specifically for low-skilled adults. There is a need for better information, advice and guidance to services, and there should also be improved communication about funding opportunities.</p>
	<p pid="a.179.1/3">The short-term nature of much funding can make it very difficult to plan from one year to the next. That is often particularly unhelpful for local community organisations. Small community and voluntary organisations in disadvantaged areas need easier access to funding and we should reduce the bureaucratic burden on them. Those organisations spend too much effort chasing funding when they should be delivering services. The result of the funding situation is that a lot of initiatives for low-skilled adults are based on short-term projects and programmes, which struggle to provide long-term, lasting results. There is a need for long-term funding and for successful local projects to be rolled out across England, Scotland and Wales. We are calling for clearer access to funding, but for it to be sustained funding, because that is the only way in which we can deliver effectively.</p>
	<p pid="a.179.1/4">It is also necessary to mention the key issue of pre-engagement. Not enough is done to provide first opportunities, which are most likely to appeal to men and women with low skills and low self-confidence, and which will help them to take the first steps back into learning and the labour market. That is partly because public policy is concentrated on providing formal education and training that leads directly to qualifications. That is fine, but it has led to a mismatch between available provision and what is actually needed to engage people in the first place. If people do not become engaged, they will not take the next step.</p>
	<p pid="a.179.1/5">Many men and women feel that they have nothing to gain from improving their skills. In some areas, there are deep-seated cultural attitudes, often with specific historical roots, that lead them to discount the benefits of learning. One of the causes can be the benefits system, or, more specifically, the fear of losing benefit, which can act as a powerful disincentive to engaging in learning. Personal development, community learning and other first-step adult learning and further education provision are vital to making progress with harder-to-reach individuals. There needs to be much more recognition of and support for first-step initiatives, which are vital.</p>
	<p pid="a.179.1/6">Many adults with low skills will not return to formal education in the classrooms of colleges and schools. To increase skill levels in the most disadvantaged communities, it is often necessary to invest directly in mentors who will work with people who need to be encouraged and pointed towards ways out of the various poverty traps that low wages and the benefits system combine to create. Fortnightly trips to the jobcentre to sign on and work-focused interviews are not likely to make a difference to people on the ground. In contrast, someone who will devote a couple of hours a week for a sustained period to a specific individual will help that person to take that next vital step. It is a case of taking the mountain to Mohammed.</p>
	<p pid="a.179.1/7">To make an impact, intensive outreach is vital, and local delivery is key. If capacity to address low-skill adults is to be effectively built, more needs to be done in the local communities in which they live. That could involve support for people to move back to work via local community enterprises, which allow men and women to enter employment where they learn new skills and at the same time make a real contribution to their community. Such projects are good at moving individuals forward at their own pace and providing a springboard for further training and long-term employment.</p>
	<p pid="a.179.1/8">There are good examples in the report of community-based support activities such as Big Tick in Pontypool, Ways2Work in Doncaster and Kingdom Homes in Fife. They show how, by providing general training for low-skill adults in suitable settings and locations, training agencies can get involved and take an active, community-based approach to engaging people. Provision should be delivered where people live. That is the best way to make them go forward. One size does not fit all, but a local solution will work best.</p>
	<p pid="a.179.1/9">As I said, the statistics reveal major regional and local differences in the proportion of adults with low skills or no formal qualifications. What is more, the geography of low skills shows strong similarities with the geography of deprivation. Against that backdrop, population-driven funding formulas make little sense, because population in such areas is decreasing. In the context of funding for adult basic training, what matters is not the total number of people in an area but the number who have low or no skills.</p>
	<p pid="a.179.1/10">The older industrial areas of Britain that all too often are still struggling with a major problem of low skills need to be given priority in the allocation of resources. Funding and effort has to be concentrated on the communities with the biggest problems; otherwise, they will be left behind yet again. Ultimately, we need to direct jobs at those areas. If job opportunities are not focused on such areas, it will be even harder for people to move forward.</p>
	<p pid="a.179.1/11">There are opportunities in this country, certainly in the area where I live. Like everyone else, we are going through tough times, but good things are on the horizon. There is a huge opportunity in the north-east to develop new jobs based on the potential of carbon capture and storage. There is huge interest among companies such as Nissan in developing electric cars, and there is a massive opportunity for offshore wind power, but the truth is that many of the people whom I have been talking about for the past 25 minutes&mdash;a long time&mdash;will not be able to take advantage of those jobs. Unless we address that agenda, we could well see people moving from one highly paid job to another while the people who are not in work do not get into work.</p>
	<p pid="a.179.1/12">I urge the Minister to support our campaign. I realise that I am making a special case but I make no apology for that. I ask him whether, as a result of the debate, we might have a discussion with the people who produced the report so that we can find a way forward together.</p>

	<p pid="a.182.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1427" name="David Anderson">the hon. Member for Blaydon (Mr. Anderson)</phrase> on securing this debate and on an excellent introduction. He set out clear policies for dealing with the skills gap in the older industrial areas. Rather than repeat much of what he said, I shall make a few specific points about some ways in which the Government could be more effective.</p>
	<p pid="a.182.0/2">The predominant employment in the area that I represent, Rochdale, was not based on coal, as in the hon. Gentleman's area, but on light engineering and textiles. Much of that has disappeared since the 1980s, but the problems remain. As he said, a large number of adults are low skilled and are working in low-skilled jobs or are unemployed. The question is: how can they get into employment or retain their job?</p>
	<p pid="a.182.0/3">A key issue is that, in the areas that we are discussing, the majority of employment is still in manufacturing. Many other areas have moved to so-called high-skilled, high-technology jobs, but, in most of the areas that we represent, a large part of the employment base is still very much in traditional manufacturing. One of the biggest problems that I come across when I speak to local employers is that, up until now, the Government simply have not had a proper strategic policy for securing the manufacturing base. Until recently, far too much emphasis has been placed on making money in the City, and we have seen where that has gone. What manufacturing we do have is high skilled and high tech.</p>

	<p pid="a.182.1/1">I strongly agree with the hon. Gentleman's remarks. I represent a constituency in the east midlands region, which, of all the regions in the country, has the highest proportion of its gross domestic product linked to manufacturing. It can survive and thrive, particularly when it focuses on the high-skill or niche end of the spectrum.</p>
	<p pid="a.182.1/2">Does the hon. Gentleman agree that one of the problems that we have seen over the past 12 years has been that the framework for training&mdash;the old training and enterprise councils and then the learning and skills councils&mdash;has not been appropriate, adequate or, as the description goes, fit for purpose? Has he any ideas on how we could reform it so that we can realign what is available to the new economy that lies outside, in the way that many east midlands firms have been able to do?</p>

	<p pid="a.182.2/1">I agree with the hon. Gentleman that the system that we have had so far with TECs, the LSC and the soon-to-be skills forum has been far too complicated, as the hon. Member for Blaydon said. We need to streamline and clarify what is available. I agree with <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1677" name="David Taylor">the hon. Member for North-West Leicestershire (David Taylor)</phrase> that we have high-tech manufacturing.</p>
	<p pid="a.182.2/2">In the current recession, there are two parts to the argument about what needs to be done. One that I would like to spend a bit of time on, which the hon. Member for Blaydon did not mention, is how companies can secure and maintain employment for people who are already in work.</p>
	<p pid="a.182.2/3">In April, the Government launched the golden hello and offered to pay employers up to &pound;2,500 to employ new people. For most of the employers whom I have spoken to in Rochdale, that is a non-starter. They are struggling to maintain the employment that they have. They are struggling to keep the people who already work for them in work. They are lean, mean outfits, and they cannot afford to lose the employees they have now, most of whom are multi-skilled.</p>

	<p pid="a.183.0/1">I do not disagree with the hon. Gentleman's comments about trying to maintain our traditional industries, but the Government have taken positive action. In the current climate, all politicians are portrayed as being the same and it is thought that politics do not matter, but I know from personal experience that the Government saved shipbuilding on the Clyde. It was on its way out and its jobs were going, but the Government's positive intervention saved it, and that is a traditional industry.</p>

	<p pid="a.183.1/1">I do not disagree with the hon. Gentleman, and I have no intention of saying that what the Government have done is wrong. I am trying to point out areas where they could be more supportive. I want to show hon. Members what we can do to maintain employment in the industries that we have&mdash;those that are struggling for orders and have people on short-term employment.</p>
	<p pid="a.183.1/2">I was given an example by a local ball bearing manufacturer in my constituency whose only major competitor in Europe is a company in Germany. The company in my constituency is struggling because Germany is assisting its workers, as is Wales, by paying employers for short-term employment schemes that allow retraining so that workers can be further upskilled. I would like the Government to adopt such schemes nationwide&mdash;Wales already has the ProAct scheme&mdash;because offering money for workers to undertake further training and paying companies for them to do so would guarantee continued employment for many workers. Employers who operate mean, lean outfits have multi-skilled workers and cannot afford to lose one or two because their whole production might be affected. I would like the Government to do more about that.</p>
	<p pid="a.183.1/3">My second point concerns the Learning and Skills Council, which has messed up the further education college reorganisation. In that regard, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1386" name="Michael Clapham">the hon. Member for Barnsley, West and Penistone (Mr. Clapham)</phrase> and other hon. Members have similar problems to those experienced in Rochdale. Colleges were promised money to reinvest and rebuild, but the LSC's mismanagement has resulted in many of them not knowing where they stand. Areas such as Barnsley, Rochdale and Blaydon, which have a large skills gap, need modern colleges that can deliver apprenticeships&mdash;I pay tribute to the Government's reinvention of apprenticeships as a way forward for many young people&mdash;but they also need money and investment. The LSC delayed decisions at the beginning of June, and we need to see a way forward. Support must be targeted in such areas because if we are ever to deal with the skills gap, investment in facilities and modern colleges is the way forward.</p>
	<p pid="a.183.1/4">My third and final point is about another area where the Government can help to secure the employment base. When the Chinese cockle pickers were tragically killed in Morecambe bay, legislation was introduced to prevent exploitation of workers by gangmasters. I was told last week that sweet manufacturers in Yorkshire, Greater Manchester and Lancashire are employing workers at below the minimum wage, and that a small sewing company in my constituency is under threat of going to the wall because larger companies are exploiting cheap labour and taking work elsewhere. Extending the gangmaster legislation to include a wider range of industries would do a lot to secure the employment base.</p>
	<p pid="a.183.1/5">Beyond that, the Government's policy on working with local authorities to draw up employment schemes is the right way forward, and Rochdale is playing its full part in drawing up plans with local employers and Jobcentre Plus to ensure opportunities for our workers. The next few years will be difficult. The areas that we represent are well used to hardship and difficulty, but with some small changes the Government could do a lot more to help those areas.</p>
	<p pid="a.183.1/6">I apologise for having to leave the debate early to attend a Statutory Instrument Committee at half-past 10.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-06-23a.184.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1386" speakername="Michael Clapham" colnum="184"  time="010:05:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090623/halltext/90623h0002.htm#09062367000428">
	<p pid="a.184.0/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1427" name="David Anderson">the Member for Blaydon (Mr. Anderson)</phrase> on securing the debate, which is particularly important for older industrial areas and the people who live there. I want to make three brief points.</p>
	<p pid="a.184.0/2">First, I want to discuss how to break the cycle of generational unemployment to improve people's life chances in areas such as Barnsley, Blaydon and Rochdale. Secondly, I shall refer to further education colleges and community colleges because they are crucial to the regeneration of older industrial areas. Barnsley college is particularly important. Thirdly, I want to emphasise the need to create jobs in older industrial areas. If we are to end generational unemployment, it is crucial to have the jobs to do that. As my hon. Friend said, evidence clearly shows that the UK's older industrial areas have too many men and women with low skills.</p>
	<p pid="a.184.0/3">Barnsley was once the centre of coal mining and the heavy industry associated with it, but it now has a great deal of worklessness, and many people have been unemployed since the collieries closed in the 1980s. It is important to remember that in 1983 40 per cent. of people who were employed by the National Coal Board, or British Coal as it became, were tradesmen, but those skills have not transferred to other industries to help to create jobs as those industries have grown. Consequently, we have high levels of unemployment, particularly among the age groups to which my hon. Friend referred&mdash;people over 35 and over 50. The prospects for unskilled workers who are unemployed are bleak in areas such as Barnsley. Many of the Government's initiatives have, sadly, missed those groups, and in the current economic downturn their prospects are bleak.</p>
	<p pid="a.184.0/4">The message that I want to get over to the Minister is that men and women with little immediate prospect of contributing to the knowledge-based economy must not be forgotten. Many initiatives have been good, but they have missed the people whom they were intended to win over. As we move from the economic downturn&mdash;there are indications that that is happening&mdash;we must concentrate efforts on how to equip the most disadvantaged people in our areas with the skills and qualifications that they need to engage with the world of work.</p>
	<p pid="a.184.0/5">Long-term unemployed people must be included in the effort to get people back to work. We seem to have missed that large number of people. Unless we tackle the problem meaningfully in older industrial communities, they will become a breeding ground for the extremism of the British National party. Already two BNP MEPs have been elected to the European Parliament. The support that they have received from older industrial areas has helped to elect them. That is a very sad fact. In tackling the economic situation, we must be aware of that, be moderate and create an understanding that leads people away from the BNP.</p>
	<p pid="a.184.0/6">My hon. Friend the Member for Blaydon talked about initiatives having to be local if we are to encourage people to take the first step towards coming back into learning and the jobs market. It is crucial that we have local initiatives, because many of the people we are trying to reach have low levels of confidence and self-esteem and it will be a slow process of mentoring, as he said, to get people in older industrial areas back into work. Further education colleges and community colleges are crucial to that.</p>
	<p pid="a.184.0/7">The Barnsley college property strategy was formally &quot;approved in principle&quot; by the Learning and Skills Council as early as July 2007. In November 2008, the LSC regionally approved the redevelopment of what is called the old mill site. That is the main college building. It was demolished, ready for construction to start in June 2009, but, appallingly, the project is currently being held up, awaiting a national decision. The LSC national council met on <phrase class="date" code="2009-06-03">3 June</phrase>, but to date the college has not been advised whether it is on the shortlist for resource allocation. In the meantime, the site stands shovel-ready, as they say, but work cannot start until there is a decision at national level.</p>
	<p pid="a.184.0/8">So far the college has spent &pound;10 million on the project, with LSC approval of the strategy. The planned building was to cost &pound;42 million. That has now been revised downwards to &pound;33 million, and here we are, still awaiting a decision. The decision is crucial to Barnsley, because if we are to deal with the skills issue that we are talking about, the college's input will be vital.</p>
	<p pid="a.184.0/9">I refer the Minister to how the college has performed in these very difficult circumstances. The college is at the heart of Barnsley's regeneration plans. Students and staff are in temporary accommodation. Further delay of the project will have a significant negative impact on students. The college is so important that 75 per cent. of young people in Barnsley go to it. It is terrifically important for employer-based skills training in the town and surrounding area. I therefore hope that he will do his best to ensure that the LSC is made aware of the critical situation in Barnsley to help to ensure that resource is made available.</p>
	<p pid="a.184.0/10">The college's results in these difficult circumstances show clearly the importance of its strategy of working with local people. The results of the Ofsted visit in March 2009 showed that the college was one of the best colleges nationally. Early results suggest that the college will be significantly above the national average for the academic year 2008-09. It is a tertiary college&mdash;a sixth-form college as well as a college dealing with vocational studies. Those results have been achieved in enormously difficult circumstances. As I said, I hope that the Minister will do his best to ensure that Barnsley receives the necessary resource so that the college can play its part in regenerating the area.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-06-23a.186.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1825" speakername="John Hayes" colnum="186"  time="010:05:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090623/halltext/90623h0002.htm#09062367000429">
	<p pid="a.186.0/1">I am interested in the hon. Gentleman's point about the capital crisis and Barnsley in particular. Will he let the Minister know, because it would be helpful, whether the college was encouraged by the Learning and Skills Council to expand in the way that he described? The story that I hear from colleges across the country is of exactly that happening. Is that the circumstance in Barnsley?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-06-23a.186.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1386" speakername="Michael Clapham" colnum="186"  time="010:05:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090623/halltext/90623h0002.htm#09062367000430">
	<p pid="a.186.1/1">That is the circumstance. The college has set out to increase the number of 16 to 18-year-old students as well as adult students. The whole strategy was, as I said, approved by the LSC as early as July 2007. That was given further, reinforced approval in November 2008, leading the college to go ahead with demolition in the belief that it would have the resource to start building a new college this month.</p>
	<p pid="a.186.1/2">The provision of job opportunities is perhaps the most important aspect of dealing with worklessness and unemployment in older industrial areas. Under the drive of the global economy, there is little doubt but that the UK has a particular problem in providing the right skills for a dynamic and quick-changing economy. Academic qualifications can be addressed, but that is only part of the problem. Apprenticeships and high-quality vocational training can also make their contribution. However, job opportunities must be created if the gap in living standards and well-being between the south of England and the older industrial areas of the north is to be bridged. The recession has highlighted the potentially catastrophic prospects for older industrial areas such as Barnsley if we do not create job opportunities.</p>
	<p pid="a.186.1/3">The way forward is to work with the regional development agencies to build a strong economic base throughout the UK. Using the RDA architecture, the Government must target resources to create job opportunities in all the older industrial regions. Training and apprenticeships are important, but without job opportunities we have a recipe for generational unemployment in areas such as Barnsley, and we must break that cycle.</p>
	<p pid="a.186.1/4">Now is the time to invest in the green economy and to bring new opportunities to older industrial areas. Yorkshire Forward&mdash;the RDA that covers Yorkshire and the Humber&mdash;is pressing for a massive carbon capture and storage project in Yorkshire and the Humber. On the RDA's estimation, that would create 50,000 jobs and stimulate the steel and engineering industries. It is the type of project that we require in Barnsley if new skills and training are to be married meaningfully to job opportunities. That will help to break the cycle of generational unemployment in the region. It will bring the people of the area high-quality jobs, with new training and skills. It will be the type of project with which the new apprenticeship schemes will fit neatly.</p>

	<p pid="a.187.0/1">We have had a good debate, albeit the Back-Bench speeches have finished slightly earlier than normal. I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1427" name="David Anderson">the hon. Member for Blaydon (Mr. Anderson)</phrase> on securing a debate on this important topic. In the interests of Front-Bench fraternity, I welcome the new Minister with responsibilities in this area to his first debate on skills. I am sure that it will be the first of many, particularly in this part of the House of Commons.</p>
	<p pid="a.187.0/2">The hon. Member for Blaydon mentioned the report&mdash;which I confess I have not read but would be interested to see&mdash;produced by the Coalfield Communities Campaign and others, which he said was called &quot;What a Waste&quot;. I empathised with a great deal of what he was saying, drawing on both that report and the experiences of his constituency. I cannot claim to represent an area of declining industry. Bristol, West does not fit that description at all. However, I did grow up in what was then, at least, a mining village, Abercynon, and Mountain Ash in south Wales. My father left school at 15 to work in a coal mine. Both my grandfathers worked in a coal mine. Three of my four great-grandfathers also worked in the south Wales mining industry. Therefore, I at least have that personal heritage and understanding of growing up in a community that was badly scarred and damaged by the 1980s downturn in the coal and steel industries.</p>
	<p pid="a.187.0/3">The hon. Gentleman mentioned the long-term effects of mass unemployment, which can be felt to this day. Employment opportunities that had been around for generations suddenly disappeared, and he mentioned the long-term health problems, including mental health problems.</p>

	<p pid="a.187.1/1">My father worked in the south Wales mines, and the decline in the 1980s was not the first in the mining industry. There was also a huge decline in the 1960s, when new industries were put in place in the new towns, and a lot of education was provided through new technical colleges. The difference in the 1980s was that there was absolutely no support and no help, and that is the real reason why the problems that we have now are becoming endemic.</p>

	<p pid="a.187.2/1">The hon. Gentleman is right. We should not spend too much time on the industrial history of south Wales, although I studied it as part of my geography A-level. We went to Cwmbran, which was a new town that had been constructed in the 1960s. As a Cardiff Member, the Minister will be familiar with these issues.</p>
	<p pid="a.187.2/2">The hon. Member for Blaydon mentioned the long-term social effects of the unemployment experienced in the 1980s. He also mentioned crime and drugs, which were new problems resulting from the despair in communities.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-06-23a.187.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1386" speakername="Michael Clapham" colnum="187"  time="010:18:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090623/halltext/90623h0003.htm#09062367000434">
	<p pid="a.187.3/1">One statistic relating to Barnsley stands out hugely in the debate. In 1975, the crime level in Barnsley was 15 per cent. below the national average. In 1995, it was 15 per cent. above the national average. In between, we had experienced something that we had not previously seen&mdash;the influx of drugs into the town.</p>

	<p pid="a.187.4/1">The hon. Gentleman makes a telling and pertinent point.</p>
	<p pid="a.187.4/2">The hon. Member for Blaydon mentioned the skills gap, which is the topic of the debate. He mentioned Leitch's 2020 targets for our skills base, which are extremely ambitious and stretching in many ways. However, he rightly said that in many communities&mdash;whether in the north-east, south Wales or other areas that share the characteristics that he mentioned&mdash;the skills gap is even wider, and we are even further from achieving the ambitious targets in the Leitch report. As he rightly said, it is important that people are not left behind in the current recession, but enabled to reach those ambitious skills targets.</p>
	<p pid="a.187.4/3">The hon. Gentleman mentioned the important role of community groups. Another characteristic of previous recessions, including in the 1980s recession, as I saw for myself in my village, is that a community's entire infrastructure can be pulled away. If one industry, such as coal mining, is closed down, an awful lot goes with it, including the social clubs, the music bands, the first aid centres and the informal training provided in the community.</p>
	<p pid="a.187.4/4">My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1784" name="Paul Rowen">the Member for Rochdale (Paul Rowen)</phrase>, who has had to go to a Statutory Instrument Committee, mentioned the characteristics of his constituency and particularly the declining textile industry. He also said&mdash;many economists have commented on this&mdash;that much of the focus of current Government policy is on reducing unemployment by inducing employers to take people from the dole queues, rather than on stemming the increase in unemployment by subsidising employers to keep existing employees in work. I was interested to hear examples of practice in Germany and Wales, where regional governments have not tried to take people from the dole queue, but have subsidised training in companies to keep people in their existing jobs so that they can meet their existing obligations.</p>
	<p pid="a.187.4/5">My party would support such an approach. We advocate redirecting the growth in the Train to Gain budget towards subsidising employers' off-the-job training costs so that they can maintain in employment apprentices who are working in the industry. It would be a tragedy if people who had entered into modern apprenticeships&mdash;several contributors to the debate have praised these programmes&mdash;lost their places simply because their employer could no longer support their employment, which is an essential and integral part of the apprenticeship.</p>

	<p pid="a.188.0/1">The hon. Gentleman mentioned his party's industrial policy. Does his party also agree that the architecture of the RDAs will be essential to creating new jobs in the new industries that will emerge as we come out of the current recession?</p>

	<p pid="a.188.1/1">I had actually noted down the point that the hon. Gentleman made about the RDAs in his speech and I was coming to it next, but I will deal with it now. Yes, I agree that RDAs could play an extremely important part, particularly in encouraging new industries. However, in my region, the South West of England Regional Development Agency has had its budget cut this year. If ever there was an inopportune moment to cut an RDA's budget, it would seem to be now, but my RDA's budget has nevertheless been cut. As a Bristol MP, I have had a letter from the RDA saying that as a result of the cut in its capital budget it is no longer able to support some of the projects that it had hoped to fund in my constituency, such as the regeneration of Stokes Croft, which is one of the gateways into the city centre. Of course, all RDAs are also affected by the downturn in the property market, because they depend, to some extent, on land sales to finance their capital programmes. The effects of the recession, as well as Government cuts in RDAs' budgets, are having a detrimental impact on the ground.</p>
	<p pid="a.188.1/2">My hon. Friend the Member for Rochdale and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1386" name="Michael Clapham">the hon. Member for Barnsley, West and Penistone (Mr. Clapham)</phrase> mentioned the important role of FE colleges. I will not dwell on that topic too long, because we have discussed it many times in Westminster Hall and on the Floor of the House. However, Barnsley college has probably been mentioned more than any other college in such debates.</p>
	<p pid="a.188.1/3">The Minister is new to his post, and his predecessor did not exactly cover himself in glory when responding to the concerns expressed by hon. Members from all parties about the FE college capital programme. I am sure that the Minister will earn the respect of many colleagues if he engages positively with the unfortunate issues raised by that programme and points to a clear way forward. If he does, he will also give hope to colleges such as Barnsley, which has been largely demolished, judging by the pictures that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1385" name="Jeff Ennis">the hon. Member for Barnsley, East and Mexborough (Jeff Ennis)</phrase> has shown me.</p>

	<p pid="a.189.0/1">May I ask the hon. Gentleman to point out to the Minister that, notwithstanding its wonderful sylvan setting, South East Essex sixth-form college and colleges like it are there to provide young people with education and training opportunities and to skill them up for the future? Those colleges have also suffered tremendously in the LSC debacle, and they should not be forgotten.</p>

	<p pid="a.189.1/1">The hon. Gentleman rightly says that we have seen a debacle under the auspices of the LSC, although there has also been a lack of good oversight on the part of Ministers, who should not be let off the hook. I have met several college principals and the associations that represent them, and although the hon. Gentleman tells the story from the perspective of his constituency&mdash;we have also heard about Barnsley&mdash;I am afraid that a cry for help can be heard from many parts of the country, where colleges have been encouraged to be ambitious in their capital bids, only to see the rug pulled from under them.</p>

	<p pid="a.189.3/1">I am always interested to listen to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1825" name="John Hayes">the hon. Member for South Holland and The Deepings (Mr. Hayes)</phrase>, and we will shortly have an opportunity to hear from him&mdash;probably at length&mdash;about Conservative party policy on the issue.</p>
	<p pid="a.189.3/2">Let me finish dealing with the points that have been made. The hon. Member for Barnsley, West and Penistone talked about the effects that despair can have on communities. He was rightly concerned about the election of two British National party members of the European Parliament, including, of course, one in his region of Yorkshire. I am sure that, whatever our differences on the topic, we are united in saying that we must find a way to reach out to people who felt that the only way they could express their despair through the ballot box was by voting for a fascist party. That should worry us all.</p>
	<p pid="a.189.3/3">The debate is taking place against the background of a deep recession. Previous recessions, which I have already described, were characterised by sudden downturns in single industries, which affected an entire community, leading to mass unemployment in the area concerned, and often long-term unemployment as well. One of the depressing statistics from that last recession in the 1980s was that many of the men, in particular, aged over 40, who lost jobs then did not return to full productive work, in what could have been useful working lives of another 20 or more years. We must work hard in the present recession so that that stark statistic is not repeated. That is why engagement with the skills needs of older workers in the current or potential work force will be vital. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1677" name="David Taylor">The hon. Member for North-West Leicestershire (David Taylor)</phrase>, who I think has gone to attend a Committee, referred to age discrimination.</p>
	<p pid="a.189.3/4">The Leitch report was mentioned once in the debate, and I said earlier that it had some stretching targets for 2020. However, it brought out very clearly the fact that, because of the demographic change in the work force, 70 per cent. of the 2020 work force to which the targets relate have already left formal education. It will therefore be vital to work not only with people who are currently in full-time education, but with the current work force. There will be a constant need for retraining, and new opportunities need to be explored.</p>
	<p pid="a.189.3/5">The present recession is different from previous ones that we have discussed. A financial heart attack has affected the entire economy. Workers in the banking and insurance industries, which are very important in my constituency, are suddenly out of work. There is retail gloom, and many retail chains that were common sights in our high streets have gone out of business; and the housing and construction bubble has, of course, burst as well. However, the restriction on credit by the banks is likely to affect the whole manufacturing and small business base. We must ensure, because of the huge injection of taxpayers' money into the capital base of the banks, that they will lend to manufacturing and small business.</p>
	<p pid="a.189.3/6">Bridging the skills gap that is the topic of the debate is the key to the future. I have mentioned older workers, but we should also think about gender differences: the opportunities that girls and young women feel are open to them, and those that boys feel are open to them. We should think about the differences in participation&mdash;the number of women taking part&mdash;in engineering, which is a key element in many of the relevant areas. Good information, advice and guidance are crucial to ensuring that young people take up the educational programmes that could lead to those productive careers.</p>
	<p pid="a.189.3/7">I want briefly to mention that we need to be worried, too, about boys' attainment in the relevant areas. There is a gap in attainment between boys and girls, which is not narrowing. The biggest gap affects white working-class boys. In the areas that we have talked about, whether south Wales, Yorkshire or the north-east, it is largely white working-class boys who feel the despair of unemployment. That is where there is the biggest attainment gap in schools.</p>
	<p pid="a.189.3/8">New industries for the future, such as carbon capture and storage, the electric cars that the hon. Member for Blaydon referred to, and wind turbines, such as those that could be installed off the west coast in the area that I represent, have been said to be essential to our meeting our 2020 climate change targets. However, none of that can be achieved if we do not bridge the current yawning gap affecting good STEM skills&mdash;science, technology, engineering and maths. That is a skills gap that the Government should address urgently.</p>

	<p pid="a.191.0/1">I welcome the debate, and I welcome the new Minister to his post. I think that he is the fourth skills Minister I have faced. I have seen off several others, and look forward to our relationship in that spirit.</p>
	<p pid="a.191.0/2">Skills matter. They matter for our economy, because they improve our productivity, and so our competitiveness, and they matter for individuals, because there is little that is more significant than the confidence that stems from the acquisition of skills through training. Most of all they matter for society, because they nourish social cohesion by feeding social mobility, and so offer the kind of social justice that is wanted by all hon. Members who have taken part in the debate&mdash;and, I hope, all hon. Members in the House. At a time when unemployment has hit its highest total for 12 years and about 100,000 people are being added to the number every month, one might have thought that the skills gaps would no longer be a pressing problem. However, last week, a CBI-KPMG survey of London business revealed that even during the downturn, skills shortages remained a major concern and could hamper economic recovery. Four in 10 of the capital's businesses still say they have problems finding the right talent, despite rising unemployment, and traditional sectors such as those we have heard about today are among those reporting the biggest skills shortages, with 52 per cent. of businesses in energy, manufacturing and construction reporting a problem.</p>
	<p pid="a.191.0/3">We heard about manufacturing from <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1784" name="Paul Rowen">the hon. Member for Rochdale (Paul Rowen)</phrase> and from <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1427" name="David Anderson">the hon. Member for Blaydon (Mr. Anderson)</phrase>, whom I congratulate on securing the debate, and who made a strong and persuasive case for his constituents. He argued forcefully, with reference to the Leitch report, that unless we fill the skills gap, our economy will falter and fail&mdash;of course he is right. Skills shortages are still a significant problem because a mismatch remains in skills policy between provision and need. We must align skills policies much more closely with the needs of businesses and individuals. Only 28 per cent. of respondents to the survey that I mentioned found Government schemes such as Train to Gain beneficial, and 45 per cent. said that they were neither relevant nor useful. That is shocking, but it should not be a surprise, because the Opposition have been arguing for some time that the investment in skills is misplaced because it is unresponsive to need and insensitive to the wishes of business.</p>

	<p pid="a.191.1/1">The hon. Gentleman will be aware that in the 1980s, when many of the older industries that we have talked about disappeared, little was put in their place. As a result, despite social mobility arising from education policy, there is still a lag, dating back to that time, that affects people whose skills were not transferable. That is the group of people we must reach. That means new jobs using, for example, the regional development agencies. What is the Conservative party's policy on RDAs and on using their architecture to create jobs?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-06-23a.192.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1825" speakername="John Hayes" colnum="192"  time="010:34:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090623/halltext/90623h0003.htm#09062367000444">
	<p pid="a.192.0/1">I was barely mature in the 1980s&mdash;actually, it is my birthday today. I was just a stripling&mdash;a child. However, I understand that it is critical to social mobility that we enable people to gain new skills and to change skills as the economy changes. Advanced economies become ever more dynamic in their skills needs, and rather than holding an archaic view of those needs, we need an ever more responsive and sensitive demand-driven system.</p>
	<p pid="a.192.0/2">I do not want to get into a debate about the RDAs, but in the brief time available I shall point out&mdash;I think it will excite and reassure the hon. Gentleman&mdash;that the Conservative Opposition are completely committed to skills. We prioritise them not just because of the difference that, as I have said, they make to the economy, but because we understand the difference that they make&mdash;especially in areas such as the hon. Gentleman's constituency, but throughout the country&mdash;to individuals, families and communities.</p>
	<p pid="a.192.0/3">A survey by the Learning and Skills Network in April 2007 found that only 4 per cent. of employers thought that Train to Gain met their needs effectively. The Select Committee on Innovation, Universities, Science and Skills concluded in its report on the 2008 departmental report by the Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills that Train to Gain lacked &quot;any real employer enthusiasm&quot;. A recent report by the United Kingdom Commission for Employment and Skills on future skills needs entitled &quot;Ambition 2020&quot; contends that long-term unemployment trends will continue and that there will be a structural shift away from mass production industries to high-end manufacturing and higher level skills at level 3 and above.</p>
	<p pid="a.192.0/4">The focus of current provision does not necessarily fit those projections. Government policy is to fund fully the training of apprentices under the age of 19, and to part-fund apprentices aged 19 and over. The Government ask employers to contribute about 50 per cent. of those people's training costs, but the Minister must know that that policy acts as a disincentive for employers to take on young people aged 19 to 24 who are not in education, employment or training. It also acts as a barrier to progression, as those who complete a level 2 apprenticeship after their 19th birthday might find their employers unwilling to contribute to the training costs of an advanced apprenticeship. That is a concern, given that UKCES projections indicate that there will be significant under-achievement on the level 3 target set out in the Leitch review, as we heard from the hon. Member for Blaydon. UKCES also reports that the Government will fail to meet its level 2 target, so there will be insufficient improvement in the lower levels of qualification.</p>
	<p pid="a.192.0/5">We need radical refocusing of skills funding and skills policy, and apprenticeships should be at the heart of that radical change. All apprenticeships should match the standards of the best and confer real and practical competence, which will boost employability. All should provide the opportunity to progress. We want to make it much easier for companies to be involved in apprenticeships.</p>
	<p pid="a.192.0/6">We want to shift &pound;800 million of support to apprenticeships and pre-apprenticeship training at all ages. We aim, as a result, to create 100,000 new training places every year. Because of greater costs to small and medium-sized businesses, they need direct financial support, which is why the Opposition propose a &pound;2,000 apprenticeship bonus for all apprenticeships in SMEs. We should fully fund apprenticeships for people of all ages, facilitating progression from level 2 to level 3. We should also allow apprenticeships to be a route into higher and further education through scholarship schemes of the sort outlined by the Conservative party. It is because we value practical skills that we want to establish a clear pathway for apprentices. That will help business to meet their skills needs, and individuals to get the training that they want.</p>
	<p pid="a.192.0/7">Apprenticeships are not the only answer. We also need to reskill and upskill, which will not always mean apprenticeships. We need to think more creatively about the advice and guidance that should be given to mature people who need to change direction. The hon. Member for Blaydon&mdash;he was echoed by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1458" name="Stephen Williams">the hon. Member for Bristol, West (Stephen Williams)</phrase>&mdash;was right to say that that will require a better system of advice and guidance, which is why I want an all-age careers service to have a presence in every town, and at every school and college, to offer advice to young people and older learners who need to upskill and reskill.</p>
	<p pid="a.192.0/8">In the light of the debate, I ask the Minister to answer three questions. First, what will he do about the further education building programme? We heard again today from hon. Members, as we do at every opportunity&mdash;although the Government give us few&mdash;about the pressing problems faced by FE colleges. When can we expect further news about that, and how many of the 150 colleges affected will have their capital programmes approved?</p>
	<p pid="a.192.0/9">Secondly, does the Minister expect the number of NEETs to grow or to fall? Shockingly, we heard last week that the number of young people not in education, employment or training has reached its highest level. Indeed, the Minister will know that the number has grown by 200,000 since the beginning of the decade. That is not acceptable ethically, socially or economically.</p>
	<p pid="a.192.0/10">Thirdly, will the Minister say something about adult community learning, which we heard a little about from the hon. Member for Blaydon? That is about people taking small steps back into learning, particularly those who were failed by the education system first time round. Adult community learning has been decimated, however, and according to the National Institute of Adult Continuing Education, 1.4 million places have been lost in only a few years. Does the Minister expect adult and community learning to grow, or does he expect that decline to continue?</p>
	<p pid="a.192.0/11">I have asked the hon. Gentleman modest questions because I do not want to make excessive demands of a new Minister. If he gives definitive answers, the whole House will welcome him even more enthusiastically than it would merely as a matter of courtesy.</p>
	<p pid="a.192.0/12">A recent survey found that one in eight people wanted to learn new skills. They know that education opens the door to a different future. If we can harness that ambition, we can begin to build the more cohesive, just and mobile society that I seek: a new hope, with a society transformed through the elevation of practical learning.</p>
	<p pid="a.192.0/13">We seek to build a Britain where all play their part and all feel valued through the kind of commitment to skills that Members across the House would welcome. The Minister owes it to hon. Members, but most significantly to young and more mature people who want to gain new skills in the face of the recession, to give positive answers to the questions that have been raised today.</p>

	<p pid="a.194.0/1">May I say what a pleasure it is, Mr. Martlew, to serve under your chairmanship? I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1427" name="David Anderson">the Member for Blaydon (Mr. Anderson)</phrase> on securing this timely debate, and on his chairmanship of the all-party group on coalfield communities, a job that he pursues with his usual dedication and passion. Before responding to the specific points raised by my hon. Friend, may I say that I will be happy to meet him and his group? I have seen the summary of the report to which he referred.</p>
	<p pid="a.194.0/2">During the debate, a number of places were mentioned by hon. Members that are in some way related to my personal history. For instance, my hon. Friend the Member for Blaydon mentioned Merthyr Tydfil, which is where my grandmother was born. He also mentioned Pontypool, which is where I went to school. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1458" name="Stephen Williams">The hon. Member for Bristol, West (Stephen Williams)</phrase> mentioned Cwmbran, which is where I was born. Like them, I too come from a mining background; my grandfather was a coal miner, as were all my uncles&mdash;my mother's brothers. My mother came from Nantyglo; the hon. Member for Bristol, West, being a Welshman, will know that that means stream of coal. I am familiar with the areas about which we are talking, even though I now represent Cardiff, West, a rather different sort of constituency.</p>
	<p pid="a.194.0/3">I shall mention briefly the other contributors to the debate. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1784" name="Paul Rowen">The hon. Member for Rochdale (Paul Rowen)</phrase>&mdash;he is not now in his place, as he had to attend a Statutory Instrument Committee&mdash;made a very balanced contribution. He acknowledged the Government's efforts on the matter of skills, and he also mentioned manufacturing. It is worth putting it on record that we remain the sixth largest manufacturer in the world, and that manufacturing has grown and been successful under this Government, albeit in a changing economy. He also mentioned further education; I shall deal with that in a moment.</p>
	<p pid="a.194.0/4">My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1386" name="Michael Clapham">the Member for Barnsley, West and Penistone (Mr. Clapham)</phrase> mentioned Barnsley college. The Learning and Skills Council will be making an announcement on the matter in the near future; it will not be a long delay before it does so. However, I acknowledge the LSC's problems on that question, as did the Foster review. The process that is now under way is based on the Foster review; we are trying to find the right sort of criteria to make a judgment on which projects should go ahead&mdash;and which projects are ready to go ahead&mdash;in order to help stimulate the economy. That will be announced in the near future.</p>
	<p pid="a.194.0/5">I welcome the remarks made by the hon. Member for Bristol, West. He rightly pointed out the importance of the skills of the current work force and not only of the young people now leaving school. He was slightly unkind to my predecessor, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1412" name="Sin Simon">the Member for Birmingham, Erdington (Mr. Simon)</phrase>, who met with many MPs to discuss the FE colleges issue.</p>

	<p pid="a.195.0/1">I welcome the Minister to his new post and thank him for his comments about me. On the issue of workers already in the work force, I refer him to a letter that I received around the time I called for this debate. It came from employers and trade unions within the textile industry, who expressed their concern that Skillfast-UK, which is their sector skills council, is in danger of losing its licence. Will he look into that matter, early into his new job, and work with employers and unions to ensure that their training remains in place?</p>

	<p pid="a.195.1/1">I acknowledge that point. The sector skills councils are currently under review, and I shall take a close look at any recommendations made in that regard.</p>
	<p pid="a.195.1/2"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1825" name="John Hayes">The hon. Member for South Holland and The Deepings (Mr. Hayes)</phrase> asked about FE colleges. We are not talking about whether we shall invest, or have been investing, in them, but about how we do so. In the final year of the last Conservative Government, not a penny was invested in FE colleges, and in the last four years, there was a 7 per cent. real cut in their funding. I am reluctant, therefore, to accept any lessons from him, even though he was a babe in arms, as he told us, at the time of the last Conservative Administration. Nevertheless, I wish him a happy birthday.</p>
	<p pid="a.195.1/3">I also remind the hon. Gentleman that we rescued apprenticeships, which were decimated under the Conservatives. In 2007-08, 225,000 apprenticeships were running, and earlier this year the Prime Minister pledged a package of support for 35,000 additional places over the coming year. I heard the hon. Gentleman's interesting pledges on apprenticeships, on behalf of his party, but is he prepared to pledge to match the expenditure that we have committed to FE colleges in the years to come? Frankly, given what his Front-Bench colleagues revealed recently about their spending plans, I doubt that he is.</p>

	<p pid="a.195.2/1">Perhaps I can help the Minister. He is catching up with these matters, so his figures might not be pinpoint perfect. The number of level 3 apprenticeships is about 100,000&mdash;just under, according to 2006-07 figures&mdash;but was about 130,000 in 1999-2000. Therefore, the number of level 3 apprenticeships&mdash;the level required for all apprenticeships in France and Germany&mdash;has fallen. Furthermore, how many of the 35,000 extra places will be for level 3 apprenticeships?</p>

	<p pid="a.195.3/1">As ever, the hon. Gentleman is interested in opportunities for the few and not for all. We have extended apprenticeships, but he is not interested in expanding those opportunities to wider groups. I also note that he had nothing to say on FE college investment.</p>
	<p pid="a.195.3/2">My hon. Friend the Member for Blaydon asked about the amount that the Government have spent on basic skills and the remaining illiteracy and innumeracy. As I think that he acknowledged, since 2001, we have helped 5.7 million people to improve their basic skills on 12 million courses, of whom 2.8 million have achieved national qualifications. As he pointed out, however, the problem is of long standing and goes back generations. Although we have made much progress, much remains to be done to meet the Leitch report target of 95 per cent. of adults having at least functional literacy and numeracy skills by 2020. We have recently refreshed our Skills for Life strategy, which this year alone is backed up by &pound;1 billion.</p>
	<p pid="a.195.3/3">Hon. Members mentioned the concentration of funding on under-25s and the disadvantage to those wishing to obtain skills in the middle and later part of life. In fact, however, our adult learning programmes are extending into those age groups. In 2007-08, a quarter of people on Train to Gain were between the ages of 45 and 59. The Government certainly agree that learning should serve the needs of the whole community, including older people, either within or outside the work force. Our strategy for world-class skills and reforms of wider adult learning offer everyone, whatever their age or background, the opportunity to improve their skills, prospects and quality of life. And, of course, literacy and numeracy courses are free for all adults whatever their age.</p>
	<p pid="a.195.3/4">My hon. Friend the Member for Blaydon mentioned the importance of outreach work, which is also mentioned in the Alliance's report. I agree that we need to invest in mentors to work with and encourage the sort of people whom he mentioned, to provide them with a way out of the poverty trap. That is why we shall ensure that the community learning champions network has more support and an improved infrastructure of connections, including with the adult advancement and careers service. In that way, it can be more effective in encouraging peers, neighbours and friends to take up learning. The champions can act as role models in the way that he wants, showing that it is never too late to learn skills and to embark on new career routes. They will be crucial in reaching out to those who need such help&mdash;and who perhaps have not been helped so far.</p>
	<p pid="a.195.3/5">My hon. Friend and other hon. Members also mentioned the complexity of funding structures and the need for people to understand what sort of funding is available. Every year more than 3 million people access the system successfully. However, we recognise that guidance arrangements can be improved, and that is why we shall go ahead with the adult advancement and careers service, which will be available to everyone, including lower-skilled and workless people, and ensure that people can get the right advice about what is available and how to get it.</p>
	<p pid="a.195.3/6">My hon. Friend raised the problem of upskilling low-skilled people, who often need to increase their confidence before committing themselves to formal training. We recognise that, which is why we are committed to informal adult learning and shall spend &pound;210 million on it this year. Low-skilled and hard-to-reach people are often those most likely to benefit from learning, but the least likely to seek it, as he pointed out. They find it difficult to enter such structured learning opportunities. Often adult learning for the worst-off begins with informal learning, so encouraging them back into that will help them to progress towards more structured learning opportunities.</p>
	<p pid="a.195.3/7">Hon. Members mentioned the need for more local training solutions to respond to local needs. We want to gear our support towards that local need. Through Train to Gain, skills brokers and providers respond to the specific training needs of employers and individuals, and recent offers to support people through the recession will link skills training to job opportunities. The Learning and Skills Council has stated to providers its wish to see Train to Gain prioritised in areas with a pre-employment training offer, and it will work locally to ensure that the wrap-around services to learners and employers enable progression into work-based skills support.</p>
	<p pid="a.195.3/8">My hon. Friends the Members for Blaydon and for Barnsley, West and Penistone mentioned that there are fewer job opportunities in older industrial areas, where we need to do more to create extra jobs. They also mentioned carbon capture. We have published our strategic vision in &quot;New Industry, New Jobs&quot; to set out the key areas where Government action can have the most impact. We want to invest in growth to speed the economic recovery and to build our manufacturing and service sectors.</p>
	<p pid="a.195.3/9">Through the future jobs fund, which is worth &pound;1 billion, we are taking action to provide job opportunities for those otherwise unable to find work. I contrast that with responses to unemployment in previous recessions by Conservative Governments. We aim to create 150,000 jobs to support long-term unemployed young people and others facing significant disadvantages in the labour market. It is important that we target our resources to address inequalities, and we shall continue to direct the majority of our investment towards the priority areas of Skills for Life and full level 2 and 3 qualifications.</p>
	<p pid="a.195.3/10">Time is short, so I cannot go through all the points raised in this debate. However, the Government remain committed to skills. My hon. Friend the Member for Blaydon made many important points in his speech, and I look forward to reading the report in full and meeting him and his colleagues to discuss it further.</p>

	<p pid="a.198.1/1">I am glad that I have the opportunity to raise this subject and that we have a new Minister to respond to the debate. I know this is a matter that will concern both her and the rest of the Chamber.</p>
	<p pid="a.198.1/2">As a country, we work the longest hours, and are the least trusting and the loneliest people in the western world, according to recent surveys. We have record levels of family breakdowns, teenage pregnancies, drug abuse and violent crime. People in this country feel powerless, anxious and insecure. They no longer feel responsible for their neighbour and do not care or know what is happening next door. We live in a dislocated and broken society, with the breakdown of the family unit at the heart of the problem. The cogs of our society have been worn out, and now we face a very new and dangerous problem.</p>

	<p pid="a.198.2/1">The hon. Gentleman is a great expert in this area, but he is giving us a counsel of despair at the moment. Does he agree that one of the great things that characterises this nation is its well developed voluntary sector? What is his view of the Barnardo's initiative to pilot services for children who are trafficked for sexual exploitation, and the work of the Coalition for the Removal of Pimping, both of which have received small amounts of public funds?</p>

	<p pid="a.198.3/1">The hon. Gentleman has not given me an even chance to explain what I want to talk about. All initiatives that try to do good and make life better are to be welcomed. I know of the Barnardo's initiative and can only speak very highly of it. All non-governmental agencies working in the field&mdash;or indeed any other field&mdash;are always to be supported and welcomed. Provided the hon. Gentleman does not interrupt me again, he might actually hear what I have to say.</p>
	<p pid="a.198.3/2">My so-called counsel of despair was designed to set the picture. The public face may look all right, but it conceals untold problems. Too many children grow up in broken homes, with one parent or within the care system, and too many are deprived of the resources that allow them to fulfil their potential. The United Kingdom displays some of the worst erosion of family values in Europe. As a result, we feel obliged to keep passing child care legislation in an attempt to deal with the problems, but we are unable to implement most of it because of the insufficient number of care professionals. Furthermore, increasing numbers of children are brought up in ethnic minority households, with different values, morals, mores and expectations. Such children are under pressure from two worlds. On the one hand they have to reconcile their own culture and, on the other, they have to fit into the British way of life. The state cannot and should not try to provide us with substitute parents to raise children; it cannot be done. Teachers should not have to teach values that parents should impart.</p>
	<p pid="a.198.3/3">More families are splitting and more children are going into care because of the fragmentation of society. Instead of trying to strengthen the family unit, successive Governments have poured resources into the substitutes. Yet our broken society still does not have enough substitutes. We have to find more social workers, children's homes and foster parents to make good the shortcomings of families. Britain today has a culture of box-ticking bureaucracy that robs people of opportunities to take personal responsibility and make their own decisions.</p>
	<p pid="a.198.3/4">In addition, there is the pressure of the modern high-speed internet, which brings into the home a whole new set of opportunities and dangers. Overtly, life appears normal, but, behind closed doors, there is sometimes an unsavoury picture. The debate is about the hidden world in which children are increasingly sexually abused.</p>
	<p pid="a.198.3/5">Let us look at the child abuse statistics. Some 1 per cent. of children under the age of 16 experience sexual abuse by a parent or a carer, and a further 3 per cent. by another relative during childhood. Some 11 per cent. of children aged under 16 experience sexual abuse during childhood by people known but unrelated to them, and 5 per cent. of children aged under 16 experience sexual abuse during childhood by an adult stranger or someone they have just met. In total, 16 per cent. of children&mdash;one in six&mdash;aged under 16 experience sexual abuse during childhood. More than one third, 36 per cent., of all rapes recorded by the police are committed against children under the age of 16. That is the picture in Britain today. The most vulnerable of those children in our advanced society should be protected. However, in Britain we do not manage to do that. Our so-called safeguarding strategies look very good on paper, but in reality, children continue to be game to predators, paedophiles and traffickers. They are the ones most at risk of abuse, and the ones least capable of protecting themselves.</p>
	<p pid="a.198.3/6">People may wonder why our society is unable to safeguard from exploitation the most vulnerable children and why the state has not been able to help more. Is it that state intervention deals only with the symptoms rather than with the root causes? Even children taken away from parents into the care of the state face multiple risks, sometimes from those who are supposed to care for them, as we know only too well. It is just not possible to replicate the role of parent in supporting and nurturing children as they develop. On <phrase class="date" code="2009-06-10">10 June</phrase>, the Department for Children, Schools and Families published &quot;Safeguarding children and young people from sexual exploitation&quot;, which is designed to help police, teachers, social workers and health workers. It has been issued to local authorities around the country. The guidance suggests that the needs of trafficked children should be met by local safeguarding children's boards. It talks about establishing trafficking sub-groups and protocols to manage the effective care of trafficked children. I ask you, Mr. Martlew, is that really the way to go? We are talking about yet another bureaucratic organisation&mdash;the local safeguarding children's boards&mdash;and yet another sub-group to look at the trafficking of children. We simply cannot cope with the needs of our own children in this country, let alone with the problems of migrant or trafficked children. Establishing trafficking sub-groups and protocols will not deal with existing problems nor provide effective care for trafficked children.</p>
	<p pid="a.198.3/7">Let us give credit where it is due. The Government have recognised the scandal of child trafficking and taken a number of steps towards the prevention and prosecution of trafficking offences. Moreover, they have provided protection for child victims of trafficking. Migrant as well as British children are at risk of being trafficked for sexual exploitation, and that exploitation is often linked with domestic servitude and other forms of exploitative labour. Information about the scope and incidence of child trafficking in the United Kingdom has been produced by the Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre, which published a strategic threat assessment in April, identifying 337 cases of children trafficked into or within the United Kingdom over the past year. The children came from a wide range of countries&mdash;China was the most frequently mentioned&mdash;for a number of purposes, including sexual exploitation, forced labour and domestic servitude.</p>
	<p pid="a.198.3/8">The National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children also published research this month on child victims of trafficking. It recommended that child protection concerns and the best interests of the child should always trump immigration procedures. I hope that the Minister takes a particular interest in this important point: trafficked children need to be seen not as immigration cases, but as children who have been trafficked here for exploitation.</p>
	<p pid="a.198.3/9">The NSPCC advocated the need for trained foster carers and 24-hour supported accommodation for child victims of trafficking. I am all for that, but can the Government deliver? A campaign to find foster carers that come from the same country as the trafficked child could be the first step. During the Slough raids on the Roma community in February 2008, the police found a number of young children who had been forced into criminal activity, but they were unable to find foster carers who spoke Romanian or the dialect of Romanian that the Roma children spoke. Could the United Kingdom Human Trafficking Centre, which was funded by the Government to the tune of &pound;1.6 million this year, take on the role of locating potential foster carers from minority communities? That is an important job, but it is not being done. If locating foster parents from minority communities who might be willing to foster children from their old home country cannot done by the UKHTC, some of the excellent non-governmental agencies that fortunately abound in this field could be given the task. I would be grateful if the Minister addressed that point.</p>
	<p pid="a.198.3/10">Although the ratification and implementation of the Council of Europe convention against trafficking provides improved protection in theory&mdash;I am glad the Government singed and ratified the convention, and that they are now implementing it&mdash;there are some serious problems with the national referral mechanism, which was set up under the convention to identify victims of human trafficking and to ensure that they are referred to specialist support services. The process of identification is critical, because it results in the granting of temporary admission into the UK and access to a range of support and legal services. Failure correctly to identify a trafficked victim can lead to a denial of basic support, continued exploitation, criminalisation and, ultimately, removal to the country of origin, often without a risk assessment. Can the Minister tell us how many children have been removed from Britain in the past year and returned to their country of origin without ensuring that the necessary support services were in place in those countries, to ensure that the child is not re-trafficked and brought back into Britain? Such a risk assessment before a child is put on a plane is a prerequisite, but is it actually happening?</p>
	<p pid="a.198.3/11">Part of the problem with the national referral mechanism is the question of what is the competent authority to identify and legalise individuals who have been trafficked. Who holds the power to identify children who have been trafficked? The answer is that it is a handful of UK Border Agency caseworkers, but how do the Government ensure that victim care is the caseworkers' priority given that they come from the immigration services? Does the Minister not think that that is the wrong way round? Would it not make much more sense to have as the competent authority professionally trained child protection staff who would recognise the best interests of the child, which is the most important thing?</p>
	<p pid="a.198.3/12">End Child Prostitution, Child Pornography and the Trafficking of Children for Sexual Purposes UK&mdash;ECPAT UK&mdash;represents a coalition of leading organisations, including Anti-Slavery International, the Jubilee Campaign, NSPCC, Save the Children, the Children's Society, UNICEF and so on. It has offered specific training for those responsible for identifying victims in the Home Office and, no doubt, people in the Minister's Department. As yet, it has received no response. The organisation does training all over Britain and it would be ideal if it were invited to train the UKBA caseworkers as to how they should identify trafficked children. When will the Minister, and the Home Office, respond, and will she apply pressure to ensure that the Government respond?</p>
	<p pid="a.198.3/13">The problem of identification and age determination at ports of entry is another spanner in the works. Trafficked children are often found without legal documents, or with documents that have been falsified by their traffickers to make them appear younger or older than they are. When a child is accompanied by an adult, the information provided by the adult should be verified to determine their relationship with the child. Once they have gone through the frontier, it is too late.</p>
	<p pid="a.198.3/14">In each region of Croatia, a police officer and a social worker are appointed and trained to identify victims and to assess the credibility of each case. We cannot expect all UKBA staff to be equipped, but why have the Government given them sole responsibility for identification? The Minister may say that it is not her responsibility, but she is here to respond to the debate, and I hope she addresses that point. If she cannot, will she see that the Department responsible deals with the problem?</p>
	<p pid="a.198.3/15">On <phrase class="date" code="2009-05-06">6 May</phrase>, <i>The Guardian</i> stated that 77 Chinese children had gone missing from Hillingdon children's services in the past year. Later in the month, the Select Committee on Home Affairs published its report into human trafficking, which described a resurgence of a type of slave trade and criticised the lack of good information on the scale of the problem. It also said that enforcement was patchy, that prosecution rates were low, and that there is little protection for victims. Similarly, ECPAT UK has found that about 60 per cent. of suspected child victims in local authority care go missing and are not subsequently found. The Committee was particularly alarmed by accounts that traffickers may, in effect, be using the care home system for vulnerable children as holding pens for their victims, until they are ready to pick them up.</p>
	<p pid="a.198.3/16">I saw that very process when I visited Gatwick with some of my colleagues from the all-party parliamentary group on the trafficking of women and children. Children who were initially applying for asylum came through the system and were sent in a minibus to one of the local authority children's homes about eight miles away. That is a receiving centre for children, as is Hillingdon near Heathrow. Oddly enough, most of the children are allowed to hold on to their mobile phones. When it is convenient for the traffickers, the children in the reception centres are picked up.</p>
	<p pid="a.198.3/17">The children's homes are not secure, and I am not sure that the balance between making them a prison and keeping them open has been correctly struck. At the moment, they are far too open, and traffickers probably ring the child on the mobile phone saying, &quot;Meet me at the front gate in half an hour,&quot; and off they go. In such circumstances, one cannot be too surprised that 77 Chinese children went missing from Hillingdon children's services. The problem is the balance between secure and free accommodation. At the moment, people can go missing if they so wish.</p>
	<p pid="a.198.3/18">Article 10(4) of the Council of Europe convention, which we implemented in April, states:</p>
	<p pid="a.198.3/19" class="indent">&quot;As soon as an unaccompanied child is identified as a victim, each Party shall...provide for representation of the child by a legal guardian, organisation or authority which shall act in the best interests of that child&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.198.3/20">The necessity of appointing a guardian for a trafficked child stems from the acute vulnerability that such a child faces. They are highly susceptible to the continued attempts by traffickers to re-establish their control. One non-governmental organisation found that children go missing at the very point when they are being assessed for support. A guardian appointed at that stage would provide additional protection, look out for the child's best interests, guide them through the complex legal and policy processes and provide a crucial link between the various agencies and services for the child.</p>
	<p pid="a.198.3/21">Will the Minister consider the issue seriously? Why do the Government oppose the appointment of guardians? Why do they say that it is not necessary? That is the one thing that would go further than anything else to guarantee the safety of vulnerable children. The system uses guardians ad litem anyway, so it is not a question of appointing a lot of new people at enormous cost. Guardians ad litem do a tremendously important job in our legal system by protecting children in this country; why can they not be given the job of looking after vulnerable children who are trafficked into Britain or come here seeking asylum? We are not talking about a vast number of children; it may be in the hundreds, but it is not yet in the thousands. It needs to be considered.</p>
	<p pid="a.198.3/22">Defining the scale of trafficking in the United Kingdom is an ongoing issue. In its report, the Home Affairs Committee said that one of the biggest problems facing attempts to tackle trafficking is the lack of any serious current estimates of the scale of the trade in people. The report, which is excellent, goes on to give a conservative estimate of at least 5,000 trafficking victims in the UK, of which just under 1,000 are children. Some estimates state that there are at least 4,000 trafficked women working in the sex industry alone.</p>
	<p pid="a.198.3/23">I am afraid that figures all over Europe are much the same. Nobody knows the extent of human trafficking, as by its nature it is under the radar. Nobody has a clue exactly how widespread it is, although the United Nations calls it the third most serious crime after arms dealing and drug dealing and says that more than 800,000 people a year are trafficked. More people in the world are trafficked in one year than were ever trafficked in the slave trade. The problem is rightly referred to as the new slavery.</p>
	<p pid="a.198.3/24">The Home Affairs Committee expressed disappointment that the United Kingdom Human Trafficking Centre had not made more progress in developing estimates of the scale of the problem, which is one of the main tasks for which it was established. Without reasonable estimates, it is impossible to gauge what support services are needed for victims. Currently, the Government provide long-term funding for just 35 places in safe accommodation for victims, through the POPPY project, on which the Government rely. Although the project does good work, it provides beds, if that is the right phrase, only for women over 18. There are no facilities for children under 18 other than local authorities' provision for children.</p>
	<p pid="a.198.3/25">I am also concerned about the criminalisation of children. The Joint Committee on Human Rights has criticised the Government for refusing to decriminalise children involved in prostitution and for new provisions in the Policing and Crime Bill that will give the police powers to direct a child as young as 10 to leave an area, without necessarily taking into account the child's safety or, more importantly, where the child will go. It is all very well to say that they cannot stay in the area, but where are they supposed to go? The Committee finds it</p>
	<p pid="a.198.3/26" class="indent">&quot;surprising that the Government propose to rely on the criminal justice system to address individual institutional failures within the services available to children and young people. It appears to us to be more appropriate to strengthen the duties and capabilities of children's services to respond to children involved in prostitution, rather than criminalise children for the state's failures.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.198.3/27">Children involved in prostitution are treated not as child abuse victims but as criminals, despite the Government's statement clarifying that involving children in prostitution is a form of child abuse. Will the Government remove the power to prosecute children over the age of 10 for prostitution offences? Children involved in prostitution are victims of child sexual abuse and need protection, not prosecution. Although prosecution numbers are low, the illegal nature of the activity adds to the child's fear of discovery and may act to deter the child further from coming forward to seek help from the authorities.</p>
	<p pid="a.198.3/28">The problem is Europe-wide, because police throughout Europe tend to be unsympathetic, seeing all prostitutes, whatever their age, as prostitutes and not child victims. Many have been trafficked and trapped into brothels. I have seen on the streets of Rome children under the age of 18, some as young as 12, who have been trafficked from Albania. They need help, not criminalisation.</p>
	<p pid="a.198.3/29">The issue was discussed recently during the passage of the Policing and Crime Bill. Baroness Miller emphasised that the right approach was crucial so that children are treated as victims and not criminals. On Second Reading of the Policing and Crime Bill, she said:</p>
	<p pid="a.198.3/30" class="indent">&quot;Nor does the Bill take the right approach to the exploited children in the sex trade. Instead of treating them as the victims they are, it leaves the under-18s to be treated as criminals. That attitude really worries us and will do nothing to help the exploited children in this country or, by example, in the rest of the world. All too often young street-working children in the rest of the world are treated as criminals simply for selling themselves for sex in order eat. We do not want to replicate that problem here in the UK.&quot;&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="lords/2009-06-03.232"><i>Official Report, House of Lords,</i> 3 June 2009; Vol. 711, c. 232</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="a.198.3/31">The Home Office has decided to cease funding the work of the Refugee Council children's panel, whose work concerns age-disputed children. That is odd. All funding to the panel is expected to be terminated in 2010. Why? The UK Border Agency says that the support work provided by the panel is now being done by specialist local authorities. Can the Minister tell us which ones? We have not been able to find any that have taken on such work. The children's panel provides essential support for age-disputed young people, including access to education. I do not know whether the Minister knows this, but there is non-stop dispute about the age of children coming through ports of entry, because if they are under 18, they are treated in one way, and if they are over 18 they are treated in another.</p>
	<p pid="a.198.3/32">I am sure that I have given the Minister enough to chew on, but I will give her a little more in the next four or five minutes. In addition to the removal of funding from such an important organisation as the Refugee Council children's panel, I am puzzled by the removal of funding from the Met. Further cuts have been made within the Met's human trafficking unit, which is being wound down despite the Prime Minister's assurances that more funding, not less, would be given. The Chairman of the Home Affairs Committee, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1674" name="Keith Vaz">the right hon. Member for Leicester, East (Keith Vaz)</phrase>, asked the Prime Minister:</p>
	<p pid="a.198.3/33" class="indent">&quot;Another recommendation from the Home Affairs Committee is on human trafficking, which I know is a concern of his. Will he look at that recommendation, which asks the Government not to cut the funding for the Metropolitan police human trafficking unit? It is very important that we deal with the perpetrators of this very difficult and important crime.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.198.3/34">The Prime Minister replied:</p>
	<p pid="a.198.3/35" class="indent">&quot;I can say to the Chairman of the Select Committee that the unit will have an increased budget; it is not being cut. We are doing whatever we can to support it.&quot;&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2009-05-20.1504"><i>Official Report</i>, 20 May 2009; Vol. 492, c. 1504</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="a.198.3/36">That does not make sense, because the Met tells me that the unit is winding down. The Home Affairs Committee noted the reduction in Government funding for the Met human trafficking unit and recommended that the unit, far from being run down, should be sustained. What is the position with regard to the Met's police work?</p>
	<p pid="a.198.3/37">When will we ratify the Council of Europe convention on the protection of children against sexual exploitation and sexual abuse, which the Government signed more than a year ago? That is directly within the Minister's remit. I can quite understand if she can get out of answering some of the other questions, but she cannot get out of this one. The Government have signed the Council of Europe convention, but have done nothing further.</p>
	<p pid="a.198.3/38">Where do we go? Where does it all leave us? Hopefully, a little nearer to protecting children from sexual exploitation, especially those who have been trafficked, but one must remain somewhat sceptical. Traffickers are far more nimble than the heavy-handed Government bureaucracy that surrounds our efforts. It is right that the professionals working in the field should be better informed and better trained to spot the telltale signs indicating the possibility of child abuse.</p>
	<p pid="a.198.3/39">The European Commission wants us to pass even more legislation to protect children, but as existing legislation has not been implemented effectively, there is not much point in producing even more. That is what the EU does constantly: it persuades its 28 member states to keep passing more and more laws. The trouble is that those laws are not being implemented. We therefore need to focus on what we can do and what we can do well, perhaps starting with the national referral mechanism. I believe that we now have our hands on the levers, but we must pull them to save increasing numbers of children from the indignity and horror of child abuse, often at the hands of traffickers.</p>

	<p pid="a.205.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1881" name="Anthony Steen">the hon. Member for Totnes (Mr. Steen)</phrase> on securing the debate. He has considerable experience and knowledge of trafficking and has used it to great effect.</p>
	<p pid="a.205.0/2">Many significant points have been made and the new Minister has many questions to answer. I welcome her to her new position officially. We have exchanged a few amicable words across the Floor of the House, but have not yet engaged in debate. This debate has highlighted how important it is for the Minister for Children to bring Departments together. We have discussed a number of issues that in the past may have been fobbed off as the responsibility of the Home Office. However, now that we have a Minister for Children, that should not be the case. On that basis, I anticipate that we will receive answers to all our questions.</p>
	<p pid="a.205.0/3">The hon. Gentleman gave some statistics, which are always a great wake-up call. They were not pessimistic enough to suggest that our society is broken, but did show that it has many worrying and upsetting traits. He rightly drew our attention to this country's child abuse statistics, which remind us that child protection should be at the top of every citizen's agenda. We must be aware of what is going on.</p>
	<p pid="a.205.0/4">In my brief contribution, I will look at the wider issue of exploitation, as well as at trafficking. The issue is important in relation to the new Government publication, &quot;Safeguarding Children and Young People from Sexual Exploitation&quot;. I was pleased to work on the parliamentary panel on safeguarding children and young people who run away or go missing from home or care. An enormous number of children&mdash;140,000&mdash; run away each year. Fortunately, most of them return safely, but about 10,000 encounter harm or danger, which can involve sexual exploitation. Homeless children, regular absentees from education, those who are not receiving a suitable education and those in pupil referral units are vulnerable. A large proportion of runaways are children in care. A wide breadth of issues make children vulnerable.</p>

	<p pid="a.205.1/1">Does the hon. Lady agree that the phrase &quot;children in care&quot; is a misnomer? The one thing that they do not get is care. Although many of the workers involved are dedicated and hard-working, there is a horrible trend that children in care either disappear or are abused while in care.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-06-23a.205.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1546" speakername="Annette Brooke" colnum="205"  time="011:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090623/halltext/90623h0005.htm#09062367000455">
	<p pid="a.205.2/1">I accept that those are problems in the care system. There is no doubt that as a society we must do a lot better with children in care. Hard decisions must be taken about whether to leave children in abusive situations or put them into care. We must be sure that we are putting them into an improved situation. Much more must be done on that.</p>
	<p pid="a.205.2/2">Many organisations work with vulnerable children, including the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children, the Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre, Barnardo's, the UK Human Trafficking Centre, ECPAT UK, UNICEF and the Children's Society. As <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2038" name="Bob Spink">the hon. Member for Castle Point (Bob Spink)</phrase> mentioned, there are statutory bodies and those from the voluntary sector.</p>
	<p pid="a.205.2/3">Sexual exploitation is all around us, as was clear from the recent arrest of a nursery worker in Plymouth, which astounded most people. At the weekend, we heard of primary school head teachers who had not done Criminal Records Bureau checks on staff.</p>
	<p pid="a.205.2/4">Some years ago, I took part in the police parliamentary scheme and spent time with what was then called the child protection unit and the vice squad. Sadly, I learned of things that were happening to children that I had not imagined. I was also involved in the Home Secretary's task force for protecting children on the internet until it changed to its new format, which was when CEOP was set up. I commend CEOP's work, but I have been concerned to read about possible shortcomings in funding. We worked hard to set up that organisation, we examined experience in the United States before doing so, and it has strong support across the board. Will the Minister assure us that it will not be constrained in its vital and successful work because of a lack of funding?</p>
	<p pid="a.205.2/5">The issues are prevention, identification of young people at risk, effective intervention at an early stage with avoidance of a crisis response, vital support as we pick up the pieces, prosecutions and convictions. Barnardo's defined sexual exploitation as:</p>
	<p pid="a.205.2/6" class="indent">&quot;Any involvement of a child or a young person below 18 in a sexual activity for which remuneration of cash or in kind is given to the child or young person or a third party or person. The perpetrator will have power over the child by virtue of one or more of the following: age, emotional maturity, gender, physical strength and intellect&quot;,</p>
	<p pid="a.205.2/7">and perhaps if a child is lost in a strange country. Barnardo's operates on the principle that no child can consent to their own abuse, so children and young people under 18 who are abused by sexual exploitation are victims. An important point was raised about criminalisation of victims, and I hope that the Minister will reply to that. Adults involved in sexual exploitation are child abusers.</p>
	<p pid="a.205.2/8">As the hon. Member for Totnes said, Government figures suggest that around 330 children and young people are trafficked in the UK each year, although that is likely to be an underestimate. Problems continue to arise from the identification of child victims, which remains very low. We must make it a priority to increase identification. Authorities have not developed adequate procedures and guidelines to improve detection, and there is a general lack of awareness about child trafficking and its indicators among practitioners who come into daily contact with victims from abroad.</p>
	<p pid="a.205.2/9">Some non-governmental organisations and other campaigners are worried that the immigration age assessment dispute process is used to divert young people into the adult system rather than to safeguard them. That is important, because there is much anecdotal evidence and many examples of disputes when someone is said to be under 18 but the judgment is swayed on the side of them being over 18. I do not know what criteria are used, but the issue is important because of what subsequently happens to those children and young people.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-06-23a.207.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1881" speakername="Anthony Steen" colnum="207"  time="011:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090623/halltext/90623h0006.htm#09062367000456">
	<p pid="a.207.0/1">Swaying on the side of a child being over 18 means that they are sent back, without regard to what will happen to them when they get back. Often, they are trafficked again. The advantage for someone under 18 is that they should be cared for, but the Border Agency is not the right agency to deal with them.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-06-23a.207.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1546" speakername="Annette Brooke" colnum="207"  time="011:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090623/halltext/90623h0006.htm#09062367000457">
	<p pid="a.207.1/1">The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right. I have met adult females who have been returned to their country and it was the most distressing situation that I can ever recall. They were put into a sanctuary for a short time, but so much support was needed that it was impossible to deliver it, because of the state that those young ladies were in&mdash;and they were young. I would not have known if they were all over 18.</p>
	<p pid="a.207.1/2">Practitioners have stressed the need for child protection concerns to override concerns about the age or immigration status of children and young people who have been trafficked into the UK from abroad. Safeguarding the child must be paramount. Children trafficked from abroad might not receive the same rights and treatment as children born in the UK, even though they are entitled to by law. Multi-agency work between the UK Border Agency, police and children's services at the point of arrival, focused on securing the safety of the child, is essential in efforts to engage with the child and to prevent them from being abducted or going missing.</p>
	<p pid="a.207.1/3">Good practice is to provide the child with a child protection key worker, who is supported through multi-agency work with police involvement, and accommodation in a place of safety, preferably in supported and supervised foster care. As an aside, I just mention that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1944" name="Tim Loughton">the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham (Tim Loughton)</phrase> and I have talked at great length about the need to register private foster carers. One concern that we all have is that if children enter this country and go into unregulated private foster care, none of us knows what their fate might be. I think that we both hope that the new Minister will look on our request in that area rather more favourably.</p>
	<p pid="a.207.1/4">Safeguarding procedures are clearly not systematically followed for trafficked children. Immigration issues have generally taken priority. As there is inadequate safeguarding, high numbers of young people go missing. That is the consequence of inappropriate placement, young people not being placed safely and inadequate training of carers in trafficking issues. Poor risk assessment means that children are often defined as trafficked only in retrospect, providing little opportunity for police investigation or for recovery of the child. A patchy police response and lack of clarity about a co-ordinated working group have resulted in a national deficit of support services for children who may have been trafficked.</p>
	<p pid="a.207.1/5">Many local authorities feel inadequately resourced to meet the additional care needs that those children present. Although it is the responsibility of local authorities, there is currently a lack of safe and appropriate accommodation for trafficked children, as the hon. Member for Totnes mentioned. There are very few specialised services for trafficked children. The trafficking of children and young people is child abuse. Therefore I think that the responsibility for protecting children in the UK rests with the local safeguarding children boards, but clearly practice there must improve.</p>
	<p pid="a.207.1/6">Experience brings improved practice, and practitioners' awareness of the indicators of trafficking is improved through their experience of working with cases. As practitioners deal with cases and face the problems presented, they begin to recognise indicators and emerging patterns. Lessons can be learned by referring to the practitioners engaged in the work and building those lessons into initiatives. We often refer to the need to see good practice spread.</p>
	<p pid="a.207.1/7">The important point is that every child matters, including trafficked children and other very vulnerable children, and everyone should be working towards achieving for every child the five outcomes specified in the Every Child Matters programme.</p>
	<p pid="a.207.1/8">The NSPCC report &quot;Breaking the wall of silence&quot; focuses on the need for improved and more structured practices between agencies: police, health, social services and immigration. The role of LSCBs in facilitating multidisciplinary agencies must be strengthened and good practice learned. The overriding feature is that the safety and welfare of trafficked children should come above their immigration status.</p>
	<p pid="a.207.1/9">At the time of a 2007 report, no national data were collected by the Department for Children, Schools and Families on runaway and missing children. Around the time of the report, a welcome announcement was made that children missing from home and care would be included as a national framework performance indicator for local authorities. That shows that raising issues continually at least gets them on the radar, but I wonder whether that is enough.</p>
	<p pid="a.207.1/10">In September 2001, we needed a national plan to safeguard children from commercial and sexual exploitation. Have we made progress over time? Certainly a new report is needed in respect of changes in society, the growth of use of the internet, as has been said, and new structures in local authorities, but we have had so much guidance and so many documents. Do they really make a difference?</p>
	<p pid="a.207.1/11">I have to confess that I have only skimmed at high speed through the Government's guidance. There were bits that I related to and thought were excellent&mdash;for example,</p>
	<p pid="a.207.1/12" class="indent">&quot;every LSCB should assume that sexual exploitation occurs within its area unless there is clear evidence to the contrary.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.207.1/13">That is an excellent starting point. I was recently at a conference about trafficking in Dorset. The local Soroptimists were highlighting the purple teardrop campaign, and there was amazement that there might be trafficked women in Dorset. We are so unaware of what is going on, and that is why it is important that we start with that premise.</p>
	<p pid="a.207.1/14">The report states that LSCBs should</p>
	<p pid="a.207.1/15" class="indent">&quot;put in place systems to monitor prevalence and responses to child sexual exploitation&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.207.1/16">What monitoring will the Department do as a consequence of the guidance being put in place? We need a report on progress right across the board, because time is ticking on. Just producing papers and books of guidance year after year is not enough. This must not be just a paper exercise. I share the hon. Gentleman's concerns about cuts in funding to some important organisations, and I hope that the Minister will address that point.</p>
	<p pid="a.207.1/17">Finally, something that I have been involved with throughout my time in Parliament is a campaign for making therapeutic treatment available to all children who have been abused. Provision is patchy across the country. As much as we are doing to safeguard children, we will not stamp out child abuse unless we provide therapeutic treatment, which is vital to breaking the cycle. Sadly, many abused children go on to exploit others in their adult life.</p>

	<p pid="a.209.0/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1881" name="Anthony Steen">the Member for Totnes (Mr. Steen)</phrase>, who has enormous expertise in this area and has campaigned on it for many years. It is unfortunate that there are not more hon. Members here today, because this important subject affects all our constituencies. I know that there are trafficked women in Worthing in my constituency, and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1546" name="Annette Brooke">the hon. Member for Mid-Dorset and North Poole (Annette Brooke)</phrase> admitted that there are some in Dorset. Exploitation happens everywhere, and often in the most unexpected places.</p>
	<p pid="a.209.0/2">I welcome the Minister, who is new to the children's brief. This is an example of where joined-up thinking and action under the remit of the Department for Children, Schools and Families is absolutely key. It needs to work with all kinds of other agencies and colleagues at the Home Office and elsewhere to bring joined-up solutions to this ongoing and, perhaps, worsening problem.</p>
	<p pid="a.209.0/3">My hon. Friend the Member for Totnes gave a comprehensive tour d'horizon of sexual exploitation of children in all kinds of areas, ending with trafficking, on which he has expertise. I recognise some of the domestic problems in broken families to which he alluded. The hon. Member for Mid-Dorset and North Poole mentioned the generational effect: children who have been sexually abused go on to have children who may suffer the same fate. That kind of vicious circle often exists.</p>
	<p pid="a.209.0/4">The very alarming figures that my hon. Friend gave&mdash;that one in six children will experience sexual abuse&mdash;provide a serious wake-up call to everyone in our country. A third of all rapes are of children under the age of 16. We often demonise children as being responsible for crime, but we forget that they are the major victims of so much crime&mdash;rape being one of the more horrendous ones.</p>
	<p pid="a.209.0/5">My hon. Friend made a good comparison when he described the trafficking of children as being the new slave trade. He also made a good point about children being victims: they should not be criminalised for being forced into prostitution at sensitive young ages. We need better awareness and more specialist training&mdash;particularly among some of our professional staff, such as social workers. The General Social Care Council has made recommendations about how better to train social workers who work in child protection. Such social workers work with children at risk from sexual exploitation or from being trafficked and ending up in sexual exploitation in this country, as well as with those who are subject to child abuse.</p>
	<p pid="a.209.0/6">My hon. Friend will know&mdash;because his wife was part of the commission on social workers, which I chaired on behalf of the Conservative party&mdash;that we have produced two reports since 2007, in which we discuss the need to make sure that we have a properly trained, motivated, reinvigorated and resourced social worker work force. Social workers work in very difficult, challenging and depressing areas&mdash;my hon. Friend has touched on several of those&mdash;and it is important that the responsibilities in relation to those are joined up. After baby P, we have head a lot about child abuse at the hands of parents or carers. The figures are alarming: perhaps upwards of three children a week die as a result of abuse or neglect in the home. In addition, 389 young people have gone missing from care since 2000, which is probably a woeful underestimate of the actual figure. My hon. Friend referred to some cases in relation to that.</p>
	<p pid="a.209.0/7">I shall refer to three areas: first, child abuse; secondly, abuse using the internet&mdash;what has been referred to as networked paedophiles; and thirdly, the subject of trafficking, which formed the major thrust of my hon. Friend's comments. We have heard the ghastly figures about child abuse and killings, but we need to appreciate that not enough people have been prosecuted: too many people have proceedings taken against them, but get off.</p>
	<p pid="a.209.0/8">Let us consider some of the figures on the sexual assault of a male child aged under 13. In 2004, only 19 cases were brought under that charge, of which only four people were found guilty. That is a woefully low conviction rate. Those figures had improved. For example, in 2007, the figure had gone up to 81 cases proceeded with, among which half&mdash;41&mdash;had a verdict of guilty. In 2004, 45 proceedings were brought for rape or attempted rape of a child aged under 13, with only three successful convictions. Again, those figures have gone up&mdash;in 2007, the number was 142. We are getting better at detecting some such cases&mdash;perhaps because more people have come forward to report such crimes, which is progress&mdash;but still only 69 were found guilty, which is just over a third. The figures are similar for sexual assault of a female child aged under 13: back in 2004, proceedings were brought against 128 people, but only 29 were convicted. That figure had risen to 448 proceedings, of which 246 ended in a conviction&mdash;rather better progress.</p>
	<p pid="a.209.0/9">Too many people are carrying on such activities under the radar and are not being detected. When they are detected, it is difficult to make charges stick. Too many of the perpetrators of such crimes are still on the loose and getting away with it&mdash;whether it be the abuse or, ultimately, the death of a child. There were serious flaws in the law about joint enterprise, although I am glad to say that the Government addressed them some years ago after a lot of campaigning by many hon. Members on both sides. As a result, both parents can now be prosecuted under the law on joint enterprise when it cannot be proved which parent struck the fatal blow. We have a long way to go to ensure that people are brought to justice and receive appropriate justice for the severity of their crimes.</p>
	<p pid="a.209.0/10">The second issue that I want to touch on is that of sexual images on the internet and the obvious exploitation that that inevitably involves&mdash;every image that ends up on the internet does so because a child has been exploited somewhere down the line, somewhere in a foreign country, in some hidden room. A while ago, I spent a depressing afternoon in the specialist unit at Scotland Yard, speaking to those whose highly depressing job it is to go through literally millions of images and films on seized hard drives. What struck me was how ingenious those who view the images are. Jim Gamble, the chief executive of the child exploitation and online protection centre, has referred to them as networked paedophiles. They are enormously clever at being one step ahead of the authorities. They use technology ingeniously to carry on their sinister activities of swapping, accessing and subscribing to images of very young children and babies in highly distressing situations. They do that as if they were swapping cigarette cards or souvenirs. The lengths to which some people will go to secure such ghastly images, which represent the exploitation of young, vulnerable children at its worst, are extraordinary.</p>
	<p pid="a.209.0/11">I have concerns about funding, which my hon. Friend also mentioned. It has been reported that thousands of cases of children who are portrayed in pornographic pictures and are at risk of abuse are not being investigated properly because of a cash crisis. CEOP is hailed as one of the leading child protection agencies in the world, but despite its excellent work, it faces something of a funding crisis. It had a three-year funding arrangement with Visa and the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children, which are to be congratulated on their support, and the Home Office has also contributed some money. None the less, the work load is so enormous that the funds are just not sufficient.</p>
	<p pid="a.209.0/12">When I visited my sexual offences unit in Sussex, I was told that there was a limit on its funding. The unit needs a lot of resources just to get the appropriate equipment&mdash;as I said, the people involved in these crimes are very clever at hiding images. Then, however, it needs people who are properly trained and able to cope with that equipment.</p>
	<p pid="a.209.0/13">The important point is that we will never prevent indecent images from being posted on the internet. One of the downsides of the internet is that we cannot closely regulate what happens on it. As we know, things can happen well beyond the geographical boundaries of the United Kingdom. The challenge is to cut off the tentacles, like those of an octopus, and to make it as difficult as possible for people to put images on the internet, to profit from them and to access them.</p>
	<p pid="a.209.0/14">That is why the European Financial Coalition has been important. The EFC is an assembly of various firms&mdash;particularly those involved in finance&mdash;including MasterCard, Microsoft, PayPal, Visa Europe, and Allen and Overy. Using those various financial firms, CEOP can cut off some of the tentacles and make it more difficult for the money to flow where people are trying to gain commercial advantage from exploiting images.</p>
	<p pid="a.209.0/15">Things have improved. As Jim Gamble has said,</p>
	<p pid="a.209.0/16" class="indent">&quot;Things have changed radically since the days of Operation Ore. Individual organisations, members of the financial sector and law enforcement agencies have worked hard to undermine the activities of those who sold images of child abuse as commodities. As a result, the organised crime element has diminished year on year as the risk increased and the profit reduced.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.209.0/17">However, it is still going on far too much.</p>

	<p pid="a.211.0/1">On internet images, the idea that we need to cut off the tentacles is all well and good, but this is a worldwide issue. If they are cut off here, they must also be cut off in Vietnam. Does the hon. Gentleman agree that it is no good Britain being jolly good at preventing traffickers and children from coming into this country when there is no Europe-wide and worldwide effort? It is no good saying that we are a wonderful island that does not let any traffickers in if they just go to Spain or Holland instead. Does he agree that we need a Europe-wide approach?</p>

	<p pid="a.212.0/1">No, my hon. Friend was right earlier when he said that we need a worldwide approach. That is why I said that even if we are good at finding the people who are promoting this stuff and posting it on the internet in this country, a lot of such activity is happening in Alaska, Florida, Russia and assorted Pacific islands that are not properly regulated. That is why I refer to the problem as an octopus. We can never clamp down on it altogether because the internet has become such a global phenomenon that it will not disappear overnight.</p>
	<p pid="a.212.0/2">[Mr. Eric Illsley <i>in the Chair</i>]</p>
	<p pid="a.212.0/3">We must make it as difficult as possible for the perpetrators to access the practical means of placing images, accessing them and profiting from them. There has been some success in that. However, we will be successful only if the UK authorities co-operate with European authorities, which is why I mentioned the EFC, and with authorities overseas, not least in America. To a certain extent, Americans have a constitutional right to post obscene images on the internet, and that causes a serious problem. That is why some states have not proceeded against people as forcefully as they might have.</p>
	<p pid="a.212.0/4">I will end on the subject of trafficking. I know the problem well because Gatwick airport is in my Worthing constituency and in West Sussex local authority. Some years ago, I led a debate in this Chamber on the problem of girls being trafficked from western Africa, mostly from Nigeria and Sierra Leone. They were coming to Gatwick airport as unaccompanied asylum seekers under dubious and frightening circumstances. They had been taken from their parents, many of whom had been offered money. In some cases, the girls had been threatened with voodoo curses in frightening circumstances.</p>
	<p pid="a.212.0/5">When the girls turned up at Gatwick airport, they were taken into the care of West Sussex social services and were placed in foster care, which turned out not to be secure enough. Quite often, the pimps would appear in the middle of the night and abduct the girls under the threat that, if they did not comply, a voodoo curse would come down on them or that something terrible would happen to their parents. They would then be trafficked across the channel. Many ended up in northern Italy as prostitutes in places such as Milan. There was a television documentary on the issue. There was a concerted co-ordination of children's services and immigration authorities to clamp down on the problem. To an extent, it has worked, but I fear that it has merely shifted the problem to other places.</p>
	<p pid="a.212.0/6">Trafficking is an enormous problem. As my hon. Friend said, it is big business. The United Nations estimates that child trafficking generates $7 billion to $10 billion annually. Human trafficking is estimated to generate upwards of $30 billion annually. It is cited as the second most lucrative crime after the drugs trade. I think that it has leapfrogged the arms trade. Of all trafficking victims, 30 per cent. are below the age of 18. Child trafficking is increasing dramatically with between 1.2 million and 2 million children being trafficked each year. It is estimated that more than 10 million children are sexually exploited each year. That is a huge problem.</p>
	<p pid="a.212.0/7">I will conclude with the example of the World cup and sporting events, which the Minister may wish to comment on. I am sure that she is or soon will be involved in that area of inquiry. There is good evidence that child trafficking for the sex trade increases with international sporting events. In 2008, the sex trade in Switzerland increased enormously; it has been estimated that up to 3,000 women were sold into the sex trade and smuggled into the country. Of course the World cup next year will be in South Africa, where an estimated 30,000 children are enslaved in prostitution, many of them refugees from Zimbabwe. They come across a porous border, where a substantial part of the population of Zimbabwe live as refugees on very little money, finding a crust where they can. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2038" name="Bob Spink">The hon. Member for Castle Point (Bob Spink)</phrase> and I were in Mozambique two years ago, where we saw the same thing happening because of the situation in that part of Africa. There were huge numbers of refugees, and children were subjected to horrible exploitation.</p>
	<p pid="a.212.0/8">South Africa does not have comprehensive legislation to deal with human trafficking, and last year the US Department of State put South Africa on the tier 2 watch list for the fourth consecutive year, because of its failure to meet the minimum standards for eliminating trafficking, with respect to prosecutions and so on. There exists a powerful lobby representing a minority of South Africans pushing for the decriminalisation of prostitution before 2010. That is very worrying, and in the interest of joined-up working and recognising that the trade is international, I am sure that the Minister, working with her colleagues in the Department for Culture, Media and Sport and the Home Office, will want to liaise with authorities in the sporting world and South Africa, to ensure that the disasters that happened in Switzerland will not be repeated in South Africa on what could, I fear, be a much bigger scale.</p>
	<p pid="a.212.0/9">There are big challenges ahead. The hon. Member for Mid-Dorset and North Poole mentioned private fostering. We shall continue to mention private fostering. I have mentioned it with reference to every measure on which I have led for the Opposition since the Adoption and Children Act 2002, and I still fail to see why the Government do not get it. Private fostering is in too many cases a cover for the exploitation of children who have been trafficked, who end up being abused sexually or in other ways. That has been found in several high-profile cases. I hope that the new Minister will take a fresh look at why private fostering has not been dealt with. A proper registration scheme could be introduced to deal with the situation effectively.</p>
	<p pid="a.212.0/10">We need to work more closely with the home countries of many of the children, not least in west Africa. We should work with children's services departments there to make sure that children do not leave in the hope of a better life or in fear of worse things happening to them and that circumstances will be suitable to enable them to stay with their families and be looked after properly. That is why international co-operation between social services and children's services is crucial.</p>
	<p pid="a.212.0/11">Barnardo's and other voluntary agencies do excellent work. Barnardo's is working on a report on the costs of sexual exploitation. It will expose the high costs to society of that exploitation and the serious consequences for the children and young people who are its victims.</p>
	<p pid="a.212.0/12">Recently, the Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1887" name="Alan Campbell">the hon. Member for Tynemouth (Mr. Campbell)</phrase> rightly said:</p>
	<p pid="a.212.0/13" class="indent">&quot;We remain committed to tackling this appalling crime by making the UK a hostile environment for traffickers, disrupting their organisations and their activities and bringing as many as possible to justice.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.212.0/14">I think that we would all say &quot;Hear, hear&quot; to that. I hope that the new Minister will be resolute in her intentions and ambitions to work with all the other agencies, countries and Departments that can tackle head on the cancer of the sexual exploitation and trafficking of vulnerable children.</p>

	<p pid="a.214.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1881" name="Anthony Steen">the hon. Member for Totnes (Mr. Steen)</phrase> on securing the debate. I did not agree with the beginning of his contribution, when he painted a picture of despair generally for children in British society. However, rather than engage with him on that&mdash;I am sure that I shall have future opportunities to do so&mdash;I want to go to the heart of his contribution and those made by the hon. Members for Mid-Dorset and North Poole (Annette Brooke) and for East Worthing and Shoreham (Tim Loughton). It is clear that the issues transcend the normal political banter and debate that often characterise much of our proceedings.</p>
	<p pid="a.214.0/2">As the hon. Member for Totnes said, sexual exploitation of children is, regrettably, not new, and its development into a global phenomenon with trafficking is a worrying extension. As the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham said, we are becoming much better at identification, although there is still a long way to go in connecting that with prosecution.</p>
	<p pid="a.214.0/3">Many important points have been made, and I am grateful to the hon. Member for Mid-Dorset and North Poole for acknowledging the importance of the new guidance and the presumption requirement in that guidance. Partnership and appropriately trained staff, working together across all the boundaries, are crucial to responding to the challenge.</p>
	<p pid="a.214.0/4">The hon. Member for Totnes is a tireless campaigner against the sexual exploitation and trafficking of children, and has enormous expertise in and understanding of the matter. As a new Minister in this area, I listened carefully to the passion with which he addressed it. I am sure that he agrees that the Government have tried to make progress by recognising that the first priority must be to keep all children in this country safe.</p>
	<p pid="a.214.0/5">Safeguarding the needs of exploited children is vital, but that requires us to ensure, as the hon. Gentleman rightly said, that agencies work together to protect them. He knows that the Government have set out how that should happen in guidance, &quot;Working Together to Safeguard Children&quot;, to which he referred, and in supplementary guidance, &quot;Safeguarding Children and Young People from Sexual Exploitation&quot;, which was published this month and builds on that work. As the hon. Member for Mid-Dorset and North Poole said, it is intended that the guidance will help local agencies to ensure that they work together on the matters addressed by the hon. Gentleman and to develop local prevention strategies, to identify vulnerable young people who may be at risk of sexual exploitation, to take action to safeguard children who may be sexually exploited and to take action against anyone who is intent on abusing young people.</p>
	<p pid="a.214.0/6">The hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham touched on the challenging dimension of the internet: communication and grooming and the circulation for profit or otherwise of images. Collecting evidence to ensure prosecution is challenging, and I agree that, whenever possible, we need a global response, but cutting off tentacles whenever we can must be an important part of our strategy. The guidance ensures that local authorities and the police have a statutory duty to work with local safeguarding children's boards, practitioners and others working with young people. That is precisely the point that the hon. Member for Totnes was making. It is about bringing together that expertise, so that, with the added value, we can take forward the tasks that have been identified. From everything that the Government have undertaken, it is clear that they believe that the exploitation of children should not be regarded as a criminal act by the children or young people. They are the victims of the crime and not the perpetrators.</p>
	<p pid="a.214.0/7">I listened very carefully to the point that the hon. Gentleman and others made about the age of 10. I have examined the Government's response on that matter with regard to the importance of maintaining the current law and the necessity of providing, in exceptional circumstances, police intervention to protect the child. I do not have an answer right now, and I do not think that he does either. He outlined his objective, but we need to define how, practically, we can deliver it. I am more than happy to meet him to explore the true challenges in getting that balance right. We do not disagree about the objective, but there are differing expert views on the best way to deliver it.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-06-23a.215.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1881" speakername="Anthony Steen" colnum="215"  time="012:09:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090623/halltext/90623h0007.htm#09062367000462">
	<p pid="a.215.0/1">I want to leave the Minister with this thought. The young people who are found running cannabis factories all over Britain&mdash;they are often and mostly from Vietnam&mdash;are charged with criminal offences even though they are usually children. That is where the problem started, and it has continued that way. We need to examine the work of the Crown Prosecution Service, because as long as it goes on prosecuting children for an offence of which they are victims rather than perpetrators, the problem will not go away. I am very happy to engage in dialogue with the Minister, and I have lots of examples to give to her.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-06-23a.215.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1457" speakername="Dawn Primarolo" colnum="215"  time="012:09:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090623/halltext/90623h0007.htm#09062367000463">
	<p pid="a.215.1/1">We would all agree that this challenge will not go away and that it is not a simple problem for which there are simple answers. Since 1997, the Government have been determined to address the very complex challenges of sexual exploitation. We must consider what we do when such challenges come from within a family or are posed by a known family friend or associate. Social workers have to strike a very delicate balance between keeping children with their families, or, as the hon. Gentleman says, taking them into care. What are the protections there? The problem is a global evil. He and other hon. Members are right when they say that we need a much wider response. It is important that we correctly balance the mechanisms in the UK. We must recognise that we still have a long way to go. I will not stand here and say that the problem is all sorted, because, patently, it is not. Complex personal and interpersonal relationships exist within families. Moreover, we must consider why and how a young child comes to be trafficked to the UK and what we should do then.</p>
	<p pid="a.215.1/2">Early identification is key to protecting vulnerable children. As the hon. Gentleman and others said, the Department must work closely across Government and with local government and those responsible for delivering the services to develop clear help and support to the front-line staff who can take the work forward. The hon. Gentleman said that the national referral mechanism enables us not only to do that but to collect the important information that is necessary.</p>
	<p pid="a.215.1/3">The hon. Gentleman mentioned foster carers and the need for diversity. I also heard what the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham said about private foster care, but I shall take that away with me. Local authorities are required to ensure that they have the necessary number of carers, including from minority ethnic groups, to meet the local need.</p>
	<p pid="a.215.1/4">The hon. Member for Totnes touched on Heathrow and the report in <i>The</i><i>Guardian</i>&mdash;that was truly worrying, but it is now being investigated&mdash;but Hillingdon council, for example, is trying very hard to recruit foster parents from its Chinese community, for precisely the reasons that he mentioned.</p>
	<p pid="a.215.1/5">The hon. Gentleman and the hon. Member for Mid-Dorset and North Poole spoke about the removal of children from the UK. I am sure that they know already that no child can be removed from the country until they reach the age of 18, when a decision will be taken on their asylum. However, I take the hon. Gentleman's point about the careful consideration of young people's needs when they reach the age of 18. He also mentioned the question of age determination and the problems of documentation being destroyed and of people trying to get young people into the country. Ultimately, children's services child protection officers must make the sometimes very difficult decision about a child's age.</p>
	<p pid="a.215.1/6">What happens to those young children is crucial. When they enter this country, they must feel that they are in a safe, secure and protected environment. That must be achieved as quickly as possible, for all the reasons that the hon. Gentleman mentioned&mdash;the pressure to run away from protection, for instance. They will need intensive, one-to-one support and perhaps translation services. We must also work to ensure that they&mdash;and their families back in their original homes&mdash;are protected. He is right about that. We must strike a difficult balance between not locking them up&mdash;that will hardly build up the trust and feelings of safety required to make progress&mdash;and protecting them from falling prey to the people who trafficked them.</p>
	<p pid="a.215.1/7">The hon. Gentleman's point about guardians ad litem has been made before, but the case remains to be made for why such guardians would make a difference, given that social work and key personnel advisers are already in place to support these young people.</p>
	<p pid="a.215.1/8">The hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham referred to Gatwick, which, along with Heathrow, is an example of the type of intensive work that we are trying to draw together. Considerable progress has been made over the past 12 months, but much remains to be done. As far as we can tell, from what we have seen over the past 12 months, including the increasing amount of data collected through the referral mechanism, very few young people have disappeared from care. However, we are trying, with all our energies, to find those who have disappeared. I am sure that hon. Members will not pretend for a minute that, for whatever reason, no young people will run away from the place of safety that we feel would serve their best interests, but we must ensure that it is a rare occurrence.</p>
	<p pid="a.215.1/9">The question of trafficked young people must be set in the context of the wider agenda. We must be more prepared to discuss the domestic violence, sexual abuse and exploitation that we see across society. As I told the hon. Member for Totnes, I do not agree with the picture of despair that he paints, but I appreciate people's reluctance to talk about relationships and appropriate behaviours and how we should deal with the problem.</p>
	<p pid="a.215.1/10">I had the privilege yesterday of meeting some young men and women from Barnardo's, who had been brought to the House to discuss with me what it was like for them as children to be part of a family where there was domestic violence and abuse. We also spoke about what we needed to do, as well as working with young children intensively, to ensure better relationships; we said that education should to give them a better and frank understanding of what is wrong or inappropriate behaviour. Indeed, as the hon. Gentleman said, great steps have been made by the Government in arranging sexual assault referral centres and the work now being done on the training of personnel.</p>
	<p pid="a.215.1/11">The hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham raised the question of the trafficking that can result from large international events and the particular vulnerabilities in South Africa, as we move towards the World cup. He will be aware of this, so I shall not recite it, but we protect those of our citizens who go elsewhere. Trafficking is still an offence here, whether or not it is an offence in the country where it is committed, and we will prosecute on the evidence.</p>
	<p pid="a.215.1/12">The hon. Gentleman raised another important point, and I want to give him a modicum of reassurance. It is important at all such events&mdash;the World cup is a classic example&mdash;that Governments speak to one another about our experience and the types of support that we offer, to ensure that young people in particular, but also women in general, are protected. We should not leave unchallenged the clear profit that traffickers seek to make at such events. I shall certainly continue to take that forward.</p>
	<p pid="a.215.1/13">This has been an important debate, and as the new Minister, I am grateful to the hon. Member for Totnes; it is an extremely quick way of getting a full idea of the breadth of issues on the subject. I absolutely take the point made by the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham about the challenge of working across government on the matter. I say to him and to the hon. Member for Mid-Dorset and North Poole that this is not an issue that I shall have to deal with on my own. I will of course be accountable for Government action, but Ministers working together will set the correct standard of debate in this country and help us to achieve the objectives that the hon. Member for Totnes seeks.</p>
	<p pid="a.215.1/14">Child exploitation and sexual abuse are always unacceptable. We will pursue the issue. We will protect those children. We will prosecute whenever we can. We will step up to the plate and do our duty, seeking a global response to the trafficking of young children and women around the world&mdash;and to those who seek to make a profit from them.</p>

	Pembrokeshire (Royal Mail Database)

	<p pid="a.218.1/1">I am grateful that I have secured this short debate on a subject that has fallen on my desk regularly in the past five years: Royal Mail's ongoing refusal to recognise the county of Pembrokeshire in its postcode address file, which is the key database that underpins the national postal system. Some of my constituents are merely puzzled about why their county name appears incorrectly on much of the mail coming through their letterboxes, while others find that quite offensive. In Pembrokeshire, there is a widespread and deep attachment to the county's name, history and culture, which is becoming quite rare in modern Britain. Pembrokeshire is so much more than a place name; it carries with it a particular identity and a wonderful heritage. For local people to continue to receive mail that is incorrectly marked with the county name Dyfed&mdash;the old county name, which disappeared 13 years ago&mdash;is both annoying and demeaning.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-06-23a.218.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1489" speakername="Mark Williams" colnum="218"  time="012:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090623/halltext/90623h0008.htm#09062367000465">
	<p pid="a.218.2/1">I assure the hon. Gentleman that the concerns he is expressing on behalf of the people of Preseli Pembrokeshire are shared by my constituents north of the River Dyfi in Ceredigion. It is not north or west Dyfed, or part of north-west Dyfed, but Ceredigion. My constituents cannot believe that we are still in the same situation 13 years after the end of Dyfed, when people made a conscious decision to call the area Ceredigion.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-06-23a.218.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1768" speakername="Stephen Crabb" colnum="218"  time="012:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090623/halltext/90623h0008.htm#09062367000466">
	<p pid="a.218.3/1">The hon. Gentleman fights like a tiger for his constituency and makes his point very well. Not only Pembrokeshire is affected. Two other old counties&mdash;Carmarthenshire and Cardiganshire, which is now Ceredigion&mdash;were affected by the abolition of Dyfed and suffer because of the usage of the old county name on the Royal Mail database.</p>
	<p pid="a.218.3/2">Other people in my constituency, especially those who run small businesses, find that the incorrect Royal Mail database creates practical problems and gets in the way of effective listing and marketing. I have corresponded about that matter with the chief executive of Royal Mail and Ministers, unfortunately without making much progress. The purpose of the debate is to find out whether we can, at long last, achieve a solution, and whether I can convince the Minister to recognise the strength of feeling in Pembrokeshire and persuade him to take up the matter more directly with Royal Mail so that it can be resolved once and for all. I recognise that this is by no means the most important or pressing issue facing Royal Mail in 2009, but the fact that it maintains an incorrect, out-of-date database should be a cause of embarrassment and ought to be remedied.</p>
	<p pid="a.218.3/3">It is tempting to think that the issue goes back only 13 years to 1996, when the old administrative county of Dyfed, which covered a large area of west Wales comprising Carmarthenshire, Cardiganshire and Pembrokeshire, disappeared as an entity. The Local Government (Wales) Act 1994 abolished Dyfed as a local authority and it became a so-called preserved county for the ceremonial purposes of lieutenancy and shrievalty. Statutes such as the Sheriffs Act 1887 and the Defence Act 1842 were duly amended to take account of the preserved county status, but for administrative, political and many other purposes, Dyfed ceased to have any meaning whatever. The restoration of the county of Pembrokeshire as a unitary local authority in 1996 was a proud moment for the people of the county. It followed many years of campaigning by local people who never really felt comfortable as part of Dyfed.</p>
	<p pid="a.218.3/4">The key complaint is that since 1996 and the great reorganisation of local government, Royal Mail has continued to maintain a database that uses Dyfed as the county name for postcodes associated with the old county. However, the issue goes back 35 years to the creation of Dyfed by the Local Government Act 1972. A great many people who were active on the issue at that time understood that the creation of Dyfed as a local authority area should have no real impact on the addresses used in the old three counties' areas that were amalgamated by the reorganisation. At the time, many were led to believe that just as Middlesex would continue to be used by Royal Mail long after the London Government Act 1963 abolished the administrative county of Middlesex, Pembrokeshire would be retained for postal address purposes, even after it was subsumed within the new county of Dyfed under the 1972 Act.</p>
	<p pid="a.218.3/5">At this point, I should pay tribute to the work of Councillor Peter Stock, an independent Pembrokeshire county councillor and a former mayor of my hometown of Haverfordwest&mdash;the county town of Pembrokeshire&mdash;who has worked harder on this issue than anyone I know. He has fought tirelessly for his community&mdash;not just for Pembrokeshire's symbols and identity, but for real public services, which have taken a hammering over the decades as the juggernaut of Government centralisation has rolled through west Wales. Councillor Stock is typical of many people in Pembrokeshire who have a huge affection and loyalty for our county.</p>
	<p pid="a.218.3/6">The county of Pembrokeshire is an ancient one. It was first formed as a territorial entity in 1138 and its historical significance stretches back almost 900 years. It is home to 200 miles of the UK's most spectacular coastline, which is now part of the Pembrokeshire Coast national park. It is the birthplace of the most important royal dynasty that this country has enjoyed&mdash;the turbulent but talented family of the Tudors, who transformed this nation. Henry Tudor, who later became Henry VII, was born in Pembroke castle in January 1457.</p>
	<p pid="a.218.3/7">It might interest the Minister to know that Pembrokeshire has its own flag: the gold cross of St. David on a blue background with the Tudor rose at its centre. St. David was a hugely important figure in the early Welsh and English Church and established the outstandingly beautiful city and cathedral that now bear his name in north-west Pembrokeshire.</p>
	<p pid="a.218.3/8">Pembrokeshire's history, culture, symbols and beauty mean that Pembrokeshire people are rightly proud of their county&mdash;it is unique. However, on <phrase class="date" code="1974-04-01">1 April 1974</phrase>, it was amalgamated, along with Cardiganshire and Carmarthenshire, into the newly created super-county of Dyfed, where it remained until 1996, when Dyfed was broken up into three counties.</p>
	<p pid="a.218.3/9">Thirteen years later, Royal Mail has still not caught up. The postcode address file still bears no mention of Pembrokeshire or, for that matter, of Cardiganshire&mdash;Ceredigion as it is now known&mdash;and Carmarthenshire. Instead, a quick search of the database shows that, according to Royal Mail, Dyfed is still the administrative county, more then 13 years after the change.</p>
	<p pid="a.218.3/10">Since I was elected in 2005, numerous constituents and representatives of local businesses have raised this issue time and time again. What is involved is not just the important issue of civic pride, which we should not underestimate, but the practical day-to-day consequences for many of my constituents, who face difficulty in getting their addresses properly recognised.</p>
	<p pid="a.218.3/11">The postcode address file is the most widely used and widely available source of all UK addresses. It is used in the public and private sectors. It is widely used as a tool for geographical referencing. It is the formal database on which Google mapping is based. It is a crucial device in direct marketing. It provides postcodes for satellite navigation systems and it underpins the system that ensures the daily delivery of 80 million or so letters and other items every day. We should make no mistake about it&mdash;this is a serious issue.</p>
	<p pid="a.218.3/12">Only yesterday, I spoke to the chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses in Pembrokeshire, Stephen Cole, who described some of the difficulties that the database creates. He said:</p>
	<p pid="a.218.3/13" class="indent">&quot;The issue regarding the Post Office's continued use of the name of Dyfed rather than Pembrokeshire, is causing great confusion to our members and to their suppliers, especially where the exact address details are required.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.218.3/14">He gave the example of a small business applying for a trade business credit account. The small business will supply its own correct Pembrokeshire address only to be contacted later by the accounts section, which will ask why it used Pembrokeshire when the Post Office database says Dyfed. That wastes a lot of time and effort. This unnecessary hassle arises from Royal Mail's refusal to recognise the county of Pembrokeshire.</p>

	<p pid="a.220.0/1">The hon. Gentleman has taken us on an historical journey. Does he acknowledge that although there could have been legitimate concern and confusion at the time of the change, particularly among small businesses, some 13 years on&mdash;that is the crucial point&mdash;most of that will have dissipated? That is why it is important that the Post Office looks at the matter again.</p>

	<p pid="a.220.1/1">The hon. Gentleman expresses the point extremely well. There is no excuse for us still to be discussing this issue in 2009&mdash;it should have been sorted out long ago.</p>
	<p pid="a.220.1/2">Another problem arises in the tourism sector. As I said, Pembrokeshire is well known for its outstanding natural beauty, and it attracts many tourists from across the United Kingdom, as well as from other countries. A significant number of tourism websites use the Royal Mail postal address file as their database. Therefore those websites still use the former county of Dyfed in their search facilities. Holidaymakers who use the websites and search for Pembrokeshire might not be able to find exactly what they are looking for. Perhaps they are unaware that Pembrokeshire was formerly part of Dyfed. If they do not readily find what they are looking for, they could, at worst, take their business elsewhere. That would be an injustice arising from an inaccuracy in the database that could easily be rectified.</p>
	<p pid="a.220.1/3">My constituent, Robert Smith, runs a bed and breakfast in Fishguard, which is a beautiful harbour town and home to an excellent ferry service to Rosslare in Ireland. Just a few weeks ago, he told me that many of the websites that he uses to advertise his holiday rental accommodation use the Royal Mail database and thus have Dyfed listed as the area. He argues that that is very confusing for potential customers, particularly those from overseas. He now does not even bother to advertise on some websites because he knows what confusion would be caused. Mr. Smith has been told that he can contact the companies operating the websites if he wishes the database to be changed, but how demeaning it is for Pembrokeshire people, or people from Ceredigion represented by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1489" name="Mark Williams">the hon. Member for Ceredigion (Mark Williams)</phrase>, to have to take the time and trouble politely to ask large companies using the postal address file database to change the reference from Dyfed to Pembrokeshire. In 2009, we should not have to do that.</p>
	<p pid="a.220.1/4">Whether they concern civic and local pride or the costs and burdens on small Pembrokeshire businesses, the arguments for a change in the database are overwhelming. However, the response from Royal Mail has been disappointing so far. After writing to it on more than one occasion, I received a reply offering its position on the matter. It claims that its database is simply a set of routeing instructions, with the emphasis being on enabling Royal Mail to provide the most efficient service possible, rather than reflecting geographical location. It also claims that the county name does not form part of the postal address and is on the database only because external users of the database objected to its complete removal on the basis that that would make address matching more difficult.</p>
	<p pid="a.220.1/5">I understand Royal Mail's position, but I do not accept it. It may well be that, for Royal Mail alone, the main aim is to provide the most efficient postal service. However, by commercialising its database and selling it on at a profit for external companies to use for different purposes, Royal Mail places on itself a burden of responsibility. It is irresponsible and short-sighted for it not to accept responsibility for what third parties may do with the database. It has an overarching duty to act in the public interest. It should recognise the ways in which third parties may use the database and amend it accordingly to ensure that it reflects accurate place names in 2009.</p>
	<p pid="a.220.1/6">I recognise, as I said, that many significant problems and challenges face Royal Mail at present, and this is perhaps not one of the most pressing. However, it does not require a long, expensive solution. There is surely an easy fix that could quickly resolve the issues that we have been discussing. There is a precedent for action. I understand that in 2007, after a long struggle, Royal Mail agreed to create a postal county of Rutland. I strongly urge the Minister to encourage it to do the same in this regard and finally recognise the great county of Pembrokeshire on its database. The continued refusals to recognise Pembrokeshire can only do harm and cause more confusion. It is an easy thing to rectify, and rectifying it would yield great results.</p>
	<p pid="a.220.1/7">The Minister has a reputation for being a good Minister&mdash;I genuinely mean that. He could have a reputation, after today, for being a truly great Minister as far as the people of Pembrokeshire are concerned. Will he, on behalf of me and my constituents in Pembrokeshire, approach Royal Mail and help it to give us our county back?</p>

	<p pid="a.222.0/1">It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Mr. Illsley. I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1768" name="Stephen Crabb">the hon. Member for Preseli Pembrokeshire (Mr. Crabb)</phrase> on securing the debate. He should not be too apologetic in saying that this may not be the most urgent issue. It might be fair of him to say that, but my predecessor before I came into the House taught me something, which is, &quot;If it's important to your constituents, it's important to you as the MP,&quot; so it is entirely fair to raise these issues. I appreciate completely the passion that he showed for the county of Pembrokeshire. He is fortunate to represent one of the most beautiful parts of the United Kingdom. I have visited it many times and have had many an enjoyable lunch in Fishguard. There is a Celtic magic about Pembrokeshire that touches every visitor. I appreciate well the fondness that he has for his constituency and the county.</p>
	<p pid="a.222.0/2">The hon. Gentleman asks a number of significant questions. One issue I must confront at the outset is the role of Ministers in telling Royal Mail what to do&mdash;if I can put it in its most colloquial way. On what he said about the urgent issues facing Royal Mail, after being involved with such matters for a couple of years, my reflection is that perhaps that organisation has suffered from too much rather than too little political interference from Ministers over the years. It has been part of Royal Mail's history that what it does is often second guessed by politicians&mdash;often for laudable reasons&mdash;but we should get away from that rather than do more of it. Such an approach is in the interests of our constituents for the necessary modernisation of Royal Mail.</p>
	<p pid="a.222.0/3">Let me return to the issue before us: the postcode address file, its purposes and so on. Royal Mail delivers around 80 million postal items every day to businesses and residential addresses throughout the UK. Unfortunately, as technology changes, the amount of mail is declining, but dealing with it is still a substantial job, which involves more than 28 million addresses. As I said, I understand that community, identity and affinity with place are all things about which people care deeply. However, as the hon. Gentleman said, the purpose of the postcode address file is the delivery of mail.</p>
	<p pid="a.222.0/4">The critical point of the debate is to establish the purpose of the postcode address file. A postal address can be made up of a number of elements&mdash;the name of the addressee, the name of the company or organisation, the number of the building and so on&mdash;but the critical part is the postcode. County information&mdash;whether it is Pembrokeshire or Dyfed&mdash;is not a required part of the postal address. The issue comes up time after time with regard to Royal Mail when, for example, people want their postcode changed for house insurance purposes because postcodes can be used by insurance companies. The hon. Gentleman mentioned that postcode information is used in the tourism industry, but it is used in a number of industries. Although Royal Mail recognises that, it cannot change the postcode information on an ad hoc basis because of all those other uses. Royal Mail has to keep focused on the purpose of the postcode address file, which is the efficient delivery of mail. Whatever passions surround the issue, it is important to recognise that. Others may use the database, but its purpose is to ensure the efficient delivery of mail.</p>
	<p pid="a.222.0/5">The allocation of a postcode is linked to Royal Mail's network of sorting and delivery offices. Postcodes were never intended to signify a geographically definitive address by local authority, other administrative boundary or community identity. I have had the same issue in my constituency. There was a reorganisation of local government in the black country in 1966, part of which was the incorporation of the town of Bilston into Wolverhampton. People in my constituency in Bilston still have as strong a sense of identity today as they had prior to 1966, but for administrative purposes they are part of the city of Wolverhampton&mdash;they have a Wolverhampton postcode and so on. I am sure there are other examples around the country about which we could say the same thing. I understand the issue, but the purpose of the postcode is to ensure the efficient delivery of mail; it is not designed to give us an absolutely accurate description of community identity.</p>

	<p pid="a.223.0/1">I am following the Minister's argument. However, surely the crucial difference with his example is that Wolverhampton still exists. The county of Dyfed does not exist in a meaningful sense at all and therefore it is entirely unhelpful to have it on the Royal Mail database.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-06-23a.223.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1936" speakername="Patrick McFadden" colnum="223"  time="012:43:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090623/halltext/90623h0008.htm#09062367000471">
	<p pid="a.223.1/1">Let me come to the Royal Mail database because I think that the hon. Gentleman is talking about a slightly different thing from me. Delivery offices may be in different counties and so on. The postcode system was developed in the 1960s as a tool to help sort mail more efficiently. County names were dropped from essential information in 1996, when the Conservative party was in power. That is the root of the issue, because from that day&mdash;it is not just about Dyfed or Pembrokeshire; I suspect that other places are similarly affected&mdash;Royal Mail has not used the county name as an essential part of a postal address. There is nothing to prevent someone from using it in the address if they wish, but it is not essential for mail delivery. The postcode system has been very successful and serves its essential purpose well. Routes taken by postmen across the country are devised on the basis of the postcode address file.</p>
	<p pid="a.223.1/2">Can the situation be changed, or is it set in stone for ever and a day? The system can be changed. I have a suggestion that I hope will be constructive. In December 2001, Postcomm, the industry regulator, issued a consultation document seeking views on a code of practice to govern changes to Royal Mail's postcode address file. The code of practice was issued in March 2002 and was subject to a further review on its working a year later.</p>
	<p pid="a.223.1/3">In March 2004, Postcomm published its review, in which the code of practice was further amended to account for things such as customer-initiated changes to locality information. I understand that in recent months, Royal Mail, Postcomm and Consumer Focus, which took over Postwatch's job, have been revisiting the code's operation. They are considering what further changes are required to clarify the code of practice and bring it up to date. Royal Mail does not believe that significant changes are required. I am not saying that there will be extensive changes to postcode information&mdash;as I said, the system works pretty well&mdash;but Royal Mail believes that the code of practice would benefit from being clearer in a number of ways. One area not currently covered by the code of practice is county information, because county information is not required for postal purposes. The county does not form part of an official postal address, and changes to it are therefore not covered by the code of practice on changes to the postcode address file.</p>
	<p pid="a.223.1/4">The name &quot;Dyfed&quot; appears because the database still lists historical county details for customer reference. Those can include the formal postal county, the traditional county, the administrative county and so on. It is what is called an alias database, which can be used by third parties, but because Royal Mail does not use that information itself, it has not been changed since 1996.</p>
	<p pid="a.223.1/5">I suggest that the hon. Gentleman takes part in the new consultation on the code of practice for changing the postcode address file. I do not promise that the county names will be changed in the way that he would like, but he is open to make that suggestion. I do not promise it because Royal Mail, understandably, focuses on the efficiency of mail delivery and does not see it as its purpose to consider every secondary use of the postcode address file for things such as insurance, tourism and the other examples that he mentioned.</p>
	<p pid="a.223.1/6">Royal Mail acknowledges that county information is important to some customers and would like to find out more about the perceived importance of including it in postal addresses. That is why the issue is included in the current consultation on the code of practice. Along with other hon. Members, the hon. Gentleman has until <phrase class="date" code="2009-07-28">28 July</phrase> to take part in the consultation that is being carried out by Postcomm. I encourage him to do so. It provides an opportunity to explore the relationship between Royal Mail's primary purpose for the postcode address file and the other purposes to which he referred.</p>
	<p pid="a.223.1/7">In conclusion, the question before us is what is the job of the postcode address file. From the point of view of the hon. Gentleman and some of his constituents, its job is to define accurately the county of Pembrokeshire. However, Royal Mail has not used the county name since 1996. I understand from my constituency experience why that might cause frustration locally. I suggest that he takes part in the consultation and argues his corner on the use of county names. Royal Mail will then have to decide whether to change from using the postcode address file purely as a tool for the delivery of mail to using it for other purposes.</p>

	Fallen Stock (Isle of Wight)
</minor-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-06-23a.225.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1654" speakername="Andrew Turner" colnum="225"  time="013:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090623/halltext/90623h0009.htm#09062367000472">
	<p pid="a.225.2/1">The important issue of the safe and legal disposal of fallen stock has concerned farmers in my constituency for at least four years. As the Minister will know, fallen stock&mdash;farm animals that have died of natural causes or been humanely shot or euthanised by a vet&mdash;must be disposed of safely. Since May 2003, under European Union law, it has been illegal for fallen stock to be buried or burnt in open spaces. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs website says that that is</p>
	<p pid="a.225.2/2" class="indent">&quot;because of the risk of disease spread through groundwater or air pollution.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.225.2/3">Carcases must be disposed of in ways approved of by DEFRA.</p>
	<p pid="a.225.2/4">In most areas of the country farmers are well catered for by the national fallen stock scheme. It provides a reasonably priced, safe and efficient collection and disposal service for farmers. Disposal of a dead cow or bullock costs about &pound;100 under the scheme. It has attracted considerable Government funding, which reduces the cost to farmers of complying with the EU directive. I do not want to stray far into the subject of EU legislation; that is rarely productive. However, the funding was not mere largesse from our Government. It is provided to comply with article 3 of the EU Animal By-products Regulations 1774/2002. The article puts an obligation on member states to ensure that adequate arrangements and infrastructure are in place, so farmers can comply with the law.</p>
	<p pid="a.225.2/5">On the Isle of Wight, however, we do not have any approved facilities to deal with our fallen stock. The Isle of Wight hunt offered a service until March 2005 but withdrew from the scheme because its incinerator no longer met the animal by-product regulations. Following the hunt's decision in May 2005 the Isle of Wight council applied for derogation from the regulations, to permit on-farm burial. That was never formally approved by DEFRA. However, between March 2005 and January this year on-farm burial was taking place. It was illegal, but it happened with the approval of DEFRA. The problem was largely masked, as most adult bovine carcases were shipped to the mainland and disposed of free of charge. That was under the compulsory testing scheme for transmissible spongiform encephalopathies, a family of diseases that includes bovine spongiform encephalopathy and scrapie. However, that scheme was due to end in January and it was clear that island farmers faced a real problem. Matt Legge of the island's National Farmers Union had been keeping me informed of the situation.</p>
	<p pid="a.225.2/6">I raised the issue on <phrase class="date" code="2009-12-18">18 December</phrase> during the debate on the Christmas Adjournment. I pointed out that island farmers wanted to comply with the law but that there was no infrastructure that enabled them to do so&mdash;no incinerator or alternative facility. The only option would be for carcases to be shipped to the mainland. There is such a service, operated by David Biles, but it is a commercial service, which costs &pound;450 per carcase. That is not an option for the majority of farmers. Indeed, just a few animal fatalities could put a small farm out of business. The problems were recognised by the Minister's predecessor, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1690" name="Jane Kennedy">the right hon. Member for Liverpool, Wavertree (Jane Kennedy)</phrase>, when she wrote to me on <phrase class="date" code="2009-04-03">3 April</phrase> confirming that island farmers need a</p>
	<p pid="a.225.2/7" class="indent">&quot;comprehensive and reasonably priced collection and disposal service&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.225.2/8">On <phrase class="date" code="2009-01-23">23 January</phrase>, I had a further meeting with Matt Legge, Laurie Calloway, county chairman of the NFU, and James Mulleneux, regional policy adviser of the NFU. They said that they could see no real progress towards a long-term solution. They felt that matters were about to be brought to a head only because two livestock farmers from Godshill, Paul and Sue Brownrigg, were being prosecuted under the Animal By-Products Regulations 2005. The whole sorry saga came to a dramatic conclusion on <phrase class="date" code="2009-04-22">22 April</phrase> when the judge found that Mr. and Mrs. Brownrigg were caught between DEFRA's unofficial derogation and the law.</p>
	<p pid="a.225.2/9">Judge Graham White threw out the case, having accepted the argument put forward by the Brownrigg's defence lawyer, Mr. Russell Reeves, that the state has a positive legal duty to provide infrastructure to enable farmers to comply with the law. To prosecute them for not obeying the law, when to do so was near impossible, was manifestly unjust and an abuse of the process. The judge described as a fudge the unofficial derogation between DEFRA and the Isle of Wight council since March 2005. That led to complete confusion. There was then a hiatus of three weeks when burial was completely banned on the island. Farmers were unable to get guidance on what should be done with their fallen stock.</p>
	<p pid="a.225.2/10">Following the Brownrigg case and the disastrous gap, Ministers agreed to give the island a temporary derogation to continue burial from <phrase class="date" code="2009-05-02">2 May</phrase>. On DEFRA's website, the decision was described as</p>
	<p pid="a.225.2/11" class="indent">&quot;an interim measure only while work continues on developing a longer-term solution for disposal of fallen stock on the Island.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.225.2/12">I am grateful to Ministers and officials who worked quickly to get the temporary derogation in place. However, the interim situation cannot be allowed to continue indefinitely. The regulations against animal burial are in place for good public health reasons. The exceptions, which allow for burial in remote, sparsely populated areas where there is little livestock, simply do not apply to the Isle of Wight. Exceptions may be appropriate for remote areas such as the Scottish highlands and islands and small islands such as Lundy and Bardsey, but the Isle of Wight is the most populous island in the UK, with a population of some 130,000, which doubles during the summer months.</p>
	<p pid="a.225.2/13">A feasibility study commissioned by the NFU and the Isle of Wight council estimated that there were around 50,000 herd animals on the island. It also estimated that there were around 15 tonnes of fallen stock per week, which means that more than 750 tonnes have to be buried every year.</p>
	<p pid="a.225.2/14">The watercourses on the island, in common with many other areas, are not accurately mapped. Some farmers simply cannot bury fallen stock on their own land and regulations forbid them from burying them on other people's land. I am sure that Ministers do not need me to spell out for them the dangers of allowing that situation to drag on for years. I would be grateful if the Minister spelled out clearly what has been done since March 2005, when the problem became apparent, towards achieving a viable, long-term solution. Even more important, could he tell me what is being done now, and give me a firm timetable of what is to happen over the coming weeks and months? Without a clear timetable, I fear that this matter will drag on and on.</p>
	<p pid="a.225.2/15">The lack of urgency in dealing with the issue is apparent in how correspondence is being dealt with. On <phrase class="date" code="2009-05-07">7 May</phrase>, my assistant forwarded a legal opinion from Russell Reeves to DEFRA officials asking for their comments. On <phrase class="date" code="2009-06-19">19 June</phrase>, I still had not received even an acknowledgement. I chased it up myself, to be told that a reply had been drafted but that it had been held up by ministerial changes. Thankfully and, I am sure, coincidentally, after this debate was announced, I received a response by e-mail yesterday, for which I thank the Minister.</p>
	<p pid="a.225.2/16">Despite being new to his brief, the Minister clearly already understands some of the issues. Unfortunately, the potential for damage to public health will not wait for ministerial changes to bed in. As DEFRA's website explains, the degradation of BSE/TSE infectivity cannot be guaranteed by burial. Until a long-term solution is found, it is imperative that proper written guidance is sent out to farmers on what they should do with fallen livestock. Such information would help to protect the environment from inadequate burial practices, and farmers from inadvertently breaking the law. No one else should suffer as Mr. and Mrs. Brownrigg have.</p>
	<p pid="a.225.2/17">I know that the Minister will agree that it is simply not good enough for the buck to be passed between DEFRA and the Isle of Wight trading standards department. Each body seems to agree that some guidance should be given out, but not by them. I would be grateful if he would promise to take the bull by the horns, so to speak, and sort out who should be issuing guidance. I would like him to ensure that all island livestock keepers receive some written guidance by, say, the end of next week. That would be a small but welcome practical outcome of this debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.225.2/18">The NFU has been working hard on this issue on behalf of its members for years. I would like to pay tribute to it for that. However, it is frustrated, as it feels that it is little further forward now than it was in March 2005, more than four years ago. I know that the NFU would welcome some innovative thinking to find a viable solution. Perhaps a pilot project for biodigestion or some other method of disposal could be set up if an incinerator is not the right answer. Another possibility may be some kind of joint facility with St. Mary's hospital, which currently ships all clinical and hazardous waste off the island at considerable public expense.</p>
	<p pid="a.225.2/19">Whatever the correct infrastructure solution is, the Government are under a clear obligation to act. We must start to see some progress soon. I promise that if my involvement would assist in any way, I will do all that I can to help bring about a successful outcome.</p>
	<p pid="a.225.2/20">There is one other matter that I would like to touch on. My constituents Paul and Susan Brownrigg have suffered enormously as a result of the court case hanging over them for months before it was finally thrown out in April this year. The financial toll that it put them under was serious, but it is somewhat easier to quantify than the emotional and mental strain, and the impact on their family life. I would be grateful if the Minister would reflect on whether they are due an apology from DEFRA for its part in creating the situation in which they found themselves.</p>
	<p pid="a.225.2/21">It would be a worthwhile legacy if the Minister, however long he may be in post, were able to look back on one of his achievements as finding a solution to the long-standing problem of the disposal of fallen stock on the Isle of Wight.</p>

	<p pid="a.228.0/2">In recognition of the recent court judgment stating that burial on the Isle of Wight is illegal, the Government have in fact moved quickly to amend domestic legislation to legalise burial on the island so that farmers can continue to have the viable route of burial to dispose of their fallen stock. This is not just an opinion coming from me or my officials; it comes from the NFU. I have an e-mail from Richard Macdonald, the director general, who thanks one of my officials and the team&mdash;John Bourne, et al&mdash;for their speedy and excellent help in getting the Isle of Wight animal burial situation resolved so quickly. He said that it was much appreciated and needed, and that he would be grateful if thanks would go to all concerned. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will recognise that some good work has been done by DEFRA and others to try to find a solution to this challenging problem.</p>
	<p pid="a.228.0/3">The Government have formalised the pragmatic arrangements that have been in place for the past four years&mdash;I recognise completely the description that the hon. Gentleman has given and doubtless it has been a challenging situation. Those pragmatic arrangements are intended to ease the burden on the industry caused by a lack of approved disposal outlets on the island. They were put in place with the full agreement of all parties concerned including, obviously, the Government, and the Isle of Wight council and the industry.</p>
	<p pid="a.228.0/4">As required by EU law, DEFRA has notified the EU Commission of its decision to designate the Isle of Wight as a remote area in order to permit burial. To date, no negative response has been received from the Commission. I do not accept the hon. Gentleman's point that it is inappropriate to designate the Isle of Wight as a remote area. A case could be made by comparing it with more remote places, but most people living on the mainland would think the Isle of Wight is pretty remote. Some of my family lived there, so I know from experience that it is not unknown for ferries and other forms of transport to be delayed or postponed, sometimes for days in extremis. The case that DEFRA has made that the island is remote stands up to factual scrutiny, and we may have to disagree about it.</p>
	<p pid="a.228.0/5">The amendment to domestic legislation will remain under review and DEFRA will continue to work closely with the local authority, the Environment Agency, the Rural Development Commission, farming unions and local collectors to ensure a longer-term solution&mdash;other than burial&mdash;for disposal of fallen stock on the island. To that end, the Isle of Wight Economic Partnership has invited proposals for disposal of fallen stock on the island, as the hon. Gentleman will know, which include the possibility of an on-island incinerator. It recently made an assessment of expressions of interest. DEFRA officials are being consulted on the process and will do all that they can to ensure that the process has a positive outcome. I made a note of the other suggestions that the hon. Gentleman made, because a good pot of possible solutions is welcome as we move through the process.</p>
	<p pid="a.228.0/6">The Government agree that the current arrangements, while providing means for farmers to dispose of their fallen stock in the short term, do not provide a satisfactory long-term solution. That is why we are working closely with all interested parties on the island to find a commercially viable, more permanent solution for disposing of fallen stock safely and without risk to the environment. Any support the hon. Gentleman can provide to the efforts of the Isle of Wight council, the NFU, DEFRA and others to find viable proposals will be greatly appreciated by all the organisations involved and, doubtless, by his farming constituents, who I am sure are keen for the matter to be rectified as soon as possible.</p>
	<p pid="a.228.0/7">On a point of fact, I should like to mention the Brownrigg case. On <phrase class="date" code="2007-11-10">10 November 2007</phrase>, at around 10.30 am, Mrs. Stephanie Moul was riding a horse when she saw five dead sheep in a field farmed by the Brownriggs. Further down the track, she saw more remains, including a jaw and leg bone with fleece attached. Two minutes or so later, she saw two more decaying sheep carcases. Between 12 and <phrase class="date" code="2005-11-16">16 November 2005</phrase>, Isle of Wight council trading standards officers visited the Brownrigg's farm and observed similar things in different quantities in different locations. They observed skulls, sheep spines and ribcages, carcasses at varying stages of decay, a sheep's leg protruding from a patch of maggots on a muck heap, and miscellaneous sheep bones and skeletons.</p>
	<p pid="a.228.0/8">On <phrase class="date" code="2009-04-22">22 April</phrase> this year, a court judgment dismissed a case taken by the Isle of Wight local authority to prosecute the Brownriggs for failure to dispose of fallen stock in accordance with the Animal By-Products Regulations 2005&mdash;the hon. Gentleman referred to this case, which of course involved his constituents. The judge ruled that as the state, DEFRA and the Isle of Wight council had failed to</p>
	<p pid="a.228.0/9" class="indent">&quot;ensure that adequate arrangements exist to guarantee the collection and transportation of fallen stock&quot;,</p>
	<p pid="a.228.0/10">as stated in article 7(3) of the EU animal by-products regulation,</p>
	<p pid="a.228.0/11">it was an abuse of process to prosecute Mr. and Mrs. Brownrigg under the domestic regulations. The judge dismissed the case and ruled that burial under a pragmatic arrangement put in place by DEFRA with council and industry agreement was illegal.</p>
	<p pid="a.228.0/12">In response to the judgment, DEFRA amended domestic legislation with effect from <phrase class="date" code="2009-05-02">2 May 2009</phrase> formally to designate the island as a remote area, thereby legalising burial and giving clarity both to enforcers and to farmers. DEFRA stresses that the derogation to allow burial should be considered an interim measure only, and work continues on developing a longer-term solution to disposal.</p>
	<p pid="a.228.0/13">I could not agree more with the hon. Gentleman on the need for the matter not to drag on and for a solution to be found as soon as possible. To that end, I have decided to visit the Isle of Wight to meet interested parties so that we can work together to find a medium and longer-term solution to the lack of fallen stock disposal outlets on the island. Without having to ask, I know that the hon. Gentleman will want to play an important role in that. I look forward to meeting him and his constituents shortly, with a view to finding a pragmatic solution as quickly as possible.</p>

	Extra Care Accommodation (Benefits)
</minor-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-06-23a.231.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1874" speakername="Stephen Ladyman" colnum="231"  time="013:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090623/halltext/90623h0009.htm#09062367000474">
	<p pid="a.231.2/1">It is good to see you in the Chair, Mr. Illsley.</p>
	<p pid="a.231.2/2">I shall begin by giving some background on why I called this debate, which is the first of three debates that I hope to secure on extra care housing. Extra care is the name that the Government give to a particular type of accommodation, which I believe is well suited to the needs of older people. It sometimes goes under different names, depending on the provider. It can be called assisted living, very sheltered accommodation, close-care accommodation and various other names.</p>
	<p pid="a.231.2/3">To qualify as extra care, the accommodation must have some specific characteristics. Residents must have their own accommodation, whether it is an apartment, a bungalow or a house in a complex. It does not matter whether the residents are freeholders, leaseholders or tenants, as long as they live in their own home. There must also be access to extra on-site care services. Those must be flexible services that residents can access as and when they need them. Typically, extra care complexes provide further services such as restaurants and food provision services. The most exotic of these complexes include a wide range of leisure facilities.</p>
	<p pid="a.231.2/4">The advantage of such accommodation for the resident is that they can get the care they need, when they need it, while maintaining their independence. Most people regard them as a much better option than care homes. The advantages for the state are that care can be provided more flexibly and cost-effectively because it is provided in one centre and that the well-being of residents is improved. That is why the Government and I strongly support the development of extra care accommodation for older people. However, despite the strenuous encouragement and some Government investment, most new property built for older people is simple warden-assisted accommodation. Extra care accommodation is not taking off as I think it should.</p>
	<p pid="a.231.2/5">The Department with lead responsibility for extra care is the Department of Health. However, the Department for Communities and Local Government is responsible for planning matters, housing and Supporting People funding, and the Department for Work and Pensions deals with pension credit and other benefit entitlements. That split responsibility causes a great deal of confusion and limits the development of the sector. I intend to secure debates with all three Departments over the coming months to identify and encourage a resolution on the issues that must be addressed. If one thing comes out of these debates and nothing else, I hope that the three Departments will be driven to sit down together and co-ordinate their efforts. The longest journey starts with the first step, so I begin today with the Department for Work and Pensions and welcome the Minister, who is a fellow Kent MP.</p>
	<p pid="a.231.2/6">Pension credit assessments for people in extra care accommodation appear to be unreliable. I seek the Minister's help to clarify some issues and to improve that situation. Pension credit is not an ungenerous benefit and can transform the quality of life of the older people who qualify for it. However, in determining the eligibility for this means-tested benefit, certain costs are off-set against income. Those costs include an element of service charges. That is where the problem sets in because there is no clear, easy-to-understand statement of what elements of a service charge are or are not allowable, particularly for those living in extra care accommodation.</p>
	<p pid="a.231.2/7">I suspect that the Minister has been briefed that the definition of allowable and unallowable costs is clear and well understood by local pension credit decision makers. When I have asked his Department whether that is the case, it has always told me that it is. However, that flies in the face of the facts. One provider of extra care accommodation told me that last year it had 186 clients on means-tested benefits who generated 229 appeals against their assessments, of which all 229 went in favour of the client: 229 examples of when a decision maker assessing entitlement turned out to have got it wrong. Admittedly, the same provider said that the situation this year has been much better&mdash;just 17 appeals have been needed&mdash;but in two areas of the country the intervention of the local Member of Parliament was needed to avoid the problems of last year. I would like to have a little bet with my hon. Friend: if a new extra care block were to be built in an area where previously there was no such accommodation, a glut of appeals would follow, and they would&mdash;again&mdash;be won by the clients.</p>
	<p pid="a.231.2/8">The reasoning behind decisions and the instructions of specialist decision makers are too complex to be understood by many older people. Things could, and should, be made simpler. The DWP has so far refused to provide a list of allowable expenses for people in homes when there is a service charge. Why on earth not? There is no consistency of decision making between local offices. Even those affecting neighbours are sometimes inconsistent. Why? A clear set of principles written in plain English would be to everyone's benefit and would resolve many of the difficulties. I would like my hon. Friend to commit to producing such a definitive guide to what is, and what is not, an allowable service charge expense for pension credit purposes. Alternatively, instead of the DWP leaving decisions to local decision makers, who, despite their best efforts, have as much difficulty following the guidance of the social security commissioner as everyone else, it could create a small specialist group to make those decisions. That group would understand matters better and create some consistency around the country.</p>
	<p pid="a.231.2/9">I want to raise another area of concern that arises from arrangements for Supporting People funding. The Supporting People programme is managed by the DCLG, with which I shall also raise this point when I get the appropriate debate. The problem is that local councils can decide arbitrarily whether to pay for the care element of extra care accommodation from that programme. They receive no guidance from Government on what they should do, and, as a consequence, some pay and some do not&mdash;even councils next door to each other have different policies. When a council chooses not to support extra care for older people from its Supporting People budget, the element of a service charge that would have been met by the Supporting People programme does not become an allowable expense for the purpose of working out entitlement to pension credit. That can leave leaseholders with a shortfall of &pound;50 per week compared with their entitlement prior to April 2003. Older people living within just a few miles of each other can find themselves being treated very differently. And the situation is getting worse. Council budgets are being stretched and Supporting People funding is an easy target. Quick savings can be made by declaring that extra care service charges are no longer eligible.</p>
	<p pid="a.231.2/10">I am sure that that is not what the Government wanted, or expected, when they introduced the Supporting People programme. Nor was it&mdash;I suspect&mdash;what the DWP wanted, or expected, when it agreed to transfer responsibility and the budget for supporting older people in this situation to the DCLG and the Supporting People fund. One obvious solution would be to rescind the ruling that puts extra care for older people within the remit of the Supporting People programme and to return to the pre-2003 arrangements. The DWP could then permit an element of care as an allowable expense within service charges. That would have the immediate impact of encouraging people to provide, and seek to live in, extra care accommodation.</p>
	<p pid="a.231.2/11">Failing that, the Government must recognise that this client group is probably the only one that does not have a provider or a champion to argue their case and ensure that they are getting their fair share of Supporting People funding in every area of the country. Perhaps my hon. Friend will undertake to discuss this matter with his DCLG colleagues and decide how national consistency can be achieved. At the very least, I would encourage the Government to withdraw the <phrase class="date" code="2002-09-12">12 September 2002</phrase> guidance note for leaseholders receiving income-related benefits from the pension service or Jobcentre Plus for support services. That note is in some disrepute in the sector. One supplier even calls it fraudulent, given that the availability of Supporting People funding is a matter for local council decision. The Government should rewrite the guidance note and other such notes and do so, this time, with the help of representatives of the industry, who are familiar with what is happening on the ground.</p>
	<p pid="a.231.2/12">There is a need properly to inform citizens of the benefits of extra care accommodation so that they can seek it out and recognise how it differs from ordinary warden-assisted or sheltered accommodation. There are guidance notes available that are aimed at decision makers, including the largely discredited document that I just mentioned. Other documents are aimed at councils and accommodation or care providers. Factsheet No. 1, from the Care Services Improvement Partnership, which is dated <phrase class="date" code="2008-02-12">12 February 2008</phrase> and entitled &quot;Extra Care Housing&mdash;What is it?&quot;, is good as far as it goes, but it is not aimed at the consumer.</p>
	<p pid="a.231.2/13">I have a question for my hon. Friend the Minister. If he were an older person who had decided to move into accommodation that was better designed for him in his old age and he had heard about extra care, how would he find out what his benefit entitlements might be? How could he get an answer to the question, &quot;Will I be entitled to pension credit so that I can afford to live in an extra care property?&quot; Of course, he could ask the agency responsible for calculating pension credit, but would he really get clear and accurate information? Probably not. In any case, officials are often reluctant to answer hypothetical questions. He might look at various third sector websites, but most are quite confusing.</p>
	<p pid="a.231.2/14">Surely, we need a guide in plain English to accommodation choices for older people on the Government's own Directgov website. It should have a link to a page written by my hon. Friend's colleagues in his Department, giving citizens a guide to benefit entitlement for people in extra care accommodation. That would allow citizens who are considering moving into extra care to estimate for themselves what their entitlement will be so that they can make their choice accordingly.</p>
	<p pid="a.231.2/15">Just to emphasise the impact of the information deficit, I should point out that before an older person applies for pension credit, they usually need to know what they could be entitled to. Some extra care providers provide a pastoral service to clients to tell them about pension credit and to help them apply, and it is that group of providers that has given me the information that I am using today.</p>
	<p pid="a.231.2/16">However, many providers do not provide such a service. I therefore wonder how many older people in extra care accommodation would be entitled to support but have never asked for it. How many have applied, been given a wrong decision and accepted it for want of anyone who knows better? How many of the 186 clients I mentioned earlier would have pursued their claims if someone had not supported them and told them that they had a good case? Again, the issue would be addressed by better information and guidance notes.</p>
	<p pid="a.231.2/17">The outputs that I seek from my hon. Friend the Minister are these: first, efforts to ensure consistent decision making when people in extra care apply for benefits; secondly, efforts to resolve the inconsistencies that arise because of different local Supporting People arrangements, preferably including a return to pre-2003 arrangements for this client group; thirdly, the production of a definitive guide to allowable expenses, as well as completely revised guidance notes for decision makers and benefit claimants, which should be written after consultation with the sector; fourthly, guides in plain English to extra care accommodation and benefit entitlement for those living in extra care to be provided online and as hard copy and to be aimed at service users; and, fifthly, the three Departments responsible for elements of extra care to sit down together to co-ordinate their approach to removing the difficulties faced by residents and providers, and to renew their efforts to encourage the sector.</p>
	<p pid="a.231.2/18">Lastly, I have a specific request. When I was a Minister, I held the record for the number of Adjournment debates answered in a Session, so I know how they work. My hon. Friend will have his departmental brief telling him that all is well and that the issues that I am raising are not as serious as I suggest. He will have been told that all is in hand and that there is no need for concern. As he sees it, his job will be to be as helpful as he can, but without committing the Department to extensive new work or new policies.</p>
	<p pid="a.231.2/19">When it comes to Adjournment debates, however, I am the very essence of a poacher turned gamekeeper, and I could not let him get away with such a response. My job is to ensure that when he leaves here today, the notes of my speech are not put into a file and forgotten about.</p>
	<p pid="a.231.2/20">My final specific request is to ask my hon. Friend to review again the number of decisions affecting older people living in accommodation with service charges who have had those decisions overturned on appeal during the past three years, compare decisions in different parts of the country for consistency, and then write to tell me whether he still believes that they are acceptable. I presume that he is not prepared today to offer to revise all the guidance notes and to produce the plain English guidance that I seek, so will he tell me in that same letter either that he will do so, or why he believes that that is not necessary? With that final request, I hope that the Department will have no choice but to continue to consider these matters a little longer, and I await my hon. Friend's answer with keen anticipation.</p>

	<p pid="a.235.0/1">It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Mr. Illsley. I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1874" name="Stephen Ladyman">the Member for South Thanet (Dr. Ladyman)</phrase> on raising this important subject, about which he knows a great deal from his previous ministerial position. He set a trap for me in anticipating what I might say. I thought that I would look back at the many Adjournment debates to which he responded to see whether other hon. Members laid the same trap for him. I will put that on my list of things to do.</p>
	<p pid="a.235.0/2">I want to give as much of the available detail as possible, and I hope that I can provide some clarity and commitments. It is right that there has been success in this policy area, as my hon. Friend said, but we need joint working for it to be more effective. I am sure that we agree that that must be demonstrated locally, where services are delivered. We must also ensure that it occurs effectively in central Government, working across Departments. All Departments with which he intends to have the debate want to work together and not in the proverbial silos. We have done, and will continue to do, a number of things to achieve that, and I will outline them later.</p>
	<p pid="a.235.0/3">I have time to talk about the Supporting People programme, which, as my hon. Friend rightly said, rests with the Department for Communities and Local Government. He is aware that, in <phrase class="date" code="2003-04-07">7 April 2003</phrase>, we saw the advent of that programme, which brought together for the first time nine housing-related funding streams from across Whitehall, which was no mean achievement. From its beginning, the main aim of the Supporting People programme has been to end social exclusion and to enable vulnerable people to maintain or achieve their independence through the provision of vital housing-related support to maintain a suitable and stable independent home in local communities.</p>
	<p pid="a.235.0/4">The Supporting People programme provides housing-related support to prevent problems that could lead to hospitalisation, institutional care and homelessness, and it aims to help the smooth transition from independent living for those leaving an institutional environment. The purpose of the programme is to assist in providing a better quality of life for vulnerable people, helping them to live more independently.</p>
	<p pid="a.235.0/5">The programme's vision of bringing together at local level better integrated and more securely funded housing and related services for vulnerable people commanded general support, and still does. The intention is to help many categories of people, including older people who want to continue to live independently and other vulnerable people in our communities.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-06-23a.236.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1874" speakername="Stephen Ladyman" colnum="236"  time="013:45:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090623/halltext/90623h0010.htm#09062367000476">
	<p pid="a.236.0/1">Given what the Minister has said about the laudable objectives of supporting people and the specific targeting of vulnerable older people, can he think of any justification for allowing councils to opt out entirely from providing extra care support for people in their area, as some have chosen to do?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-06-23a.236.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1491" speakername="Jonathan R Shaw" colnum="236"  time="013:45:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090623/halltext/90623h0010.htm#09062367000477">
	<p pid="a.236.1/1">My hon. Friend will know that services differentiate between local authority areas. A common complaint about the postcode lottery that people often talk about is the difficulty of getting the balance right between local choice for the council to provide for its residents and ensuring that there are standards. I am sure that we will continue to have this debate&mdash;particularly when we publish the care and support Green Paper, on which a most important debate will take place, and what he has discussed today will be very pertinent to that. We will publish that document soon. As my hon. Friend knows, we have invested more than &pound;8.7 billion in the programme, and we will spend a further &pound;4.9 billion up to <phrase class="date" code="2011-03-31">31 March 2011</phrase>. The programme has helped more than 1 million people across England.</p>
	<p pid="a.236.1/2">On the DWP's role, help with service charges from income-related benefits relies on the charge first being a condition of occupying the home. In practice, therefore, the tenant or leaseholder could be evicted from their home for non-payment. The benefit decision maker decides whether any part of those charges is ineligible for help and removes that from the overall service charge before deciding on the amount of benefit payable. Legislation does not prescribe which service charges are eligible. We have always sought to avoid providing a prescriptive list of eligible service charges, as it would prevent help from being given for worthy costs that are not on the list.</p>
	<p pid="a.236.1/3">As a general rule, all eligible service charges must be connected with the provision of adequate accommodation. Charges must therefore be related to those services that are property related, rather than to the person's ability to live in a property, which are usually met by other funding streams. A proportion of the service charge costs in respect of supported accommodation that is owned or leased may be met through income-related benefits, such as income support or pension credit.</p>
	<p pid="a.236.1/4">We are aware that some decision makers have faced difficulty when the management fee payable on leasehold apartments does not include a breakdown of the service charges included in the fee, including those for providing support. If that breakdown is not available, it may be that the decision maker is unable to establish the eligible charges met by pension credit. The issue of determining and assessing the ineligible service charges for owners was addressed in a commissioner's decision&mdash;CIS/2901/2004&mdash;which was reported in April 2005. Essentially, the commissioner decided that the appropriate apportioning of staff costs between housing management and support functions should be determined by how much time is spent on each function.</p>
	<p pid="a.236.1/5">On the issues that relate to my Department, my hon. Friend mentioned the number and 100 per cent. success rate of appeals made against the pension credit assessment. In those cases where a breakdown was not available at the time of the original decision, that decision can be reconsidered if the information becomes available subsequently and an application for a revision is made. I understand that the total number of pension credit appeals submitted to a tribunal during 2008-09 was 1,387, of which 221 were allowed in full and 32 in part. We believe that the appeals to which my hon. Friend refers are those where the decision has been reconsidered and revised by the decision maker, so that there is no need to submit the appeal to the Tribunals Service. The provision of the information means that the reconsideration can be done, the decision revised and the appeal lapsed.</p>
	<p pid="a.236.1/6">On issues relating to housing costs, which includes service charges, only 32 appeals were lost. Appeals are normally lost because the decision is on a matter of subjective judgment and the tribunal comes to a different conclusion, or the customer provides extra information at the hearing. Approximately 120,000 decisions were made on service charges last year, of which only 32 were found to be incorrect on appeal. In essence, therefore, only 0.03 per cent. of our decisions on service charges were found to be incorrect in the end. Several appeals were made to the commissioner and upper tribunal judge, to clarify which expenses were eligible and which were ineligible. The commissioner's decisions are binding and must be followed by decision makers, as my hon. Friend is aware. To ensure that decisions are consistent and in line with the commissioner's findings, a guidance memo&mdash;SPC memo 53&mdash;was issued to all decision makers in November 2006. I can send it to my hon. Friend if he wishes.</p>
	<p pid="a.236.1/7">My hon. Friend asserted that the reasoning behind decisions and the instructions of specialist decision makers are too complex for many older people to understand. The concept behind the decision is straightforward. A resident is eligible for help with service charge costs associated with the provision of adequate accommodation, but not for help with costs associated with counselling, care and support. Complexity arises if the service charge costs comprise both eligible and ineligible elements in unspecified and varying proportions. However, SPC memo 53 simplifies the matter for decision makers by including an automated spreadsheet calculator. The decision maker simply inputs the established facts and the calculator works out the entitlement.</p>
	<p pid="a.236.1/8">My hon. Friend suggested that the DWP has so far refused to give a list of allowable expenses for people in homes where a service charge adds to the confusion, yet SPC 53 also includes a desk aid containing an extensive list of allowable expenses for people in homes where there is a service charge. The memo has been accessible and in the public domain since November 2006.</p>
	<p pid="a.236.1/9">Finally, my hon. Friend remarked that there is no consistency in decision making between local offices, or even between decisions affecting neighbours. It is difficult to comment on or analyse the consistency of decisions between local offices or neighbouring areas, because each individual case should be decided on its own facts and will therefore be different from the case of a resident in a similar establishment in the next road, town or village. It is likely that residents within the same leasehold dwelling will have similar entitlements, but those entitlements will be different from those of the residents of a neighbouring dwelling. That individuality was confirmed by the commissioner, who stated that</p>
	<p pid="a.236.1/10" class="indent">&quot;the eligibility of service charges must be considered by reference to each individual residential complex, an average figure taken by reference to a sample of developments will not suffice.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.236.1/11">The Pension, Disability and Carers Service also encourages consistency of decision making in the area. I am assured that decision makers have been provided with the training and guidance to deal effectively with claims. A current programme of work is being undertaken to update existing training modules and provide staff with extra training directed at all aspects of error in decision making. There is a specific training module on service charges, which was launched in April 2009.</p>
	<p pid="a.236.1/12">PDCS has an independent team that undertakes regular checks of the accuracy of pension credit decisions. When errors are found, feedback is given to staff. The most up-to-date pension credit statistics show accuracy for 2008-09 to have been 92.11 per cent. against a target of 92 per cent. PDCS has a specialist centralised appeals section to handle all pension credit appeals. If the decision referred to the appeals section looks in doubt, the case goes back to the decision maker for reconsideration. Our records show that only 12 cases were reconsidered for service charges in the past year.</p>
	<p pid="a.236.1/13">I am grateful to my hon. Friend for bringing his expertise and understanding of the sector to the debate. I believe that our objectives as a Government and his, as a champion for older people, are the same. I will arrange for meetings between him and officials to ensure that all the points that he raised are covered if I have not been able to respond to them today.</p>

	<p pid="a.238.0/1">I will certainly take up my hon. Friend's invitation, but given what he said about the guidance notes being in the public domain, it seems a small step for them to be put into plain English, so that clients as well as decision makers can understand them. Will he consider that?</p>

	<p pid="a.238.1/1">On a final note, of course I will consider it. We always strive to ensure that our publications are in plain English and meet the various marks for that. I hope that we can indeed improve the service.</p>
