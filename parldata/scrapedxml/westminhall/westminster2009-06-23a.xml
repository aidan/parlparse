	<p pid="a.176.3/1">Unfortunately, I will be unable to stay for the whole debate because I am serving on a Committee at 10.30 am.</p>
	<p pid="a.176.3/2">The promise of the '80s was that the old industries, such as coal and ship building, would be allowed to run down and would then be replaced by new industries. In my constituency, Hewlett-Packard, the new electronics firm, has just informed 700 of its workers that they will be sacked. In my view, the only reason is that the manufacturing base is being transferred to the Czech Republic. Such modern employers are taking advantage of the employment legislation in this country, which means that they can sack unskilled and unqualified workers. The UK is the easiest place in Europe to get rid of workers.</p>

	<p pid="a.182.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1427" name="David Anderson">the hon. Member for Blaydon (Mr. Anderson)</phrase> on securing this debate and on an excellent introduction. He set out clear policies for dealing with the skills gap in the older industrial areas. Rather than repeat much of what he said, I shall make a few specific points about some ways in which the Government could be more effective.</p>
	<p pid="a.182.0/2">The predominant employment in the area that I represent, Rochdale, was not based on coal, as in the hon. Gentleman's area, but on light engineering and textiles. Much of that has disappeared since the 1980s, but the problems remain. As he said, a large number of adults are low skilled and are working in low-skilled jobs or are unemployed. The question is: how can they get into employment or retain their job?</p>
	<p pid="a.182.0/3">A key issue is that, in the areas that we are discussing, the majority of employment is still in manufacturing. Many other areas have moved to so-called high-skilled, high-technology jobs, but, in most of the areas that we represent, a large part of the employment base is still very much in traditional manufacturing. One of the biggest problems that I come across when I speak to local employers is that, up until now, the Government simply have not had a proper strategic policy for securing the manufacturing base. Until recently, far too much emphasis has been placed on making money in the City, and we have seen where that has gone. What manufacturing we do have is high skilled and high tech.</p>

	<p pid="a.188.1/1">I had actually noted down the point that the hon. Gentleman made about the RDAs in his speech and I was coming to it next, but I will deal with it now. Yes, I agree that RDAs could play an extremely important part, particularly in encouraging new industries. However, in my region, the South West of England Regional Development Agency has had its budget cut this year. If ever there was an inopportune moment to cut an RDA's budget, it would seem to be now, but my RDA's budget has nevertheless been cut. As a Bristol MP, I have had a letter from the RDA saying that as a result of the cut in its capital budget it is no longer able to support some of the projects that it had hoped to fund in my constituency, such as the regeneration of Stokes Croft, which is one of the gateways into the city centre. Of course, all RDAs are also affected by the downturn in the property market, because they depend, to some extent, on land sales to finance their capital programmes. The effects of the recession, as well as Government cuts in RDAs' budgets, are having a detrimental impact on the ground.</p>
	<p pid="a.188.1/2">My hon. Friend the Member for Rochdale and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1386" name="Michael Clapham">the hon. Member for Barnsley, West and Penistone (Mr. Clapham)</phrase> mentioned the important role of FE colleges. I will not dwell on that topic too long, because we have discussed it many times in Westminster Hall and on the Floor of the House. However, Barnsley college has probably been mentioned more than any other college in such debates.</p>
	<p pid="a.188.1/3">The Minister is new to his post, and his predecessor did not exactly cover himself in glory when responding to the concerns expressed by hon. Members from all parties about the FE college capital programme. I am sure that the Minister will earn the respect of many colleagues if he engages positively with the unfortunate issues raised by that programme and points to a clear way forward. If he does, he will also give hope to colleges such as Barnsley, which has been largely demolished, judging by the pictures that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1385" name="Jeff Ennis">the hon. Member for Barnsley, East and Mexborough (Jeff Ennis)</phrase> has shown me.</p>

	<p pid="a.189.0/1">May I ask the hon. Gentleman to point out to the Minister that, notwithstanding its wonderful sylvan setting, South East Essex sixth-form college and colleges like it are there to provide young people with education and training opportunities and to skill them up for the future? Those colleges have also suffered tremendously in the LSC debacle, and they should not be forgotten.</p>

	<p pid="a.189.2/1">Is the hon. Gentleman as interested as I am to learn what the Conservative party's policy on funding all the LSC's promises to colleges around the country would be if it was to form the next Government?</p>

	<p pid="a.189.3/1">I am always interested to listen to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1825" name="John Hayes">the hon. Member for South Holland and The Deepings (Mr. Hayes)</phrase>, and we will shortly have an opportunity to hear from him&mdash;probably at length&mdash;about Conservative party policy on the issue.</p>
	<p pid="a.189.3/2">Let me finish dealing with the points that have been made. The hon. Member for Barnsley, West and Penistone talked about the effects that despair can have on communities. He was rightly concerned about the election of two British National party members of the European Parliament, including, of course, one in his region of Yorkshire. I am sure that, whatever our differences on the topic, we are united in saying that we must find a way to reach out to people who felt that the only way they could express their despair through the ballot box was by voting for a fascist party. That should worry us all.</p>
	<p pid="a.189.3/3">The debate is taking place against the background of a deep recession. Previous recessions, which I have already described, were characterised by sudden downturns in single industries, which affected an entire community, leading to mass unemployment in the area concerned, and often long-term unemployment as well. One of the depressing statistics from that last recession in the 1980s was that many of the men, in particular, aged over 40, who lost jobs then did not return to full productive work, in what could have been useful working lives of another 20 or more years. We must work hard in the present recession so that that stark statistic is not repeated. That is why engagement with the skills needs of older workers in the current or potential work force will be vital. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1677" name="David Taylor">The hon. Member for North-West Leicestershire (David Taylor)</phrase>, who I think has gone to attend a Committee, referred to age discrimination.</p>
	<p pid="a.189.3/4">The Leitch report was mentioned once in the debate, and I said earlier that it had some stretching targets for 2020. However, it brought out very clearly the fact that, because of the demographic change in the work force, 70 per cent. of the 2020 work force to which the targets relate have already left formal education. It will therefore be vital to work not only with people who are currently in full-time education, but with the current work force. There will be a constant need for retraining, and new opportunities need to be explored.</p>
	<p pid="a.189.3/5">The present recession is different from previous ones that we have discussed. A financial heart attack has affected the entire economy. Workers in the banking and insurance industries, which are very important in my constituency, are suddenly out of work. There is retail gloom, and many retail chains that were common sights in our high streets have gone out of business; and the housing and construction bubble has, of course, burst as well. However, the restriction on credit by the banks is likely to affect the whole manufacturing and small business base. We must ensure, because of the huge injection of taxpayers' money into the capital base of the banks, that they will lend to manufacturing and small business.</p>
	<p pid="a.189.3/6">Bridging the skills gap that is the topic of the debate is the key to the future. I have mentioned older workers, but we should also think about gender differences: the opportunities that girls and young women feel are open to them, and those that boys feel are open to them. We should think about the differences in participation&mdash;the number of women taking part&mdash;in engineering, which is a key element in many of the relevant areas. Good information, advice and guidance are crucial to ensuring that young people take up the educational programmes that could lead to those productive careers.</p>
	<p pid="a.189.3/7">I want briefly to mention that we need to be worried, too, about boys' attainment in the relevant areas. There is a gap in attainment between boys and girls, which is not narrowing. The biggest gap affects white working-class boys. In the areas that we have talked about, whether south Wales, Yorkshire or the north-east, it is largely white working-class boys who feel the despair of unemployment. That is where there is the biggest attainment gap in schools.</p>
	<p pid="a.189.3/8">New industries for the future, such as carbon capture and storage, the electric cars that the hon. Member for Blaydon referred to, and wind turbines, such as those that could be installed off the west coast in the area that I represent, have been said to be essential to our meeting our 2020 climate change targets. However, none of that can be achieved if we do not bridge the current yawning gap affecting good STEM skills&mdash;science, technology, engineering and maths. That is a skills gap that the Government should address urgently.</p>

	<p pid="a.195.1/1">I acknowledge that point. The sector skills councils are currently under review, and I shall take a close look at any recommendations made in that regard.</p>
	<p pid="a.195.1/2"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1825" name="John Hayes">The hon. Member for South Holland and The Deepings (Mr. Hayes)</phrase> asked about FE colleges. We are not talking about whether we shall invest, or have been investing, in them, but about how we do so. In the final year of the last Conservative Government, not a penny was invested in FE colleges, and in the last four years, there was a 7 per cent. real cut in their funding. I am reluctant, therefore, to accept any lessons from him, even though he was a babe in arms, as he told us, at the time of the last Conservative Administration. Nevertheless, I wish him a happy birthday.</p>
	<p pid="a.195.1/3">I also remind the hon. Gentleman that we rescued apprenticeships, which were decimated under the Conservatives. In 2007-08, 225,000 apprenticeships were running, and earlier this year the Prime Minister pledged a package of support for 35,000 additional places over the coming year. I heard the hon. Gentleman's interesting pledges on apprenticeships, on behalf of his party, but is he prepared to pledge to match the expenditure that we have committed to FE colleges in the years to come? Frankly, given what his Front-Bench colleagues revealed recently about their spending plans, I doubt that he is.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-06-23a.198.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1881" speakername="Anthony Steen" colnum="198"  time="011:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090623/halltext/90623h0004.htm#09062367000452">
	<p pid="a.198.3/1">The hon. Gentleman has not given me an even chance to explain what I want to talk about. All initiatives that try to do good and make life better are to be welcomed. I know of the Barnardo's initiative and can only speak very highly of it. All non-governmental agencies working in the field&mdash;or indeed any other field&mdash;are always to be supported and welcomed. Provided the hon. Gentleman does not interrupt me again, he might actually hear what I have to say.</p>
	<p pid="a.198.3/2">My so-called counsel of despair was designed to set the picture. The public face may look all right, but it conceals untold problems. Too many children grow up in broken homes, with one parent or within the care system, and too many are deprived of the resources that allow them to fulfil their potential. The United Kingdom displays some of the worst erosion of family values in Europe. As a result, we feel obliged to keep passing child care legislation in an attempt to deal with the problems, but we are unable to implement most of it because of the insufficient number of care professionals. Furthermore, increasing numbers of children are brought up in ethnic minority households, with different values, morals, mores and expectations. Such children are under pressure from two worlds. On the one hand they have to reconcile their own culture and, on the other, they have to fit into the British way of life. The state cannot and should not try to provide us with substitute parents to raise children; it cannot be done. Teachers should not have to teach values that parents should impart.</p>
	<p pid="a.198.3/3">More families are splitting and more children are going into care because of the fragmentation of society. Instead of trying to strengthen the family unit, successive Governments have poured resources into the substitutes. Yet our broken society still does not have enough substitutes. We have to find more social workers, children's homes and foster parents to make good the shortcomings of families. Britain today has a culture of box-ticking bureaucracy that robs people of opportunities to take personal responsibility and make their own decisions.</p>
	<p pid="a.198.3/4">In addition, there is the pressure of the modern high-speed internet, which brings into the home a whole new set of opportunities and dangers. Overtly, life appears normal, but, behind closed doors, there is sometimes an unsavoury picture. The debate is about the hidden world in which children are increasingly sexually abused.</p>
	<p pid="a.198.3/5">Let us look at the child abuse statistics. Some 1 per cent. of children under the age of 16 experience sexual abuse by a parent or a carer, and a further 3 per cent. by another relative during childhood. Some 11 per cent. of children aged under 16 experience sexual abuse during childhood by people known but unrelated to them, and 5 per cent. of children aged under 16 experience sexual abuse during childhood by an adult stranger or someone they have just met. In total, 16 per cent. of children&mdash;one in six&mdash;aged under 16 experience sexual abuse during childhood. More than one third, 36 per cent., of all rapes recorded by the police are committed against children under the age of 16. That is the picture in Britain today. The most vulnerable of those children in our advanced society should be protected. However, in Britain we do not manage to do that. Our so-called safeguarding strategies look very good on paper, but in reality, children continue to be game to predators, paedophiles and traffickers. They are the ones most at risk of abuse, and the ones least capable of protecting themselves.</p>
	<p pid="a.198.3/6">People may wonder why our society is unable to safeguard from exploitation the most vulnerable children and why the state has not been able to help more. Is it that state intervention deals only with the symptoms rather than with the root causes? Even children taken away from parents into the care of the state face multiple risks, sometimes from those who are supposed to care for them, as we know only too well. It is just not possible to replicate the role of parent in supporting and nurturing children as they develop. On <phrase class="date" code="2009-06-10">10 June</phrase>, the Department for Children, Schools and Families published &quot;Safeguarding children and young people from sexual exploitation&quot;, which is designed to help police, teachers, social workers and health workers. It has been issued to local authorities around the country. The guidance suggests that the needs of trafficked children should be met by local safeguarding children's boards. It talks about establishing trafficking sub-groups and protocols to manage the effective care of trafficked children. I ask you, Mr. Martlew, is that really the way to go? We are talking about yet another bureaucratic organisation&mdash;the local safeguarding children's boards&mdash;and yet another sub-group to look at the trafficking of children. We simply cannot cope with the needs of our own children in this country, let alone with the problems of migrant or trafficked children. Establishing trafficking sub-groups and protocols will not deal with existing problems nor provide effective care for trafficked children.</p>
	<p pid="a.198.3/7">Let us give credit where it is due. The Government have recognised the scandal of child trafficking and taken a number of steps towards the prevention and prosecution of trafficking offences. Moreover, they have provided protection for child victims of trafficking. Migrant as well as British children are at risk of being trafficked for sexual exploitation, and that exploitation is often linked with domestic servitude and other forms of exploitative labour. Information about the scope and incidence of child trafficking in the United Kingdom has been produced by the Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre, which published a strategic threat assessment in April, identifying 337 cases of children trafficked into or within the United Kingdom over the past year. The children came from a wide range of countries&mdash;China was the most frequently mentioned&mdash;for a number of purposes, including sexual exploitation, forced labour and domestic servitude.</p>
	<p pid="a.198.3/8">The National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children also published research this month on child victims of trafficking. It recommended that child protection concerns and the best interests of the child should always trump immigration procedures. I hope that the Minister takes a particular interest in this important point: trafficked children need to be seen not as immigration cases, but as children who have been trafficked here for exploitation.</p>
	<p pid="a.198.3/9">The NSPCC advocated the need for trained foster carers and 24-hour supported accommodation for child victims of trafficking. I am all for that, but can the Government deliver? A campaign to find foster carers that come from the same country as the trafficked child could be the first step. During the Slough raids on the Roma community in February 2008, the police found a number of young children who had been forced into criminal activity, but they were unable to find foster carers who spoke Romanian or the dialect of Romanian that the Roma children spoke. Could the United Kingdom Human Trafficking Centre, which was funded by the Government to the tune of &pound;1.6 million this year, take on the role of locating potential foster carers from minority communities? That is an important job, but it is not being done. If locating foster parents from minority communities who might be willing to foster children from their old home country cannot done by the UKHTC, some of the excellent non-governmental agencies that fortunately abound in this field could be given the task. I would be grateful if the Minister addressed that point.</p>
	<p pid="a.198.3/10">Although the ratification and implementation of the Council of Europe convention against trafficking provides improved protection in theory&mdash;I am glad the Government singed and ratified the convention, and that they are now implementing it&mdash;there are some serious problems with the national referral mechanism, which was set up under the convention to identify victims of human trafficking and to ensure that they are referred to specialist support services. The process of identification is critical, because it results in the granting of temporary admission into the UK and access to a range of support and legal services. Failure correctly to identify a trafficked victim can lead to a denial of basic support, continued exploitation, criminalisation and, ultimately, removal to the country of origin, often without a risk assessment. Can the Minister tell us how many children have been removed from Britain in the past year and returned to their country of origin without ensuring that the necessary support services were in place in those countries, to ensure that the child is not re-trafficked and brought back into Britain? Such a risk assessment before a child is put on a plane is a prerequisite, but is it actually happening?</p>
	<p pid="a.198.3/11">Part of the problem with the national referral mechanism is the question of what is the competent authority to identify and legalise individuals who have been trafficked. Who holds the power to identify children who have been trafficked? The answer is that it is a handful of UK Border Agency caseworkers, but how do the Government ensure that victim care is the caseworkers' priority given that they come from the immigration services? Does the Minister not think that that is the wrong way round? Would it not make much more sense to have as the competent authority professionally trained child protection staff who would recognise the best interests of the child, which is the most important thing?</p>
	<p pid="a.198.3/12">End Child Prostitution, Child Pornography and the Trafficking of Children for Sexual Purposes UK&mdash;ECPAT UK&mdash;represents a coalition of leading organisations, including Anti-Slavery International, the Jubilee Campaign, NSPCC, Save the Children, the Children's Society, UNICEF and so on. It has offered specific training for those responsible for identifying victims in the Home Office and, no doubt, people in the Minister's Department. As yet, it has received no response. The organisation does training all over Britain and it would be ideal if it were invited to train the UKBA caseworkers as to how they should identify trafficked children. When will the Minister, and the Home Office, respond, and will she apply pressure to ensure that the Government respond?</p>
	<p pid="a.198.3/13">The problem of identification and age determination at ports of entry is another spanner in the works. Trafficked children are often found without legal documents, or with documents that have been falsified by their traffickers to make them appear younger or older than they are. When a child is accompanied by an adult, the information provided by the adult should be verified to determine their relationship with the child. Once they have gone through the frontier, it is too late.</p>
	<p pid="a.198.3/14">In each region of Croatia, a police officer and a social worker are appointed and trained to identify victims and to assess the credibility of each case. We cannot expect all UKBA staff to be equipped, but why have the Government given them sole responsibility for identification? The Minister may say that it is not her responsibility, but she is here to respond to the debate, and I hope she addresses that point. If she cannot, will she see that the Department responsible deals with the problem?</p>
	<p pid="a.198.3/15">On <phrase class="date" code="2009-05-06">6 May</phrase>, <i>The Guardian</i> stated that 77 Chinese children had gone missing from Hillingdon children's services in the past year. Later in the month, the Select Committee on Home Affairs published its report into human trafficking, which described a resurgence of a type of slave trade and criticised the lack of good information on the scale of the problem. It also said that enforcement was patchy, that prosecution rates were low, and that there is little protection for victims. Similarly, ECPAT UK has found that about 60 per cent. of suspected child victims in local authority care go missing and are not subsequently found. The Committee was particularly alarmed by accounts that traffickers may, in effect, be using the care home system for vulnerable children as holding pens for their victims, until they are ready to pick them up.</p>
	<p pid="a.198.3/16">I saw that very process when I visited Gatwick with some of my colleagues from the all-party parliamentary group on the trafficking of women and children. Children who were initially applying for asylum came through the system and were sent in a minibus to one of the local authority children's homes about eight miles away. That is a receiving centre for children, as is Hillingdon near Heathrow. Oddly enough, most of the children are allowed to hold on to their mobile phones. When it is convenient for the traffickers, the children in the reception centres are picked up.</p>
	<p pid="a.198.3/17">The children's homes are not secure, and I am not sure that the balance between making them a prison and keeping them open has been correctly struck. At the moment, they are far too open, and traffickers probably ring the child on the mobile phone saying, &quot;Meet me at the front gate in half an hour,&quot; and off they go. In such circumstances, one cannot be too surprised that 77 Chinese children went missing from Hillingdon children's services. The problem is the balance between secure and free accommodation. At the moment, people can go missing if they so wish.</p>
	<p pid="a.198.3/18">Article 10(4) of the Council of Europe convention, which we implemented in April, states:</p>
	<p pid="a.198.3/19" class="indent">&quot;As soon as an unaccompanied child is identified as a victim, each Party shall...provide for representation of the child by a legal guardian, organisation or authority which shall act in the best interests of that child&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.198.3/20">The necessity of appointing a guardian for a trafficked child stems from the acute vulnerability that such a child faces. They are highly susceptible to the continued attempts by traffickers to re-establish their control. One non-governmental organisation found that children go missing at the very point when they are being assessed for support. A guardian appointed at that stage would provide additional protection, look out for the child's best interests, guide them through the complex legal and policy processes and provide a crucial link between the various agencies and services for the child.</p>
	<p pid="a.198.3/21">Will the Minister consider the issue seriously? Why do the Government oppose the appointment of guardians? Why do they say that it is not necessary? That is the one thing that would go further than anything else to guarantee the safety of vulnerable children. The system uses guardians ad litem anyway, so it is not a question of appointing a lot of new people at enormous cost. Guardians ad litem do a tremendously important job in our legal system by protecting children in this country; why can they not be given the job of looking after vulnerable children who are trafficked into Britain or come here seeking asylum? We are not talking about a vast number of children; it may be in the hundreds, but it is not yet in the thousands. It needs to be considered.</p>
	<p pid="a.198.3/22">Defining the scale of trafficking in the United Kingdom is an ongoing issue. In its report, the Home Affairs Committee said that one of the biggest problems facing attempts to tackle trafficking is the lack of any serious current estimates of the scale of the trade in people. The report, which is excellent, goes on to give a conservative estimate of at least 5,000 trafficking victims in the UK, of which just under 1,000 are children. Some estimates state that there are at least 4,000 trafficked women working in the sex industry alone.</p>
	<p pid="a.198.3/23">I am afraid that figures all over Europe are much the same. Nobody knows the extent of human trafficking, as by its nature it is under the radar. Nobody has a clue exactly how widespread it is, although the United Nations calls it the third most serious crime after arms dealing and drug dealing and says that more than 800,000 people a year are trafficked. More people in the world are trafficked in one year than were ever trafficked in the slave trade. The problem is rightly referred to as the new slavery.</p>
	<p pid="a.198.3/24">The Home Affairs Committee expressed disappointment that the United Kingdom Human Trafficking Centre had not made more progress in developing estimates of the scale of the problem, which is one of the main tasks for which it was established. Without reasonable estimates, it is impossible to gauge what support services are needed for victims. Currently, the Government provide long-term funding for just 35 places in safe accommodation for victims, through the POPPY project, on which the Government rely. Although the project does good work, it provides beds, if that is the right phrase, only for women over 18. There are no facilities for children under 18 other than local authorities' provision for children.</p>
	<p pid="a.198.3/25">I am also concerned about the criminalisation of children. The Joint Committee on Human Rights has criticised the Government for refusing to decriminalise children involved in prostitution and for new provisions in the Policing and Crime Bill that will give the police powers to direct a child as young as 10 to leave an area, without necessarily taking into account the child's safety or, more importantly, where the child will go. It is all very well to say that they cannot stay in the area, but where are they supposed to go? The Committee finds it</p>
	<p pid="a.198.3/26" class="indent">&quot;surprising that the Government propose to rely on the criminal justice system to address individual institutional failures within the services available to children and young people. It appears to us to be more appropriate to strengthen the duties and capabilities of children's services to respond to children involved in prostitution, rather than criminalise children for the state's failures.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.198.3/27">Children involved in prostitution are treated not as child abuse victims but as criminals, despite the Government's statement clarifying that involving children in prostitution is a form of child abuse. Will the Government remove the power to prosecute children over the age of 10 for prostitution offences? Children involved in prostitution are victims of child sexual abuse and need protection, not prosecution. Although prosecution numbers are low, the illegal nature of the activity adds to the child's fear of discovery and may act to deter the child further from coming forward to seek help from the authorities.</p>
	<p pid="a.198.3/28">The problem is Europe-wide, because police throughout Europe tend to be unsympathetic, seeing all prostitutes, whatever their age, as prostitutes and not child victims. Many have been trafficked and trapped into brothels. I have seen on the streets of Rome children under the age of 18, some as young as 12, who have been trafficked from Albania. They need help, not criminalisation.</p>
	<p pid="a.198.3/29">The issue was discussed recently during the passage of the Policing and Crime Bill. Baroness Miller emphasised that the right approach was crucial so that children are treated as victims and not criminals. On Second Reading of the Policing and Crime Bill, she said:</p>
	<p pid="a.198.3/30" class="indent">&quot;Nor does the Bill take the right approach to the exploited children in the sex trade. Instead of treating them as the victims they are, it leaves the under-18s to be treated as criminals. That attitude really worries us and will do nothing to help the exploited children in this country or, by example, in the rest of the world. All too often young street-working children in the rest of the world are treated as criminals simply for selling themselves for sex in order eat. We do not want to replicate that problem here in the UK.&quot;&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="lords/2009-06-03.232"><i>Official Report, House of Lords,</i> 3 June 2009; Vol. 711, c. 232</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="a.198.3/31">The Home Office has decided to cease funding the work of the Refugee Council children's panel, whose work concerns age-disputed children. That is odd. All funding to the panel is expected to be terminated in 2010. Why? The UK Border Agency says that the support work provided by the panel is now being done by specialist local authorities. Can the Minister tell us which ones? We have not been able to find any that have taken on such work. The children's panel provides essential support for age-disputed young people, including access to education. I do not know whether the Minister knows this, but there is non-stop dispute about the age of children coming through ports of entry, because if they are under 18, they are treated in one way, and if they are over 18 they are treated in another.</p>
	<p pid="a.198.3/32">I am sure that I have given the Minister enough to chew on, but I will give her a little more in the next four or five minutes. In addition to the removal of funding from such an important organisation as the Refugee Council children's panel, I am puzzled by the removal of funding from the Met. Further cuts have been made within the Met's human trafficking unit, which is being wound down despite the Prime Minister's assurances that more funding, not less, would be given. The Chairman of the Home Affairs Committee, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1674" name="Keith Vaz">the right hon. Member for Leicester, East (Keith Vaz)</phrase>, asked the Prime Minister:</p>
	<p pid="a.198.3/33" class="indent">&quot;Another recommendation from the Home Affairs Committee is on human trafficking, which I know is a concern of his. Will he look at that recommendation, which asks the Government not to cut the funding for the Metropolitan police human trafficking unit? It is very important that we deal with the perpetrators of this very difficult and important crime.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.198.3/34">The Prime Minister replied:</p>
	<p pid="a.198.3/35" class="indent">&quot;I can say to the Chairman of the Select Committee that the unit will have an increased budget; it is not being cut. We are doing whatever we can to support it.&quot;&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2009-05-20.1504"><i>Official Report</i>, 20 May 2009; Vol. 492, c. 1504</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="a.198.3/36">That does not make sense, because the Met tells me that the unit is winding down. The Home Affairs Committee noted the reduction in Government funding for the Met human trafficking unit and recommended that the unit, far from being run down, should be sustained. What is the position with regard to the Met's police work?</p>
	<p pid="a.198.3/37">When will we ratify the Council of Europe convention on the protection of children against sexual exploitation and sexual abuse, which the Government signed more than a year ago? That is directly within the Minister's remit. I can quite understand if she can get out of answering some of the other questions, but she cannot get out of this one. The Government have signed the Council of Europe convention, but have done nothing further.</p>
	<p pid="a.198.3/38">Where do we go? Where does it all leave us? Hopefully, a little nearer to protecting children from sexual exploitation, especially those who have been trafficked, but one must remain somewhat sceptical. Traffickers are far more nimble than the heavy-handed Government bureaucracy that surrounds our efforts. It is right that the professionals working in the field should be better informed and better trained to spot the telltale signs indicating the possibility of child abuse.</p>
	<p pid="a.198.3/39">The European Commission wants us to pass even more legislation to protect children, but as existing legislation has not been implemented effectively, there is not much point in producing even more. That is what the EU does constantly: it persuades its 28 member states to keep passing more and more laws. The trouble is that those laws are not being implemented. We therefore need to focus on what we can do and what we can do well, perhaps starting with the national referral mechanism. I believe that we now have our hands on the levers, but we must pull them to save increasing numbers of children from the indignity and horror of child abuse, often at the hands of traffickers.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-06-23a.209.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1944" speakername="Tim Loughton" colnum="209"  time="011:48:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090623/halltext/90623h0006.htm#09062367000458">
	<p pid="a.209.0/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1881" name="Anthony Steen">the Member for Totnes (Mr. Steen)</phrase>, who has enormous expertise in this area and has campaigned on it for many years. It is unfortunate that there are not more hon. Members here today, because this important subject affects all our constituencies. I know that there are trafficked women in Worthing in my constituency, and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1546" name="Annette Brooke">the hon. Member for Mid-Dorset and North Poole (Annette Brooke)</phrase> admitted that there are some in Dorset. Exploitation happens everywhere, and often in the most unexpected places.</p>
	<p pid="a.209.0/2">I welcome the Minister, who is new to the children's brief. This is an example of where joined-up thinking and action under the remit of the Department for Children, Schools and Families is absolutely key. It needs to work with all kinds of other agencies and colleagues at the Home Office and elsewhere to bring joined-up solutions to this ongoing and, perhaps, worsening problem.</p>
	<p pid="a.209.0/3">My hon. Friend the Member for Totnes gave a comprehensive tour d'horizon of sexual exploitation of children in all kinds of areas, ending with trafficking, on which he has expertise. I recognise some of the domestic problems in broken families to which he alluded. The hon. Member for Mid-Dorset and North Poole mentioned the generational effect: children who have been sexually abused go on to have children who may suffer the same fate. That kind of vicious circle often exists.</p>
	<p pid="a.209.0/4">The very alarming figures that my hon. Friend gave&mdash;that one in six children will experience sexual abuse&mdash;provide a serious wake-up call to everyone in our country. A third of all rapes are of children under the age of 16. We often demonise children as being responsible for crime, but we forget that they are the major victims of so much crime&mdash;rape being one of the more horrendous ones.</p>
	<p pid="a.209.0/5">My hon. Friend made a good comparison when he described the trafficking of children as being the new slave trade. He also made a good point about children being victims: they should not be criminalised for being forced into prostitution at sensitive young ages. We need better awareness and more specialist training&mdash;particularly among some of our professional staff, such as social workers. The General Social Care Council has made recommendations about how better to train social workers who work in child protection. Such social workers work with children at risk from sexual exploitation or from being trafficked and ending up in sexual exploitation in this country, as well as with those who are subject to child abuse.</p>
	<p pid="a.209.0/6">My hon. Friend will know&mdash;because his wife was part of the commission on social workers, which I chaired on behalf of the Conservative party&mdash;that we have produced two reports since 2007, in which we discuss the need to make sure that we have a properly trained, motivated, reinvigorated and resourced social worker work force. Social workers work in very difficult, challenging and depressing areas&mdash;my hon. Friend has touched on several of those&mdash;and it is important that the responsibilities in relation to those are joined up. After baby P, we have head a lot about child abuse at the hands of parents or carers. The figures are alarming: perhaps upwards of three children a week die as a result of abuse or neglect in the home. In addition, 389 young people have gone missing from care since 2000, which is probably a woeful underestimate of the actual figure. My hon. Friend referred to some cases in relation to that.</p>
	<p pid="a.209.0/7">I shall refer to three areas: first, child abuse; secondly, abuse using the internet&mdash;what has been referred to as networked paedophiles; and thirdly, the subject of trafficking, which formed the major thrust of my hon. Friend's comments. We have heard the ghastly figures about child abuse and killings, but we need to appreciate that not enough people have been prosecuted: too many people have proceedings taken against them, but get off.</p>
	<p pid="a.209.0/8">Let us consider some of the figures on the sexual assault of a male child aged under 13. In 2004, only 19 cases were brought under that charge, of which only four people were found guilty. That is a woefully low conviction rate. Those figures had improved. For example, in 2007, the figure had gone up to 81 cases proceeded with, among which half&mdash;41&mdash;had a verdict of guilty. In 2004, 45 proceedings were brought for rape or attempted rape of a child aged under 13, with only three successful convictions. Again, those figures have gone up&mdash;in 2007, the number was 142. We are getting better at detecting some such cases&mdash;perhaps because more people have come forward to report such crimes, which is progress&mdash;but still only 69 were found guilty, which is just over a third. The figures are similar for sexual assault of a female child aged under 13: back in 2004, proceedings were brought against 128 people, but only 29 were convicted. That figure had risen to 448 proceedings, of which 246 ended in a conviction&mdash;rather better progress.</p>
	<p pid="a.209.0/9">Too many people are carrying on such activities under the radar and are not being detected. When they are detected, it is difficult to make charges stick. Too many of the perpetrators of such crimes are still on the loose and getting away with it&mdash;whether it be the abuse or, ultimately, the death of a child. There were serious flaws in the law about joint enterprise, although I am glad to say that the Government addressed them some years ago after a lot of campaigning by many hon. Members on both sides. As a result, both parents can now be prosecuted under the law on joint enterprise when it cannot be proved which parent struck the fatal blow. We have a long way to go to ensure that people are brought to justice and receive appropriate justice for the severity of their crimes.</p>
	<p pid="a.209.0/10">The second issue that I want to touch on is that of sexual images on the internet and the obvious exploitation that that inevitably involves&mdash;every image that ends up on the internet does so because a child has been exploited somewhere down the line, somewhere in a foreign country, in some hidden room. A while ago, I spent a depressing afternoon in the specialist unit at Scotland Yard, speaking to those whose highly depressing job it is to go through literally millions of images and films on seized hard drives. What struck me was how ingenious those who view the images are. Jim Gamble, the chief executive of the child exploitation and online protection centre, has referred to them as networked paedophiles. They are enormously clever at being one step ahead of the authorities. They use technology ingeniously to carry on their sinister activities of swapping, accessing and subscribing to images of very young children and babies in highly distressing situations. They do that as if they were swapping cigarette cards or souvenirs. The lengths to which some people will go to secure such ghastly images, which represent the exploitation of young, vulnerable children at its worst, are extraordinary.</p>
	<p pid="a.209.0/11">I have concerns about funding, which my hon. Friend also mentioned. It has been reported that thousands of cases of children who are portrayed in pornographic pictures and are at risk of abuse are not being investigated properly because of a cash crisis. CEOP is hailed as one of the leading child protection agencies in the world, but despite its excellent work, it faces something of a funding crisis. It had a three-year funding arrangement with Visa and the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children, which are to be congratulated on their support, and the Home Office has also contributed some money. None the less, the work load is so enormous that the funds are just not sufficient.</p>
	<p pid="a.209.0/12">When I visited my sexual offences unit in Sussex, I was told that there was a limit on its funding. The unit needs a lot of resources just to get the appropriate equipment&mdash;as I said, the people involved in these crimes are very clever at hiding images. Then, however, it needs people who are properly trained and able to cope with that equipment.</p>
	<p pid="a.209.0/13">The important point is that we will never prevent indecent images from being posted on the internet. One of the downsides of the internet is that we cannot closely regulate what happens on it. As we know, things can happen well beyond the geographical boundaries of the United Kingdom. The challenge is to cut off the tentacles, like those of an octopus, and to make it as difficult as possible for people to put images on the internet, to profit from them and to access them.</p>
	<p pid="a.209.0/14">That is why the European Financial Coalition has been important. The EFC is an assembly of various firms&mdash;particularly those involved in finance&mdash;including MasterCard, Microsoft, PayPal, Visa Europe, and Allen and Overy. Using those various financial firms, CEOP can cut off some of the tentacles and make it more difficult for the money to flow where people are trying to gain commercial advantage from exploiting images.</p>
	<p pid="a.209.0/15">Things have improved. As Jim Gamble has said,</p>
	<p pid="a.209.0/16" class="indent">&quot;Things have changed radically since the days of Operation Ore. Individual organisations, members of the financial sector and law enforcement agencies have worked hard to undermine the activities of those who sold images of child abuse as commodities. As a result, the organised crime element has diminished year on year as the risk increased and the profit reduced.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.209.0/17">However, it is still going on far too much.</p>

	<p pid="a.211.0/1">On internet images, the idea that we need to cut off the tentacles is all well and good, but this is a worldwide issue. If they are cut off here, they must also be cut off in Vietnam. Does the hon. Gentleman agree that it is no good Britain being jolly good at preventing traffickers and children from coming into this country when there is no Europe-wide and worldwide effort? It is no good saying that we are a wonderful island that does not let any traffickers in if they just go to Spain or Holland instead. Does he agree that we need a Europe-wide approach?</p>

	<p pid="a.212.0/1">No, my hon. Friend was right earlier when he said that we need a worldwide approach. That is why I said that even if we are good at finding the people who are promoting this stuff and posting it on the internet in this country, a lot of such activity is happening in Alaska, Florida, Russia and assorted Pacific islands that are not properly regulated. That is why I refer to the problem as an octopus. We can never clamp down on it altogether because the internet has become such a global phenomenon that it will not disappear overnight.</p>
	<p pid="a.212.0/2">[Mr. Eric Illsley <i>in the Chair</i>]</p>
	<p pid="a.212.0/3">We must make it as difficult as possible for the perpetrators to access the practical means of placing images, accessing them and profiting from them. There has been some success in that. However, we will be successful only if the UK authorities co-operate with European authorities, which is why I mentioned the EFC, and with authorities overseas, not least in America. To a certain extent, Americans have a constitutional right to post obscene images on the internet, and that causes a serious problem. That is why some states have not proceeded against people as forcefully as they might have.</p>
	<p pid="a.212.0/4">I will end on the subject of trafficking. I know the problem well because Gatwick airport is in my Worthing constituency and in West Sussex local authority. Some years ago, I led a debate in this Chamber on the problem of girls being trafficked from western Africa, mostly from Nigeria and Sierra Leone. They were coming to Gatwick airport as unaccompanied asylum seekers under dubious and frightening circumstances. They had been taken from their parents, many of whom had been offered money. In some cases, the girls had been threatened with voodoo curses in frightening circumstances.</p>
	<p pid="a.212.0/5">When the girls turned up at Gatwick airport, they were taken into the care of West Sussex social services and were placed in foster care, which turned out not to be secure enough. Quite often, the pimps would appear in the middle of the night and abduct the girls under the threat that, if they did not comply, a voodoo curse would come down on them or that something terrible would happen to their parents. They would then be trafficked across the channel. Many ended up in northern Italy as prostitutes in places such as Milan. There was a television documentary on the issue. There was a concerted co-ordination of children's services and immigration authorities to clamp down on the problem. To an extent, it has worked, but I fear that it has merely shifted the problem to other places.</p>
	<p pid="a.212.0/6">Trafficking is an enormous problem. As my hon. Friend said, it is big business. The United Nations estimates that child trafficking generates $7 billion to $10 billion annually. Human trafficking is estimated to generate upwards of $30 billion annually. It is cited as the second most lucrative crime after the drugs trade. I think that it has leapfrogged the arms trade. Of all trafficking victims, 30 per cent. are below the age of 18. Child trafficking is increasing dramatically with between 1.2 million and 2 million children being trafficked each year. It is estimated that more than 10 million children are sexually exploited each year. That is a huge problem.</p>
	<p pid="a.212.0/7">I will conclude with the example of the World cup and sporting events, which the Minister may wish to comment on. I am sure that she is or soon will be involved in that area of inquiry. There is good evidence that child trafficking for the sex trade increases with international sporting events. In 2008, the sex trade in Switzerland increased enormously; it has been estimated that up to 3,000 women were sold into the sex trade and smuggled into the country. Of course the World cup next year will be in South Africa, where an estimated 30,000 children are enslaved in prostitution, many of them refugees from Zimbabwe. They come across a porous border, where a substantial part of the population of Zimbabwe live as refugees on very little money, finding a crust where they can. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2038" name="Bob Spink">The hon. Member for Castle Point (Bob Spink)</phrase> and I were in Mozambique two years ago, where we saw the same thing happening because of the situation in that part of Africa. There were huge numbers of refugees, and children were subjected to horrible exploitation.</p>
	<p pid="a.212.0/8">South Africa does not have comprehensive legislation to deal with human trafficking, and last year the US Department of State put South Africa on the tier 2 watch list for the fourth consecutive year, because of its failure to meet the minimum standards for eliminating trafficking, with respect to prosecutions and so on. There exists a powerful lobby representing a minority of South Africans pushing for the decriminalisation of prostitution before 2010. That is very worrying, and in the interest of joined-up working and recognising that the trade is international, I am sure that the Minister, working with her colleagues in the Department for Culture, Media and Sport and the Home Office, will want to liaise with authorities in the sporting world and South Africa, to ensure that the disasters that happened in Switzerland will not be repeated in South Africa on what could, I fear, be a much bigger scale.</p>
	<p pid="a.212.0/9">There are big challenges ahead. The hon. Member for Mid-Dorset and North Poole mentioned private fostering. We shall continue to mention private fostering. I have mentioned it with reference to every measure on which I have led for the Opposition since the Adoption and Children Act 2002, and I still fail to see why the Government do not get it. Private fostering is in too many cases a cover for the exploitation of children who have been trafficked, who end up being abused sexually or in other ways. That has been found in several high-profile cases. I hope that the new Minister will take a fresh look at why private fostering has not been dealt with. A proper registration scheme could be introduced to deal with the situation effectively.</p>
	<p pid="a.212.0/10">We need to work more closely with the home countries of many of the children, not least in west Africa. We should work with children's services departments there to make sure that children do not leave in the hope of a better life or in fear of worse things happening to them and that circumstances will be suitable to enable them to stay with their families and be looked after properly. That is why international co-operation between social services and children's services is crucial.</p>
	<p pid="a.212.0/11">Barnardo's and other voluntary agencies do excellent work. Barnardo's is working on a report on the costs of sexual exploitation. It will expose the high costs to society of that exploitation and the serious consequences for the children and young people who are its victims.</p>
	<p pid="a.212.0/12">Recently, the Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1887" name="Alan Campbell">the hon. Member for Tynemouth (Mr. Campbell)</phrase> rightly said:</p>
	<p pid="a.212.0/13" class="indent">&quot;We remain committed to tackling this appalling crime by making the UK a hostile environment for traffickers, disrupting their organisations and their activities and bringing as many as possible to justice.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.212.0/14">I think that we would all say &quot;Hear, hear&quot; to that. I hope that the new Minister will be resolute in her intentions and ambitions to work with all the other agencies, countries and Departments that can tackle head on the cancer of the sexual exploitation and trafficking of vulnerable children.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-06-23a.215.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1457" speakername="Dawn Primarolo" colnum="215"  time="012:09:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090623/halltext/90623h0007.htm#09062367000463">
	<p pid="a.215.1/1">We would all agree that this challenge will not go away and that it is not a simple problem for which there are simple answers. Since 1997, the Government have been determined to address the very complex challenges of sexual exploitation. We must consider what we do when such challenges come from within a family or are posed by a known family friend or associate. Social workers have to strike a very delicate balance between keeping children with their families, or, as the hon. Gentleman says, taking them into care. What are the protections there? The problem is a global evil. He and other hon. Members are right when they say that we need a much wider response. It is important that we correctly balance the mechanisms in the UK. We must recognise that we still have a long way to go. I will not stand here and say that the problem is all sorted, because, patently, it is not. Complex personal and interpersonal relationships exist within families. Moreover, we must consider why and how a young child comes to be trafficked to the UK and what we should do then.</p>
	<p pid="a.215.1/2">Early identification is key to protecting vulnerable children. As the hon. Gentleman and others said, the Department must work closely across Government and with local government and those responsible for delivering the services to develop clear help and support to the front-line staff who can take the work forward. The hon. Gentleman said that the national referral mechanism enables us not only to do that but to collect the important information that is necessary.</p>
	<p pid="a.215.1/3">The hon. Gentleman mentioned foster carers and the need for diversity. I also heard what the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham said about private foster care, but I shall take that away with me. Local authorities are required to ensure that they have the necessary number of carers, including from minority ethnic groups, to meet the local need.</p>
	<p pid="a.215.1/4">The hon. Member for Totnes touched on Heathrow and the report in <i>The</i><i>Guardian</i>&mdash;that was truly worrying, but it is now being investigated&mdash;but Hillingdon council, for example, is trying very hard to recruit foster parents from its Chinese community, for precisely the reasons that he mentioned.</p>
	<p pid="a.215.1/5">The hon. Gentleman and the hon. Member for Mid-Dorset and North Poole spoke about the removal of children from the UK. I am sure that they know already that no child can be removed from the country until they reach the age of 18, when a decision will be taken on their asylum. However, I take the hon. Gentleman's point about the careful consideration of young people's needs when they reach the age of 18. He also mentioned the question of age determination and the problems of documentation being destroyed and of people trying to get young people into the country. Ultimately, children's services child protection officers must make the sometimes very difficult decision about a child's age.</p>
	<p pid="a.215.1/6">What happens to those young children is crucial. When they enter this country, they must feel that they are in a safe, secure and protected environment. That must be achieved as quickly as possible, for all the reasons that the hon. Gentleman mentioned&mdash;the pressure to run away from protection, for instance. They will need intensive, one-to-one support and perhaps translation services. We must also work to ensure that they&mdash;and their families back in their original homes&mdash;are protected. He is right about that. We must strike a difficult balance between not locking them up&mdash;that will hardly build up the trust and feelings of safety required to make progress&mdash;and protecting them from falling prey to the people who trafficked them.</p>
	<p pid="a.215.1/7">The hon. Gentleman's point about guardians ad litem has been made before, but the case remains to be made for why such guardians would make a difference, given that social work and key personnel advisers are already in place to support these young people.</p>
	<p pid="a.215.1/8">The hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham referred to Gatwick, which, along with Heathrow, is an example of the type of intensive work that we are trying to draw together. Considerable progress has been made over the past 12 months, but much remains to be done. As far as we can tell, from what we have seen over the past 12 months, including the increasing amount of data collected through the referral mechanism, very few young people have disappeared from care. However, we are trying, with all our energies, to find those who have disappeared. I am sure that hon. Members will not pretend for a minute that, for whatever reason, no young people will run away from the place of safety that we feel would serve their best interests, but we must ensure that it is a rare occurrence.</p>
	<p pid="a.215.1/9">The question of trafficked young people must be set in the context of the wider agenda. We must be more prepared to discuss the domestic violence, sexual abuse and exploitation that we see across society. As I told the hon. Member for Totnes, I do not agree with the picture of despair that he paints, but I appreciate people's reluctance to talk about relationships and appropriate behaviours and how we should deal with the problem.</p>
	<p pid="a.215.1/10">I had the privilege yesterday of meeting some young men and women from Barnardo's, who had been brought to the House to discuss with me what it was like for them as children to be part of a family where there was domestic violence and abuse. We also spoke about what we needed to do, as well as working with young children intensively, to ensure better relationships; we said that education should to give them a better and frank understanding of what is wrong or inappropriate behaviour. Indeed, as the hon. Gentleman said, great steps have been made by the Government in arranging sexual assault referral centres and the work now being done on the training of personnel.</p>
	<p pid="a.215.1/11">The hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham raised the question of the trafficking that can result from large international events and the particular vulnerabilities in South Africa, as we move towards the World cup. He will be aware of this, so I shall not recite it, but we protect those of our citizens who go elsewhere. Trafficking is still an offence here, whether or not it is an offence in the country where it is committed, and we will prosecute on the evidence.</p>
	<p pid="a.215.1/12">The hon. Gentleman raised another important point, and I want to give him a modicum of reassurance. It is important at all such events&mdash;the World cup is a classic example&mdash;that Governments speak to one another about our experience and the types of support that we offer, to ensure that young people in particular, but also women in general, are protected. We should not leave unchallenged the clear profit that traffickers seek to make at such events. I shall certainly continue to take that forward.</p>
	<p pid="a.215.1/13">This has been an important debate, and as the new Minister, I am grateful to the hon. Member for Totnes; it is an extremely quick way of getting a full idea of the breadth of issues on the subject. I absolutely take the point made by the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham about the challenge of working across government on the matter. I say to him and to the hon. Member for Mid-Dorset and North Poole that this is not an issue that I shall have to deal with on my own. I will of course be accountable for Government action, but Ministers working together will set the correct standard of debate in this country and help us to achieve the objectives that the hon. Member for Totnes seeks.</p>
	<p pid="a.215.1/14">Child exploitation and sexual abuse are always unacceptable. We will pursue the issue. We will protect those children. We will prosecute whenever we can. We will step up to the plate and do our duty, seeking a global response to the trafficking of young children and women around the world&mdash;and to those who seek to make a profit from them.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-06-23a.218.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1768" speakername="Stephen Crabb" colnum="218"  time="012:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090623/halltext/90623h0008.htm#09062367000466">
	<p pid="a.218.3/1">The hon. Gentleman fights like a tiger for his constituency and makes his point very well. Not only Pembrokeshire is affected. Two other old counties&mdash;Carmarthenshire and Cardiganshire, which is now Ceredigion&mdash;were affected by the abolition of Dyfed and suffer because of the usage of the old county name on the Royal Mail database.</p>
	<p pid="a.218.3/2">Other people in my constituency, especially those who run small businesses, find that the incorrect Royal Mail database creates practical problems and gets in the way of effective listing and marketing. I have corresponded about that matter with the chief executive of Royal Mail and Ministers, unfortunately without making much progress. The purpose of the debate is to find out whether we can, at long last, achieve a solution, and whether I can convince the Minister to recognise the strength of feeling in Pembrokeshire and persuade him to take up the matter more directly with Royal Mail so that it can be resolved once and for all. I recognise that this is by no means the most important or pressing issue facing Royal Mail in 2009, but the fact that it maintains an incorrect, out-of-date database should be a cause of embarrassment and ought to be remedied.</p>
	<p pid="a.218.3/3">It is tempting to think that the issue goes back only 13 years to 1996, when the old administrative county of Dyfed, which covered a large area of west Wales comprising Carmarthenshire, Cardiganshire and Pembrokeshire, disappeared as an entity. The Local Government (Wales) Act 1994 abolished Dyfed as a local authority and it became a so-called preserved county for the ceremonial purposes of lieutenancy and shrievalty. Statutes such as the Sheriffs Act 1887 and the Defence Act 1842 were duly amended to take account of the preserved county status, but for administrative, political and many other purposes, Dyfed ceased to have any meaning whatever. The restoration of the county of Pembrokeshire as a unitary local authority in 1996 was a proud moment for the people of the county. It followed many years of campaigning by local people who never really felt comfortable as part of Dyfed.</p>
	<p pid="a.218.3/4">The key complaint is that since 1996 and the great reorganisation of local government, Royal Mail has continued to maintain a database that uses Dyfed as the county name for postcodes associated with the old county. However, the issue goes back 35 years to the creation of Dyfed by the Local Government Act 1972. A great many people who were active on the issue at that time understood that the creation of Dyfed as a local authority area should have no real impact on the addresses used in the old three counties' areas that were amalgamated by the reorganisation. At the time, many were led to believe that just as Middlesex would continue to be used by Royal Mail long after the London Government Act 1963 abolished the administrative county of Middlesex, Pembrokeshire would be retained for postal address purposes, even after it was subsumed within the new county of Dyfed under the 1972 Act.</p>
	<p pid="a.218.3/5">At this point, I should pay tribute to the work of Councillor Peter Stock, an independent Pembrokeshire county councillor and a former mayor of my hometown of Haverfordwest&mdash;the county town of Pembrokeshire&mdash;who has worked harder on this issue than anyone I know. He has fought tirelessly for his community&mdash;not just for Pembrokeshire's symbols and identity, but for real public services, which have taken a hammering over the decades as the juggernaut of Government centralisation has rolled through west Wales. Councillor Stock is typical of many people in Pembrokeshire who have a huge affection and loyalty for our county.</p>
	<p pid="a.218.3/6">The county of Pembrokeshire is an ancient one. It was first formed as a territorial entity in 1138 and its historical significance stretches back almost 900 years. It is home to 200 miles of the UK's most spectacular coastline, which is now part of the Pembrokeshire Coast national park. It is the birthplace of the most important royal dynasty that this country has enjoyed&mdash;the turbulent but talented family of the Tudors, who transformed this nation. Henry Tudor, who later became Henry VII, was born in Pembroke castle in January 1457.</p>
	<p pid="a.218.3/7">It might interest the Minister to know that Pembrokeshire has its own flag: the gold cross of St. David on a blue background with the Tudor rose at its centre. St. David was a hugely important figure in the early Welsh and English Church and established the outstandingly beautiful city and cathedral that now bear his name in north-west Pembrokeshire.</p>
	<p pid="a.218.3/8">Pembrokeshire's history, culture, symbols and beauty mean that Pembrokeshire people are rightly proud of their county&mdash;it is unique. However, on <phrase class="date" code="1974-04-01">1 April 1974</phrase>, it was amalgamated, along with Cardiganshire and Carmarthenshire, into the newly created super-county of Dyfed, where it remained until 1996, when Dyfed was broken up into three counties.</p>
	<p pid="a.218.3/9">Thirteen years later, Royal Mail has still not caught up. The postcode address file still bears no mention of Pembrokeshire or, for that matter, of Cardiganshire&mdash;Ceredigion as it is now known&mdash;and Carmarthenshire. Instead, a quick search of the database shows that, according to Royal Mail, Dyfed is still the administrative county, more then 13 years after the change.</p>
	<p pid="a.218.3/10">Since I was elected in 2005, numerous constituents and representatives of local businesses have raised this issue time and time again. What is involved is not just the important issue of civic pride, which we should not underestimate, but the practical day-to-day consequences for many of my constituents, who face difficulty in getting their addresses properly recognised.</p>
	<p pid="a.218.3/11">The postcode address file is the most widely used and widely available source of all UK addresses. It is used in the public and private sectors. It is widely used as a tool for geographical referencing. It is the formal database on which Google mapping is based. It is a crucial device in direct marketing. It provides postcodes for satellite navigation systems and it underpins the system that ensures the daily delivery of 80 million or so letters and other items every day. We should make no mistake about it&mdash;this is a serious issue.</p>
	<p pid="a.218.3/12">Only yesterday, I spoke to the chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses in Pembrokeshire, Stephen Cole, who described some of the difficulties that the database creates. He said:</p>
	<p pid="a.218.3/13" class="indent">&quot;The issue regarding the Post Office's continued use of the name of Dyfed rather than Pembrokeshire, is causing great confusion to our members and to their suppliers, especially where the exact address details are required.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.218.3/14">He gave the example of a small business applying for a trade business credit account. The small business will supply its own correct Pembrokeshire address only to be contacted later by the accounts section, which will ask why it used Pembrokeshire when the Post Office database says Dyfed. That wastes a lot of time and effort. This unnecessary hassle arises from Royal Mail's refusal to recognise the county of Pembrokeshire.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-06-23a.235.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1491" speakername="Jonathan R Shaw" speakeroffice="The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Work and Pensions"  colnum="235"  time="013:45:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090623/halltext/90623h0010.htm#09062367000475">
	<p pid="a.235.0/1">It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Mr. Illsley. I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1874" name="Stephen Ladyman">the Member for South Thanet (Dr. Ladyman)</phrase> on raising this important subject, about which he knows a great deal from his previous ministerial position. He set a trap for me in anticipating what I might say. I thought that I would look back at the many Adjournment debates to which he responded to see whether other hon. Members laid the same trap for him. I will put that on my list of things to do.</p>
	<p pid="a.235.0/2">I want to give as much of the available detail as possible, and I hope that I can provide some clarity and commitments. It is right that there has been success in this policy area, as my hon. Friend said, but we need joint working for it to be more effective. I am sure that we agree that that must be demonstrated locally, where services are delivered. We must also ensure that it occurs effectively in central Government, working across Departments. All Departments with which he intends to have the debate want to work together and not in the proverbial silos. We have done, and will continue to do, a number of things to achieve that, and I will outline them later.</p>
	<p pid="a.235.0/3">I have time to talk about the Supporting People programme, which, as my hon. Friend rightly said, rests with the Department for Communities and Local Government. He is aware that, in <phrase class="date" code="2003-04-07">7 April 2003</phrase>, we saw the advent of that programme, which brought together for the first time nine housing-related funding streams from across Whitehall, which was no mean achievement. From its beginning, the main aim of the Supporting People programme has been to end social exclusion and to enable vulnerable people to maintain or achieve their independence through the provision of vital housing-related support to maintain a suitable and stable independent home in local communities.</p>
	<p pid="a.235.0/4">The Supporting People programme provides housing-related support to prevent problems that could lead to hospitalisation, institutional care and homelessness, and it aims to help the smooth transition from independent living for those leaving an institutional environment. The purpose of the programme is to assist in providing a better quality of life for vulnerable people, helping them to live more independently.</p>
	<p pid="a.235.0/5">The programme's vision of bringing together at local level better integrated and more securely funded housing and related services for vulnerable people commanded general support, and still does. The intention is to help many categories of people, including older people who want to continue to live independently and other vulnerable people in our communities.</p>
