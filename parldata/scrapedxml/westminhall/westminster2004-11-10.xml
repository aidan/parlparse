	<p pid=".243.3/1">First, may I thank you, Mr. Taylor, for chairing the sitting? It is the first time that we have crossed paths like this, and I welcome the chance to discuss such a subject with you in the Chair. Secondly, although we are few this morning, that does not reflect on the importance of the issue, and I hope that that fact will come out during the debate.</p>
	<p pid=".243.3/2">The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency&mdash;MHRA for short, although not many people know what the acronym stands for&mdash;is an executive agency of the Department of Health with trading fund status. It replaced or merged with the Medical Devices Agency, or MDA, and the Medicines Control Agency, or MCA, on <phrase class="date" code="2003-04-01">1 April 2003</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".243.3/3">The MHRA's aims are to ensure that medicines for human use, sold or supplied in the United Kingdom, are of an acceptable standard of safety, quality and efficacy; to ensure that medical devices meet appropriate standards of safety, quality and performance; and to promote the safe use of medicines and devices. That is a sterling task. Its stated objectives are to make a major and effective contribution to public health, to provide authoritative and accessible information, to influence international regulation, to support industry and scientific innovation, to operate a successful and fully integrated business, and to minimise the cost of regulation.</p>
	<p pid=".243.3/4">The agency's many activities include overseeing those notified bodies that audit device manufacturers, regulating clinical trials of medicines and medical devices, and promoting good practice in the safe use of medicines and devices. Those are some of its functions.</p>
	<p pid=".243.3/5">My interest in this area stems from a visit I made to the MHRA during the summer. As a result of that meeting, I felt that not enough people were aware of its work, or of how medicines are regulated. Not enough is being made of its work on public health policy and it could have a far more extensive public profile. I am concerned about the bad press it has attracted recently, which is the result of underlying problems in the organisation and how it functions. Those problems must be addressed before an increasingly bad media reputation damages its future credibility. In short, the agency could be a disaster waiting to happen.</p>
	<p pid=".243.3/6">There is nothing more damaging to public trust than a regulatory system that is seen to have no clout, or that seems unwilling to use its power effectively. As the chief executive of the MHRA recently told the Health Committee,</p>
	<p pid=".243.3/7" class="indent">&quot;our prime responsibility is to ensure we protect public health&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".243.3/8">With that stated priority, and with a forthcoming public health White Paper, it seems timely to take a look at one of the major agencies charged with safeguarding it.</p>
	<p pid=".243.3/9">As I said, I decided to raise the issue in Parliament following a visit to the MHRA to see how it works and what it does. I was enthused by the resources and data that its staff had at their fingertips, but thought that much more needed to be made of it. My concern is primarily to raise the profile of the agency and to see it impact more effectively on public health policy.</p>
	<p pid=".243.3/10">I have not been impressed by the agency's communication skills since I secured today's debate. Given its recent bad press over issues such as Seroxat and the Chiron flu vaccine, I would have expected it to take the chance to come forward with some positive messages. However, it sent me a briefing that left me with the impression that it is not interested in putting its name out into the world, or simply that it does not know how to do so.</p>
	<p pid=".243.3/11">The agency points out in its briefing that it has just appointed a director of communications&mdash;a 21st century activity, and I would not argue with the need for it. I hope that the appointment is not merely cosmetic and that it is backed up by a well thought through communications strategy that can help to build public confidence and improve the flow and exchange of information. That is vital, given the growing public perception that the workings of the drugs industry and its regulators are clouded in secrecy and governed by behind-the-scenes manipulation&mdash;a well-nurtured view in communities across the country. It is also vital given that the MHRA is the only regulatory agency that is fully industry funded.</p>
	<p pid=".243.3/12">It is a difficult task to convince people that a regulator entirely funded by the industry it regulates is completely impartial. That is why transparency should be at the heart of its agenda. The MHRA is gaining a reputation for not giving out information. It suspended Chiron's licence at the factory at Speke in Liverpool because of concerns about a bacterial contamination blocking half the United States' vaccine supply&mdash;48 million doses and 2 million United Kingdom doses. It was alleged in <i>The Times</i> that that had happened and that inspectors had been aware of potential problems for some time, but had done nothing about it.</p>
	<p pid=".243.3/13">Let me put the matter straight: I do not believe anything much that I read in the press, but I have not read any robust replies to the accusations. On <phrase class="date" code="2004-10-04">4 October</phrase>, <i>The Guardian</i> revealed that the relationship between the industry through its organisation, the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry, and the regulator might be too close, with evidence of a joint lobbying campaign in Europe, a blueprint by industry for how the MHRA should be run and higher board level representation. Most notoriously, there has been a continuing controversy surrounding the drug Seroxat, the alleged withholding of clinical trial information by GlaxoSmithKline and questionable analysis of the data by the MHRA, as exposed and documented by &quot;Panorama&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".243.3/14">Most recently, claims of increased suicide risk in young adults led the European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products, which licences drugs for use in the European Union, to recommend that Seroxat be prescribed with extra caution for 18 to 29-year-olds whose treatment should be monitored closely. The MHRA endorsed those findings, but has dragged its feet over issuing the necessary warnings and information to GPs and the public.</p>
	<p pid=".243.3/15">It is time for the culture of secrecy to be dealt with. The legal basis for the giving and withholding of information by the MHRA will change with the implementation of the Freedom of Information Act 2000, but the damage done by the public believing that they have been lied to or defrauded is extremely difficult to repair. The workings of the agency need to be reviewed thoroughly. There should be more lay involvement on the committees, openly published minutes and a greater engagement with the public.</p>
	<p pid=".243.3/16">I should acknowledge that there is lay representation on the Committee on Safety of Medicines, which advises the MHRA and runs the yellow card scheme for reporting suspected adverse drug reactions, in which most GPs are involved. I have examined the system and there are piles of yellow cards. The Government have just announced direct reporting by consumers, but, as Mind has stated,</p>
	<p pid=".243.3/17" class="indent">&quot;consumer representation and the championing of consumer rights is not built into the MHRA's structures and processes&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".243.3/18">There is a legal requirement to protect genuinely sensitive market information, but sharing information as openly as possible is of optimum importance. People should be able to find out easily what the organisation does, readily access its services and find out what decisions it is taking and how it is taking them. It seems that the MHRA adopts a restrictive approach to sharing information. As the 2003 National Audit Office report on the MCA pointed out, its public profile is weak compared with that of the Food and Drug Administration in the United States of America. That limits its ability to communicate safety messages to the public and engage with them as a source of information on the effects of medicines.</p>
	<p pid=".243.3/19">The exemplary model of best practice in this country is the Food Standards Agency, which states on its website that its aims are putting the consumer first, being open and accessible, and being an independent voice. It holds its board meetings and key committee meetings in public, which it advertises well in advance. The independence of the agency is reinforced by its arm's-length relationship with the Government. The FSA website states:</p>
	<p pid=".243.3/20" class="indent">&quot;Although the FSA is a Government agency, it works at 'arm's length' from Government because it doesn't report to a specific minister and is free to publish any advice it issues.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".243.3/21">Therefore, I am inclined to support Mind on that issue. It calls for a drug regulatory system that puts consumer safety before commercial pressure and cost. Such a system would require agency access to all trial results, which should be put in the domain of researchers and reviewers and, once a drug is licensed, made available to all.</p>
	<p pid=".243.3/22">There should also be a well-supported consumer committee and consumer representation on other MHRA committees. Also, membership and operations should be transparent and accountable. People should have no personal&mdash;or even non-personal&mdash;interest in the industry that they are reviewing and regulating. The information on which decisions are based should be made available in suitable form.</p>
	<p pid=".243.3/23">Such a drug regulatory system should have sufficient legal powers to ensure access to all drug trial information and adequate funding to verify the accuracy of that information. It may need enhanced legal powers to obtain the information it needs from companies and better funding to ensure it has the resources to use the information fully, act promptly on it and publicise any safety messages effectively. Trial data should be provided as soon as they are available. Finally, the system should give consumer experience of drugs comparable weighting to information from drug trials.</p>
	<p pid=".243.3/24">I am encouraged by initiatives such as the extension of the yellow card system to include direct reporting of adverse effects by patients and the new paediatric medicines initiative, but we probably need an independent inquiry on the workings of the MHRA. That is a priority. I do not in any way want to suggest anything about individuals, but I and others have looked at the records of heads of enforcement who had long careers with GlaxoSmithKline. There is also a head of licensing who held a major post with that firm. We need to ensure that the workings of the agency are investigated externally as independently as possible.</p>
	<p pid=".243.3/25">I want to discuss a few further issues related to the MHRA's remit. The greater emphasis, in terms of discussing its work, seems to be on the medicines side; the medical devices side has been somewhat sidelined since the merger and may well have suffered from it. The MDA was once a leading organisation in Europe, but a senior person has just left it and there is no independence in that area. There is a problem as regards the two arms coming together and both parts having equal weight. It would be interesting to know why there is no head of devices services and diagnostics, and what the agency's intentions are in that regard.</p>
	<p pid=".243.3/26">I want to talk briefly about drug reclassification, because it is part of the choice agenda. The Government, in their December 2003 report &quot;Building on the Best: Choice, Responsiveness and Equity in the NHS&quot;, make a commitment to doubling the rate of medicine reclassifications from five to 10 a year, which is welcome. However, that should be driven by strong evidence of efficacy and safety, and should not be seen to boost industry's profits in any way&mdash;that is a problem&mdash;or to shift the cost of treatment from the NHS to the consumer. The process needs to take into account possible consumer detriment resulting from reclassification. I would like to hear something about that from the Minister.</p>
	<p pid=".243.3/27">I have looked at some advertising overseen by the agency. In particular, I have a personal interest, as do many others here, in the drug simvastatin, a statin, which has been available in a 10 mg dose over the counter since July 2004.</p>
	<p pid=".243.3/28">I do not believe that clinical trials have been conducted in over-the-counter conditions on people deemed to be at moderate risk of coronary heart disease. The public are being subjected to a world-first experiment, as there is no evidence on the safety and efficacy of a 10 mg daily dose of simvastatin for the target group under those OTC conditions. The public need to be alerted to that, although I know that general practitioners have already been alerted. There needs to be a real opening up.</p>
	<p pid=".243.3/29">In relation to the drug, we have heard about the issues to do with drinking grapefruit juice and the likelihood of severe muscular damage and so on. Again, although those claims have appeared in one or two newspapers, it is not generally known whether there is good solid evidence for them. Let us hear from the organisation.</p>
	<p pid=".243.3/30">Decisions should be based on adequate data and data on efficacy, and nothing should be reclassified if there is doubt about the safety of the target population at the dose specified. It is essential that we have a robust, transparent, impartial regulatory process.</p>
	<p pid=".243.3/31">Perhaps we should think seriously about having an inquiry into this organisation. Is it, for example, best equipped to vet pharmaceutical advertising? There are some wonderful advertisements about heart conditions, which I find vague. I know that the words have been changed over the past few months, after various protests but, again, it is the public who see those adverts and think, &quot;I'll have that drug.&quot; Sometimes the evidence changes in midstream, or there is no evidence. We need to know that there is good solid evidence and where we can get it.</p>
	<p pid=".243.3/32">Are the organisation's aims and objectives beyond its means and is it being pulled in too many directions to be effective? Where do its priorities lie in practice? Is it serving commercial interests and arbitrary targets, such as in reclassification, at the cost of public benefit? We need to know. Do the public even know what it is and what it does, or is that brought to their notice only when things go wrong? In fact, do many MPs know about it?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2004-11-10.247.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/891" speakername="Paul Flynn" colnum="247"  time="009:46:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200304/cmhansrd/vo041110/halltext/41110h01.htm#41110h01_spnew1">
	<p pid=".247.0/1">I congratulate my   hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/911" name="Ian Gibson">the Member for Norwich, North (Dr.   Gibson)</phrase> on securing this important debate. I question one thing that he said. When he referred to the credibility of the organisation, one was tempted to ask, &quot;What credibility?&quot; Recent events have proven that it is not a watchdog; it is a pussycat that purrs in front of the pharmaceutical industry and does what it is told. It has an incestuous relationship with the big pharmas and has a close association with the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry. It has a disgraceful recent record. We can look with gratitude to the work not of the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency in protecting the public, but of people such as Sarah Boseley of <i>The Guardian</i> for her expos&eacute; of the organisation, the television programme &quot;Panorama&quot; and Richard Brook of Mind, who courageously resigned from the MHRA in disgust at its activities.</p>
	<p pid=".247.0/2">It is a matter of enormous importance that, in recent history, the regulator is not protecting the 25,000 people who suffered heart attacks and the 7,000 who died from taking a painkilling drug for arthritics that was withdrawn by Merck Sharpe and Dohme in September after being promoted by the regulator and by organisations that exist to defend arthritics. I had a conversation the day that it was withdrawn with one of the executives of Arthritis Care&mdash;a splendid organisation that I have worked with for many years. It has done pioneering work for people with arthritis, particularly in promoting the real beneficial therapies for arthritis, such as exercise, losing weight and displacing the pain through coping mechanisms: all the non-drug treatments. On the day that Vioxx was withdrawn, it was interesting that those who should have been defending the patients suggested that those who were taking the drug should not panic. I should have thought that panic was the appropriate response when someone was taking a drug that was likely to kill them.</p>
	<p pid=".247.0/3">The organisations advised people not to panic, but to find another drug. Over my lifetime, 50 per cent. of medicinal drugs have had nasty, unpleasant side effects, and the other 50 per cent. have nasty side effects that are yet to be discovered. That has been the continuous history of medicinal drugs over the years. Protection did not come from the MHRA.</p>
	<p pid=".247.0/4">Neither did protection come with Seroxat. When business collapsed in the House on one day in March, we had an hour and a half to discuss Seroxat at some length. The contribution of the regulatory body has been derisory. Given the lamentable performance of its group when it gave evidence to the Health Committee, I hope that the Committee will produce a hard-hitting report that will finally put the last nail in the coffin. I do not think that the body can be reformed. We have to set up another. We cannot have the public exposed to the greed of the pharmaceutical industry any longer without protection.</p>
	<p pid=".247.0/5">That is not a criticism. My hon. Friend the Member for Norwich, North is a distinguished scientist. There is no criticism of the science or the quality of the miraculous discoveries that have been made over the past 200 years in pharmaceuticals. However, there is serious criticism of the marketing of those products, which has been based on obtaining maximum profits, with only a cursory glance at safety.</p>
	<p pid=".247.0/6">Seroxat is a licensed drug that is proved to have significant side effects and to induce suicide, particularly in young people. Data have been held on this since 1990. We now know that the MHRA reviewed it five times and always gave it a clean bill of health. However, that organisation, which treats itself seriously and is proud of its qualifications, held information on Seroxat for 10 years, which suggested that dosages above 20 mg were unnecessary and possibly dangerous. Consequently many people may have been wrongly prescribed. It did not do anything about that until 2003.</p>
	<p pid=".247.0/7">We believe that 17,000 people were prescribed doses above that level and advice was given very late in the day to doctors to remind them of the recommended dose. It was not the official watchdog that caused something to be done; it was publicity by energetic, intelligent, resourceful journalists&mdash;people we often criticise. The real watchdogs are those journalists and organisations such as Mind. It is not an insignificant consideration that Mind does not take a penny in support or sponsorship from the pharmaceutical industry.</p>
	<p pid=".247.0/8">It is interesting that Arthritis Care, which promoted Vioxx over the years, states on its website:</p>
	<p pid=".247.0/9" class="indent">&quot;The redevelopment of Arthritis Care's website has been made possible with support from Merck Sharp &amp; Dohme Limited.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".247.0/10">The Depression Alliance Cymru takes very little money from the drugs industry, but the Depression Alliance nationally takes 80 per cent. of its funds from the pharmaceutical industry. As far as I can see its mouth has been bandaged against any criticism of any drug. I have never known it to criticise any drug at any time. That incestuous relationship is something else that the Health Committee is examining.</p>
	<p pid=".247.0/11">It is almost laughable to see the interests of the members of the MHRA. They will all tell us that they are professional people and that they can be regulators at one moment and servants of the pharmaceutical industry the next. However, it is difficult to believe that they can carry out their jobs independently when we look at the relationship of the committee and its sub-committees with the pharmaceutical industry. In the 2002 annual report, 17 of the 34 members of the main committee declare personal interests, which include receiving travel expenses and fees, employment as consultants and the ownership of shares. Fourteen declare non-personal interests such as the receipt of research grants.</p>
	<p pid=".247.0/12">All the main pharmaceutical companies are represented, from AstraZeneca to Roche and the trend continues through the sub-committees of the committee on the safety of medicine. The biological sub-committee has 11 members: 10 of them declare personal interests and three declare non-personal interests. These interests run to several pages. I do not want to weary the Chamber, but the chemistry, pharmacy and standards committee has 14 members, seven declaring personal interests and nine declaring non-personal interests. The pharmacovigilance committee has eight members: two have declared personal interests and six have declared non-personal interests.</p>
	<p pid=".247.0/13">The whole body is part of the pharmaceutical industry, an industry that has a dreadful record of overselling its products, of disease mongering, of trying to encourage a therapy culture in society by convincing every human being that for every moment of pain, boredom, distress, anxiety they feel in their life, they should take a pill of some kind. The whole myth has been built up, not to help humanity, but to serve the greedy interests of the pharmaceutical industry. Many of the marvellous advances that have been made have been damaged by the overselling of many dangerous and damaging drugs. The problems that we now have with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors reveal how the system has not worked in the interests of patients and how the agency has been colonised by the drugs companies, whose commercial interests have been protected as a result.</p>
	<p pid=".247.0/14">The agency has shown itself not to be worthy of our respect or of continuing in its role. At best, it is ramshackle and ineffective; at worst, it could be corrupt. We cannot give examples by which we can say, &quot;Things haven't happened.&quot; I do not think that my hon. Friend the Member for Norwich, North mentioned any names, although I am sorely tempted to. In a newspaper article on <phrase class="date" code="2004-10-04">4 October</phrase>, Sarah Boseley mentioned the name of someone who was in the extraordinary position of advising and serving a drugs company while working for the agency at the same time. That cannot be right. However, the issue would have remained unnoticed had it not been brought to our attention by that newspaper.</p>
	<p pid=".247.0/15">Almost everyone in the country relies on medicinal drugs at some time in their lives, and we deserve protection. We deserve a body whose independence is beyond question, but we do not have one now. We have been badly served by the MHRA.</p>

	<p pid=".250.0/1">I, too, welcome you to the Chair, Mr. Taylor. This is the first time that I have spoken in Westminster Hall under your chairmanship.</p>
	<p pid=".250.0/2">I thank <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/911" name="Ian Gibson">the hon. Member for Norwich, North (Dr. Gibson)</phrase> and congratulate him on securing the debate. He has given us the opportunity to explore an important watchdog regulatory function, which perhaps does not get enough attention in the House, although one or two hon. Members question the agency closely about its work. It is useful to have this debate and to have quite a bit of time to go over the details.</p>
	<p pid=".250.0/3">I want to pick up on several points. In opening the debate, the hon. Gentleman made some powerful points about the remit and work of the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency. He posed important questions, which the Minister needs to answer, about the degree of transparency and the nature of the engagement between the regulatory agency and the industry, and between the agency, consumers and their interests. We need to ensure that the agency is not only seen to be acting independently, but that it is acting independently. I shall return to that point in a minute.</p>
	<p pid=".250.0/4">The hon. Gentleman suggested that there needs to be an inquiry. It is worth noting that the Health Committee is conducting an inquiry into the pharmaceutical industry&mdash;it is attempting to paint a very large canvas. I have read the report of some of the evidence sessions that it has conducted so far, and it is clearly looking at the agency's role. Only time will tell whether it concludes that it or someone else needs to do more work and whether it makes specific recommendations about changing the agency and tipping the balance somewhat in favour of the consumer. However, some of the strong points that have been made in the debate lead me to the view that we need to look again at the balance of interests in the agency.</p>
	<p pid=".250.0/5">We need to ensure that the public interest is seen to be properly reflected in how medicines are made available to the public. In particular, we need to ensure that the industry is properly involved in the process. We need to consider the large sums that it invests in the development of drugs and in trials and examine how information about such issues is made available in a timely fashion to the regulatory bodies. Furthermore, I take the hon. Gentleman's point that we need to think about how consumer interests are represented. In answers to parliamentary questions, Ministers have rightly made the point that lay people have been involved in the agency since its inception. However, it is important to be clear about how much the lay and consumer interest permeates the whole organisation and its culture. That is the question being asked today and it would be useful to get a response from the Minister.</p>
	<p pid=".250.0/6">Reference has already been made to Richard Brook, who served on the Committee on Safety of Medicines working group on SSRIs&mdash;selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. In his evidence, he said:</p>
	<p pid=".250.0/7" class="indent">&quot;The last point I would make, which I think is a very relevant point, is it takes 40 days for the MHRA on average, in the last annual report, to license a drug and yet it takes two years to review antidepressants; and so there is something about the balance that Andrew was talking about that raises a real issue. If it takes eight weeks to get a drug into the market, why does it take two years to sort out its safety afterwards?&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".250.0/8">Some may question whether it really takes eight weeks, but it is relevant to note that Risperidone, a strong anti-psychotic drug that caused concern earlier this year&mdash;<phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/891" name="Paul Flynn">the hon. Member for Newport, West (Paul Flynn)</phrase> has taken a close interest in anti-psychotic medication&mdash;was being used unlicensed in the UK to treat older people with dementia. The relevant Government watchdog received information in 2002 that the risk of strokes was three times higher among older people prescribed this medication, but it finally warned that the drug should not be used only on 9 March 2004. Patients in Canada were warned of the risk of strokes two years earlier. In an answer I received from the Department of Health on <phrase class="date" code="2004-03-24">24 March</phrase>, it was said that:</p>
	<p pid=".250.0/9" class="indent">&quot;The MHRA is represented on the CPMP and its Pharmacovigilance Working Party (PhVWP), which meet monthly and provide a regular forum for discussion of drug safety issues within the European Union. An electronic communication system allows rapid exchange of drug safety information between member states.&quot;&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2004-03-24.825"><i>Official Report</i>, 24 March 2004; Vol. 419, c. 825W</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid=".250.0/10">The point is that mechanisms are supposed to be in place to allow our regulator to be aware at an early stage of concerns and of the weight to be attached to them. The pharmacovigilance working party is apparently in regular video conference contact with the US Food and Drug Administration yet it took two years for our agencies to come to a conclusion that had already been reached across the Atlantic in Canada and the United States, and to take the necessary protective measures. How many elderly people in care homes or elsewhere suffered strokes or great disability or even lost their lives as a result of being prescribed this drug?</p>

	<p pid=".251.1/1">I am drawing attention to Richard Brook's contribution and the questions he asked about pressures. I was going to end with this point, but it is worth bringing it up now to respond to that question. Brook's argument, which the Minister must address, is that the organisation is risk averse and is constantly looking over its shoulder, fearful of being a victim of legal action or a challenge in the courts for acting peremptorily.</p>
	<p pid=".251.1/2">In his evidence to the Select Committee on 14 October, Richard Brook said:</p>
	<p pid=".251.1/3" class="indent">&quot;Every time we made difficult decisions, there was always this issue of: 'We have got to be very careful because the pharmaceutical companies will sue us if we get this wrong; they will take us to court and take us through legal processes'; and it was very clear that the MRHA officials were very mindful of the whole time of that dimension, to my view, more than the dimension of public health and public responsibility of the public.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".251.1/4">He continued that</p>
	<p pid=".251.1/5" class="indent">&quot;it is a very difficult thing to be confident about the transparency of the regulator when so many people have got long histories, career histories, in the pharmaceutical company.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".251.1/6">That pressure, real or imagined, is clearly having an effect&mdash;certainly in Mr. Brook's view.</p>

Is the Committee on Safety of Medicines so frightened to tell the truth about the accuracy of the data or does it dodge giving any messages at all? Has it ever appeared on Radio 4?</p>

	<p pid=".252.0/1">I listen to Radio 4 quite a bit, but not enough to say whether the CSM has appeared on it. The hon. Gentleman's point about a communications director having only recently been appointed says a lot about the organisation's posture. Is it a public-facing organisation or is it an industry-facing organisation? Perhaps it urgently needs to take advantage of that appointment to ensure not only that it informs Members of its work more effectively, but that it makes the public more aware.</p>
	<p pid=".252.0/2">To come to my second point, the Government have indicated their willingness in principle for the patient&mdash;the consumer&mdash;to be much more directly involved in the reporting of adverse reactions, through the yellow card system or a parallel system. That has to be welcome. A number of those who submitted evidence to the Select Committee said that the best way to ensure that more information about adverse reactions was captured in the system would be to involve the person affected directly. The people concerned have the greatest vested interest in reporting, but they are outwith the system.</p>
	<p pid=".252.0/3">We know from parliamentary answers that more than 150 people a day are admitted to hospital because of bad reactions to medicine. Approximately 20,000 adverse drug reactions a year are reported to the MHRA and the CSM through the yellow card scheme, of which approximately 3 per cent. are suspected adverse drug reactions with a fatal outcome.</p>

	<p pid=".252.1/1">The hon. Gentleman is making an important point about communication with individual patients, but does he not also think that the organisation should liaise more closely with the user groups that have sprung up to draw attention to the SSRIs that my hon.

	<p pid=".252.2/1">The organisation must be seen as genuinely even-handed in its treatment of all parties. It must be more permeable and open to engagement with consumer and interest groups of the kind that the hon. Gentleman mentioned. His point is fair and must be part of any review of how the new body works. That is something that I hope the Select Committee will consider carefully, especially given the recent experiences that the hon. Member for Newport, West described.</p>
	<p pid=".252.2/2">I was outlining some of the figures. There were 722 fatal suspected adverse drug reactions in 2003, the last year for which figures are available.</p>

	<p pid=".252.4/1">Let me finish the figures, then I will be happy to give way. Back in 1997, the figure was 446, so there has been a 62 per cent. increase in the number of reported adverse drug reactions with a fatal outcome. That is a significant increase. Adverse drug reactions make up 6 per cent. of hospital admissions, but they are, according to a study by researchers from the university of Liverpool in the <i>British Medical Journal</i> earlier this year, in most cases avoidable. Nearly 10 per cent. of adverse drug reactions were definitely avoidable through drug treatment procedure that is consistent with knowledge of good medicine practice, whereas nearly two thirds&mdash;63 per cent.&mdash;were possibly avoidable.</p>
	<p pid=".252.4/2">I recently asked a parliamentary question about what plans the Government had to introduce a system to use the yellow card system to learn about correct dosage and prescribing methods, particularly for children. The answer that I received said:</p>
	<p pid=".252.4/3" class="indent">&quot;The yellow card scheme is not designed to enable lessons to be drawn about correct dosage or prescribing methods for medicines for children. There are no plans to introduce a system of learning in this context.&quot;&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2004-11-03.319"><i>Official Report</i>, 3 November 2004; Vol. 426, c. 319W</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid=".252.4/4">However, the research shows clearly that an awful lot of poor prescribing practice results in people being admitted to hospital. Surely the Government have an interest in reducing inappropriate admissions as a result of such prescribing practices. Will the Minister say whether the Government might still consider action on that?</p>

	<p pid=".253.0/1">I remind the hon. Gentleman of a previous Minister's answer to my question about the number of deaths from a particular drug. He might be pleased to know that the yellow card figure showed that the number of deaths went down last year from 62 to 48. However, the true figure obtained from coroners' courts showed that the number of deaths had risen from 580 to 640. The yellow card scheme has never given anything but a ludicrous underestimate&mdash;a snapshot&mdash;of the figures. The system has no credibility.</p>

	<p pid=".253.1/1">I am not sure that it has no credibility. The hon. Gentleman is right that it is probably not used anything like as much as it should be, and that there is significant under-reporting. The question that I have to ask the Minister&mdash;I believe that the hon. Gentleman has also asked it&mdash;is how data collected from the system are analysed and used in the public interest, and who has access to them. The Government have said that they are carrying out a review about who might have access to that data and how and when they are used.</p>
	<p pid=".253.1/2">That data could and should be a valuable tool. Some 500,000 records are kept of adverse reactions over the years, which researchers should use much more effectively to obtain a much clearer picture of why there are adverse reactions. I accept the hon. Gentleman's point that often only what amounts to the tip of the iceberg is reported, but the data could be used far better, and I hope that the Minister will say where the Government have got to with the review and when they intend to publish its conclusion. I hope that the conclusion will be that the process will be far more transparent and open.</p>
	<p pid=".253.1/3">The hon. Member for Norwich, North referred to access to information, and I was struck by some of the comments made during the Select Committee's consideration of the matter about the difference between the attitude in this country to the control of information and access to it by the public and consumer groups, and the attitude across the Atlantic in the United States. The Federal Drugs Administration has a website that will put almost all this information into the public domain.</p>
	<p pid=".253.1/4">We can access the information on the FDA website, but we cannot see it on a website provided by our own regulatory agency. That is an anomalous position in a world that has the internet, which has no such boundaries. The public should be able to see our own agency providing the same sort of service to them. Will the Minister comment on that?</p>
	<p pid=".253.1/5">The problem of capturing only the tip of the iceberg needs to be addressed. The National Audit Office carried out research on this a few years ago and recommended that we need to move from a non-mandatory to a mandatory system of reporting. There is certainly a very powerful case to be made for that. France has a mandatory reporting system. When will the Government decide whether we should move away from the current voluntary arrangements?</p>
	<p pid=".253.1/6">The expansion in the number of people who can report&mdash;the inclusion of nurses and the plans to include patients&mdash;is welcome, but when will the reporting system become mandatory, given that GPs in particular say that one reason why they do not submit yellow cards is that it never comes to mind at the right time? They say that they are not sure what should be reported, that it takes too long to fill out the form, that it is not easy to find a yellow card when necessary, and that reporting generates too much extra work. Those are just some of the reasons that GPs give for not submitting their yellow cards. That cannot be an acceptable basis for a system that should be about giving clinicians information about what works and what is risky.</p>

	<p pid=".254.1/1">The hon. Gentleman makes a very fair point about the ever-growing burden of form filling and paperwork on GPs and others, and about the consequences of the target and tick-box culture that drives that. That means that yellow cards are missed on the radar, which is another reason why they must be made mandatory to ensure that more information is captured.</p>
	<p pid=".254.1/2">Only 74 incidents were reported in the first year of the electronic yellow card system, which was introduced back in October 2002. It would be useful if the Minister could tell us what is being done to promote wider use of that service and to publicise it. That uptake is surprisingly low for what should be a much simpler way of providing information to the MHRA.</p>
	<p pid=".254.1/3">I want to conclude by mentioning the relationship between the MHRA and the pharmaceutical industry. At the beginning of the year Mr. Brooks said to <i>The Guardian</i>:</p>
	<p pid=".254.1/4" class="indent">&quot;At present the MHRA listens far too closely to the concerns of major pharmaceutical companies and not nearly closely enough to people experiencing side effects from drugs that should be making them better, not worse.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".254.1/5">His criticism came two months after he resigned from the MHRA experts group on selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, claiming that it failed to protect patients from potentially harmful doses of the antidepressant Seroxat.</p>
	<p pid=".254.1/6">The debate today is about whether the agency, which is funded solely by the industry, provides the safeguards and reassurance that the public should have about the medicines being made available to them. The hon. Member for Newport, West described in very strong terms the concerns that those outside the agency have about its role. It might be characterised as a paper tiger, or a toothless tiger&mdash;he described it as a pussycat.</p>
	<p pid=".254.1/7">Whether it is a pussycat or a watchdog, there are serious concerns about the fact that two years are spent on some matters by an agency that can give a licence in 40 days; that will not necessarily carry public confidence. The example of the Food Standards Agency given by the hon. Member for Norwich, North is a good one. It has set a benchmark for credibility and confidence building that other Government agencies should perhaps be trying to reach. We need to maintain confidence so that the industry and the public will benefit and, as a result, society as a whole will benefit from medicines.</p>

	<p pid=".255.2/1">The hon. Gentleman makes a good point, which rather underscores the one I was about to make&mdash;if I, as a shadow health spokesman and, indeed, an ex-GP, know little about the organisation in question, perhaps the general public know even less. That is dreadful, particularly when we compare it with knowledge of the equivalents on the continent and in America. The relevant bodies there are well known and well respected. Importantly, they are listened to.</p>
	<p pid=".255.2/2">I suspect that what is already emerging in our debate is the fact that the agency has very few friends. It appears not to be on particularly good terms with patients and the organisations that represent them. Indeed, it seems not to be on particularly good terms with the industry, despite the apparent over-representation of the industry on its board.</p>
	<p pid=".255.2/3">I am reluctant to lay into individuals, however. When organisations are being considered, I prefer to examine their structures and how they are constituted. The fault in that context lies with the Government, Ministers and, ultimately, Parliament. We need first to look to ourselves to discover why the organisation, which is apparently failing rather badly, is as it is and how we can either reform or replace it so that it can carry out its stated functions more effectively. I sincerely hope that after this debate, given the strength of feeling that has legitimately been expressed, the Minister will think about the organisation and how to improve it.</p>
	<p pid=".255.2/4">I want to focus on some structural problems that I believe have inhibited the agency from doing its job properly. The hon. Member for Norwich, North mentioned my background. My dealings with the MHRA and its predecessors chiefly involved the yellow card system. I was rather horrified to hear him describe seeing piles and piles of yellow cards when he visited the MHRA recently. What were those cards being used for? How was the information on them being collated and transformed by the agency into useful information that might inform any decisions or recommendations that it makes?</p>
	<p pid=".255.2/5">Under-reporting is a feature of our health care system. Indeed, the Minister of State, Department of Health, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1332" name="Rosie Winterton">the hon. Member for Doncaster, Central (Ms   Winterton)</phrase>, admitted in a recent parliamentary answer:</p>
	<p pid=".255.2/6" class="indent">&quot;The number of reports received via the yellow card scheme does not directly equate to the number of people who suffer adverse reactions to drugs for a number of reasons including an unknown level of under-reporting.&quot;&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2004-04-19.222"><i>Official Report</i>, 19 April 2004; Vol. 420, c. 222W</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid=".255.2/7">That is a gross understatement. A small minority of adverse reactions to medicinal products are reported through the yellow card system or in any other way. To be fair to the MHRA, if it is basing what it does on inadequate information input of that sort, it is hardly surprising that it is failing.</p>
	<p pid=".255.2/8">I am very concerned about Seroxat, which is the flagship product that has drawn attention to the MHRA in a negative way. There appears to have been a significant delay after concerns were initially expressed, which perhaps stem from the excess of suicidal behaviour among those taking the product over and above what one would expect from people on a placebo. Such a delay is unacceptable, which is what set alarm bells ringing in relation to the agency.</p>

	<p pid=".256.0/1">Does not a significant criticism of this body relate to its competence, because in its examinations of Seroxat it did not get into the raw data from the trials that took place? All the agency looked at, and all it had in its possession, were the conclusions. We now know that had the data been looked at, it would have been known that the firm, GlaxoSmithKline, suppressed information. The trials showed that the drug had no utility; it was no better than placebos. Furthermore, it increased suicidal tendencies in the young. This is a question not just of delay, but of whether this body is competent, given that it looked only at the conclusions, not the raw data.</p>

	<p pid=".256.1/1">I am grateful for that intervention. I intend to raise the difficulty that we have with the publication of negative conclusions. I think that 38 per cent. of independent studies of medicines produce unfavourable conclusions, whereas only 5 per cent. of studies funded by pharmaceutical companies produce negative conclusions. That is published information. So, there is a problem with negative reporting. The Minister must think carefully about how we can encourage negative reports to appear in the literature and require pharmaceutical companies to publish all data, whether negative or positive, because clearly the pharmaceutical industry has an interest in suppressing information showing that its products have a negative or neutral effect. I suspect that some difficulties surrounding Seroxat revolve around that.</p>
	<p pid=".256.1/2">These problems do not stop with Seroxat, however, as 3,000 children in this country are on a product that is marketed here as Effexor. Again, that product can cause suicidal and aggressive behaviour. In that connection, we are worried about trialling the product specifically on children&mdash;an issue that others have raised&mdash;and the possibility of suppression of negative reporting. It is extremely important to realise that the medical press favours positive reports; it does not particularly like negative ones. However, if we are to get a true impression of whether a product has a positive effect that outweighs the negative effects, which I have to say most products have, it is vital that negative reports, as well as the positive ones, are in the public domain and accessible for those such as the MHRA, which, in a reformed state, one hopes would consider all the evidence available when making its recommendations to Ministers and others.</p>
	<p pid=".256.1/3">The system for reporting adverse effects stems from the 1960s and relates to thalidomide. At that time, GPs were very willing to report adverse effects and it was assumed that they would report them all fairly rigorously. That practice has fallen away dramatically and we need better surveillance methods to determine whether a product has adverse effects.</p>
	<p pid=".256.1/4">I am pleased that the yellow card system has been extended to other health care professionals, principally nurses, and that it is easier for patients to report adverse effects. I am interested in the use of NHS Direct in that connection and I hope that the Minister tells us the early results of that initiative, as they would be useful to know. I am doubtful that it will be particularly effective, given my experience of telephoning NHS Direct: I was kept on hold for 20 minutes. My strong suspicion is that most people who telephone the service, especially those who want to report minor adverse effects, would probably give up in half that time. Nevertheless, it would be interesting to know what part the Minister thinks NHS Direct can play in reporting adverse effects.</p>
	<p pid=".256.1/5">Dr. Andrew Herxheimer said recently in the <i>International Journal of Risk and Safety in Medicine </i>that the yellow card system is &quot;chaotic and misconceived&quot;. I know from my own experience that that is the case. The fault lies with those who are tasked with reporting using the yellow card system. However, the paperwork and bureaucracy&mdash;the tick-box culture&mdash;among which practitioners now have to work do not help, because they dilute what is essential in reporting.</p>
	<p pid=".256.1/6">The yellow card system was set up a long time ago in a different environment, in the downdraft from the thalidomide scandal, and it has perhaps become less important in the minds of many practitioners. However, it is vital that it is brought to the fore. Making reporting mandatory may be a way ahead, but that would be difficult to police. The current system is not acceptable, although I do not entirely share the view expressed by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/891" name="Paul Flynn">the hon. Member for Newport, West (Paul Flynn)</phrase> that it is pretty useless.</p>

	<p pid=".258.0/1">I know of no academic researcher who takes any notice of the yellow card system. If people want data on the side effects of medicines, they go elsewhere for them. The system has never had any such reputation. The Library never quotes the yellow card system when asked for information. In the example I gave, not only did that system underestimate the number of deaths by 90 per cent., but it also gave the wrong trend.</p>

	<p pid=".258.1/1">I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for that information, which perhaps accounts for the piles of yellow cards that the hon. Member for Norwich, North saw and the implication that they were sitting there unattended. I hope that that message does not go out to GPs. I have filled in yellow cards and if I thought that they were not being attended to, I would be even less likely to do anything about them. I suspect that they are filled in if there are severe adverse effects, but not if there are lesser ones.</p>
	<p pid=".258.1/2">I entirely agree with the hon. Member for Newport, West that the system is likely to be flawed, but I hope that it is not fatally flawed and that it flags up some serious side effects. I filled in the yellow cards when I was a GP; if I was being honest, I would have to say that I did so when there was a severe side effect, rather than something I was uncertain about.</p>
	<p pid=".258.1/3">That is important, especially in the context of side effects associated with the underlying condition, particularly when one is dealing with mental health, for example. Indeed, one side effect of Seroxat appears to be suicidal behaviour, but some would say that that is a feature of the underlying condition for which Seroxat is being prescribed. In those circumstances, one has to feel sympathy for the doctor, who is trying to disentangle what, on the balance of probabilities, is due to the drug and what is due to the underlying condition. I say in all candour that it is often very difficult to determine that.</p>
	<p pid=".258.1/4">The cases that I remember reporting using the yellow card system were reasonably barn-door. There were, for example, cases in which hyperkalemia&mdash;raised potassium levels&mdash;occurred in relation to a drug for which that was a reported known side effect, and in which there was no other particular reason for the patient to have a raised potassium level. In such cases, I suspect that the yellow card system is used reasonably well and in a way that might be effective and might prompt the MHRA, with all its faults, to take some note&mdash;providing the data are being collated. However, for the rest, I agree that if the system is to be useful it must be radically overhauled. We need to ensure that all practitioners are aware of it, have confidence in it and feel that the data they are submitting will be useful and used.</p>
	<p pid=".258.1/5">I am also concerned about the proliferation of agencies in the field. I wonder whether some problems that the MHRA experiences are related to confusion about the boundaries. We now have, in addition to the National Patient Safety Agency in the immediate area, the National Coordinating Centre for Health Technology Assessment, the National Institute for Clinical Excellence and the Committee on Safety of Medicines. I am confused about the boundaries between those various organisations. There are many different voices&mdash;that does not tend to be the case in other countries&mdash;and I wonder whether that dilutes the voice of the MHRA in performing its important function. Will the Minister comment on that?</p>
	<p pid=".258.1/6">I said earlier that the MHRA has few friends. The industry&mdash;particularly small-scale industry&mdash;seems not to be particularly impressed with it. It involves cost that does not apply on the continent. I have been contacted by someone in the field who works across the European Union. He says that in no other health economy is there quite such a burdensome system that applies particularly to small organisations and start-up organisations working out of universities and that that is causing a real problem for those who are trying to bring innovations online.</p>
	<p pid=".258.1/7">We need a rigorous way to regulate the industry&mdash;one of our tasks in this place is to ensure that public health is protected&mdash;but I worry that we have an organisation that is both burdensome to innovators and failing to protect the public adequately. I hope the Minister takes away the comments that have been made in the debate and has a serious look at the organisation.</p>

	<p pid=".259.0/1">I am pleased to answer the points raised in the debate and to congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/911" name="Ian Gibson">the Member for Norwich, North (Dr. Gibson)</phrase> on raising the topic of the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency.</p>
	<p pid=".259.0/2">As patients and carers become increasingly aware of their own health care choices, it is important that the impact of the work of the UK regulator of medicines and medical devices is better known. Having access to information, in this case about medicines and devices, is at the heart of patient choice, which is a Government priority for the NHS.</p>
	<p pid=".259.0/3">In my opening remarks, I want to underline a number of key points about what the agency is, what it is responsible for and the impact that it has. Without doubt, products regulated by the agency have a major impact on all our lives. I will try to give hon. Members a sense of the scale of that impact. In 2001, nearly 600 million prescriptions were dispensed in the UK and   some 700 million packages of non-prescription medicines were supplied. Those range from innovative products designed to treat major, life-threatening illnesses to generic versions of common painkillers. Devices ranging from walking aids and examination gloves to radiotherapy machines and resuscitators are used in our hospitals, care homes and, increasingly, in our homes. It is estimated that more than half the UK population has contact with a medical device in any one day.</p>
	<p pid=".259.0/4">The MHRA is an executive agency of the Department of Health, which employs some 750 people, and it has an annual budget of about &pound;65 million. It was created on 1 April 2003 from the merger of the Medicines Control Agency and the Medical Devices Agency. Most of its staff are medical, scientific or technical, but the MHRA is also responsible for providing policy advice to Ministers on medicines and devices issues.</p>
	<p pid=".259.0/5">The merger was a logical step in the development of the two agencies. Hon. Members have not particularly touched on this, but the boundaries between medicines and devices are blurring: we already have many drug-device combination products such as drug-eluting stents on the market, and emerging technologies, such as nanotechnology and tissue engineering, will require a new approach to regulation. Ultimately, patients, users of medicines and medical devices, and health care professionals who rely on the safety advice of the agency should benefit most from the merger.</p>
	<p pid=".259.0/6">I will briefly explain what the agency does. To put it simply, medicines have to be authorised before they can be placed on the market in the UK or European Union. The regulator must be satisfied that the product meets set standards of safety, quality and efficacy. The MHRA also regulates the manufacture of pharmaceuticals, and ensures that rules governing the sale, labelling and advertising of medicinal products are followed. Crucially, it operates a system for the surveillance of products on the market, in which suspected adverse reactions are reported and stored on a database on which more than 500,000 reports have been collected over 40 years. That is the yellow card scheme to which my hon. Friend the Member for Norwich, North and other Members referred.</p>
	<p pid=".259.0/7">Devices are regulated quite differently in many respects. I have already mentioned the diversity of products; that diversity influences the way in which the sector is regulated. For most products, the system involves the monitoring of safety in use, rather than pre-authorisation, and is based on the CE mark, which is awarded by a notified body in one of the member states. The regulator audits the notified body to ensure that its decisions are correct.</p>
	<p pid=".259.0/8">Before I address the specific issues raised by hon. Members, I will briefly touch on the role of stakeholders. A body with such diverse functions has a wide range of stakeholders. First, of course, come members of the public, patients, clients of social services departments, carers, and all users of medicines and medical equipment, but stakeholders also include professionals in health and social services who need to act on the safety advice broadcast by the agency. Manufacturers of pharmaceuticals and medical devices also have a right to expect high standards of service from the agency.</p>
	<p pid=".259.0/9">I turn to the impact of the agency on public health and point out that it regulates products that are in common use. It is therefore of crucial importance. Protecting public health is at the heart of the regulation of devices and medicines. The yellow card scheme is the cornerstone of the UK monitoring scheme. The agency has recently reviewed its policy in that area, and is considering, on behalf of Ministers, ways of increasing access by researchers to the yellow card database.</p>
	<p pid=".259.0/10">Monitoring systems for devices, and the system of liaison officers set up in NHS trusts, ensure that any devices issues can be resolved through prompt action by the agency. Surveillance programmes have allowed the agency to lead the way in several high profile areas of drug and device safety to ensure that there is a consistent approach to important issues for public health.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2004-11-10.261.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1000" speakername="Melanie Johnson" colnum="261"  time="010:33:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200304/cmhansrd/vo041110/halltext/41110h01.htm#41110h01_spnew23">
	<p pid=".261.0/1">I will in a moment, but I have not addressed any of the points that have been raised. If the hon. Gentleman raised one such point, perhaps he will give me the chance to get to it.</p>
	<p pid=".261.0/2">The surveillance programmes include hormone replacement therapy, which has not been mentioned, anti-psychotics, which have the risk of stroke, and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, or SSRIs. I will come to those specific points.</p>
	<p pid=".261.0/3">The agency uses other resources to protect public health: another key database is the general practice research database, which holds anonymised clinical records supplied by GPs. The database, which has not been mentioned much in the debate, is used by the MHRA and internationally for regulatory pharmacovigilance decision making. The value of such a unique resource has been recognised by the United States Food and Drug Administration, which hon. Members have cited as an exemplar in such matters. The FDA is using the MHRA's database, by acquiring a five-year licence to use the data, to support its own drug safety monitoring programmes, which I hope brings a little doubt to the minds of hon. Members about some of the aspersions that they have cast in the direction of the agency.</p>
	<p pid=".261.0/4">Seroxat and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors have benefited millions of people. I thought that the account of my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/891" name="Paul Flynn">the Member for Newport, West (Paul Flynn)</phrase> rather neglected the benefits of medicines and drugs, although he made a passing reference to them, as well as the occasional risks and difficulties&mdash;some serious and some not so serious&mdash;that are experienced by people who take such medicine. Serious side effects are rare in the case of Seroxat and SSRIs. Seroxat has been used by more than 160 million people worldwide. Suicidal behaviour during treatment may be linked to illness and may not necessarily be due to the drug. However, the Government and the MHRA take such issues seriously.</p>
	<p pid=".261.0/5">All medicines, including Seroxat, are licensed on the available data at the time, but their benefits are kept under constant review. Seroxat and the other SSRIs are associated with an improvement in safety in overdose and are better tolerated by patients than other main classes of medicines used in the treatment of depression, the tricyclic antidepressants. An expert working group of the Committee on Safety of Medicines is undertaking a comprehensive, independent scientific assessment of the available data relating to the safety of SSRIs, particularly withdrawal reactions and suicide behaviour.</p>
	<p pid=".261.0/6">The expert group sought and considered evidence from a wide range of sources, including a specific objective to listen to the patient voice. I hope that hon. Members know that it has already reached conclusions on the use of SSRIs in children and the Government have published the findings on that, including the results of the clinical trials. That unprecedented step goes further than any regulator has ever done and demonstrates our commitment to being as open as possible in drug regulation. The expert group is now focusing its attention on the use of SSRIs in adults and hopes to conclude its full and thorough review before Christmas. No doubt hon. Members will be interested to receive that information when it is published and to examine the findings.</p>
	<p pid=".261.0/7">I want now to discuss the withdrawal of Vioxx and point out to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/769" name="Paul Burstow">the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam (Mr. Burstow)</phrase> that the Canadians took action on Risperdal, which is an anti-psychotic drug, not the drug Vioxx that was withdrawn worldwide in September. The United Kingdom acted on Risperdal as soon as the evidence was available. The drug was licensed for different uses in Canada and was licensed specifically for use by elderly people. That was not replicated in this country. From the advice that I have received, the hon. Gentleman gave the wrong impression about the time scale. The company, Merck Sharp and Dohme, withdrew Vioxx based on the emerging findings of clinical trials, which showed an increased risk, as hon. Members have said, of coronary heart events when people had taken the drug for more 18 months.</p>
	<p pid=".261.0/8">We thought carefully about the advice given to patients, but the advice that we received both from the MHRA and our advisers within the Department about the time scale of withdrawal was to allow patients to spend a week or so to see their GPs before they were taken off the drug and put on to another one. The risk was not great enough to necessitate more rapid action. Had it been, we would, of course, have given different advice.</p>

	<p pid=".262.1/1">I have not. My noble Friend Lord Warner deals daily with these matters in the Department, but I cannot tell my hon. Friend whether he has communicated with the company on this matter because I have no briefing on it at the moment.</p>

	<p pid=".262.2/1">Will the Minister check again and write to me about the chronology of decisions taken by this country's regulatory agencies and the Canadian regulatory agencies? The latter took their decisions some two years ago, or possibly even earlier. The answers that I have so far received to parliamentary questions led me to make the comments that I did. The period of two years seems relevant.</p>

	<p pid=".262.3/1">All I can comment on at the moment is the advice that I have received and relayed to the hon. Gentleman. I will, of course, reconsider the issues that he raises, and see whether a further point needs to be made. He will not necessarily learn anything new from our simply standing by our answer to an earlier written question.</p>
	<p pid=".262.3/2">I will make a point about the agency's relationship with industry that I believe hon. Members will be keen to hear. The working relationship that the agency needs to have with industry does not inhibit the scientific and regulatory independence of the MHRA. Industry representatives do not participate in any management, executive or advisory functions, with the exception of the statutory representation on the agency's medicines commission bodies.</p>
	<p pid=".262.3/3">A significant proportion of the MHRA's senior scientific staff are, of course, recruited from, or have a history in, the industry. That is necessary, as they make up the largest single pool of specialist advice for effective drug regulation. They must be drawn from the industry; there is no other source. We do not operate the sort of secondment programme operated by other bodies because of the relationship between the two.</p>
	<p pid=".262.3/4">I alert hon. Members to the fact that the agency has been reviewing the advisory committee structure, and has taken the opportunity to reconsider the arrangements in place for managing interests&mdash;an issue that my hon. Friend the Member for Norwich, North and others have raised a great deal. Proposals are being drafted that will bring UK policy into line with new EU legislation, which requires that experts should have no financial or other interest in the pharmaceutical industry that could affect their impartiality. My noble Friend Lord Warner will make a more detailed announcement on the issue very shortly. Members will therefore appreciate that there are other issues that I cannot discuss this morning.</p>

	<p pid=".263.3/1">We need to accept that the pool of people who may have a background in the drugs industry and who understand how it works are likely to be from the industry. The question is where Members believe we would acquire experts who at no point in their past have some sort of background connected with the drugs industry. The second question relates to the nature of their ongoing relationship. My noble Friend will make an announcement on that point. I repeat for the hon. Gentleman's information that we will bring UK policy into line with the new EU legislation on these matters, which requires that experts should have no financial or other interest in the pharmaceutical industry that could affect their impartiality.

	<p pid=".263.4/1">The Minister made an appalling statement to back up the nonsense that only people with years of experience in the pharmaceutical industry should police it. That does not happen in any other body&mdash;there must be lay members on regulatory bodies. Someone does not need years of experience in an industry to decide to work on the raw data rather than on conclusions provided by the industry to reach life-and-death decisions for millions of people.</p>

	<p pid=".263.5/1">If I am to make progress, I need to continue without too many interventions. However, in response to my hon. Friend, I am not saying that those are the only people who should be involved with a regulator, but that the expertise should come from those with a background of experience. Lay members are, of course, crucial&mdash;we accept and welcome lay involvement. The MHRA seeks to engage patients as stakeholders in a number of ways, including formally through the Committee on the Safety of Medicines and its sub-committees, and in less formal ways that I do not have time to go through. Both the CSM expert group on patient information and the recently established group on patient reporting of suspected adverse drug reactions have lay chairmen and are heavily weighted towards lay membership to reflect medicine users' views. The crucial role of lay people is well accepted; I was making the point that the expert view will often come from people with a background in the industry.</p>
	<p pid=".263.5/2">In addition, the agency is seeking to be more transparent in its working, and I point out to my hon. Friend the Member for Norwich, North that it already publishes details of all complaints received about medicines advertising and of the outcomes of its investigations, as well as being more open about how such decisions are made. It has also published summaries of clinical trial data to support key communications on drug safety, when it has been in the public interest to do so&mdash;the public interest being an overriding demand.</p>
	<p pid=".263.5/3">Freedom of information legislation will make such arrangements even more open from January, and my noble Friend indicated that section 118 of the Medicines Act 1968 will be repealed as part of the preparation for that. My hon. Friend the Member for Norwich, North made a specific point about minutes being published, and I am advised that those minutes are published and will continue to be.</p>

	<p pid=".264.0/1">I want to ask my hon. Friend about advertising. There are some very glossy ads for statins. People go to their pharmacies, get statins and are advised by the pharmacist, but many of the adverts are misleading. What does the regulator do to control those advertisements? Should it not publicise what it does? As I said, it changed one advert, but only in a small way. We need to know what the regulator does in terms of its influence on the public buying drugs.</p>

	<p pid=".264.1/1">I am happy to write to my hon. Friend about advertising, partly because of the growing pressure of time, but also to give him more detail on that subject. As I said, lay members are involved in that work and play a key role in considering those questions.</p>
	<p pid=".264.1/2">The points made in the review about a lack of understanding of the role of the agency and the fact that more work has to be done on communications have been accepted. The National Audit Office made a number of recommendations in its value for money review of the agency. Those are being taken forward, including work on communications and more engagement with the public.</p>
	<p pid=".264.1/3">We can only consider whether the agency's communications are effective if the safety messages that it generates are properly communicated and acted upon. I hope that the fact that we are having this debate is a sign that the profile of the agency could be, and is being, further improved.</p>
	<p pid=".264.1/4">On the creation of the MHRA, as I mentioned, a review was carried out on, among other things, the agency's external profile. The findings are being implemented. For example, work is being done on the redesign of the agency's website to make it more accessible and usable by a range of stakeholders.</p>
	<p pid=".264.1/5">My hon. Friend the Member for Norwich, North asked about the role of the agency in relation to wider public health. Before I come to that, I shall touch on the issue of secrecy and openness and point out that the principle underpinning the existing code is that information should be released except where disclosure would not be in the public interest&mdash;for example, on the grounds of personal or commercial confidentiality. In fact, information can be released if that is done in performance of the MHRA's duty. Where there is a risk to public safety or health, the MHRA has an overriding obligation to remove or reduce the risk, even if confidentiality is broken. As I mentioned, that provision is effectively being strengthened by changes under freedom of information that will be implemented from the new year. Of course, there remain some common-law protections in relation to confidentiality, but otherwise the provisions I mentioned are all that would in any way impede the publication of a lot more information.</p>
	<p pid=".264.1/6">Regulation does not happen in isolation, and I was honestly confused by the remarks of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1132" name="Andrew Murrison">the hon. Member for Westbury (Dr. Murrison)</phrase> on the subject. On the one hand, he alleges bureaucracy and complaints about under-reporting on health care; on the other, the official Opposition, for whom he is a spokesman on the subject, believe in no targets, and hence, presumably, on no reporting on many subjects. They also believe in removing bureaucracy&mdash;as, indeed, do we where it is pointless.</p>

	<p pid=".265.5/1">I am afraid that I have no intention of withdrawing them. The under-reporting point sounded very much like a desire to have more information at the centre about what is going on. That is exactly what has led us to set targets, which have already lead to huge improvements of more than 12 per cent. in respect of cancer mortality, and to improvements in relation to coronary heart disease of more than 23 per cent. We must recognise that we are making huge progress as a result of the developments that the hon. Gentleman is criticising.</p>
	<p pid=".265.5/2">Ministers have been strong advocates of policies to broaden the range of products available over the counter. We believe, importantly, in the concept of patient choice. At the time of the adoption of the NHS plan, there was emphasis on smoking cessation products to support our initiative to reduce coronary heart disease, and on emergency contraception in relation to the issue of unwanted pregnancies. On all those matters, we had the possibility of moving forward as a result of work done on the reclassification of medicines from prescription only to pharmacy.</p>
	<p pid=".265.5/3">Regulation can also be used to address the lack of availability of medicines in specific sectors, medicines for children being a key example. The European Commission has now formally issued a draft regulation with the aim of improving the availability of medicines licensed specifically for use in the treatment of children. The Government welcome that initiative, which will complement the work that the UK is already undertaking to address that important issue. We will play a leading role in negotiations on the regulation in the coming months to make sure that it meets the needs of the UK and addresses the points that hon. Members raised in relation to children.</p>
	<p pid=".265.5/4">To conclude, I would like to illustrate how regulation really does contribute to the protection of individual patients. In September 1998, the MCA, as it then was, moved to restrict the pack size of paracetamol and aspirin through a change in legislation. Research just completed by Oxford university researchers has shown that suicides have been reduced by 25 per cent. in three years.</p>

	Birds Eye (Grimsby)
</major-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2004-11-10.267.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1116" speakername="Austin Mitchell" colnum="267"  time="011:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200304/cmhansrd/vo041110/halltext/41110h02.htm#41110h02_spnew0">
	<p pid=".267.1/1">I rise to draw attention to the closure of the Unilever-Birds Eye factory on Ladysmith road in Grimsby, which will mean the loss of 620 jobs. In its last year, the factory has had sales of &pound;56 million and it brings about &pound;10 million a year into the Grimsby economy. It produces frozen prepared meals and boil-in-the-bag meals, both of which are profitable.</p>
	<p pid=".267.1/2">I do not want to begin this major complaint about Unilever's behaviour without paying some tribute to the company. Unilever-Birds Eye has done well by Grimsby and the town has done well out of the company. It has been a model employer, and I pay tribute to its sense of social responsibility, which it has demonstrated through cultural sponsorship and in many other ways. However, it has blotted that copybook with what amounts to a betrayal of its work force, its management and the town of Grimsby, which has always worked closely with it.</p>
	<p pid=".267.1/3">Unilever is a big corporation, but it is gripped by a corporate panic. That is what led to those betrayals, which have made a mockery of the partnership that has existed between Birds Eye and its workers over the years. Birds Eye has invested in training, and its staff at the plant are active and enthusiastic. It has upgraded standards all round and invested well in health and all the other things that a co-operative work force need. That partnership is now to be rewarded with a P45 for the employees. That is an appalling way to behave.</p>
	<p pid=".267.1/4">I understand the problems of big corporations, which cannot behave with the youthful enthusiasm of small, thrusting, dynamic companies or achieve the same rates of return. That would be like a mature person such as me desperately stuffing himself with ginseng and going to the gym to make himself as virile and active as a superstud of 20. Of course, I have high hopes in that direction, but I do not think I will achieve it. In the same way, a big corporation will not achieve the rates of return that Unilever has been seeking.</p>
	<p pid=".267.1/5">In 1999, Unilever produced a report called &quot;Path to Growth&quot; to inject a new dynamism into the company and increase profitability and returns on assets. The company, which is, in effect, an amalgam of brands, reduced its 1,600 brands to about 400. It also shed workers, and there was a major reduction in the work force at Grimsby. The plan produced greater profits in 2002&ndash;03 and bonuses were paid to the Grimsby work force. Then, all of a sudden, there was a reversal. In October this year, Unilever issued a profit warning.</p>
	<p pid=".267.1/6">The plan was a failure because big companies cannot produce the same rates of return as smaller companies, nor should they try to. That is especially true when markets move against them. In Birds Eye's case, supermarket cost-cutting moved against it, there was growth in the chilled food market, rather than the frozen food market for which the Grimsby plant produced, and boil-in-the-bag became less fashionable. However, all those lines were profitable and sold well. In that situation, the correct response of any capitalist organisation that is attempting to revivify itself and cope with market difficulties is to compete and fight back, not to submit to trends. Birds Eye should invest and re-equip. Much of the Grimsby plant is 20 years old, and some was brought from Kirkby. The company can fight back by involving the workers, who want to keep their jobs and keep production going, and by investing in the plant.</p>
	<p pid=".267.1/7">Birds Eye can also fight back through promotion. Companies of this scale have enormous power, particularly when it comes to advertising their brands. Advertising was cut back, however, and we have not seen Captain Birds Eye on the television as much. I love Captain Birds Eye. Why do we not see him like we used to? Birds Eye has cut back on advertising, which brand sales depend on, but the correct response is to fight back with new products.</p>
	<p pid=".267.1/8">Birds Eye introduced some new products, but, as far as I can see, enjoy! was one of the biggest disasters in food marketing, as it was designed for a yuppie market that did not exist. The employees in Grimsby told the company that enjoy!, which was produced in Germany as far as I can gather, would not sell and did not appeal to the company's basic market. They warned that enjoy! was headed for failure, and so it failed, losing the company some &pound;25 million.</p>
	<p pid=".267.1/9">If a company with a strong marketing department, strong brand loyalty and strong advertising cannot devise successful new products, the correct response is to fire the marketing department, not close the plant and fire the workers who produce the products. That would have been one response. Birds Eye should also have looked at new value-added lines, own-label production for supermarkets&mdash;anything to use the surplus space in the factory and spread the overheads through bigger production. However, Birds Eye decided that it could do that only by getting somebody else to take over the factory.</p>
	<p pid=".267.1/10">A further response could have been to produce for Europe. We are talking about a huge multinational with marketing power all over the place. The pound is coming down and the euro is becoming stronger, increasing the prospects for production and sales from this country, but there was no attempt to produce for a wider market, as a successful and competitive company would have done.</p>
	<p pid=".267.1/11">The factory was profitable, as I say: the gross margin was 27 per cent., although Unilever wanted 35, whereas the profit was 13 per cent. and Unilever wanted 16. Those are marginal differences, yet on the basis of them Unilever decided to sell the plant and get rid of it. Those difficulties could have been overcome with the co-operation of the work force and investment in the plant.</p>
	<p pid=".267.1/12">Unilever, in the grip of financial panic, decided on a review, which was largely dedicated to trying to get somebody else to take over the factory. Various people were sounded out and came to visit. The effort to sell went on for a whole year, preventing any further action to deal with the problem. That attempt came to an end in September this year. The betrayal&mdash;that is, the decision to close&mdash;came immediately thereafter, in early October, which was far too quick to allow the consideration of investment and alternatives that should have been used.</p>
	<p pid=".267.1/13">James Hill, the managing director, told me that a report on investment would be submitted to the board and that it would be well considered and well put together. I dreamt that I saw James Hill last night, but unfortunately it turned out to be Joe Hill, who represented another tradition. However, the company cannot have considered investment in the way I have described.</p>
	<p pid=".267.1/14">An investment plan was developed by the GMB in co-operation with local management, who think that the plant could and should be kept open. The cost in that investment plan was &pound;10 million. The plan would have been eligible for grants for new investment and new production, so the cost would have come down after making inquiries with the Department of Trade and Industry and Yorkshire Forward, but they were never made. The cost of investment would therefore have been less than &pound;10 million, whereas the cost of closure is &pound;21.4   million, so why is Birds Eye opting to close and waste its money like that? The accusation is that Birds Eye never seriously considered the investment in the plan. Was the plan pushed before the board? Why was closure rushed through in that fashion?</p>
	<p pid=".267.1/15">The closure betrayed the work force and the local management. I pay tribute to Roger Norrington, the local manager, who has kept us in close dialogue&mdash;I hope that does not imperil his job&mdash;and has been helpful in dealing with the situation. The closure betrayed Grimsby as well.</p>
	<p pid=".267.1/16">Instead of considering the alternatives, it has been decided to outsource the bulk of production to Rye Valley in Ireland and escape the responsibilities of an employer to the work force, in the same way that Nike has pioneered outsourcing production to south-east Asia. I have a wry view of Rye Valley, because the plant was built with &pound;30 million of European aid to take jobs from this country. It benefits from 15 per cent. corporation tax, as all Irish plants do. The race to the bottom is beginning, and it will get worse, because Estonia is considering corporation tax of 0 per cent. to attract businesses.</p>
	<p pid=".267.1/17">In effect, through Europe, the British taxpayer is paying money to Ireland to invest in production that will take jobs from this country because the Irish Government are imposing such a low corporation tax rate to make it attractive to invest in Ireland. Mr. Sarkozy, France's Minister for the Economy, Finance and Industry, argued that</p>
	<p pid=".267.1/18" class="indent">&quot;if Ireland was unwilling to fund its public services by levying taxes on profitable companies operating here, then it should not get handouts financed by the taxpayers of the rest of Europe.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".267.1/19">It is unusual for me to agree with a French Minister, but I agree wholeheartedly with that. It is iniquitous that we should be paying both to lose jobs and in aid to Ireland, which benefits from various tax concessions, to establish a plant that takes those jobs.</p>
	<p pid=".267.1/20">A United States Government report indicates that in four years, US multinationals have boosted their profits from &pound;13.4 billion to &pound;26.8 billion by establishing in Ireland. They have absolved themselves of all responsibility, they have an easier life and they do not have to get involved in the messy business of production as it has been transferred to Ireland. That restores the gross margins to the 35 per cent. they want, plus 7 per cent. for marketing, even though the goods are produced by another company.</p>
	<p pid=".267.1/21">We have the spectacle of a Labour Government&mdash;a Labour Government, to use Neil Kinnock's intonation&mdash;using taxpayers' money to clear up the mess and pay the unemployment benefit of the workers in Grimsby who will be out of a job, and allowing the company to transfer jobs to Ireland, without penalties. I draw that to the Minister's attention: something must be done about that outsourcing. We cannot just sit there and say it is inevitable. It is a loss of British jobs.</p>
	<p pid=".267.1/22">Under the Companies Act 1985, the directors have a responsibility to have regard to the interests of their employees. In other words, they have a duty of care to them. Is that exercised by closing the factory? I wrote to all the directors of the parent companies, who have that duty of care, pointing out what they were doing and saying that a brand holder divorced from production and relying only on advertising is doomed to failure.</p>
	<p pid=".267.1/23">The supermarkets have their own labels, but they have a base in the market and a marketing ability, while brand masters who just produce brands and demand a high rate of return on them have no strength in production or marketing. Effectively, they are doomed to exploitation and they put themselves at the mercy of whoever produces the goods. The have no control over quality. All they are doing is advertising the product, hoping that the returns roll in to finance their comfortable existence without the messy business of production and having to co-operate with the workers, who have given them so much in the case of the Grimsby plant.</p>
	<p pid=".267.1/24">Production is power; there cannot be brands without companies having the power to produce them. This is a squalid end to what was a good relationship. There was 40 years of co-operation between Birds Eye and Grimsby, but that co-operation has been rewarded by betrayal.</p>
	<p pid=".267.1/25">The workers have been loyal and supportive&mdash;I regularly awarded certificates for training and other schemes developed by the union and the company together&mdash;so no wonder they feel betrayed. In some ways, this is almost a family plant. Mothers and daughters, husbands and wives&mdash;they all work there and they all feel angry and betrayed. They are being asked to continue production until the end of February, when the factory can be handed over to someone else. I thought better of Unilever and Birds Eye than that.</p>
	<p pid=".267.1/26">I must ask the Minister whether we can intervene at an earlier stage to make the company aware of any alternative and of what investment the Government might make. Why cannot we penalise the extravagant destruction of British jobs by outsourcing? I am grateful that the Department of Trade and Industry has set up the task force that I asked for, so that employees can be helped into new jobs. I am grateful also that the Department will consider alternative uses for the factory. The closure will have consequences for the Hull and Lowestoft plants, which have so far escaped that fate.</p>
	<p pid=".267.1/27">It is essential that the Department intervene to get a better deal for the local work force, as unemployment in Grimsby is higher than the national average. Most of all, Mr. Taylor, I want to say to Unilever, &quot;It is not too late. Nothing becomes you so badly as the leaving of Grimsby. Think again.&quot;</p>

	<p pid=".271.1/1">Order. It is important that the Minister has adequate time to respond, as we are debating an important subject.

	<p pid=".271.2/1">Thank you, Mr. Taylor. I shall certainly be brief. The essence of what we are debating was well articulated by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1116" name="Austin Mitchell">the Member for Great Grimsby (Mr. Mitchell)</phrase>, who represents a neighbouring constituency.</p>
	<p pid=".271.2/2">Grimsby and Cleethorpes form one urban area, and the workers come from both towns, so the closure also affects many of my constituents. As my hon. Friend said, we are calling upon the company to think again. Even at this late stage, we want the Department and the Government to work with the company if they can&mdash;for example, by examining the grants that could be made   available to modernise the plant&mdash;to protect the 600-plus jobs. What we are asking for is not difficult, we believe.</p>
	<p pid=".271.2/3">I want the Government to consider future prospects should those jobs go. The Minister must be aware that the area of Grimsby and Cleethorpes is remote. It is a large urban area, but it is remote from other urban centres. The result is that many of the workers will have to move to other cities and towns should they lose their jobs, although we obviously want the company to think again. It is an isolated area.</p>
	<p pid=".271.2/4">We must also consider the fact that many of the workers are women, that our area has a high number of part-time workers and that, as has been said, unemployment is higher than the national average in the constituencies of Grimsby and Cleethorpes. The role of the task force is therefore crucial. We obviously hope, through my hon. Friend the Minister's intervention, that Unilever will think again about closing the Birds Eye factory in Grimsby. However, should the worst come to the worst&mdash;I honestly hope that it does not, for the well-being of so many families in our communities&mdash;the task force should do all that it can to ensure that those people secure other jobs in our community.</p>

	<p pid=".271.3/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1116" name="Austin Mitchell">the Member for Great Grimsby (Mr. Mitchell)</phrase> on securing this debate, and on raising the important issues surrounding the closure of the Birds Eye factory. As a constituency MP, it is right that he should bring it to the attention of the House. It is also right that my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1074" name="Shona McIsaac">the Member for Cleethorpes (Shona McIsaac)</phrase>, whose constituents are also affected, should be able to come before the Chamber and raise enormously serious issues that affect the whole area.</p>
	<p pid=".271.3/2">The Government certainly want to extend our sympathy and concern to members of the GMB, a union of which I am also a member. I am concerned that they have been put in this position. It is not a matter for the Government to speak for Unilever; it is big enough to speak for itself. However, we have approached Unilever and discussed the situation.</p>
	<p pid=".271.3/3">Unilever announced its intention to close the factory on <phrase class="date" code="2004-10-07">7 October</phrase>. The decision, it says, was an extremely difficult one. It explored all the alternatives to closure. It tells us that it considered the possibility of selling to a third party and the viability of retraining its work force and investing in developing new opportunities and products. It explored the various financial sources that might be available. None the less, it concluded that it needed to find a far larger and more flexible plant&mdash;in its terms&mdash;to be competitive in the industry. Longer-term investment in the Grimsby plant did not match up to the scale and innovation capabilities already available from third parties.</p>
	<p pid=".271.3/4">It is remarkable, given the difficult circumstances that we have heard about today, that my hon. Friend the Member for Great Grimsby was able to pay the tribute that he did to Birds Eye as an employer that has shown a sense of responsibility until now. It is right that the company should explain to the work force why it made this decision. It is regrettable that it has taken the decision as part of its review. I understand that two other sites, in Lowestoft and Hull, are to remain unchanged for the foreseeable future.</p>
	<p pid=".271.3/5">There has been great concern about the impact that the loss of 620 jobs will have on Grimsby. The departure of Birds Eye is a huge loss for the town. We fully recognise that. Department of Trade and Industry officials at the Government office for Yorkshire and the Humber have made contact with Unilever and early dialogue has begun. That has been assisted by a group of local and regional partners, including Yorkshire Forward, Jobcentre Plus and North East Lincolnshire council officials, to see what can be done to talk through the issue with Birds Eye and about any job losses.</p>
	<p pid=".271.3/6">One hope, I am told, is that there are significant job opportunities still in the Grimsby area. In the food industry alone, there are opportunities for 200 jobs. That falls short of the 620 jobs lost, but at such a time 200 jobs are welcome in themselves. A recent press report suggested that local food firms are struggling to fill vacancies. Bizarrely, given the circumstances, North East Lincolnshire council reported that there would be a trade mission to Latvia and Lithuania to try to recruit workers to the area. I suspect that those undertaking the journey may feel that there are opportunities to employ people in the local area, rather than going further afield. They might want to reconsider going there in these difficult circumstances.</p>
	<p pid=".271.3/7">The company tells us that it will provide assistance for retraining and skills for new avenues with an offer of between &pound;0.5 million and &pound;0.75 million to be made available. The regional development agency, Yorkshire Forward, has agreed to consider meeting costs to undertake an impact assessment study and has confirmed funds up to &pound;30,000. It is not for the Government to intervene in business decisions, but they will, along with Yorkshire Forward, work closely with the local authority and the appropriate agencies in the remaining months, to secure a more co-ordinated approach to the handling of the circumstances and their immediate impact on the area.</p>
	<p pid=".271.3/8">I know that my hon. Friend's constituents will be enormously concerned about the closure of the factory. I assure him that despite that very bad news, the Government remain firmly committed to manufacturing, which is a vital part of our economy. It accounts for one sixth of our national wealth and it is also part of our history. More importantly, it must be part of our future. We want a successful manufacturing sector, encompassing food production, which makes value-added products and involves well paid, highly skilled jobs.</p>
	<p pid=".271.3/9">My hon. Friend raised the issue of offshoring. The difficulty is that Britain benefits enormously from offshoring. I remind hon. Members of the factories from other countries that have been set up in the UK&mdash;Nissan from Japan and many companies from the USA have located here. They all offshore production into the UK. The UK, as the director general of the CBI, Digby Jones, said a few days ago, is made for globalisation. We are in a very competitive position and we benefit enormously from offshoring into this country&mdash;or inshoring, from our point of view. That is one reason why we would not want to take protective measures. The damage to our overall economy and to jobs would be enormous throughout the country.</p>

	<p pid=".273.1/1">We need to make sure that companies choose to come here because they know that they will not be subject to vast numbers of restrictions. Otherwise, they will not come. We must get the balance right. We need to remain in our present position. We are in second place out of the whole world, behind the US, as a location where people are investing. We are well ahead of many other countries&mdash;certainly all our European partners&mdash;in getting jobs and investment from abroad.</p>
	<p pid=".273.1/2">Those jobs come here because of the infrastructure, the skills of the work force, the stability of our economy and the fact that our public finances are properly managed. All that my hon. Friend's party&mdash;and mine&mdash;has been so busy doing to manage the economy in the past seven years has contributed to making Britain a place that attracts inward investment.</p>
	<p pid=".273.1/3">I appreciate that it is frustrating&mdash;it makes constituents like those of my hon. Friend very angry&mdash;when jobs go to other countries, and particularly when they go to another member of the European Union that may have received financing for part of the building of the factory. I understand the view that people take in such circumstances. There are, of course, instances when British companies have benefited from EU finance. None of that mitigates the serious problems faced by members of the GMB because of Birds Eye's decision.</p>
	<p pid=".273.1/4">All I can say to my hon. Friend is that we will continue to engage with Unilever and to see if there is any way we can assist. We will provide whatever is available to encourage it to look at its decision. We will provide what assistance we can towards dealing with job losses and making retraining available. We will encourage the company to continue, even in these difficult circumstances, to adopt a socially responsible approach to skills retraining and helping workers relocate.</p>

I am also pleased that the three major English political parties are well represented by hon. Members here today. No doubt they want to raise concerns that exist in their police authority areas and constituencies.</p>
	<p pid=".275.1/2">Crime and policing issues are probably among people's principal priorities and concerns, whether in the south-west and the Avon and Somerset constabulary area, which I represent, or others parts of the United Kingdom. No doubt such issues will be prominent in the forthcoming general election. I hope that the Government's mind is focused in particular on the 2005&ndash;06 police settlement for England and the concerns expressed recently by chief constables and police authorities about the settlement and its implications for police staffing.</p>
	<p pid=".275.1/3">I shall start by talking about general resourcing issues for the police and how those issues have changed in recent years, and go on to describe changes in manning levels that the Government have overseen in the past couple of years. I shall then discuss funding concerns and problems relating to the 2005&ndash;06 settlement, before commenting on proposals that the Government should consider if they are to try to avoid a severe funding squeeze next year. That squeeze could reverse the increase in police numbers in recent years.</p>

	<p pid=".275.5/1">No, I am not. I wish that I had not given way now. I shall make some progress.</p>
	<p pid=".275.5/2">The concern throughout the country about policing levels is based not just on an irrational fear of crime but on developments that have taken place in the past few decades, including the increasing volume of crime and the increasing responsibilities that have fallen on our police forces. In 1979&mdash;a useful benchmark date&mdash;there were about 2.5 million notifiable offences throughout England and Wales; that figure more than doubled to 5.6 million by 1992. There are big debates about the validity of crime statistics and problems with them, but even if we take a category of crime such as burglary, the statistics for which are more reliable than others, we can see that although the figures peaked in 1993 and have fallen for many years since, they are still significantly above 1979 levels.</p>
	<p pid=".275.5/3">If we consider other pressures on the police in the past few years, we see that there is a series of areas that require a great deal of money, but that is not necessarily reflected in police numbers. They include the cost of DNA testing, the increasing cost of call handling given the more extensive use of mobile phones by the public, and the inexorable rise in IT costs in the police service as elsewhere. There has been a significant increase in the volume of crime in every category, which has not been reversed to the levels that we experienced in the 1970s. As I said, there have been cost increases in a host of areas, including call handling, DNA technology and other technology. Set against that, the increase in police officer numbers in the past few decades has been quite modest. We started with about 111,000 police officers in 1979 and hit a temporary peak of 127,600 in 1992. There was a small reduction in police numbers during the 1992&ndash;97 Parliament, which continued when Labour came to power in 1997 and stuck to Conservative spending plans, so that the police numbers continued to fall to about 124,000 in 2000. It is only in the past couple of years that there have been significant increases in police numbers to just below 140,000. The pressures on the police and the costs of running the police force have increased significantly over the past few decades, but the number of police officers has increased by only 25 per cent.</p>

	<p pid=".276.0/1">My hon. Friend is talking about a range of different cost pressures on the police. I may be pre-empting him, but does he not agree that there is another significant cost? A blip in the number of officers retiring in the coming year will significantly increase the pension bill, and police forces across the country are concerned that that will have a significant impact on budgets, resulting in officers coming off the front line to fill the positions of civilians who have been made redundant.</p>

	<p pid=".276.1/1">My hon. Friend is right. I want to look at some of the pension pressures that have been affecting police authorities across the country for a number of years, but which will increase particularly in 2005&ndash;06.</p>

	<p pid=".276.3/1">I agree entirely with the hon. Gentleman's initial point. Hon. Members are successfully anticipating my speech. I shall therefore push ahead rapidly before I have nothing left to say, and shall allow time later for people to make points about the experience in their areas.</p>
	<p pid=".276.3/2">Turning to more recent progress&mdash;at last, police numbers have started to rise&mdash;we acknowledge that there has been an improved environment over the past couple of years. Police numbers in Avon and Somerset have risen from just under 3,000 in 1998&ndash;99 to just over 3,400 in August this year. At the most local level in the Somerset east police district, police numbers have risen from 241 in 2001 to 278 today. There have been the additional allocations of money for the police community safety officers who are beginning to be deployed by the Government.</p>
	<p pid=".276.3/3"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1271" name="David Taylor">The hon. Member for North-West Leicestershire (David Taylor)</phrase> made an important point when he said that the Government must not forget that many additional police resources have been paid for not out of the Government's central resources, but by people in their local area through significant increases in the police precept. In my area, for every &pound;100 that was spent on policing in 1995&ndash;96, less than &pound;15 was raised locally. That figure has now roughly doubled to just under &pound;30. The increases in the police precept in Avon and Somerset were 15 per cent. in 2002&ndash;03, 34 per cent. in 2003&ndash;04 and 12 per cent. for 2004&ndash;05. The police precept has therefore increased by over 60 per cent. in the past three years alone, which is broadly representative of the experience of many areas of the country. Indeed, there are some areas that have experienced even bigger rises&mdash;there was a 52 per cent. rise in Gloucestershire in one year alone.</p>
	<p pid=".276.3/4">Many people across the country have somewhat begrudgingly paid more in their local police precept over the past few years, because they were convinced by the local police authority that additional police officers and staff would be deployed. People who have paid more in their local taxes would be particularly concerned if the ultimate settlement for the police budget in 2005&ndash;06 reverses the recent expansion of staff. Over the past few weeks, we have all been successfully lobbied by our local police forces, who have expressed concerns about the 2005&ndash;06 settlement. I suspect that the Minister for Crime Reduction, Policing and Community Safety has received representations from the Association of Police Authorities. I met the chief constable of Avon and Somerset constabulary, Steve Pilkington, who described the experience in his area, and I have no doubt that other Members will have been briefed by their police authorities and chief constables.</p>
	<p pid=".276.3/5">There is serious concern that the nature of the settlement that the Government envisage for next year will leave a funding gap of up to &pound;350 million in the budgets of English authorities, and that that gap can only be closed with a reduction in police officers or police staff. The driving concerns&mdash;and I will return to the Home Secretary's statement yesterday on the White Paper&mdash;are fear that next year's Government grant for police authorities could rise by as little as 3 per cent., and the associated fear that increases in the police precept will be kept down by Government diktat to the low single figures suggested by Ministers in the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister.</p>

	<p pid=".277.0/1">Is the hon. Gentleman aware that in a county such as Hertfordshire the standstill pressures on spending are about 6 per cent., and the new spending pressures are about 1 per cent. as a result of the cost of police surgeons, criminal record searches and so on? If the grant were 3 per cent., and there was capping of the sort to which he referred, Hertfordshire would have to make a saving equivalent to the cost of 170 police officers. That would be extremely unpopular, given the need for a visible police presence in our market towns and villages.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2004-11-10.278.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1036" speakername="David Laws" colnum="278"  time="014:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200304/cmhansrd/vo041110/halltext/41110h03.htm#41110h03_spnew10">
	<p pid=".278.0/1">The hon. Gentleman is right. I have seen the representations from his authority, which are typical of the concerns expressed across England. That brings me neatly to my next point. The Association of Police Authorities has calculated that if the precept is kept down to 3 to 4 per cent. to paper over the fact that the Government have not yet been able to put in place a fairer mechanism than the council tax to raise local funding, and if there is a lower Government settlement, there will be a shortfall of about &pound;350 million in the funding that police authorities have calculated that they need for the standstill budget. They need an average of 5.7 per cent., but the figure is higher for authorities that are experiencing the pension problems to which my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1032" name="Norman Lamb">the Member for North Norfolk (Norman Lamb)</phrase> referred. In Avon and Somerset, pension funding is a problem, because a large cohort of officers will retire next year, so the standstill settlement for Avon and Somerset has been calculated at 7.7 per cent.</p>
	<p pid=".278.0/2">The first point to make about individual areas of cost pressure and the scope for efficiency savings is that pension costs are increasing significantly across the country. In Avon and Somerset, they will go up by 50   per cent. between 1997&ndash;98 and 2004&ndash;05, from &pound;25   million a year when Labour came to power to &pound;37.2 million this financial year, and they will continue to rise. We appreciate that the Government are trying to tackle the historic underfunding of the police pension scheme, but that will not have any effect on the situation next year, when there will be a particular problem, as the large cohort of police officers who were recruited in the mid 1970s, are coming up for retirement, resulting in a surge of retirements in most authorities. The Minister may be interested to know that Avon and Somerset anticipates that there will be 150 retirements in 2005&ndash;06, compared with just 73 in 2004&ndash;05.</p>

	<p pid=".278.1/1">Does the hon. Gentleman agree that one problem with public sector pension schemes&mdash;this does not apply to the local government scheme, but it does apply to the police scheme&mdash;is that they tend to be pay-as-you-go schemes, and are particularly vulnerable to surges in employer requirements, as certain events must be reflected actuarially in the demands on the fund in the years to come?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2004-11-10.278.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1036" speakername="David Laws" colnum="278"  time="014:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200304/cmhansrd/vo041110/halltext/41110h03.htm#41110h03_spnew12">
	<p pid=".278.2/1">Yes, I agree. It is fair to point out that while individual employees pay contributions, which are obviously not ring-fenced, there is no specific employer contribution. The Government are seeking to address that matter, but they will not have done so by next year. Pension pressures are therefore a significant problem, and they could account for about &pound;100 million of the &pound;350 million gap.</p>
	<p pid=".278.2/2">Police authorities are examining other parts of their budgets to see where there are cost pressures and where savings could be made. More than 80 per cent. of most police authorities' costs will be staff or pension costs, so it will be difficult to cut a large proportion of costs without reducing police or staff numbers. In addition, there is the growing cost of technology. DNA technology has been introduced in many areas, and there are attempts to improve telephone centres to make it easier for people to contact the police, thus addressing a problem has caused a great deal of frustration throughout the country.</p>
	<p pid=".278.2/3">Many police authorities have made efficiency savings year on year for a number of years, but the proportion of efficiency savings that can be achieved in a cashable way has been reduced. Avon and Somerset has been successful in achieving its targets over recent years, but the proportion of cashable savings has gradually reduced. It therefore anticipates a funding gap of about &pound;10.4 million in the coming year.</p>

	<p pid=".279.0/1">If, as my hon. Friend says, the police settlement is limited to 3 per cent., and if there is a cap on the 3 per cent. precept and a standstill in the number of police officers, cuts must be made in the civilian force, which is almost a reverse of the civilianisation that is taking place at present. Police officers will be back in the office doing administrative jobs when we want their presence out on the street.</p>

	<p pid=".279.1/1">Perhaps unauthorised copies of my speech have been circulating among hon. Members, because every time they speak they anticipate what I am about to say. Given the circumstances, the only mechanism for saving money available to most chief constables is to reduce police staffing&mdash;that is certainly the position that the chief constable of Avon and Somerset has described.</p>
	<p pid=".279.1/2">There are limits on the areas of staffing that can be reduced without losing ring-fenced funds. The number of police community safety officers cannot be reduced without cutting ring-fenced money from the Government. If the police authorities decide to target back-office staff rather than police on the beat, they risk losing staff who have taken the place of the police officers whom they are trying to deploy on the beat. Consequently, even if they try to protect the number of front-line police officers, those officers could be drawn back from the beat to undertake back-office responsibilities, as my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1324" name="Roger Williams">the Member for Brecon and Radnorshire (Mr. Williams)</phrase> pointed out. One must therefore conclude that if the budget is anything like the one that is expected, there will be severe pressures on police authorities next year.</p>

	<p pid=".279.2/1">I shall make a point that my hon. Friend may not be going to make himself.

	<p pid=".279.3/2">There is always scope for examining whether the claims made by any organisation about how cuts will   fall are borne out in reality or whether they are worst-case scenarios. However, there is no doubt that if the assumptions about the grant from central Government and from the police precept are borne out, budgetary pressures would result in reductions in staffing in most police authorities. There would be anger throughout the country at any such staff reduction, given that people have paid much more in their police precept over the past few years.</p>
	<p pid=".279.3/3">What should the Government do about the situation? The first and most obvious point is that they must look closely at the level of settlement from central Government for English police authorities for 2005&ndash;06. I was cheered, but only slightly, by the Home Secretary's response yesterday to a question that followed his statement on the policing White Paper. He said:</p>
	<p pid=".279.3/4" class="indent">&quot;On spending and the police grant, police authorities believed that they were to get a 3 per cent. uplift. On that basis, they have been lobbying that that is insufficient for them to meet the future demands of the service and they have been demanding 5.7 per cent. Let me make it clear: there is no way that I can deliver a 5.7 per cent. uplift across the board, and I do not believe that the police authorities truly believe that that is feasible. However, I will make sure, along with my right hon. Friends the Chancellor and the Deputy Prime Minister, that the uplift that we deliver in a few weeks will ensure that the programme that we have set out, and its supplementing in the years ahead, will deliver the neighbourhood beat police officers and the 25,000 support officers to which we have committed.&quot;&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2004-11-09.711"><i>Official Report</i>, 9 November 2004; Vol. 426, c. 711</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid=".279.3/5">In one sense, that is cheering, because the Home Secretary does not seem to be intent on a settlement as low as 3 per cent. The band seems to be between 3 per cent., which he says is too low, and 5.7 per cent., which he says is too high. Part of this debate is to try to force the Minister for Crime Reduction, Policing and Community Safety and her colleagues towards the upper end of that spectrum.</p>
	<p pid=".279.3/6">The central Government settlement should not only deliver the specific and limited targets to which the Home Secretary referred in his statement&mdash;for example, ring-fenced police community safety officers&mdash;but protect existing staffing levels and additional police that have recently been taken on. I hope that it will at least deliver the existing level of services and the increase in officers that the Government have promised without the need for staff savings elsewhere. To do so, the figure must be closer to 5 per cent. than to the rumoured 3 per cent.</p>
	<p pid=".279.3/7">There must be specific provision for pensions. Those of us who represent police authority areas with difficult pension outlooks next year would like a supplement to the police settlement next year that reflects those pressures. There should be an amount additional to the standard uprating of the police central grant. The pension pressures will be severe next year for many authorities because of the retirement bulge that we face, so I hope that the Minister is examining that problem seriously.</p>
	<p pid=".279.3/8">I hope that the Government will consider providing greater flexibility in Home Office ring-fenced grants that, for example, pay for police community support officers. Many people will not have found entirely credible the implication in the Home Secretary's statement yesterday that the Home Office is giving more power to police authorities and that there is earned autonomy. The statement implied that authorities can do what they wish and deploy resources as they wish provided that they are not failing police authorities. However, at the same time, there is a whole list of ring-fenced central Government schemes, and additional targets are being introduced. The Government and the Home Office do not appear to have decided whether they believe in localism and letting people decide their priorities, or whether they want to nanny police authorities and tell them how to deploy resources, which may lead to a bizarre situation in which police authorities seek to make savings, but are penalised as a result of the ring-fenced budgets that the Home Office has earmarked for specific purposes. I therefore hope that there is additional flexibility.</p>
	<p pid=".279.3/9">Finally, if the Minister helps to secure a fairer central settlement and fairer funding for police authorities next year, I hope that instead of trying to cap local police authorities, she will, in the spirit of localism, allow them to decide their priorities and the way in which they set the local police precept in the interests of their areas. I have no doubt that after the huge increases of recent years, many police authorities will want to keep their police precept rises in low single digits, but some may not. Some may wish to make higher increases to fund additional police officers, and that should be their right and choice.</p>
	<p pid=".279.3/10">A year or so ago, after the Government had made some progress on education, especially on funding, their policies suffered a fall in credibility. There was growing public discontent because of a funding problem that hit many schools throughout England, not least in the south-west. The Government's reputation for delivering better education suffered a hard knock, and I hope that the Minister accepts that after a couple of years of progress, the Government face the self-same risk in policing and crime. Police chiefs and police authorities have warned them of the problems that they face next year. They will pay the political price in the next general election if they fail to deal with the issue in time.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2004-11-10.281.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/778" speakername="Alan Campbell" colnum="281"  time="014:26:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200304/cmhansrd/vo041110/halltext/41110h03.htm#41110h03_spnew18">
	<p pid=".281.1/1">I am grateful for the opportunity to contribute to the debate and I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1036" name="David Laws">the hon. Member for Yeovil (Mr. Laws)</phrase> on securing it. I shall try to be brief, although I do not know whether four minutes is realistic.</p>
	<p pid=".281.1/2">I shall limit my comments to the situation facing the three main police forces in the north-east of England. I acknowledge that the wider debate about the settlement for 2005&ndash;06 comes in the context of very good settlements in recent years. A record number of police officers has meant more than 700 additional officers in the Northumbria, Durham and Cleveland police force areas and a continuing fall in crime. That is all the more impressive when one considers that they are additional officers, because throughout the period people have left the force because of retirement, ill health or family reasons or to do other jobs.</p>
	<p pid=".281.1/3">In the Northumbria police area alone, funding has risen from &pound;126 per head of population in 1997&ndash;98 to more than &pound;166 per head last year. That has meant more police officers in every command unit and in every constituency. I agree with the hon. Member for Yeovil that that makes it more, not less, important, to sustain progress and ensure that the necessary resources are available.</p>
	<p pid=".281.1/4">The Minister will have closely studied the case being made by police authorities and chief police officers who have been lobbying Members of Parliament and the Government. That is their job and they have a right to do it, but just as police authorities and chief police officers are doing their job, I would expect the Minister to do hers, which is to ensure that additional resources are available and that they turn into officers on the streets. She must ensure, too, that civilian support staff are available to allow officers to do their job. Ministers have a responsibility to ensure that the taxpayer gets a fair deal for the resources being expended. It is hard to believe that future savings are not possible in the north-east, which has about &pound;0.5 billion in police funding every year.</p>
	<p pid=".281.1/5">I shall say one or two things about those savings and changes in the Northumbria police area to illustrate my point. With Government help, Northumbria police has moved to civilianise many posts, which has meant more police officers on the beat; it has also reduced the number of police command units to six, which means that chief officers in those areas can use officers under their command more efficiently and effectively. In that regard, I mention the excellent work of Chief Superintendent Jim Peacock of north Tyneside command unit. He is busy establishing community teams of officers, which will bring them nearer to the community, and allow the better use of resources. We need to avoid undermining those efforts with cuts to civilian staff, which could reverse the trend of constables leaving their offices and going out on to the streets.</p>
	<p pid=".281.1/6">The community teams are to be strengthened by community support officers. I hope that the Minister will take this opportunity, in the light of comments made in previous debates&mdash;not yet in this debate, I am pleased to say&mdash;to pay tribute to community support officers and emphasise the key role that they can play. They provide a uniformed presence on the streets where people want to see it. They also tackle antisocial behaviour. Whatever disputes we may have about crime statistics, antisocial behaviour is the reality for many people in our local communities. It seems that that is what community support officers are there to tackle.</p>
	<p pid=".281.1/7">In the light of the comments made by the hon. Member for Yeovil, if the price of getting rid of ring-fencing is that chief police officers reduce the number of community support officers, I would not favour going down that route. Even at this late stage, as my hon. Friend the Minister deliberates on such matters, I lobby her again for more community support officers for Northumbria police. I hope that they will come.</p>
	<p pid=".281.1/8">I encourage the Government to begin, or to continue, to think innovatively about future police funding&mdash;perhaps not for 2005&ndash;06, but beyond. My constituency has what is known as an evening economy, which is a mixed blessing for a seaside town such as Whitley Bay. The downside is alcohol-fuelled disorder, which requires an enhanced police presence. Is it unreasonable to ask businesses that profit from such alcohol sales to contribute towards alleviating the effects? I welcome the press reports today that suggest that the Government are considering such an idea and hope that the Minister will keep an open mind. Although a voluntary scheme may prove the best step initially, it may require legislation. I hope that she will continue to consider that. If football clubs are asked to contribute towards policing costs, it is not unreasonable to ask nightclubs and club owners to make a contribution.</p>
	<p pid=".281.1/9">When it comes to the balance between council tax, the precept and central funding, I, like others, have received letters about high council tax. I cannot recall a single letter about the high level of police precept or the increase in police precept, because people see that turning into police officers on the streets, which they want. When the Government consider what powers may be brought to bear on that precept, I ask that they first look carefully at what local authorities are doing. It is the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister that brings those powers to bear.</p>
	<p pid=".281.1/10">When a local authority, such as North Tyneside, has a high council tax but is closing centres such as the Linskill centre, we should look at the local authority rather than concerning ourselves too much with the police precept. That is particularly the case in my local area. If the police are recruited locally and are accountable locally, there should be an element of local funding.</p>

	<p pid=".283.0/1">Does my hon. Friend agree that one option not mentioned so far, which is the restructuring of police authorities, could be dangerous if it makes the relationship between local funding and local policing even more indistinct ?</p>

	<p pid=".283.1/1">Yes, I do. I am not sure that it is wrong to consider the issue and to look continually at whether there is a better way to deliver services, but the trend in public services is that people are looking for them to be delivered locally. They are concerned, first, that they should be delivered, but they also want them delivered locally. We should think carefully before going down the route that my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/865" name="David Drew">the Member for Stroud (Mr. Drew)</phrase> warns us against, not least because local authority changes in the past have often come back to bite us.</p>
	<p pid=".283.1/2">I re-emphasise the point made by the hon. Member for Yeovil about police pensions. Clearly, they have a distorting effect on the police budget and will continue to do so if, as the Durham constabulary area advises, there is a 12 per cent. increase in the need to draw down from that pension in the next year alone. When will the Government say what they intend to do about that? Are they looking at a national form of funding?</p>
	<p pid=".283.1/3">I hope that the Minister will reassure me that there will be as fully funded a settlement as possible in 2005&ndash;06, that she will listen to lobbying and that she will appreciate that my comments come from someone who acknowledges the Government's good record so far.</p>

	<p pid=".283.2/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1036" name="David Laws">the hon. Member for Yeovil (Mr. Laws)</phrase> on securing this important debate, which enables us to question the Minister on the police funding settlement, as it affects our police authorities. I shall try to keep my speech narrow and examine what is happening in Norfolk. I understand that the provisional funding settlement has been deferred until late November or even mid-December. Can the Minister for Crime Reduction, Policing and Community Safety give me some idea of when the provisional settlement will be announced?</p>
	<p pid=".283.2/2">Norfolk is not necessarily the centre of organised crime in the United Kingdom, or at least not until we have a large casino in Great Yarmouth. We have specific problems relating to the geographical extent of the area and its rural sparsity. We have crime that involves drugs and violence, and robberies in rural areas. People fear crime very much because of the sparsity of the population and the limited number of police. I am the first to acknowledge that Norfolk police, with support from the Home Office, have made a great effort over the past few years to concentrate on smashing criminal gangs, increasing the number of police and dealing with the fear of crime.</p>
	<p pid=".283.2/3">Norfolk is trialling two good initiatives, which are the use of mobile police stations and post offices, but there are still major funding problems that go back several years: first, the whole business of police communications and, secondly, the continuing dispute between the Home Office and the police authority about Norfolk police having a dedicated police helicopter. Given the size of Norfolk, the extent of the coastline and the fact that some points are vulnerable to terrorist attack, the Home Office must reconsider such matters. As the hon. Member for Yeovil emphasised, many grants are ring-fenced in police authorities and money is increasingly absorbed by nationally applied legal and efficiency targets.</p>
	<p pid=".283.2/4">The hon. Gentleman also said that it is acknowledged by everyone that, across the board, most police authorities need about a 5.5 per cent. increase just to stand still. They are between a rock and a hard place. The assessment carried out by Norfolk is that, if we are lucky, the increase will be between 3 and 4 per cent., which means that we will be out by about 1 per cent. As he pointed out, the options are limited. One example is efficiency savings, which, as other hon. Members have said, can be made largely in terms of manpower. Indeed, 85 per cent. of most police funding in police authorities goes on that. There is a threat to get rid of civilian staff, which all chief constables would be reluctant to do, with the absurd possibility that uniformed staff would have to go back into head office. That would undercut all the increases in uniformed policing. Another option is to raise the police precept.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2004-11-10.284.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1224" speakername="Mark Simmonds" colnum="284"  time="014:34:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200304/cmhansrd/vo041110/halltext/41110h03.htm#41110h03_spnew22">
	<p pid=".284.0/1">Is my hon. Friend aware that the logical conclusion of his argument is that, if police officers have to go back to civilian tasks, ultimately the Home Office grant will fall as the number of policemen falls?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2004-11-10.284.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1227" speakername="Keith Simpson" colnum="284"  time="014:34:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200304/cmhansrd/vo041110/halltext/41110h03.htm#41110h03_spnew23">
	<p pid=".284.1/1">Yes, we are in a bad Catch-22 position. The alternative is that the police precept might have to be raised. The experience of people in Norfolk is unlike   that of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/778" name="Alan Campbell">the hon. Member for Tynemouth (Mr. Campbell)</phrase>, as they knew only too well what part of the council tax was being affected by the rise in the police precept. There is no doubt that the Government are also determined to cap those areas that are thinking of raising the local tax.</p>
	<p pid=".284.1/2">I have a simple question for the Minister: if we are between a rock and a hard place, what are we going to do about it? The problem is not one for the police to solve and it is not particularly one for local councils. It is a problem that the Home Office has given us and we want an answer.</p>
	<p pid=".284.1/3">I have a final important point to make about Norfolk. Several grants are specifically ring-fenced and tied to the Home Office, and they can be applied to areas such as Norfolk and others. I refer, for example, to the crime fighting fund and to the rural policing fund, which is worth about &pound;2 million per annum to Norfolk. The future of the RPF is still in doubt, so I would be grateful if the Minister said whether Norfolk is to continue to receive that important allocation. If not, Norfolk's problem is even greater.</p>

	<p pid=".285.0/1">I am delighted to take part in the debate, and I agree with many of the   wider points that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1036" name="David Laws">the hon. Member for Yeovil (Mr. Laws)</phrase> made about the challenge and costs of new technology and DNA testing, and about the real problem of pensions.</p>
	<p pid=".285.0/2">I want to be more specific: I will talk about the Nottinghamshire police because, as the Minister knows, resourcing Nottingham's police has been very controversial in the area. The Minister also well knows that murder and serious and organised crime, often drug-related, have been a big issue. The cold facts are that the number of offences per officer and per head of population appears to be the highest in the country, which has led to some disillusionment. Just a few days ago, the shadow Home Secretary compared Nottingham to Chicago in prohibition days. Gedling Conservatives are putting out a leaflet that says:</p>
	<p pid=".285.0/3" class="indent">&quot;We are ashamed of where we live&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".285.0/4">I am not ashamed of where I live; I am proud of the honest, decent Nottingham people, and I am backing their effort. My good friend and colleague, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/808" name="Vernon Coaker">the Member for Gedling (Vernon Coaker)</phrase>, and my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/957" name="John Heppell">the Member for Nottingham, East (Mr. Heppell)</phrase> are also backing them in putting in place community safety initiatives to build partnerships so that our children are safe on the streets.</p>
	<p pid=".285.0/5">People who make such claims are ignorant of the facts. Again, I quote the Gedling Conservatives, who say that the chief constable is</p>
	<p pid=".285.0/6" class="indent">&quot;having to spin the crime statistics to hide failure&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".285.0/7">and that the police and politicians</p>
	<p pid=".285.0/8" class="indent">&quot;will fiddle the figures and spin deceit.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".285.0/9">The facts are rather different, although there is no doubt that Nottinghamshire police have underperformed.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2004-11-10.285.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1115" speakername="Andrew Mitchell" colnum="285"  time="014:40:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200304/cmhansrd/vo041110/halltext/41110h03.htm#41110h03_spnew25">
	<p pid=".285.1/1">I certainly do not want to discourage the hon. Gentleman from quoting the excellent literature put out by the hard-working prospective Conservative parliamentary candidate in Gedling, but surely he is shooting himself in the foot. He reads out literature that says that the Nottinghamshire police force is underperforming and then reveals that statistics show that Nottingham's force is indeed one of the least well performing in the country.</p>

	<p pid=".286.0/1">I am delighted that the hon. Gentleman has endorsed Gedling Conservatives' comments that they are ashamed of where they live. Given that he used to represent the area, that is quite disgraceful.</p>
	<p pid=".286.0/2">The performance of Nottinghamshire police is improving under the chief constable. In the past six months, crime has come down by 13.4 per cent. In particular, burglary and vehicle crime are down, and the number of offences in the past six months is down by 10,803 compared with the previous six months. That is the kind of performance that I applaud and I stick up for. I also stick up for the fact that Her Majesty's inspectorate of constabulary and the police standards unit have been working closely with Nottinghamshire police to achieve those results. That police authority is going forward; it should not be put down.</p>
	<p pid=".286.0/3">Of course, we need more resources. Only last Thursday, my hon. Friends the Members for Gedling and for Nottingham, East met the Minister for Crime Reduction, Policing and Community Safety yet again to argue for extra resources for Nottinghamshire police. Again, I quote the excellent literature that we have talked about, which makes this accusation:</p>
	<p pid=".286.0/4" class="indent">&quot;The Government refuses to give us more police and Gedling's MP has never even raised the issue in Parliament.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".286.0/5">The number of police in Nottinghamshire is at a record level. In the past three years, an extra 303 officers have been recruited, backed by 71 new community support officers. In private&mdash;he cannot speak publicly in Parliament&mdash;my hon. Friend the Member for Gedling has been assiduous and robust on the issue. I must say that my view differs slightly from his in that he has campaigned vigorously for extra police for Nottinghamshire, and I back him on that, while I want improved performance, too. We are beginning to see the results of improved performance.</p>
	<p pid=".286.0/6">I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister for Crime Reduction, Policing and Community Safety will reflect on her visit to Nottingham only last Thursday and consider ways to reward Nottinghamshire police. I hope that she has listened carefully to the pleas that we have made privately about the need to tackle serious and organised crime in the county. In particular, there will be an opportunity fairly soon to make decisions and announcements on police community support officers.</p>
	<p pid=".286.0/7">People in Gedling, Nottingham and Hucknall&mdash;across Nottinghamshire&mdash;want a greater police presence on our streets. I applaud yesterday's statement and look forward to seeing more police officers and more community support officers in Nottingham so that we can all be jointly proud of Nottingham and of Nottinghamshire.</p>

	<p pid=".287.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1036" name="David Laws">the hon. Member for Yeovil (Mr. Laws)</phrase> on securing the debate. There is no doubt that shortfalls in police authority funding are a problem throughout the country. Nowhere is their effect more pronounced, proportionally, however, than in the Bedfordshire police authority.</p>
	<p pid=".287.0/2">Let me say straight away that the force itself is not to blame. Early-day motion 1830 makes it clear that the force, although historically underfunded by central Government, has nevertheless</p>
	<p pid=".287.0/3" class="indent">&quot;achieved the highest level of cashable efficiency savings of any police authority in England and Wales over the last five years with the highest proportion of officers undertaking front line policing duties&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".287.0/4">However, even with the expected increases in council tax and central Government funding, and despite raiding its modest &pound;1 million reserves, which exist only because of the force's effective governance, Bedfordshire police remains set to suffer a &pound;2.2 million shortfall&mdash;the equivalent of losing 75 constables.</p>
	<p pid=".287.0/5">That shortfall cannot be plugged indefinitely by using council tax to fund essential services, and nor can we reasonably expect the force to make further cuts when it is already operating at the top end of the range of efficiency targets set out by the Government. The only option is likely to be a cut in personnel. Although I accept that efficiency is a virtue and that more should be done with less, once a force is efficient, as the Government recognise the Bedfordshire police force to be, any new demands are likely to require extra resources.</p>
	<p pid=".287.0/6">As we know, Bedfordshire police authority has made the efficiency savings demanded by the Treasury, with 83 per cent. of its budget going directly on staffing costs. Any further reduction in the back-room staff essential to keep the force operational is likely to mean that police officers will have to be taken off the beat to fulfil those functions. There is little room to cut already minimal administrative costs when Bedfordshire is feeling the funding shortfall ever more intensely because of pressure from the Metropolitan police, the pension time bomb, the requirement for the normal maintenance of expenditure, and the need to update technology and equipment.</p>
	<p pid=".287.0/7">A further squeeze is likely to come from the possible imposition by the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister of a low cap on council tax. The proportion of Bedfordshire police authority budget met from council tax has risen from 14.5 per cent. in 1995&ndash;96 to 25.5 per cent. in 2004&ndash;05. Although local taxes from a historically underfunded county should not compensate for the lack of funding for essential services that are imposed by, and are the responsibility of, central Government, the removal of the option to plug the central Government funding shortfall has created another hole in the police budget.</p>
	<p pid=".287.0/8">The third squeeze on Bedfordshire's police budget comes from the Home Office, which, quite understandably, is imposing demands to put crime prevention at the top of the agenda. However, the Home Office's grand rhetoric and initiatives are not being matched by funding. Similarly, the ring-fencing of available funding, such as for CSOs and so on, is limiting the county's flexibility to decide how best to spend money, even though those concerned are in the best position to be able to do so. I believe that Bedfordshire police has more than fulfilled the Government's demands of it. If the county's policing is, at the very least, to stand still, let alone improve, the Government must put their money where their rhetoric is.</p>

	<p pid=".288.0/1">I shall spend one moment emphasising the importance of diversity in the police force. I do so in the light of the sneering response that I received from the&mdash;somewhat illiberal&mdash;hon. Member for Yeovil (Mr. Laws) when I invited him, in what I thought was a friendly way, not to use sexist language in talking about the composition of the police force. I point out how much his attitude contrasts with that displayed yesterday, publicly and properly, by the Home Secretary, who announced a range of policies intended to encourage diversity in the police force. The Home Secretary made it clear that, unlike the hon. Member for Yeovil, he understands that the police force has lagged behind and needs policies to catch up in its diversity targets.</p>
	<p pid=".288.0/2">Women in Redcar, as everywhere else, frequently need the assistance of the police, particularly in response to sexual offences, of which there are a large number and for which the conviction rate is 7.2 per cent. Women find it infinitely easier to talk about such matters with women police officers. Domestic violence is also still an epidemic in this country, producing one phone call every minute to a police force somewhere, every day of every year. Yet the conviction rate is still lower than that for sexual offences. Similarly, women find it easier to talk to women police officers about domestic violence. Truly, in many situations, where women may be being oppressed by antisocial behaviour or by their own delinquent children, they find it easier to talk to women police officers about their needs. It is therefore not political correctness for the Home Office to say in its latest pronouncements that diversity in the police force is key.</p>

	<p pid=".288.2/1">No, not now. It is a great shame that the sexist language that the hon. Gentleman deployed shows that he has not understood&mdash;<i>[Interruption.] </i>I am afraid that he is making his lack of understanding even clearer as I speak. He has not understood the importance of language in trying to encourage people who are not of the usual kind into a new field of operation.</p>
	<p pid=".288.2/2">Before I move on to Cleveland police, which is more important than the hon. Gentleman's inability to understand the modern world, I should like to give him an example from my past. As a barrister, I used to receive letters from the Court of Appeal&mdash;happily they no longer come&mdash;that said that counsel at the appeal must ensure that &quot;he&quot; tells &quot;his&quot; client that &quot;his&quot; responsibility is to do such-and-such and that &quot;he&quot; must always encourage such-and-such. The consequence of an address of that kind and the use of words such as &quot;manning&quot; is to make it perfectly clear that women are not the norm in a field of activity, but are rather unusual, and to make them feel somewhat peculiar to have ventured into it. Such language is the utter opposite of encouraging. Indeed, talking to a woman about increasing &quot;manning&quot; in the police force is about the same as talking to a black person about increasing the number of white people in the police force.</p>
	<p pid=".288.2/3">I hope that the hon. Member for Yeovil will start to understand the significance of sexist language&mdash;although I doubt he will&mdash;and I compliment the Home Secretary, who does understand it. The proposals to recruit more diversely, to train in a less residential way, which is obviously difficult for women to follow through on, and to ensure that duties and working hours are more family friendly are long overdue and hugely welcome. Police community support officer posts have proved a ripe source of recruitment from women and black and minority ethnic people. That development has helped with antisocial behaviour and other community problems and with diversity.</p>
	<p pid=".288.2/4">I want to sketch in a tiny amount of background on Cleveland&mdash;the police service that serves Redcar. There are two points that I want my hon. Friend the Minister to keep in mind. Cleveland police force found a &pound;7.3 million black hole in its finances earlier this year. Imagine the impact of that discovery on the public, coming as it did in the immediate aftermath of a campaign&mdash;conducted, I am sure, in good faith by the chief constable&mdash;asking for an increase of 29 per cent. in the precept, in order, inter alia, to give every ward a police constable. That campaign was conducted on a roadshow basis but, far from being able to achieve what had been planned, the police needed to put the moneys into the black hole to try to bolster the finances.</p>
	<p pid=".288.2/5">A new chief constable was then appointed&mdash;Mr. Price, who is rightly not being blamed. It is clear that the old Cleveland police authority had not kept itself as well informed as it might have done. Of course, the National Audit Office was involved, and so was Her Majesty's inspectorate of constabulary. No one was misappropriating funds, but the National Audit Office said that there had been a culture of unbridled growth in Cleveland police, with too little regard for financial management. That had not been challenged by the police authority. Part of what went wrong was insufficient attention to the need to keep balances and reserves high. It was clear by the beginning of this year that Cleveland police reserves were very small indeed.</p>
	<p pid=".288.2/6">The Audit Commission reports that the chief constable, the new police authority and the management are working well together. Their next budget and their next financial year, will remain extremely difficult, however, for two reasons. First, Cleveland police force is 30 years old this year, which means that it has a very large number of officers who are going to retire. As I understand it, the availability of pension funding for them must be calculated on the basis that 50 per cent. of them will retire with only 30 days' notice. Consequently, it is important that balances are kept in hand for that. It is probably right to say that pensions will make a higher-than-ordinary impact on policing in Cleveland in the next year or so.</p>
	<p pid=".288.2/7">Secondly, the National Audit Office severely criticised the running down of balances by the previous administration in Cleveland police force. Very properly, the current chief constable has spent a good deal of the last finance to be received, both from precept and from grant, on replenishing those balances. However, they are still extremely small.</p>
	<p pid=".288.2/8">Because significant balances are not available, it will be very difficult, if there is a shortfall in pension provision or if the expected resignations occur, to meet any shortfall out of balances. It will also be difficult for the current chief constable, whose police force has recently been criticised extraordinarily strongly for the running down of balances, to take more out of them in the teeth of that criticism to fund any shortfall&mdash;</p>

	<p pid=".290.1/1">Thank you, Miss Begg; I am not sure what I can say in a minute, but I want to put on the record some issues relating to Lincolnshire, which was the only police authority in England and Wales in 2003&ndash;04 to have its funding per head reduced. I want an assurance from the Minister this afternoon that that trend will not continue in the forthcoming financial settlement.</p>
	<p pid=".290.1/2">Lincolnshire police authority faces an extra &pound;6.9   million in costs in the financial year 2005&ndash;06, &pound;1.8   million of which is specifically for the increased burden of police pensions. Will the Minister and the Home Office consider making a special one-off payment to offset this year's pensions bulge for Lincolnshire police authority?</p>
	<p pid=".290.1/3">Early indications are that the Government will provide only a 3 per cent. increase in grant, which leaves Lincolnshire to find &pound;3.9 million from council tax. That shortfall will lead to an increase of up to 20 per cent. in the precept on local people in Lincolnshire, which is totally unacceptable. People realise that they must make a contribution, but it should be a fair one. There is a massive disparity of more than 50 per cent. between the allocation of funding per head in Lincolnshire, which was &pound;102.31 in the 2003&ndash;04 financial year, and that in the constituency of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/778" name="Alan Campbell">the hon. Member for Tynemouth (Mr. Campbell)</phrase>, which is &pound;166 per head. That is completely unacceptable. In this day and age, people in rural areas suffer many of the same problems of drugs and other criminal activity as those in urban areas.</p>
	<p pid=".290.1/4">I urge the Minister to ensure that Lincolnshire receives a fair share of police funding. If the police authority received funding at the national average, never mind at the level suggested by the hon. Member for Tynemouth, there would be up to &pound;15 million more to spend, which would enable it to provide a full and proper service to the people of Lincolnshire.</p>

	<p pid=".290.2/1">This has been an extraordinarily useful and timely debate. It is a great shame that not all Members have had the opportunity to contribute to it, but I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1036" name="David Laws">the Member for Yeovil (Mr. Laws)</phrase> on introducing it. I could, if I were so minded, come in behind him on matters that pertain to Avon and Somerset, as he is my parliamentary neighbour and I have worked very closely with him over the years in trying to ensure that proper resources are allocated to the Avon and Somerset constabulary.</p>
	<p pid=".290.2/2">The paradox is that we are finally having some success. East Somerset is getting a few extra officers on the beat as well as community support officers, which we welcome. Indeed, I will see newly appointed officers this Friday and will welcome them to the area. That has been a long time coming. We were without the resources for many years under the previous Government, and have spent many years under this one without them. What we are trying to say today is that we do not want to turn the clock back again as a result of this year's settlement. If we do not obtain the resources, we will simply not be able to concentrate on areas in which the Government and all Members, whatever their political hue, want action to be taken.</p>
	<p pid=".290.2/3">We want greater visibility in rural areas of our constituencies and a greater police presence in the neighbourhoods of our cities. We want effective work to be done on prolific offenders, which Avon and Somerset has been particularly good at, but it is an expensive option that needs resources to make it work. We want better drug interdiction, and burglaries and car crime to continue to be driven down. We want the work on domestic violence to be enhanced. Indeed, we debated that in our consideration of the Domestic Violence, Crime and Victims Bill. We particularly want an effective response to gang warfare, which is all too prevalent in some of our cities&mdash;Bristol is no exception.</p>

	<p pid=".291.0/1">My hon. Friend may remember that the rural policing grant was omitted from the police settlement when that was first announced last year, and reinstated only after lobbying. Does he agree that the Minister could perform a great service today if she confirmed that the rural policing grant will be included in the police settlement?</p>

	<p pid=".291.1/1">The Minister certainly could do that. She may have made that commitment when we debated the matter recently in response to a debate on West Mercia police, but I will ask her to repeat it today for the benefit of Members who are present.</p>
	<p pid=".291.1/2">In recent years, we have seen an increase in police numbers, which is welcome. Less welcome is the fact that it has been funded largely by the council tax payer. We welcome the fact that the Government have allowed that expansion, but we are concerned that they should take credit for it as though the money came from Government resources. In reality, much of the increase has been paid for by local tax payers through the council tax.</p>
	<p pid=".291.1/3">For all the reasons that I have given, we want to see more activity, particularly in the more obscure areas covered in the excellent White Paper published yesterday. I give credit to the Government for that&mdash;it contains much that we support&mdash;but we want the resources to make it happen. Investment is needed now if we are to release officers on to the street and away from their bureaucratic burdens. That cannot be done without cost; there is a front-loading cost to be met if we are to provide the technology that enables the police to pursue their activities on the street, which is where we want them to be.</p>
	<p pid=".291.1/4">Many police authority areas have unavoidable commitments, and pensions are a big component of that. We have debated the difficulties of pensions many times. Indeed, I have often repeated the assurance that I was given by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1079" name="David Maclean">the right hon. Member for Penrith and The Border (David Maclean)</phrase> in 1996 that it would all be dealt with&mdash;but it was not dealt with then, nor since. The Government are at last bringing forward proposals, but we remain to be persuaded that the funds are available to resource those proposals without affecting direct policing.</p>

	<p pid=".292.0/1">Surrey has the highest precept; Surrey people pay 43 per cent. for police funding despite savings of &pound;15.9 million, and they are now at risk of paying more than 50 per cent.

	<p pid=".292.1/1">My hon. Friend is right. The Surrey police authority was explicit in its advice to its members. It said:</p>
	<p pid=".292.1/2" class="indent">&quot;The present funding gap is &pound;350 million UK-wide, and &pound;11.3 million in Surrey; without a change in this situation there will be cuts.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".292.1/3">The chief constable of Hampshire constabulary, Paul Kernaghan, said:</p>
	<p pid=".292.1/4" class="indent">&quot;I am very conscious that the level of grant announced to date is insufficient to maintain our current level of service.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".292.1/5">Norfolk constabulary made exactly the same point:</p>
	<p pid=".292.1/6" class="indent">&quot;By far the largest expenditure item in all constabulary is staff salaries, yet the government now effectively controls police officer establishment levels by means of the Crime Fighting Fund&mdash;reductions in police officers result in commensurate reductions in grant.&quot;</p>

	<p pid=".292.2/1">Is the hon. Gentleman aware that, according to the police authority, the gap is 6.9 per cent. in Hertfordshire? Does he share my worry that many home county authorities have a retention problem because London is able to pay &pound;4,000 more per officer?</p>

	<p pid=".292.3/1">I certainly understand that, but I understand also that the lack of area cost adjustment payments means that many peripheral forces are disadvantaged; they are paying the same scale rates as many of the home county forces, but without the resources to support those payments.</p>
	<p pid=".292.3/2">We do not have enough time to do justice to the subject. I am aware of the many pressures on the Home Office budget this year. The burgeoning prison population is a huge drain, as are the pressures caused by asylum and immigration. The need to invest in new technologies and the Government's scheme for identity cards, if it goes ahead, will also have a huge effect on finances. We have yet to discover the costs of the serious and organised crime agency, a measure that I entirely support, but I want to know from where the funding will come.</p>
	<p pid=".292.3/3">What worries many of us is not that chief constables and police authorities are engaged in some perverse shroud waving simply for effect&mdash;they provide the front-line services on which we depend&mdash;but that they are taking a candid look at what is needed for next year. They realise that something approaching 3 per cent. will not be adequate, as it will not meet their needs. Although it may not result in fewer police officers, they say that it will certainly result in cuts to front-line services because civilianisation will be put into reverse and police officers will be put back into the police stations to do the backroom jobs. Chief constables and the police authorities are expressing a real concern.</p>
	<p pid=".292.3/4">I know from experience in my area that basic command unit commanders are being asked to bring forward budgets for consideration that show real-term cuts. That is what the Government's present spending figures imply. Those who are most committed to the objective of reducing crime, which we share with the Government, will be the hardest hit if the budgets go ahead.</p>
	<p pid=".292.3/5">The Home Office needed this debate and it needs more such debates, because it has a battle to win with the Treasury to ensure that the police service gets the funds needed to do the job. I regard the deferral of the announcement as a good sign that perhaps matters are being reconsidered. I welcome what the Home Secretary said yesterday. He pulled half a rabbit out of a hat&mdash;if that is not a rather macabre vision&mdash;in making it clear that some rethinking is going on.</p>
	<p pid=".292.3/6">The Minister needs to confirm that the settlement will be above 3 per cent. and to tell us whether the floors and ceilings will be retained, whether there is any intention to cap police authorities&mdash;that would be wholly counter-productive in the coming year&mdash;and whether the rural policing fund, which we are told will have no inflation component, will persist beyond the coming year.</p>
	<p pid=".292.3/7">Most of all, the Minister needs to tell us whether the Government are really committed to what they say in &quot;Building Communities, Beating Crime: A better police service for the 21st century&quot;, the new White Paper. It contains 10 commitments to the police service. Commitment 4 is that the police service should be confident that</p>
	<p pid=".292.3/8" class="indent">&quot;policing is being supported properly by Government&mdash;with officers and staff having the resources, powers and equipment they need to do their jobs effectively&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".292.3/9">That is the key to good policing and what many people up and down the country will expect from the Home Secretary and the Minister in years to come. However, it is currently under threat.</p>

Although I have harsh things to say about the Government's performance in that regard, I hope that if she takes one thing away from the debate, it will be that in the three main political parties, there is a strong view that the police service and therefore our constituents could be short-changed by the settlement that we receive this year. We very much hope that she will be able to ensure that that does not happen.</p>

	<p pid=".294.1/1">I am pleased to have given way to my hon. Friend, not least because hon. Members were deprived of hearing a speech from him in this important debate.</p>
	<p pid=".294.1/2">We heard a most interesting contribution from <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/778" name="Alan Campbell">the hon. Member for Tynemouth (Mr. Campbell)</phrase>. He, too, urged the Minister to get a good settlement from the Treasury. I suspect that, with some of the coded words that he used, he was warning her of the importance of that. He suggested that not everyone believes that community support officers are the panacea that the Government think they are. Opposition Members do not oppose CSOs, but we think it a mistake to increase so substantially the funding for them and to increase the number of such officers without any proper independent and reliable evaluation. If we saw such an evaluation, we might have more sympathy with the Government's argument.</p>
	<p pid=".294.1/3">My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1227" name="Keith Simpson">the Member for Mid-Norfolk (Mr.   Simpson)</phrase>, as ever, stood up for Norfolk and argued forcefully about the difficulties facing the county. We then heard the most remarkable speech of the day, from <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1282" name="Paddy Tipping">the hon. Member for Sherwood (Paddy Tipping)</phrase>. I saw the phalanx of Nottinghamshire Members of Parliament here today and asked myself what they were doing. Nottinghamshire MPs have a reputation for rugged individuality. On the speech of the hon. Member for Sherwood, I will only suggest strongly that the Minister listens more carefully to my right hon. and learned Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/802" name="Kenneth Clarke">the Member for Rushcliffe (Mr. Clarke)</phrase> and the hon. Members for Nottingham, South (Alan Simpson) and for Nottingham, North (Mr. Allen) about how she should deal with policing in Nottinghamshire. Secondly, what I take away from the hon. Gentleman's contribution&mdash;I shall be on the phone shortly after this debate&mdash;is the good news for the Gedling Conservatives. Clearly, Labour is in trouble in Gedling. There is no other conceivable reason why he could have made such a speech. I give way to him with the greatest of pleasure.</p>

	<p pid=".294.2/1">I am sure that the Conservatives in Gedling will be interested that the hon. Gentleman endorses the comments that they are disgusted and ashamed of the area where they live. They will take it from him because they will remember him as a failed Member there.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2004-11-10.295.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1115" speakername="Andrew Mitchell" colnum="295"  time="015:11:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200304/cmhansrd/vo041110/halltext/41110h03.htm#41110h03_spnew46">
	<p pid=".295.0/1">I rest my case. It is clear that the Labour party is worried about what is happening in Gedling. I neither endorse nor repudiate what was said by the Gedling Conservatives. They are doing a first-class job in standing up for the people of my old constituency.</p>
	<p pid=".295.0/2">Reluctantly, I must move on. We heard an excellent speech from my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1214" name="Jonathan Sayeed">the Member for Mid-Bedfordshire (Mr. Sayeed)</phrase> about the squeeze on his local police force. We then heard from <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/709" name="Vera Baird">the hon. and learned Member for Redcar (Vera Baird)</phrase>, who was unduly hard on the hon. Member for Yeovil. I agree that diversity in the police is enormously important, and although I did not agree with everything that she said, she made a most powerful and eloquent argument about that. My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1224" name="Mark Simmonds">the Member for Boston and Skegness (Mr. Simmonds)</phrase> made his points forcefully for the Lincolnshire police force in a remarkable speech; he managed to get so much into such a short period.</p>
	<p pid=".295.0/3">I fear that I will run out of time quite soon but I want to make a number of key points, which I hope tie together some of my hon. Friends' comments. The question of how we pay for the police is at the heart of the debate. Under this Government, there has been a dramatic shift in funding responsibility to the council tax payer. The average precept increase is 20 per cent. in this financial year. The precept increase in North Yorkshire was more than 75 per cent., and it was more than 50 per cent. in Gloucestershire. Police expenditure financed through council tax has doubled in real terms between 1997 and 2004. Council tax now accounts for 20 per cent. of police force expenditure, compared with only 12 per cent. before. The police precept has increased by 87 per cent.</p>
	<p pid=".295.0/4">One of the points that our constituents notice is that if one assumes the cost of a police officer is about &pound;50,000, that precept increase could have paid for more than 19,000 officers, instead of the 13,900 that we have received. The council tax precept has paid for increased police numbers, not the Government, and the public have been short-changed out of something like 5,000 police officers.</p>
	<p pid=".295.0/5">The police will suffer some serious effects. In the west midlands, which has a police force that serves some 2.5 million people and covers the three major centres of Birmingham&mdash;Britain's second city&mdash;Coventry and Wolverhampton, crime is at very high levels. The force is fully stretched. It has been seriously affected by the Government's meddling with the police grant funding formula. It lost out by &pound;27 million in the funding settlement because the amount to which it was entitled, according to the Government's funding formula, was capped by the introduction of floors and ceilings. The force lost out again in the 2004&ndash;05 funding settlement by a further &pound;27 million because of the flat increase of 3.25 per cent.</p>
	<p pid=".295.0/6">Those are serious factors that affect the west midlands. I know that the Minister has some sympathy with the case that we have put in the west midlands, but it would be remiss of me not to stand up for the force in the area that I represent. There is no doubt that recorded crime has risen hugely under this Government. It has risen by some 16 per cent. It is up from 5 million crimes to nearly 5.9 million crimes. Violence against the person is up 90 per cent. Sexual offences are up 44 per cent. Violent crime under this Government has risen by 83 per cent. Robbery is up 51 per cent. Criminal damage is up 37 per cent.</p>
	<p pid=".295.0/7">The ultimate condemnation of the Government's performance lies in how detection rates have fallen. Detection rates for violence against the person have fallen from 79 per cent. to 50 per cent., for sex crimes from 77 per cent. to below 40 per cent., for robbery from 27 per cent. to 18 per cent., and for criminal damage from 19 per cent. to 13 per cent.</p>
	<p pid=".295.0/8">The Minister appears to be in a state of denial about crime. She mouths to our constituents that crime has fallen under this Government, but the opposite is the truth. She must realise that part of coming to terms with reality is to accept, rather like a drunk, that the first phase of recovery is to acknowledge what the problem actually is. I hope she will say today that she is determined to persuade the Treasury to implement the Conservative party's proposals for an extra 40,000 police, and that she will set about a return to the detection rates that her Government inherited in 1997. She must stop the endless passion of the Home Office for ring-fencing funding and interfering. I hope that in her debates and arguments with the Treasury she will try to ensure that some of the enormous extra tax that the Chancellor of the Exchequer has taken is directed to helping our communities by increasing the money that central Government provide to police forces.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2004-11-10.296.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/737" speakername="Hazel Blears" speakeroffice="The Minister for Crime Reduction, Policing and Community Safety"  colnum="296"  time="015:21:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200304/cmhansrd/vo041110/halltext/41110h03.htm#41110h03_spmin0">
	<p pid=".296.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1036" name="David Laws">the hon. Member for Yeovil (Mr. Laws)</phrase> on securing the debate. It is clear from the number of hon. Members present that we are all concerned about policing and tackling crime and antisocial behaviour in our constituencies. It is also a testament to the lobbying powers of the Association of Police Authorities and the Association of Chief Police Officers, which have made a good case to Members of Parliament.</p>
	<p pid=".296.0/2">This has been a very cheerful debate; until the contribution of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1115" name="Andrew Mitchell">the hon. Member for Sutton Coldfield (Mr. Mitchell)</phrase>, I was going to say that it had been good-tempered, too. If I were still a Minister at the Department of Health, I might be inclined to give him a bit of advice about his blood pressure.</p>
	<p pid=".296.0/3">Many contributions were the result of assumptions about the level of police grant and of precept and uncertainty about how far police forces will be able to drive through their cashable and non-cashable efficiency gains. My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/778" name="Alan Campbell">the Member for Tynemouth (Mr. Campbell)</phrase> made a very good contribution about efficiency.</p>
	<p pid=".296.0/4">There are several imponderables in our current position on police funding, some of which will become clearer in the next few weeks. Hon. Members press me about funding, and I try to keep as a straight a face as I can&mdash;it is a little like playing poker. Before the formal settlement is made, I cannot talk about the general level of police grant or the specific grants other than to reaffirm what I have already said about the rural policing grant, which is that it is &pound;30 million and is distributed to about 31 forces. It will still be around for the next year, because we recognise that it has been a great help to many of the forces mentioned by hon. Members.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2004-11-10.297.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/737" speakername="Hazel Blears" colnum="297"  time="015:21:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200304/cmhansrd/vo041110/halltext/41110h03.htm#41110h03_spnew48">
	<p pid=".297.1/1">I will not, as I have only seven minutes to try to cover all the points that hon. Members raised.</p>
	<p pid=".297.1/2">I am grateful to the hon. Member for Yeovil for acknowledging the improvements that have been made. Many hon. Members also acknowledged that an increased numbers of police officers and community support officers have been out in the community in the last couple of years giving the public the reassurance that they want from the police service, and I am delighted about that.</p>
	<p pid=".297.1/3">My hon. Friend the Member for Tynemouth mentioned the pilot study on the civilianisation of the custody function in his constituency. It is one of the most ambitious work force modernisation pilots, which has released 93 police officers for front-line activity, and it is a good example of efficiency.</p>
	<p pid=".297.1/4">Hon. Members, including my hon. Friend, asked about the allocation of community support officers, and I am considering my submission on that at present. The fund available is oversubscribed by almost 100 per cent. We have had bids for &pound;100 million, but we have &pound;50   million, so I shall need to make the allocations carefully.</p>
	<p pid=".297.1/5">I am delighted that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1227" name="Keith Simpson">the hon. Member for Mid-Norfolk (Mr. Simpson)</phrase> acknowledged the progress made. He raised the issue of funding for a helicopter; helicopters have to be funded partly by a contribution from the force, and Norfolk has not so far been prepared to make a contribution, but the door is still open if it wants to discuss the matter further.</p>
	<p pid=".297.1/6">My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1282" name="Paddy Tipping">the Member for Sherwood (Paddy Tipping)</phrase>, in an excellent and passionate contribution, reminded me of my visit last Thursday and Friday to Nottingham, where I met police officers, local leaders and residents. I saw the video ID suite, which saves a fortune, and met the robbery team, who are out on the streets driving down robbery.</p>
	<p pid=".297.1/7">Despite his position as a Government Whip and his inability to make contributions in the opening part of parliamentary proceedings, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/808" name="Vernon Coaker">the Member for Gedling (Vernon Coaker)</phrase> has been a champion for his local area. He has lobbied me for more police officers, community support officers and funding. I can barely walk through Parliament without him constantly stopping me on behalf of his community. I am delighted that the performance of Nottinghamshire police is improving, and we must ensure that investment is used to its best effect. I have received a further report in the past week from Nottingham about the problems of serious and organised crime, and I will deal with it carefully.</p>
	<p pid=".297.1/8">My hon. and learned Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/709" name="Vera Baird">the Member for Redcar (Vera Baird)</phrase> made an important contribution about diversity. Recruiting more women is important in implementing some of the findings of the White Paper, but we also need a different relationship, culture and set of skills in the police force. We need to recruit more from black and minority ethnic communities and more disabled people. We want the police force to look like the communities it serves.</p>
	<p pid=".297.1/9">My hon. and learned Friend spoke about the &pound;7.5   million gap in the budget of Cleveland police. There have clearly been difficulties with financial management in the force. I shall ask officials to engage with the force to see what can be done, but I cannot offer specific extra funding today. I am conscious of the difficulties in that community.</p>
	<p pid=".297.1/10"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/950" name="David Heath">The hon. Member for Somerton and Frome (Mr. Heath)</phrase> welcomed much of the ongoing improvement. He mentioned technology. With video ID suites, automatic number plate recognition and fingerprinting improvements, we are driving through efficiencies so that we can continue to provide good police services with the available resources.</p>
	<p pid=".297.1/11">Several hon. Members mentioned that local precepts have risen to fund extra officers. In fact, 9,650 of the extra 13,000 police officers have been funded through the crime fighting fund rather than through local precepts. I entirely acknowledge that local people have made a big contribution to providing extra officers, but a huge amount has come from central Government funding&mdash;we still provide nearly 80 per cent. of police funding. Although local percentage increases have risen, there has been a massive increase in Government funds.</p>
	<p pid=".297.1/12">The allegations from the hon. Member for Sutton Coldfield and his intemperate expression of the current situation contrast with what everyone else has said. People have spoken about improvements on the ground, more police officers, performance increases, people feeling safer in their communities and crime falling by 30 per cent. Let us not judge him on what he says, but on the record of his party. There were 11,000 fewer police officers under the Conservatives, and crime doubled. It is easy for him to talk intemperately about these issues, but I ask him to reflect on his party's record, and I ask other hon. Members to judge the Conservatives on what they did, not what they say.</p>
	<p pid=".297.1/13">I hope to provide a good police grant settlement. The Home Secretary said yesterday that we are doing everything possible to generate a realistic police grant, as we did last year. We took &pound;140 million from the rest of the Home Office and put it into police grant because we recognised how important tackling crime and antisocial behaviour is for constituents in their communities.</p>
	<p pid=".297.1/14">Finally, I shall turn to pensions. There is a pensions increase for most authorities this year. Some authorities have managed to put away &pound;161 million in reserves. Authorities knew that they would have a spike in pensions on retirements, but I appreciate that it is a difficult situation. Rather than delaying, the Government have sought to change the pension scheme from next year, to iron out volatility and avoid peaks and troughs. However, the combination of authorities' reserves, potential efficiencies, a reasonable police grant and a reasonable precept should enable us to carry on providing the excellent levels of policing and community safety on which the Government have a proud record.</p>

	Gypsy Encampment (Minety)
</major-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2004-11-10.299.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/919" speakername="James Gray" colnum="299"  time="015:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200304/cmhansrd/vo041110/halltext/41110h04.htm#41110h04_spnew0">
	<p pid=".299.1/1">I am very pleased to have the opportunity to raise an extremely important constituency issue. For the record, the correct pronunciation is &quot;Mine-tee&quot;, and a wonderful place it is, too. However, in recent weeks and months&mdash;indeed, it is getting on for two years&mdash;what was a peaceful and remote rural village has, in effect, been wrecked by the presence of 50 or 60 Gypsy caravans, whose owners have illegally occupied a greenfield site.</p>
	<p pid=".299.1/2">This is a timely debate because the issue affects not only Minety, but a great many other places throughout England. Most notable among them are Smithy Fen near Cottenham, where the problem that I am about to describe is particularly bad, and North Curry in Somerset, which has recently had the Minety experience again. So the debate is of more than purely constituency interest, and the Minister's reply will be of interest to hon. Members from throughout England. Indeed, even the Prime Minister suggested at Prime Minister's Question Time last Wednesday that he would leave no stone unturned in seeking a solution to this intractable problem, so we are looking forward to hearing what the Minister has to say on his behalf.</p>
	<p pid=".299.1/3">Under the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994, we could remove Gypsies when they were illegally camped on public or private land. That was easily done; it was a good Act and it worked rather well. In recent years, however, the pattern has changed: instead of illegally entering public or private land, Gypsies purchase land and occupy it covertly, having put it around that they want it for agricultural purposes. They nearly always invade the site after office hours on a Friday evening so that the local district council has gone home for the weekend. They breach the hedges, bringing in dozens of lorries of hardcore to lay down hard standing. They bring cesspits and even lay on electricity and, in many cases, telephones. An army of caravans then arrives&mdash;in my constituency, it was 50 or 60, but there were even more in Cambridgeshire, which was a particularly bad case. The same happened in Newbury and a variety of other places. By Monday morning, when the district council returns to work, it finds a well established Gypsy encampment of 50 or 100 caravans.</p>
	<p pid=".299.1/4">The Gypsies then put in a retrospective planning application for the site, which the district council, of course, turns down. Naturally enough, the Gypsies go to appeal on the issue. Attempts are made to remove them. In my constituency, Wiltshire county council tried to use highways matters in the High Court to do that, but the court will defer any such removal action until an appeal has been heard, which, by definition, may be a year to 18 months from the date of the illegal occupation. If the Gypsies take the matter further&mdash;they have talked about going to the European Court of Human Rights and to other organisations&mdash;it could be several months or years before proper action is taken to end what, by anybody's standards, is an illegal occupation.</p>
	<p pid=".299.1/5">The Gypsies seem to hope that inertia will set in and that people will say that it is easier to leave them where they are than to remove them because they have been there for such a long time. Well, I can tell them that, as far as Minety goes, they have chosen the wrong village. People there are up in arms in a big way about the issue. I have held two public meetings, both of which were attended by 400 extremely angry people who wanted to take all kinds of action to have the Gypsies removed.</p>
	<p pid=".299.1/6">If the Gypsies think that the MP for the area is a pushover, they have made a mistake there, too. I assure those Gypsies, who are making the lives of several of my constituents hell&mdash;I use the word advisedly&mdash;that if they think we will roll over and let them stay, they are quite wrong. I have been to two or three such debates in this Chamber, so I know that the same applies to several other areas, where the Member of Parliament is fighting the case very hard.</p>
	<p pid=".299.1/7">The debate is particularly timely because, on Monday, the Select Committee on Office of the Deputy Prime Minister produced what, in many ways, was a carefully researched and thought through report on the problem. I welcome the fact that the Committee has done that work, and we look forward to the Government's response. However, I have no hesitation in taking issue with one of the main conclusions reached by the Select Committee&mdash;that the solution to the kind of illegal occupancy of land that I have described in Minety is the provision of more Gypsy sites throughout England. The Committee seems to think that if we provide enough Gypsy sites for the 3,500 caravans that are illegally parked at present, that will solve the problem.</p>
	<p pid=".299.1/8">If that is the case, where will those sites be built? They would be small sites&mdash;perhaps 10 caravans per site&mdash;and we would therefore be looking for 300 or 350 more sites just for a few caravans. Given that we are talking only about rural constituencies, that would probably mean three or four proper Gypsy caravan sites in each of those rural constituencies. My constituency would doubtless be one of them, and if I was challenged to find three or four sites for a legal Gypsy encampment in North Wiltshire, I would be hard pressed to do so&mdash;indeed, I would not consider doing so.</p>
	<p pid=".299.1/9">The Committee's conclusion also ignores the fact that the Gypsies do not seem to want to go to certain parts of England&mdash;they seem to want to go to particular places&mdash;and also that they do not want to go on to local authority sites. In Wiltshire, for example, we have an abundance of local authority sites&mdash;perhaps I exaggerate my case a little by using the word &quot;abundance&quot;&mdash;but there are certainly vacancies on local authority sites in Wiltshire. Indeed, a new site was recently opened outside Salisbury. The Gypsies in Minety left a local authority site in Swindon&mdash;a legitimate, sensible local authority site&mdash;and moved on to their own land.</p>
	<p pid=".299.1/10">The pattern appears to be that Gypsies do not to want to live on local authority sites, but on land that they themselves own. I rather encourage that. It seems to me to be eminently sensible to encourage them to set up their own sites legally and with proper planning permission. Local authorities ought to set aside and designate land for Gypsy encampments. The Gypsies could then buy that land and put an encampment on it. That seems a sensible way forward, whereas invading a site and then seeking retrospective planning permission will not work.</p>
	<p pid=".299.1/11">There is also a problem of what I would describe as a Parkinson's law of Gypsies: there has been an enormous increase in the number of Gypsies in England, which shows no sign of abating. I remember that in the early 1960s, when the original legislation on Gypsy encampments was passed, there were 3,000 caravans in England and about 1,700 illegally parked. Today, there are about 6,000 Gypsy caravans on council-approved sites, 5,000 on private sites, and about 4,000 that are illegally parked&mdash;something like 15,000 in total. In other words, the numbers have increased four times since the 1960s.</p>
	<p pid=".299.1/12">Recently, I asked a Gypsy at a meeting that I held with them, &quot;Where on earth are all these Gypsies coming from?&quot; and received probably the most disarming response that I have experienced at any recent meeting. He replied, &quot;From their mothers, I reckon.&quot; However, I do not think that that is the case&mdash;although doubtless they had something to do with it. I suspect that a significant number of Gypsies are coming in from Ireland and Romania. There is a significant influx of Gypsies into England at present and, with the expansion of the European Union, that process will doubtless continue.</p>
	<p pid=".299.1/13">I therefore do not accept that simply increasing the number of sites available&mdash;putting some sort of requirement on local authorities to provide sites&mdash;would necessarily solve the problem. In that context, I am glad to have read a press release in which the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister gave an initial reaction to the Select Committee's report. It stated:</p>
	<p pid=".299.1/14" class="indent">&quot;A duty to provide sites is not necessarily an appropriate solution. A duty has been tried before and often did not produce sufficient or appropriate provision. A duty which relates solely to the Gypsy and Traveller community reinforces the view that they should be dealt with outside the mainstream housing system.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".299.1/15">I hope that the Minister will reiterate that statement today, and confirm that placing some kind of obligation on local authorities to provide more sites would not necessarily solve the problem.</p>
	<p pid=".299.1/16">The second point on which many people watching the debate today will be keen to hear a clear statement from the Minister relates to the fact that a number of recent court cases concerning Gypsies have rested to a significant degree on the Human Rights Act 1998. There is some lack of clarity as to whether the Human Rights Act can be used in planning law during consideration of whether to allow those sites. In the recent Chichester case, the media's interpretation was that the Act had led the judge to allow the Gypsies to remain, although I think that that was a misinterpretation of the judgment. In a recent case in Cottenham, the judge delayed any decision on the site pending a legal challenge by the Gypsies using the 1998 Act. In that case, the judge commented that the Gypsies were holding a gun to the head of the councils.</p>
	<p pid=".299.1/17">Will the Minister confirm the stance taken by the Under-Secretary of State, Office of the Deputy Prime Minister, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/818" name="Yvette Cooper">the hon. Member for Pontefract and Castleford (Yvette Cooper)</phrase> at our meeting about six months ago, to which I took a group of councillors and officers from Wiltshire county council and North Wiltshire district council? At that meeting, I asked her whether the Human Rights Act 1998 should have anything to do with planning issues with regard to Gypsies, and she gave a reply that she then confirmed in writing. Her letter states:</p>
	<p pid=".299.1/18" class="indent">&quot;The European Convention on Human Rights and the Human Rights Act do not grant Gypsies immunity from planning legislation.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".299.1/19">She said also that local planning authorities, inspectors and the Secretary of State have always had to comply with convention rights</p>
	<p pid=".299.1/20" class="indent">&quot;whether the cases involve Gypsies or non-Gypsies.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".299.1/21">That sums it up exactly: Gypsies and non-Gypsies alike must conform to planning law, and the fact that some people happen to be of a nomadic frame of mind should not give any presumption in their favour in planning law. They must go through the same processes that any other constituent of mine would have to go through if they wanted to set up their holiday caravan in a field. There is no reason why a person who calls himself a Gypsy, Traveller, new-age Traveller or any of the other descriptions around, should have a presumption in their favour. The presumption against allowing such things should apply to them in the same way as to anyone else.</p>
	<p pid=".299.1/22">The European Court of Human Rights confirmed that approach in the Chapman case of 2001, in which it said that any kind of presumption in favour of Gypsies would be</p>
	<p pid=".299.1/23" class="indent">&quot;tantamount to imposing on the United Kingdom . . . an obligation . . . to make available to the Gypsy community an adequate number of suitably equipped sites.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".299.1/24">The court said that it was not convinced that the human rights convention could be interpreted to allow</p>
	<p pid=".299.1/25" class="indent">&quot;such a far-reaching . . . obligation of general social policy&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".299.1/26">to be imposed on member states.</p>
	<p pid=".299.1/27">So, the ECHR seems to have laid down that the Human Rights Act does not apply, and the Under-Secretary of State seems to have confirmed that in her letter to me, but the judges in certain recent cases seem to be unclear as to whether the Human Rights Act applies. The Minister might like to use this opportunity, if he does nothing else, to shed some light on this particular legal point about the degree to which Gypsies may use the Act in seeking to obtain a retrospective planning application.</p>
	<p pid=".299.1/28">Leaving the legal question aside, it seems to me&mdash;and the Prime Minister, if he is to believed&mdash;that people in Minety, and many other places across England, should be able to remove people such as the Gypsies in Minety. They are breaking the law; they have illegally moved into a greenfield site in the middle of the countryside. No one disputes that they have broken planning law. Even the Gypsies do not dispute that; they do not say, &quot;We are here legally.&quot; They accept that they are there illegally.</p>
	<p pid=".299.1/29">The first duty of the Government should be to come up with a mechanism whereby we can remove such people more easily and quickly. Several proposals have been put forward, most notably last year, in the private Member's Bill of an hon. Friend of mine, which would have allowed stop notices to be applied to Gypsies instantly on their discovery, and their instant removal so that they could seek prospective rather than retrospective planning permission for their site. In other words, it would have put them in precisely the same situation as any other applicant. The Ministry or the Government should tell councils such as North Wiltshire district council what they can do better to enforce the planning law.</p>
	<p pid=".299.1/30">I readily accept that there are complex legal issues&mdash;the fact that the courts are so busily occupied looking into Gypsy sites is evidence of that, but positive discrimination in favour of Gypsies is as bad as negative discrimination against them. I hope that the Minister agrees. It is plain that, in equity, Gypsies should be treated in precisely the same way as anyone else. I have no objection to their nomadic way of life; I respect that they want to live that way. If they want to settle down, I, as a local Member of Parliament, will help them with housing and other issues, but if they want to live a nomadic way of life, they should be treated the same as any constituent who does not. If they prefer to own their sites, that is fine; let us have local authority land designated specifically for Gypsy encampments, but can we please have stronger powers to enforce the will of the local people, as represented by the district councils, for when they will not do that?</p>
	<p pid=".299.1/31">Illegal Gypsy encampments of the kind at Minety seem rapidly to be becoming a national crisis. This afternoon, we look to the Minister to show us some ways out of this difficult problem.</p>

	<p pid=".303.0/1">May I begin by congratulating <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/919" name="James Gray">the hon. Member for North Wiltshire (Mr. Gray)</phrase> on securing this debate on the important issue of Gypsies and Travellers and unauthorised developments in his constituency? I am sure he is right to say that the debate has a wider resonance than simply the case that concerns him. He will appreciate that I cannot comment on individual planning cases like that of Minety because of the appellate responsibilities of the Secretary of State.</p>
	<p pid=".303.0/2">The hon. Gentleman also referred to the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister: Housing, Planning and Local Government Committee, which published its report into Gypsy and Traveller accommodation issues earlier this week. We certainly welcome the interest shown by the Select Committee. It raises many important issues that we are already considering as part of a review of Gypsy and Traveller policy. We will respond to its report in due course. I am glad he would agree that Gypsies and Travellers should enjoy the same rights as everyone else to establish a decent place to live, as long as they do so within the law. That is a point of agreement across the Chamber.</p>
	<p pid=".303.0/3">We believe in an inclusive society where members of this community have the right to pursue a traditional nomadic lifestyle and to access essential services, but I also acknowledge the problems that are often caused by unauthorised development and the concerns of the settled community when that occurs. It is for those reasons that the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister is currently undertaking a Gypsy and Traveller policy review. Officials will report to Ministers on the outcome of that shortly.</p>

</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2004-11-10.304.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/971" speakername="Phil Hope" colnum="304"  time="015:45:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200304/cmhansrd/vo041110/halltext/41110h04.htm#41110h04_spnew2">
	<p pid=".304.0/1">After many years in this place, the hon. Gentleman will know that shortly means shortly. Unfortunately, I cannot define it any more exactly. I think he will appreciate that it does not mean lengthily.</p>
	<p pid=".304.0/2">The review has a focus on equality issues for the Gypsy and Traveller community and the mainstreaming of Gypsy and Traveller issues within wider local and national policy. The review is looking at how we can encourage more publicly provided and privately owned sites and how to overcome some of the unnecessary barriers that exist to site provision. We want the planning system to reflect the mainstreaming of Gypsy and Traveller accommodation within the wider social housing context. The hon. Gentleman mentioned that at the end of his remarks. We also want it to support changes that will lead to the improvement of the health of Gypsies and Travellers who have the poorest health status of any black or minority ethnic group in England.</p>
	<p pid=".304.0/3">As a part of this wider policy review, we have already started a thorough review of the Gypsy sites planning circular and will be publishing a new draft circular for consultation later in the autumn. That gives the hon. Gentleman some clues as to how close we may be to that process. While the Government recognise that some Gypsies and Travellers wish to embrace a nomadic lifestyle, we know that others prefer to live a more settled existence on local authority or private sites. I want to draw what I hope will be a helpful distinction between unauthorised development and unauthorised camping.</p>
	<p pid=".304.0/4">An unauthorised encampment is one where the land is not owned by those setting it up. I will talk about this later if I have time. The focus of the debate today has been on unauthorised developments. An unauthorised development is where a person or persons, be they Gypsies and Travellers or members of the settled community, purchase land and carry out development for which planning permission is required, but where no such permission has been granted. That is considered a breach of planning control and amounts to unauthorised development. Local planning authorities have a range of enforcement powers to deal with unauthorised development.</p>
	<p pid=".304.0/5">While I cannot comment on specific planning cases, it might be useful to say a few words about the Government's policy on Gypsy and Traveller sites and planning. Planning policies concerning the provision of suitable locations for Gypsy and Traveller sites, whether local authority provided or private, are set out in the Department of the Environment circular 1/94, published in 1994, entitled &quot;Gypsy Sites and Planning&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".304.0/6">The current circular recognises the desire of many Gypsies and Travellers to buy their own sites to develop and manage. Gypsy and Traveller sites constitute development and therefore require planning permission. In formulating their development plans, local authorities are encouraged to discuss Gypsies' accommodation needs with the Gypsies themselves, with a view to identifying suitable locations for Gypsy and Traveller sites in plans wherever possible.</p>
	<p pid=".304.0/7">For many local authorities, especially in rural areas, the identification of sites is not easy, as the hon. Gentleman said. Where local authorities find it impossible to identify suitable locations, they must define clear and realistic criteria as the basis for site provision. It is the responsibility of local authorities to judge how they frame their policies, which are open to public scrutiny and comments at inquiry.</p>
	<p pid=".304.0/8">Local plans must take account of local circumstances. For example, Gypsy and Traveller sites are not among the uses that are normally appropriate on greenbelt land, in areas of special scientific interest or on open land where development is severely restricted. The onus is on the applicant to prove special circumstances that overcome the harm through inappropriateness.</p>

	<p pid=".305.0/1">The Minister specifies the different types of land that circular 1/94 mentions as inappropriate, but he has not yet mentioned areas of outstanding natural beauty. Does the circular make any reference to them? If so, is there a preference against areas of outstanding natural beauty but in favour of other open countryside, or are Gypsy encampments in open countryside of all kinds inappropriate?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2004-11-10.305.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/971" speakername="Phil Hope" colnum="305"  time="015:45:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200304/cmhansrd/vo041110/halltext/41110h04.htm#41110h04_spnew4">
	<p pid=".305.1/1">I am going to discuss later in detail how the planning system works when an unauthorised development occurs in a place that, for any number of reasons, might be inappropriate and what the planning authority can do to ensure that matters are put right.</p>
	<p pid=".305.1/2">The special circumstances that allow a site to be developed might include health and educational needs, but it would be for the planning authority to decide on that, using the planning system.</p>
	<p pid=".305.1/3">The 1994 circular is not working effectively in many areas to identify enough appropriate sites. Recent caravan counts have shown that there are around 3,500 caravans on unauthorised developments and encampments in England&mdash;I think that the hon. Gentleman mentioned the figure of 4,000&mdash;of which around a third are in the eastern region. The new circular is likely to stress the importance of local authorities undertaking a proper quantitative assessment of need, of meeting that need via proper spatial planning through the new regional planning process, and of the identification of specific sites and achievable criteria that offer some certainty of planning permission being granted.</p>
	<p pid=".305.1/4">Unfortunately, some Gypsies and Travellers often proceed to establish sites without first obtaining the necessary planning consent, as the hon. Gentleman described. In many cases, the locations that they choose are inappropriate in land use terms, such as where land is in the green belt or open countryside. Enforcement action by local authorities against such unauthorised development is therefore common.</p>
	<p pid=".305.1/5">In addition, the Government expect the standard of the behaviour from Gypsies and Travellers to be the same as that expected in the settled community. Any antisocial behaviour will be dealt with in the same way.</p>

	<p pid=".305.2/1">Will the Minister give way?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2004-11-10.305.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/971" speakername="Phil Hope" colnum="305"  time="015:45:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200304/cmhansrd/vo041110/halltext/41110h04.htm#41110h04_spnew6">
	<p pid=".305.3/1">I have more to say.</p>
	<p pid=".305.3/2">Travellers and Gypsies, whatever type of site or encampment they are on, should take responsibility for their plots or for the land next to them, keep them clean, not tip waste, dispose of waste properly and not cause a nuisance to neighbours. The availability of alternative sites can be a consideration when appeals against enforcement notices are determined, but only when considering such sites as alternatives to a proposed location that is not suitable itself in planning terms.</p>
	<p pid=".305.3/3">Local authorities have a key role to play in identifying suitable locations for sites and in working with Gypsies to help them find land that they can purchase and develop. A few planning authorities have now adopted that best practice. Although that does not deal with the issues that the hon. Gentleman raised, close co-operation between local authorities and Gypsies is very much the best way forward to reduce instances where Gypsies establish sites unlawfully&mdash;in some cases causing friction between the Gypsy and Traveller and settled communities.</p>
	<p pid=".305.3/4">The Government share the view that local planning authorities should take appropriate enforcement action if they consider an unacceptable breach of planning control to have occurred. There is a range of tools at local planning authorities' disposal. Under powers in the Town and Country Planning Act 1990, as amended by the Planning and Compensation Act 1991, local planning authorities have wide-ranging enforcement powers to deal with breaches of planning control. There are powers to serve a planning contravention notice, issue an enforcement notice, serve a stop notice and serve a breach of condition notice, the ability to seek an injunction in the High Court and, finally, improved powers of entry on to land. We also recently introduced the temporary stop notice under the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004. I will write to the hon. Gentleman about what each of those planning powers means, if that would help him, rather than read through the detail here, given the limited time available to me in this debate.</p>
	<p pid=".305.3/5">Powers also exist under section 178 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 that enable a local planning authority to enter and remove unauthorised developments that are in breach of an enforcement notice. Section 178 provides that where an enforcement notice requires steps to be taken that are not taken within the period of compliance with the notice, the local planning authority may enter the land, take the steps and recover from the person who is the owner of the land any expenses reasonably incurred by them in doing so. We have also undertaken a review of the planning enforcement system as a whole, not only for unauthorised Gypsy and Traveller sites but for other unauthorised developments, and we expect to make an announcement about the review later this year.</p>
	<p pid=".305.3/6">The hon. Gentleman mentioned human rights in particular. It is, of course, for the local planning authority to determine planning applications, as I just described, and to take breach notices in the sequence that I just outlined. As part of that process, the local authority needs to consider what impact its decision may have on the human rights of individuals.</p>
	<p pid=".305.3/7">I want to make it absolutely clear that Gypsies and Travellers do not have special human rights. Everyone has human rights, and all public authorities must act compatibly with convention rights and take decisions individually case by case. Likewise, when inspectors take decisions about appeals, it is for them to decide, as decision takers, whether human rights issues are involved.</p>
	<p pid=".305.3/8">Decisions may be challenged on the ground of human rights, but because of the nature of the system, the outcome of such challenges lies with the courts at the end of the appeal sequence, as the hon. Gentleman knows. It would not be appropriate or possible for me to guess the outcome. The European Court of Human Rights has recognised that complex issues are often involved in planning and that decision takers at all levels are required to exercise discretionary powers in the course of their duties. I want to emphasise that everyone has human rights in these circumstances.</p>
	<p pid=".305.3/9">Unauthorised encampments are a local concern, but we know that authorities may operate a policy of toleration to allow such encampments, not developments, to remain temporarily where they are not causing problems. I stress that that policy does not mean tolerating mess, nuisance or bad behaviour. That is not what toleration means. As I said, it means tolerating the existence of encampments where they are not causing problems. Agreed standards must be maintained, or toleration is not an appropriate policy.</p>
	<p pid=".305.3/10">There is a range of other powers relating to unauthorised encampments, as distinct from unauthorised developments, with which the hon. Gentleman may be familiar. The Home Office has just consulted on guidance on the new powers against trespassing that were introduced under the Anti-social Behaviour Act 2003. They will be incorporated in the guidance, and will enable the police to remove Gypsies and Travellers from unauthorised encampments with greater speed. They can be used where the police have established, through consultation with local authorities, that a suitable pitch is available on an authorised site in the area. They will obviously be more effective where local authorities have made adequate provision, and are an incentive for local authorities to establish local authority sites. There are several other detailed action points relating to unauthorised encampments, but I will not go into them now, given the time available.</p>
	<p pid=".305.3/11">The Gypsy site refurbishment grant is improving conditions on sites throughout the country and is providing new transit sites and stopping places. Revisions to the Gypsy caravan count are being put in place so that we can obtain more accurate and useful data about the network. As I said, we also have a major programme of policy review.</p>
	<p pid=".305.3/12">I have not managed to cover all the issues that I wanted to cover, but I hope that I have covered most of them. I will write to the hon. Gentleman with the details of each of the planning powers that local authorities have. We take the accommodation issue of Gypsies and Travellers very seriously. We believe that consultation with local authorities on planning matters relating to Gypsies is the right way forward before buying land on which Gypsies want to live or for planning permission for any subsequent development. I hope that many of the difficulties outlined by the hon. Gentleman may be avoided through such consultation.</p>

	<p pid=".308.1/1">This is a particularly timely debate, because the periodic review of water prices will reach the point of final determination at the beginning of December and there is considerable concern among my constituents about what that will mean for their water and sewerage bills.</p>
	<p pid=".308.1/2">I appreciate that the Government have made important progress on water policies since 1997. Leakage has been cut substantially, drinking water is the safest ever and our rivers and beaches are much cleaner. Legislation has ended disconnection and it has improved metering rights, including the right to a free water meter. In a similar debate in December 2001, which took place in the context of the then draft Water Bill, I argued that a new settlement would be needed to guide the resolution of conflicts between environmental, social and economic goals, certainly as far as the area covered by South West Water was concerned and increasingly in some other water areas too.</p>
	<p pid=".308.1/3">The experience of the current periodic price review suggests that a reappraisal is now essential. Apart from the question of affordability, there are also wider questions as to whether the present framework serves the interests of companies, shareholders and workers, and the competitiveness of our regional economy. I want to spend a minute or two to reflect on how we came to have such high prices before I go on to discuss how we might find solutions.</p>
	<p pid=".308.1/4">Following privatisation in 1989, average household bills increased steeply in the south-west. In 1999, a review was introduced that reduced water prices by 12 per cent. on average across the country and by 12.25 per cent. in the south-west. That was welcome, but it did not by any means undo the previous price hike.</p>
	<p pid=".308.1/5">Since disconnections were banned, access to water is not a widespread problem but the costs can be. The average water bill amounts to about 1 per cent. of a household's income. However, for many low-income households, the proportion is many times that. In its sustainability indicators, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs set 3 per cent. of household income as a measure of affordability. Nationally, more than 2 million households spend more. A greater proportion of such households are in the South West Water area, where some pensioners and those on jobseeker's allowance pay 9 per cent. and 13 per cent. of their income&mdash;significantly more than people in the same position in Birmingham.</p>
	<p pid=".308.1/6">The problems in the south-west lie in the original settlement at the time of the Conservative privatisation of the industry. At almost every event that I have attended to seek a solution to the south-west charges, it has been recognised that the south-west share of the green dowry fell far short of what was needed or fair. The inadequacy of the green dowry has given us the highest water bills in the country: more than &pound;100 more than the average bill. Against such a background, an increase of 17 per cent. on the average bill can be viewed only with apprehension by those who have to try to find the means to pay it, as well as by those who have to collect it and those who work hard to make our economy competitive.</p>
	<p pid=".308.1/7">As WaterVoice South West points out, the Ofwat presentation of price increases is misleading. It cites a 17 per cent. increase in the average bill for the five years between 2004&ndash;05 and 2009&ndash;10, but the typical measured bill and the typical unmeasured bill over the same period will increase by 29 per cent. and 35 per cent. before inflation. That will put the typical unmeasured bill at nearly &pound;600 by 2010.</p>
	<p pid=".308.1/8">I am aware that as part of the periodic review process the Secretary of State said in her initial guidance that due weight must be given to the economic and social effects, especially with regard to vulnerable customers.</p>

	<p pid=".309.0/1">I am following the hon. Lady's speech with great interest, because she has campaigned on this issue inside and outside Parliament over the same period as I have. Does she accept that the figures that we now face are so much more dramatic precisely because lower-income households in our region have been badly hit over many years and this is only adding to that considerable burden? She said that the original legislation introduced by the Conservative Government in 1989 caused the problem, so does she accept that the absence of any rebate for low-income households in the legislation has been a major factor in the south-west?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2004-11-10.309.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/915" speakername="Linda Gilroy" colnum="309"  time="016:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200304/cmhansrd/vo041110/halltext/41110h05.htm#41110h05_spnew2">
	<p pid=".309.1/1">I agree that the root of the problem lies    in the initial privatisation settlement when, ironically, the leader of the Conservative party, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/974" name="Michael Howard">the right hon. and learned Member for Folkestone and Hythe (Mr. Howard)</phrase>, was the Secretary of State for the Environment. Over the past five or so years, there has been some stability compared with that period. We must tackle the issue at some stage, although it will not be easy.</p>
	<p pid=".309.1/2">I hope that DEFRA's review is finding ways of addressing concerns about affordability and associated debt matters that many organisations, such as WaterVoice, the National Consumer Council, the Public Utilities Reform Group&mdash;PURGe&mdash;Water UK and others, have raised over a long time. I pay tribute in particular to the National Consumer Council for its recent work in &quot;Lifelines&quot;. As the Minister will know, I have been associated with such issues in Parliament since I was elected as co-chair of the Public Utilities Reform Group.</p>
	<p pid=".309.1/3">I suspect, however, that the review will find it challenging to come up with effective answers inside the existing parameters within which the industry and its regulators operate. I therefore wish to set out for the Minister's observation the arguments for dealing with such issues in a wider context. By no means, are they all new ideas, but together they make the case for more fundamental work to be undertaken. Outdated charging systems based on rateable values last looked at in 1989 need to change. Water companies should be required to devise alternatives to charging on that basis, taking account of local conditions&mdash;one size may not fit all regions&mdash;and undertake a calculation of economic efficiency, environmental sustainability and social justice. According to its latest annual report, the Pennon Group, which owns South West Water, managed to spend &pound;6.5 million on an abortive takeover bid in its non-regulated sector. If it, and other water companies, were to put in a fraction of that amount to fund an independent reappraisal of how the system could be changed, we might begin to find some answers.</p>
	<p pid=".309.1/4">The remit of such a review could include an assessment of other relevant issues, such as clarifying the amount allowed in benefits and tax credits for water bills and the relationship between methods of charging and ease of debt collection, which would make it easier to distinguish between people who cannot pay and those who will not pay, a matter about which the industry has some concerns. I have heard about a figure of as much as &pound;10 being passed on from the &quot;won't pays&quot; to other customers, including poor and vulnerable customers.</p>
	<p pid=".309.1/5">The review could cover whether the costs involved in the voluntary metering programme is the best means of achieving conservation benefit. I have done a quick back-of-the-envelope calculation on what the 117,000 meters that may be required in the next periodic review will cost. It runs into tens of millions of pounds, especially in the south-west where conservation is perhaps not the prime issue compared with other regions. Again, perhaps one size does not fit all regions.</p>
	<p pid=".309.1/6">Some interesting proposals are emerging from a recent study by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation about the impact of green taxes on poor households. In the case of water, the report investigates the effects of universal water metering and of 11 alternative charging methods, including a lower tariff for low-income households on benefit, a free water allowance for some households and a variable tariff linked to the council tax band. Such a review could consider whether it is now time to end the ban on mergers that has resulted in overseas water companies and companies with other United Kingdom activities being able to take on water companies, but does not allow mergers between water companies in this country.</p>
	<p pid=".309.1/7">Some 15 years after privatisation, it is a little difficult to think that the injustice of the inadequate green dowry might be unpicked but, given that each periodic price review builds on the unfair settlement, surely it is not unreasonable to look for a solution that will break the vicious circle in which we are caught. I am talking not only about social justice, but the unfair competitive position that our businesses and industry are in.</p>
	<p pid=".309.1/8">I would also like the review to look into whether second homes in the south-west pay for a fair share of the costs of providing their water. My hon. Friend the Minister will know that recent changes have been made to council tax to ensure that such second home owners shoulder a fairer proportion of the price for local services. As I understand it, about half of total water and sewerage costs come from infrastructure capital costs. Is it fair that those who come to enjoy the amenity of our clean rivers and beaches and a connection to their second homes end up paying little for the benefit, as they use relatively little metered water, and that at peak times?</p>
	<p pid=".309.1/9">I know that my hon. Friend the Minister is working to ensure that the &quot;polluter pays&quot; principle is fully and correctly applied, so that costs that should more appropriately be paid by others are not passed on to customers. I am thinking particularly of the costs of diffuse agricultural pollution. However, I think that I am right in saying that the issue will not be resolved according to that determination. There is also the matter of highways drainage costs, which has considerably exercised WaterVoice South West.</p>
	<p pid=".309.1/10">In a previous debate, I mentioned the difficulty arising from the long-term nature of decisions that need to be taken on investment in the water industry, and the problem of aligning those decisions with the five-year price review. In his submission to the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Committee's first review, which reported at the end of 2003, Dr. Dieter Helm of Oxford university said the difficulty</p>
	<p pid=".309.1/11" class="indent">&quot;creates set-piece artificial decision points, focuses management on the short term, and encourages game playing.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".309.1/12">He advocates</p>
	<p pid=".309.1/13" class="indent">&quot;a longer-term view, comprising an overarching policy framework, ten-year fundamental reviews, and much more reliance on&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".309.1/14">an interim determination process</p>
	<p pid=".309.1/15" class="indent">&quot;to allow flexibility within periods.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".309.1/16">The issue was also the basis of much searching questioning in the most recent review of the determination process, conducted by the Select Committee over the past month.</p>
	<p pid=".309.1/17">Those are just a few of the subjects that merit closer examination, not just to help us resolve some of the all-too-obvious tensions in the south-west, but to ensure fairness and transparency and, through that, best value elsewhere in the country. Unless there is fairness and transparency, we will not necessarily have the best possible value. When all is said and done, regulation acts as a substitute for competition in the market, which would otherwise deliver best value.</p>
	<p pid=".309.1/18">I hope that a few of the issues raised will be addressed in the hardship review that DEFRA has in hand, but I suspect that most will not. Some of the ideas that I have put forward might provide more effective medium and long-term solutions. The wider review for which I am calling needs two stages. The first would identify the options, shortlist those likely to provide really effective solutions, and identify those that might need legislation. At that stage, all stakeholders would have a role to play. Stage 2 of the review would be for Government to take responsibility for a detailed analysis of the impact of those shortlisted options before arriving at decisions.</p>
	<p pid=".309.1/19">The regulator has made a commitment to reviewing the price determination process, but he is constrained by what statute requires of him. Even if he were not so constrained, I suspect that the whole culture of the regulator in the current framework of legislation would mean that he would look at too narrow a range of issues to come up with that full broad range of options that it would be beneficial to consider. They say that for every complex problem there is a simple solution, but that it is usually wrong. For water, that is particularly the case, and that is why I advocate a wide-ranging review.</p>
	<p pid=".309.1/20">In conclusion, I hope that by raising these matters at the present point in the price-determination cycle, I will be able to obtain from the Minister a commitment to discuss them with his colleagues in other Departments&mdash;such as, perhaps, the Treasury, which would have an interest in aspects of the matter, the Department of Trade and Industry, which has an interest in regulatory and competitiveness issues, and the Department for Work and Pensions. Those Departments come particularly to mind.There is a need to revisit the regulatory framework to stop the price-hike misery for my constituents&mdash;which is likely to cause problems, too, for our water company and possibly its shareholders, and to form the basis for a continuing competitive disadvantage to our economy.</p>

	<p pid=".312.0/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/915" name="Linda Gilroy">the Member for Plymouth, Sutton (Linda Gilroy)</phrase> not only on the way she has raised this issue but on her long involvement, through PURGe, in campaigning on utilities regulation and prices. The subject is an important one and the debate about how to deal with the issues continues.</p>
	<p pid=".312.0/2">My hon. Friend is right to say that the root of the problem is the nature of the privatisation process and the green dowry, and the base prices that were set, which now underpin future price increases and which have clearly worked to the disadvantage of the south-west. I do not dispute that.</p>
	<p pid=".312.0/3">I am conscious that water bills can be a significant cost to many households, making price increases significant too. As my hon. Friend said, the Government are currently reviewing the way in which lower-income households are helped with their water and sewerage charges. That includes considering the existing vulnerable groups provision for people on water meters and the potential for other ways of helping, such as, perhaps, setting up trust funds, as happens in some water company areas; they are used to help people on low incomes who have difficulty with bills.</p>
	<p pid=".312.0/4">My hon. Friend raised important points about water pricing and the regulatory system in general. There has been considerable discussion about that. The Government reviewed the water charging system in 1997&ndash;98. That review resulted in the Water Industry Act 1999, which introduced, for example, protection against disconnection because of important health and welfare considerations.</p>
	<p pid=".312.0/5">We have not shut down the idea of a review of structures, prices and tariffs. We remain open to new ideas about them. I shall make a point of looking at what the study done for the Joseph Rowntree Foundation had to say about green taxes and their application. I have considerable sympathy with the idea of variable tariffs, for example, but there are many different ways, as my hon. Friend will know, of applying variable tariffs. Those ideas are nevertheless worth exploring. I have in the past put forward the idea that we should consider them.</p>

	<p pid=".312.1/1">Perhaps my hon. Friend would agree that one size does not fit all and that there might be scope in the future to encourage water companies to consider the charging solutions that best suit their region.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2004-11-10.312.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1122" speakername="Elliot Morley" colnum="312"  time="016:15:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200304/cmhansrd/vo041110/halltext/41110h05.htm#41110h05_spnew4">
	<p pid=".312.2/1">Yes; if we are to examine the charging system generally, it is not unreasonable to consider regional differences. As we know, there are now regional differences in cost, although the charging mechanism is based on a similar formula.</p>
	<p pid=".312.2/2">There is likely to be an increase in bills. We want to continue with investment, which, as my hon. Friend said, has made this country's rivers and beaches the cleanest they have been in probably 100 years. People are worried about prices and we are sensitive to that, but consumers are also quite keen on high environmental standards and high quality. Those are popular and people want them. Making sure that we get those improvements at the lowest possible cost to consumers is, of course, an issue to be dealt with.</p>
	<p pid=".312.2/3">Prices rose an average of 3 per cent. in April, and customers of South West Water paid the most, with an average bill of &pound;361. However, the figures that I have, just as a matter of interest, show that in 1999 the average bill for the company, taking inflation into account, would have been &pound;394.</p>
	<p pid=".312.2/4">The Government have commissioned and published research into alternative methods of unmeasured charging, including charges based on council tax bands. However, that research shows that switching to any of the proposed alternatives would create not only winners but a large number of losers, including many of those least able to afford it and particularly those with the lowest rateable value properties. That is one problem with variable charges. It is essential that any proposals for new charging arrangements provide adequate transitional arrangements and that we consider those issues. I accept that we should consider a range of issues and that we can approach that in different ways.</p>
	<p pid=".312.2/5">In the south-west, Ofwat's proposals would lead to an average increase in bills of &pound;61 to &pound;418 over the five years to 2010, before inflation. Incidentally, that is less than half what the company has been asking for. I am well aware that that is an average and that there are different price impacts and I know that my hon. Friend is, too.</p>

	<p pid=".313.0/1">Because there has been an unusual volume of switching to metered supplies in the south-west, averages are particularly misleading there. There is the average for unmeasured and the average for measured. The gap between them is increasing and one has an impact on the other.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2004-11-10.313.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1122" speakername="Elliot Morley" colnum="313"  time="016:15:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200304/cmhansrd/vo041110/halltext/41110h05.htm#41110h05_spnew6">
	<p pid=".313.1/1">I accept the points that my hon. Friend makes. However, most customers in the south-west will save money by switching to meters, and I would encourage them to do so. My hon. Friend is well aware of that. Under water regulations, meters are provided free of charge, and that is one way to reduce bills for a large number of consumers in the south-west. That said, I know that it will not help those who are already on meters and that there are issues about unmeasured charges. There are complexities in this matter and I do not want to be glib about average increases. Let us take the increase, for example, from 1999 to 2009; the average increase in the south-west is 6 per cent. Even though that is a very low figure because of the decrease in the last round, I know that that hides significant increases for other consumers.</p>

	<p pid=".313.2/1">I welcome the Minister's open-minded approach, on which I think both the hon. Lady and I would congratulate him. However, I hope that he will recognise that the difficulty with an open-minded approach and saying that many of these issues can be examined might be that that will take a great deal of time, and this is a very urgent problem. Although the rises from 1999 to date are not that great, the rises from 1989 to now are very great. That is the background, and the problem is very urgent for next year.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2004-11-10.314.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1122" speakername="Elliot Morley" colnum="314"  time="016:15:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200304/cmhansrd/vo041110/halltext/41110h05.htm#41110h05_spnew8">
	<p pid=".314.0/1">It is true that there was a very sharp increase from 1989 and that prices have been smoothed because of the decrease in the last round and the change that the regulator has suggested to business plans now. That is right and proper. However, there are real complexities with regard to how we consider this issue and the benefits system, for example, and how we measure the affluence of both the country and regions.</p>
	<p pid=".314.0/2">There have been positive changes, including in the south-west. Let us consider the reduction in unemployment, for example. The latest figures, which go up to September this year, show that, compared to 1997, there has been a reduction in unemployment in Plymouth, Sutton of 63.5 per cent. There has been a reduction in North Cornwall of 57.5 per cent. That is significant.</p>
	<p pid=".314.0/3">The changes in tax and benefits that the Government have introduced in recent years mean that, in real terms, families in the south-west with children are, on average, &pound;1,360 a year better off. Families with children in the poorest fifth of the population will, on average, be &pound;3,000 a year better off. Pensioner households will, on average, be &pound;1,350 year better off&mdash;about &pound;26 a week. The poorest third of pensioner households will have gained &pound;1,750 a year. That is the result of the Government focusing on raising overall living standards, particularly those of people on lower incomes.</p>
</speech>

	<p pid=".314.1/1">My hon. Friend has been patient in giving way. As long as the sort of difference that I described exists for those in the south-west with pensions or the jobseeker's allowance, who pay two or three times as much as their equivalents in Birmingham, we will never be able to solve the poverty problem. Much though I welcome the fact that we have taken a million children out of poverty, there is still more to do.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2004-11-10.314.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1122" speakername="Elliot Morley" colnum="314"  time="016:15:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200304/cmhansrd/vo041110/halltext/41110h05.htm#41110h05_spnew10">
	<p pid=".314.2/1">I accept that. Part of the equation is the fact that Ofwat's proposals would lead to an increase in bills of between &pound;61 and &pound;418. The company's business plans have been significantly reduced by Ofwat, as my hon. Friend knows. In fact, it will be allowed less than half the increase that it was asking for.</p>
	<p pid=".314.2/2">The jobseeker's allowance includes a calculation to reflect the cost of such things as water. The JSA and income support are covered by what is known as the Rossi increase, based on the retail prices index to reflect cost of living increases. The Rossi index takes account of increases in a wide range of goods and services, including water and sewerage charges. However, it takes no account of housing costs or of income support help with mortgage interest payments, which are provided for separately through housing benefit. I know that those payments help people on benefits, but some people on low incomes are just above the benefit level, so not all the issues raised by my hon. Friend have been resolved.</p>
	<p pid=".314.2/3">I was interested in my hon. Friend's comments about the merger policy. It is not unreasonable that the policy should be renewed. I have said so publicly. However, I must be careful what I say. When visiting the south-west, I said very mildly that I thought my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/702" name="Candy Atherton">the Member for Falmouth and Camborne (Ms Atherton)</phrase> had a reasonable idea about merger policy, but my expression of mild support caused a share price movement. I got into a bit of trouble for that, so I must be careful.</p>
	<p pid=".314.2/4">We should look at all options. We should consider everything, including affordability, how to dealt with debt and the polluter-pays issue, which was raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Plymouth, Sutton because it throws costs onto consumers that they should not have to pay. She was right to say that we are addressing the problem, although it will be some time before consumers see the benefits of any measures that we put in place.</p>
	<p pid=".314.2/5">We must also consider the question of second homes. I certainly agree that their owners should pay their fair share. However, as my hon. Friend said, there have already been some changes. Indeed, those changes apply to Members of the House, and they are entirely justified. I also take my hon. Friend's point about looking at the legislative and regulatory framework when addressing such issues.</p>
	<p pid=".314.2/6">I reassure my hon. Friend that the regulator is dedicated to ensuring that increases are no higher than they need be. That is reflected in how he dealt with the draft business plan. The range of views that my hon. Friend expressed on the potential options need to be examined. It is important to keep an open mind about charging methods, tariffs, how to help people on low incomes, metering and fairer ways to pay for water. It is not always easy, but it is nevertheless important. I give my hon. Friend the assurance that although it will not happen overnight we will seriously consider those issues, which are important for the future.</p>
	<p pid=".314.2/7" class="italic">Question put and agreed to</p>
	<p pid=".314.2/8" class="indent">Adjourned accordingly at twenty-nine minutes past Four-o'clock.</p>
