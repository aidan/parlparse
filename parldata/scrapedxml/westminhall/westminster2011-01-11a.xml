	<p pid="a.40.2/1">It is good to serve under your chairmanship, Mrs Riordan. Like my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40176" name="Martin Vickers">the Member for Cleethorpes (Martin Vickers)</phrase>, it is the first time I have done so.</p>
	<p pid="a.40.2/2">I pay tribute to my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40572" name="Andrew George">the Member for St Ives (Andrew George)</phrase> for securing the debate, and giving me and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40497" name="Chris Bryant">the hon. Member for Rhondda (Chris Bryant)</phrase> the chance to spend the entire morning in Westminster Hall, debating a fascinating range of topics.</p>
	<p pid="a.40.2/3">My hon. Friend the Member for St Ives ranged widely across a number of constitutional issues. I hope I will deal with all the points he raised, but I might be a little pressed. I will deal first with the issues he raised, as it is his debate, and then touch on some raised by other Members. He started with the question of why the Government settled on 600 as the right number for the House of Commons. We were frank during the debate on the Bill. There is no magic about it; it is a judgment. The two coalition parties had different views before the election. They both wanted to shrink the size of the House of Commons: the Conservatives to 585, and the Liberal Democrats to 500, albeit with a change to the voting system. We settled on 600, which we thought was the right balance; as several Members have pointed out, constituencies should not be so large in population that Members could not do the job. With 600, most constituencies would be within a range that Members today would recognise, and we do not think it is an enormous leap.</p>
	<p pid="a.40.2/4">The hon. Member for Rhondda said he would be against a dramatic cut in the number of MPs. The Government would be as well; we are not making a dramatic cut. We are making a modest reduction of about 7%. One can argue about it, but I do not think anyone can say that a reduction of 7% is dramatic.</p>
	<p pid="a.40.2/5">I was aware of the Bill brought forward by the hon. Member for St Ives. He said that his Bill proposed a reduction to 500, primarily as a result of devolution. Prior to the formation of this Government, people argued that we should treat the parts of the United Kingdom that have a devolved Parliament or Assembly differently from those parts that do not, in terms of entitlement to seats at Westminster. That idea was put forward but the Government decided not to do that. We were keen to treat all parts of the United Kingdom in the same way, so the quota is a United Kingdom quota. Because of where we start from, the impact of the change in the number of seats will differ in different parts of the UK. That is because we want the weight of a constituent's vote to be equal across the United Kingdom, and that is an important principle.</p>
	<p pid="a.40.2/6">My hon. Friend the Member for St Ives, supported by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40046" name="Alan Reid">the Member for Argyll and Bute (Mr Reid)</phrase>, wanted to know what principles guided us on the two exceptions. First, we wanted a set of principles that were widely applicable and that gave the boundary commissions the chance to allow it. We made only two exceptions out of the 600 seats for exceptional geographical reasons; the constituencies both have small populations but are large enough to sustain a Member of Parliament, as they do now, because of their dispersed geography.</p>
	<p pid="a.40.2/7">I know that the matter is debatable. My hon. Friend the Member for Argyll and Bute demonstrated an encyclopaedic knowledge of his constituency, as one would expect from an assiduous Member of Parliament; he certainly taught me something. None the less, I still believe that the Government have made the right judgment about the two exceptional constituencies that he selected. I would not be so churlish as to suggest that he was pleading for anything special. However, the hon. Member for Rhondda did so; he engaged in special pleading for Wales, something about which those who participated in the debate on the Parliamentary Voting System and Constituencies Bill heard an awful lot. We heard much about the Welsh valleys and Welsh constituencies, as the record will show.</p>
	<p pid="a.40.2/8">My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40616" name="Sarah Newton">the Member for St Ives and my hon. Friend the Member for Truro and Falmouth (Sarah Newton)</phrase>, who is not in her seat, made some specific points about Cornwall. My hon. Friend the Member for St Ives spoke about what he called-I have to be careful here-the border between Cornwall and England. I think that he raised exactly the same point when we were debating the Parliamentary Voting System and Constituencies Bill. He referred today to the length of that debate; we had eight days of debate in the House, and he has obviously had the opportunity today to expand on the points that he made then.</p>
	<p pid="a.40.2/9">In response to that debate, I said that although that view is shared by some in Cornwall, the Government's position is that Cornwall is part of England and the United Kingdom; we do not recognise that boundary in quite the same constitutional way as does my hon. Friend the Member for St Ives. I understand why my hon. Friend takes that view, but I was surprised that the hon. Member for Rhondda appeared to suggest that the boundary had constitutional significance. I do not know whether the Opposition have changed policy and are trying to separate Cornwall from England, but I do not suggest that my hon. Friend takes that view.</p>
	<p pid="a.40.2/10">My hon. Friend made some good points, including about the difficulty of getting to London from his constituency. That is something that he and I can both take up with First Great Western. I see that my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40657" name="John Penrose">the Member for Weston-super-Mare (John Penrose)</phrase> has arrived for the next debate; he, too uses that train service and will concur. That will be the best way to deal with that problem.</p>
	<p pid="a.40.2/11">My hon. Friend the Member for St Ives accepted in general the strong case for moving towards equal seats. I was most impressed by his novel arguments, which I have not heard before, for claiming significant parts of the Atlantic ocean as part of his constituency. We might get into all sorts of territorial difficulties if we did so, but it was a novel idea.</p>
	<p pid="a.40.2/12">My hon. Friend and his fellow Cornwall Members met the Prime Minister and me to make a pitch and to explain why they believe that the nature of Cornwall is unique. I would leave him with this notion. The Government do not subscribe to the view that one cannot represent constituents in Cornwall and other parts of the country, Devon being the most obvious. The Member of the European Parliament who represents the whole of the south-west of England, covers Cornwall, Devon and other counties, and also represents Gibraltar. He does so perfectly ably. Cornwall and Devon also share a police force. The border is not inviolate.</p>
	<p pid="a.40.2/13">I do not accept the argument put by my hon. Friend the Member for St Ives, although I know that my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40546" name="Sheryll Murray">the Member for South East Cornwall (Sheryll Murray)</phrase> shares his view, about a Member of Parliament representing, say, part of Plymouth and part of Cornwall. Of course, some things are more important to one group of constituents than to others, but that is true of many constituencies. I have a fairly large rural constituency, and at one end of it a particular range of matters will be important that have no connection with those at the other end because of the distance. Nevertheless, I have to represent them all and understand all those issues. That is part of the job of being a Member of Parliament. The Government do not share the view that it is impossible to deal with that.</p>
