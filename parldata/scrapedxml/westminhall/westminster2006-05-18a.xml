Member for Buckingham (John Bercow)</phrase> might refer to this, but when we were last there we had the opportunity to meet the peacekeepers who were responsible for the ceasefire in the Nuba mountains. The one message that I took from that was that it was not numbers that made the difference, but organisation, logistics, a clear knowledge of what people were doing and earning the respect of the people among whom they were trying to keep the peace. I hope that the Nuba mountains are still at the back of the minds of those who are considering how this situation can be made to work.</p>

	<p pid="a.345.0/1">My hon. Friend makes an important point. Those circumstances were slightly different, in that the security situation was not anything like as difficult. I received a briefing on how those missions worked; independent monitors, one from either side, were involved and could deploy quickly. It was an effective operation, but it was operating in circumstances where the parties were not slugging it out in the way that has continued to occur in Darfur.</p>
	<p pid="a.345.0/2">There needs to be a combination of things. The first is sufficient physical presence, in particular we need to provide protection for people&mdash;the current primary need of those in the camps&mdash;and to prevent more people from being forced to flee from their homes. There also needs to be an effective mechanism for when things go wrong and there are incidents, that will allow us to get in there, investigate quickly, publish reports, call people to account for what they have done, and refer it to the mechanisms that have been created. Such mechanisms would include the sanctions committee&mdash;if evidence becomes available, that committee can examine it and take action against the individual&mdash;and the international criminal court in those circumstances.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-05-18a.346.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1669" speakername="Hilary Benn" colnum="346"  time="014:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060518/halltext/60518h0089.htm#060518124000268">
	<p pid="a.346.1/1">General Bashir had said that in the absence of a peace agreement he was not prepared to consider a UN mission coming in. The best information that I have currently is that the Sudanese Government have indicated that they are thinking about that, but I have not seen a definitive answer. The issue is relevant to a point that I intend to make about the UN Security Council's decision on Tuesday. If the hon. Gentleman will bear with me, I shall come to that.</p>
	<p pid="a.346.1/2">The third thing that we have done is provide support for a peace agreement. As we all recognise, the only answer is for people to stop fighting and to use politics, debate, argument and elections to determine what will happen in Darfur, rather than killing each other and innocent citizens of that region. That is why we have offered a lot of support to the African Union. It is important that we should recognise that the process has been led by the African Union. In the same way as security and the work of AMIS have been an African-led process, so too have the peace talks in Abuja.</p>
	<p pid="a.346.1/3">We have kept a presence there, and the then Foreign Secretary, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1423" name="Jack Straw">my right hon. Friend the Member for Blackburn (Mr. Straw)</phrase>, now the Leader of the House of Commons, travelled there in February&mdash;to be a bit unparliamentary about it&mdash;to read the Riot Act to those who had been negotiating and say that, frankly, our patience was running out, not least because the international community was paying for the consequences of the war. We are all paying to keep people in the camps because of the failure of the parties to the conflict to do what they did&mdash;in the north and the south&mdash;when they finally fought themselves to a standstill and realised that Sudan would never progress while people continued to fight. They can do exactly the same thing again if they want.</p>
	<p pid="a.346.1/4">That is why the African Union set a deadline of <phrase class="date" code="">30 April</phrase> for the next phase of the negotiation. The AU tabled an agreement. The Sudanese Government said that they were prepared to sign, but the three rebel movements said that they were not. It became clear over the weekend just before the local elections&mdash;that is how I remember the date&mdash;that the negotiations were in difficulty. That is when I and Bob Zoellick, the US Deputy Secretary of State, along with one or two others, went to Abuja to see whether we could help out, with the extremely skilful support and assistance of President Obasanjo of Nigeria&mdash;he was brilliant, if I may say so.</p>
	<p pid="a.346.1/5">In trying to get the parties to focus on what needed to be done in that four-day period, during the final stages of the negotiations, we proposed some further changes to the agreement, to try to bring the rebel movements on board. On <phrase class="date" code="">5 May</phrase> there was a signing, at which the Government of Sudan and the largest rebel movement, led by Minni Minnawi put their signatures to the agreement.</p>
	<p pid="a.346.1/6">That was a significant moment, but challenges remain. I hope that it will still be possible for the two other rebel movements&mdash;the faction of the Sudan Liberation Army/Movement, led by Abdel Wahed, and the Justice And Equality Movement, led by Khalil Ibrahim&mdash;to sign. Those two need to be on board, particularly Abdel Wahed's group, because although the Justice And Equality Movement has a national political objective, it has a small number of fighters in Darfur, whereas the other two groups are concerned particularly about Darfur.</p>
	<p pid="a.346.1/7">The agreement provides for power sharing, with a guaranteed significant role for the rebels in Darfur, in the Government in Khartoum. It provides for wealth sharing, including arrangements for compensation for individuals who have lost their homes. The agreement provides for peace and security with a ceasefire, disarmament, demobilisation and reintegration, and would deal with the Janjaweed, moving a large number of the rebel forces into the Sudanese army.</p>
	<p pid="a.346.1/8">Above all, the agreement would provide what the rebels have been fighting for; namely, regional government for Darfur. The agreement says that, within a maximum of three years, subject to a referendum and the will of the people of Darfur, if they vote for regional government, they will get regional government. In those circumstances, what is the justification for carrying on fighting? Or, are the rebels are so impatient that they are not prepared to allow people to express a view and to wait a maximum of three years? By the way, in-between there will be elections to all state legislative councils and national elections in Sudan, which the comprehensive peace agreement provides. In my view, there is no justification whatever.</p>
	<p pid="a.346.1/9">I want to make progress because I know that many hon. Members want to speak. What is the immediate task? The first is for the people of Darfur to know what is in the agreement. That is urgent. The African Union is working on that as we speak, with help from the United Kingdom, Germany and Italy. We have also been in conversation with the BBC World Service, which has tried to publicise the agreement.</p>
	<p pid="a.346.1/10">The second task is to work with the parties&mdash;the Government in Sudan and Minni Minnawi's group&mdash;to ensure that they get on with it. At a practical level, we have offered English language training to Minni Minnawi who requested that for 100 members of his group. We are also looking at ways to support him in setting up an office. Those are practical matters for anyone who wants to take the post provided for in the transition and who will be the senior assistant to the President and the fourth person in the presidency with significant influence over the composition of the transitional regional authority. Where that person will be based, when they will get to work and when they will go to Khartoum are practical issues in implementing the agreement. Frankly, there are ways in which we could make life difficult for those who stand in the way of peace.</p>
	<p pid="a.346.1/11">Above all, the agreement provides for the people of Darfur to participate in what is known as the Darfur-Darfur dialogue, but there is an issue about the extent to which the movements represent all the people of Darfur. The crisis is complex and the Darfur-Darfur dialogue is a convocation of people&mdash;the final agreement refers to 800 to 1,000 representatives. It would be one way of testing how people feel about the way forward and ensuring that there is an inclusive process to bring together all the tribes, interests and other views to ensure that progress can be made.</p>
	<p pid="a.346.1/12">On Monday, the AU Peace and Security Council welcomed the agreement, called for its implementation and confirmed&mdash;I refer to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1982" name="John Barrett">the point made by the hon. Member for Edinburgh, West (John Barrett)</phrase>&mdash;that transfer to the United Nations mission should go ahead. The AU Peace and Security Council previously said that that is what it wanted in principle and that preparations should take place, but it has now confirmed that that is what should now occur. The following day, UN Security Council resolution 1679, which the UK co-sponsored, was passed unanimously and called on the parties to implement the agreement, urged the other rebel groups to sign it, and called for the strengthening of AMIS, an acceleration of the transition to a UN force and an immediate end to violence and atrocities.</p>
	<p pid="a.346.1/13">Now that we have a peace agreement signed by at least one of the rebel movements we must go ahead with the practical tasks in hand, particularly the rapid deployment of a UN force. International pressure must be maintained on the Government of Sudan&mdash;the hon. Member for Edinburgh, West referred to this&mdash;because just as there is no justification for carrying on fighting now that there is an agreement, there is no justification in my view for the Government of Sudan to resist or obstruct in any way the preparations for a UN handover. After all, there is already a UN force in south Sudan&mdash;UNMIS&mdash;which is helping to oversee the implementation of the north-south peace agreement. There cannot be any objection in principle to having UN forces in Darfur.</p>
	<p pid="a.346.1/14">The immediate test is to give visas to the planning mission so that they can go to Darfur and start asking the questions that the hon. Member for Buckingham and others asked.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-05-18a.353.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1783" speakername="Susan Kramer" colnum="353"  time="015:25:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060518/halltext/60518h0090.htm#060518124000278">
	<p pid="a.353.0/1">I am glad to join in this debate, and I thank the Government for bringing this subject before the House. Not only do Members of Parliament have a great interest in this issue, but the British public are increasingly taking an interest, too. The public are rightly preoccupied with issues such as that campaigned for by Make Poverty History and with trade, aid and debt, but Darfur is now coming on to the radar screen. We as MPs will need to account to them for what is happening, as well as reflecting their interest in this debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.353.0/2">We are at a tense and fragile moment for peace in Darfur. We all applaud the peace agreement signed in Abuja last week by the Sudanese Government and the largest of the rebel groups, the SLM faction led by Minni Minnawi. That is a significant achievement. We also join in the congratulations to the African Union on its leadership. By chance, I had a brief word with the Secretary of State shortly after he returned from Abuja, and he talked strongly about the effectiveness of the African Union in this situation, in moving discussions forward and providing a frame for an effective process. We congratulate him and the former Foreign Secretary, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1423" name="Jack Straw">the right hon. Member for Blackburn (Mr. Straw)</phrase>. The United States, in the person of Deputy Secretary of State Robert Zoellick, has also always played a role.</p>
	<p pid="a.353.0/3">However, I remain very concerned that the two smaller rebel factions have not signed this agreement&mdash;most significantly the faction led by Abdel Wahed, who has the widespread support of the Fur people. We often forget that Darfur is the land of the Fur, and Abdel Wahed is a Fur. Although he has relatively few fighters at his command, having split with Minni Minnawi about a year ago, he has overwhelming support within the Fur community. His refusal to sign the peace agreement was based on the issue of compensation, and there have been riots across Darfur&mdash;in the west, the south and the north&mdash;in the past few days over compensation. We must be clear that people who lost their villages and livestock, either to the Janjaweed with the Government in complicity or directly to the Government through aerial bombing, are looking for restitution, and the restitution offered under the peace agreement is relatively modest: $300,000 as a one-off payment and an additional $200,000 over two years.</p>
	<p pid="a.353.0/4">People will say, &quot;Look, there is international aid, which will be coming in to support recovery, so this will not be the only money in play,&quot; but I understand from people close in on the ground that because of the suffering that is put at the doorstep of the Government, many of the Fur people feel that it is imperative that the restitution comes from that Government, as that would in a sense be an admission of the damage they have suffered and, so to speak, a down-payment on a different future. I wanted to raise that issue and to ask the Secretary of State to tell us more&mdash;if he is unable to do so now, then whenever that is appropriate&mdash;about the compensation issue and how that obstacle can be overcome.</p>
	<p pid="a.353.0/5">The peace agreement also sets up a structure for power sharing, with the rebels now to play a role in government. Sometimes such arrangements work, and sometimes they do not, but the rebels will now have the opportunity to have, in effect, a vice-president, a senior assistant to the President. However, if I understand correctly&mdash;perhaps the Secretary of State will help me if I am wrong&mdash;that is likely to be Minni Minnawi, and Mr. Minnawi is a Zaghawa. He is not Fur, and I do not know how this arrangement would be adjusted if the Fur were to come into the agreement, but we have surely largely missed the point if the largest ethnic group does not play a role in the Government structure. I have serious issues to raise about that. We know that the rebels will have guaranteed seats in the national state assemblies and will be involved in the Ministries, but how will those jobs be divided up between the many factions? Has any of that been resolved? We know from the example of Iraq that it is easier to appoint members to a Government than to turn them into a Government.</p>
	<p pid="a.353.0/6">I have also been troubled that whereas the discussions in Abuja pretty much engaged the national and regional leadership, from what I understand of Darfur and Sudan more generally, tribal leaders are key participants in what happens. Nazir Saeed Madibu heads the most significant or important tribe in Darfur and has managed to keep most of his people out of the conflict by creating pacts with neighbours and taking a different, individual stand. There are others like him and I should be interested to know how those people will be brought into the process.</p>
	<p pid="a.353.0/7">The Darfur-Darfur dialogue seems a long drawn-out, distant process, which is what troubles me. It seems critical that the individuals concerned should buy into the peace process as soon as possible, if things are to move forward. How realistic is the idea of planned elections by July 2009? Can they be delivered? How willing will the Khartoum Government be in three years' time to hold a referendum leading to an autonomous region of Darfur?</p>
	<p pid="a.353.0/8">Security is a key precondition of the peace that we hope for. The peace agreement calls for the disarmament of the Janjaweed. Most of us would probably believe that all groups should be disarmed and that a reformed Sudanese military is needed&mdash;or one whose leadership is committed to a very different role. Otherwise arms and conflict will not be taken out of the situation. How realistic is the idea of integration of the rebel forces into the Sudanese military, given the history on both sides? Once again, Iraq is an example of a place where such an issue has been discussed from day one, and has proved nearly impossible to implement.</p>
	<p pid="a.353.0/9">Any hope of security requires the transfer of peacekeeping authority from the struggling African Union, which has inadequate resources and about 7,300 troops, to a UN peacekeeping mission. What is the likelihood that the Sudanese Government will fall in line with that idea?</p>

	<p pid="a.355.3/1">Our difficulty in finding the appropriate peacekeeping force&mdash;the African Union is not in a position to provide a sufficiently robust on-the-ground presence&mdash;is an indictment of the international community. We have so often talked of Africa sorting out its own problems; here, in many ways, is an example of Africa attempting to sort out its own problems, yet we have not provided the resources, the back-up or the resilience that would have enabled the African Union troops to manage the situation without giving rise to the questions that we now face.</p>
	<p pid="a.355.3/2">I do not want to take up too much time, but let me quickly turn to two more issues, both of which have to do with aid. International donors are standing in line to offer recovery aid to Darfur. I raise a note of caution, not about the amount of recovery aid or the need for it, but about its timing. My concern springs from various conversations with non-governmental organisations in the area, who pointed out to me that sequencing matters. We must not attempt to bring in aid before there has been disarmament, before issues such as compensation are agreed on and the Fur are tied into those agreements, or before the issue of forced land ownership has been resolved. Hon. Members will know that many people have been displaced and land has been occupied, particularly in west Darfur, which has some agricultural potential. There is fear that recovery aid would lock in that occupation, rather than deal with the issue of who owns that land.</p>
	<p pid="a.355.3/3">We have not tackled the issues of tribe-on-tribe violence or most issues of extortion&mdash;&quot;self-protection payments&quot; would be the language that we would use if it was happening on our streets&mdash;and that needs to be resolved before recovery aid is moved in. The Government have not yet lifted their unofficial embargo on trade outside the main towns. I just wanted to sound a note of caution about the overall situation and get the Government's comments on that. There is real fear that if recovery aid is brought in, people who are displaced will return to their villages, although they are unsafe, and rebuild them, that new livestock will be provided and that people will then merely become a magnet for yet another attack. So I raise the issue of the preconditions, and ask the Government how they intend to approach that set of issues.</p>
	<p pid="a.355.3/4">Humanitarian aid is obviously an entirely different matter and is desperately needed. We were all shocked to find out that only 20 per cent. of the UN's appeal had been funded, and that the World Food Programme had to cut rations by 50 per cent. We understand that food stocks in the country are very low, and that the only way to get large amounts of food in now could be through airlifts, which are extremely costly.</p>
	<p pid="a.355.3/5">I have been told by people that the World Food Programme has done an excellent and very much unsung job in distributing food, despite the violence. In light of what has been happening in Darfur, the very fact that the WFP has been able to reach out to remote areas and reduce malnutrition rates is entirely to its credit. However, we are entering the hungry season, and as Members will know, that is not only when food stocks are at their lowest, but also when most energy is needed to cultivate the next harvest, which will be in September.</p>
	<p pid="a.355.3/6">Some might say that we should fill the gap with aid, but it seems to take some five months between a pledge of aid to Darfur being made and food being delivered on the ground. The World Food Programme was telling people as early as January that the crisis was coming, and it pointed to the timetable, but aid has been slow to arrive. Although I congratulate the Government on putting in another &pound;9 million, that was in May, and the question is whether we will have a far more significant crisis on our hands by the time that money is available on the ground.</p>
	<p pid="a.355.3/7">I have a couple of questions about that for the Secretary of State. First, he is one of the architects of the United Nations emergency relief fund, but where are its representatives in Darfur now? Secondly, he is one of the architects of a co-ordinated approach to aid, which, in Darfur, takes the form of the UN common humanitarian fund. Those on the ground tell me that that approach seems a positive idea, but that the bureaucratic layers that have been added to the process have delayed aid distribution to such an extent that we face a potential crisis over the next several months, until new aid, as it were, turns into food or cultivated crops provide in-country resources.</p>

	<p pid="a.357.2/1">I am delighted to follow <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1783" name="Susan Kramer">the hon. Member for Richmond Park (Susan Kramer)</phrase>. I shall come back to some of the points that she made. It was also good to hear the spokesman for <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1862" name="Andrew Mitchell">the official Opposition, the hon. Member for Sutton Coldfield (Mr. Mitchell)</phrase>, who went to Darfur and, I am sure, learned a lot.</p>
	<p pid="a.357.2/2">I also want to say how much I appreciate the efforts of my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State&mdash;I have been able to put that in print in the form of an early-day motion. He addressed the all-party group on Sudan just after he had got off the plane from the Darfur peace talks. I thought that he could not do any more, but he went off to northern Uganda and Somalia and returned to address us today. I do not know whether there is much more that one can say about his stamina, let alone his interest in these issues, with all the problems that they bring with them.</p>
	<p pid="a.357.2/3">It is easy to criticise some groups for the way in which they raise money and for some of the lobbying that they undertake. However, the all-party group on Sudan is a model for what it has tried to do in this place and beyond. I pay tribute to my predecessor, Hilton Dawson, who was a wonderful chairman and who went to Darfur with <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1463" name="John Bercow">the hon. Member for Buckingham (John Bercow)</phrase> and me. I also pay tribute to our current co-ordinator, Senait Petros, who keeps us wonderfully well informed of everything that is happening with Sudan, and to her predecessor, Sultana Begum.</p>
	<p pid="a.357.2/4">I do not want to speak for long because this will be a consensual debate, albeit we could disagree on what more could be done and what lessons could be learned. However, something that may not have come out as clearly as it should is that, although we have had to analyse and play our part in trying to resolve the recent crisis, many of the problems date back some considerable time. Anyone who has time to read the two recent books on Darfur by Flint and de Waal, who are well known commentators, and by G&eacute;rard Prunier, whom I have had the opportunity to meet&mdash;yes, I will put those books back in the Library shortly&mdash;will at least gain an understanding that these are, in some respects, age-old conflicts. I am talking about the question of who belongs to the Fur and who belongs to the Zaghawa. The Masalit is another tribe that is very dominant in Darfur.</p>
	<p pid="a.357.2/5">Sadly, tribal conflict goes back a long way. In many respects, this is where, as always, the British come in, because it was largely our decision that put Darfur in Sudan. We cannot escape that responsibility. With regard to what the hon. Member for Richmond Park said, I would not exaggerate and say that this is the first conflict for which global warming has been directly responsible, but it certainly contributed, in that the nomads have been driven south and have come into conflict with the pasturalists. In many respects, the conflict is about land&mdash;who has the land and who is keeping animals there. One should never underestimate the importance of animals. One lesson that the hon. Member for Buckingham and I learned was that, as much as seeing people starve to death is terribly difficult to come to terms with and when we see dead donkeys we think, &quot;Well, thank goodness they are not children&quot;, the Darfurians would say, &quot;But those animals are our future.&quot; If people do not have a donkey to carry firewood back to the settlement, they have no future&mdash;they will die.</p>
	<p pid="a.357.2/6">Let me explain another fact from which we can never escape. As the hon. Lady mentioned, Sudan&mdash;that huge area that we call a country&mdash;has suffered from the problem of balkanisation for a considerable time. Many of the antecedents of the conflict came from the south; in the early days, the Sudan People's Liberation Movement/Sudan People's Liberation Army had a lot of influence over the Sudan Liberation Army/Sudan Liberation Movement. Furthermore, the work of Mr. al-Turabi through the Justice and Equality Movement cannot be underestimated, given that it added to the belief of those in the Darfur area that they were getting less than those who had taken up arms in the south, and made them ask why they should not take up arms, as they could become beneficiaries by fighting in that conflict.</p>
	<p pid="a.357.2/7">The hon. Lady was right to mention east Sudan. I make no apology for asking that this time, please, the world must get ahead of the conflict, given that there is already evidence that it is happening on the ground. We have to prevent it from happening, not just pick up the pieces. It is vital that we look at what is happening in the east of the country and continue to support the comprehensive peace agreement in the south. Given that the eyes of the world have been on Darfur, the danger is that it is easy to say that that is where the aid and effort should go, but the south might begin to slip back into problems.</p>
	<p pid="a.357.2/8">We have reached a good stage. Six months ago, some of us would have despaired about whether there was ever going to be anything like a peace agreement. There will not really be peace be until we get it on the ground. However, Minni Minnawi's faction has been willing to come formally into discussions via my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State's good agencies and Robert Zoellick, through the Sudan Government. It is good that that has moved forward rather rapidly.</p>
	<p pid="a.357.2/9">However, as the hon. Lady said, there are still the other two factions&mdash;that of Abdel Wahed, and the Ibrahim faction of the Justice and Equality Movement. Both are still outside the process. One hopes that they will see the benefits that the Minni Minnawi faction gets&mdash;sooner rather than later&mdash;and that that will encourage them to lay down their arms.</p>
	<p pid="a.357.2/10">One of the challenges that has not been mentioned is who will disarm the Janjaweed. It is easy to cast aspersions. In an intervention on my right hon. Friend, I mentioned the role of Musa Hilal. In his eyes, the Janjaweed was not a tool of the Sudanese Government, although he was occasionally seen in a Government of Sudan army colonel's uniform. He lectured us at length about his justification&mdash;that his people had for years been abused and shut out from the opportunities to share in the riches of the area, let alone the wider country.</p>
	<p pid="a.357.2/11">In recent times, it has been clear that some of the things going wrong on the ground have been not about political movements, or even about people feeling that they are justified in doing the things they do because of what has happened previously, but about sheer banditry. That is the difficulty with putting a force in on the ground. We need numbers because the operation is not only for peacekeeping, but policing. People have grown used to the fact that they take what they believe to be theirs&mdash;even if it is not theirs in any way, they still take it.</p>
	<p pid="a.357.2/12">The all-party group has built a relationship with the Sudan Organisation Against Torture, in the face of the most vicious attacks by the Government of Sudan, who demand that the British Government stop funding it. We have continued to fund it. It brings to our attention some of the worst aspects of depravity, whether they be the attacks on villages or the summary justice that is issued on the back of them, where the so-called &quot;perpetrators&quot; are arrested and all sorts of things happen. One can never cease to be amazed at the irony that we must get used to when dealing with the Sudan. In terms of the Darfur-to-Darfur dialogue and civil society, some of us found it difficult that the representative who was put before us as the best person to talk on behalf of civil society when we were dealing with the south-south dialogue was Mrs. Garang. She, of course, was the wife of John Garang. Some of us found it difficult to understand that we were dealing with civil society, because her husband was leading the SPLM.</p>
	<p pid="a.357.2/13">Likewise, the previous time that we were in Darfur, we heard a wonderful lecture by the Minister for human rights&mdash;at least, he called himself that&mdash;Ali Osman Taha's brother. He said that the best thing to teach people about human rights was to indulge in Hudood&mdash;lopping people's hands and legs off&mdash;because they then understood what human rights were all about. Irony is strong in the Sudan, and it is sometimes difficult to bring ourselves back to western values and understand how we approach the problem.</p>
	<p pid="a.357.2/14">As the hon. Member for Sutton Coldfield said, there is clearly an issue about the role of international non-governmental organisations. The worst offences against them are the delaying of visas and people making it difficult for them to operate on the ground. I hope that my right hon. Friend will say something about how we will engage with the Government of Sudan in particular, this time, so that we allow those organisations to operate freely and with a degree of effectiveness that has not been possible in the past. We are all aware that we do not know what has been happening in whole areas of Darfur, because the NGOs have not been able to get into them. They have had no protection, and that is as much to do with the Sudanese Government as it is to do with the rebels' activities.</p>
	<p pid="a.357.2/15">The UN Security Council visit on <phrase class="date" code="">5 June</phrase> to <phrase class="date" code="">9 June</phrase> will presumably begin to examine how the UN can take over from the AU. I pay tribute to the AU. It can be much criticised about the things that have not gone as well as they might have done, but, as my right hon. Friend said, this is its first real test. It has performed as well as could be expected and in many respects better than that, but there is still a shortfall in manpower.</p>
	<p pid="a.357.2/16">There is also an issue about how the transference of power is to be managed: whether things go through NATO or directly to the UN. It is a bit worrying that, in a sense, as the transition occurs, people take their eyes off the ball. The last thing we want is the AU to start thinking it can withdraw troops because its job is over. In addition, those who have been funding it might think that they might as well start funding the UN or NATO as an interim agency. In reality, we must keep people doing the jobs that they are doing. We cannot allow a further vacuum to develop. That is an important consideration.</p>
	<p pid="a.357.2/17">The humanitarian situation is everything. I have talked about the human rights abuses. We sometimes grow use to them, but we must never ignore them, and they need to be highlighted. There is an idea about a donor conference; I gather it is being planned for September. It would be useful if my right hon. Friend tells us what is expected. We clearly need more money. How will that be organised? What is being sought? Are we seeking just money, money and food, or money, food and the means to be able to move to the UN mandate being properly delivered? Who else are we trying to bring on board? It would be wonderful if the Chinese could think outside their self-interested approach to the country and be brought on board as part of the resolution rather than as a large part the problem because of their specific role, as I said to the hon. Member for Sutton Coldfield.</p>

	<p pid="a.361.1/1">The hon. Gentleman is probably much more knowledgeable than I am. It is quite likely&mdash;my right hon. Friend will arbitrate between us&mdash;that the September conference has been brought forward to June, which can only be a good thing. The hon. Gentleman knows as well as I do that dates slip and move forward occasionally. The main thing is that the world is engaged and that matters are properly organised, because we have only one chance to get it right.</p>
	<p pid="a.361.1/2">On the comprehensive peace agreement, for the Darfur-to-Darfur dialogue to stand any chance, we must learn from what has been going on in the south. It is early days there, but all the evidence is that the only chance for long-term peace in Darfur is if we develop not just a political solution, but one in which civil society has a specific mandate and responsibilities. It must play its role in a way that will, over time, bring about a normalisation of events on the ground. Given the history of the area, what is normal is very difficult to understand from our western point of view, but we have to work incredibly hard to build up the things that will prove that we are making a difference to people's lives in education, health, social services and how people are catered for. That simply has never occurred, and that has been the stimulus for people taking up arms, because they think, &quot;What difference does it make? We might as well fight for what we believe we can achieve,&quot; rather than see a growing dialogue.</p>
	<p pid="a.361.1/3">I would be interested to know a bit more about how we are learning from the south-to-south dialogue, primitive as it might be, in relation to the Darfur-to-Darfur dialogue, and how genuinely civil society can grow, take its part, take responsibility and be given a real role, given that the history of Sudan tells us that the Sudanese Government will start interfering. I expect that the hon. Member for Buckingham will have something to say on that.</p>
	<p pid="a.361.1/4">I leave things on a negative note, because my speech has been largely positive. We have all learned to our cost that what the Government of Sudan say is not necessarily the whole truth or something that we can take as read. It would be good to hear that the inclusion of Ministers from the SPLM into the Government is beginning to make a difference, and that the Government, with their unified command, can be trusted to deliver the things that the world&mdash;not just the UK or EU&mdash;expects of them. We know why Sudan did not get the presidency of the AU. If the Government of Sudan want to achieve that status in the future, they must be able to deliver not only the words but the actions on the ground. That is very important, and I hope that we can trust them to do that.</p>

	<p pid="a.362.0/1">The people of Darfur have been victims of some of the most egregious human rights abuses inflicted on anyone, anywhere in the world at any time in recent memory. It is important to recognise the significance and enormity of the suffering that has taken place and not simply jump on to the next stage. Aerial bombing, mass shooting, widespread rape, destruction of crops, theft of livestock, poisoned water supplies, and human beings chained together and burned alive have all been part of the cocktail of barbarity that has scarred the conscience of the world.</p>
	<p pid="a.362.0/2">I intervened on <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1862" name="Andrew Mitchell">my hon. Friend the Member for Sutton Coldfield (Mr. Mitchell)</phrase> because some time ago I concluded that genocide versus non-genocide, which is a discussion that could take place about what has transpired in Darfur, is not a semantic debate. It is not simply a matter of the choice of terminology of one individual or another. It is a matter of real significance both because we understand that certain consequences and actions ordinarily are expected to flow from a judgment in international law that genocide has been committed, and because it is important that our moral conscience should be stirred by what has happened.</p>
	<p pid="a.362.0/3">My impression is that the events that have taken place, the calculated and remorseless evil that has been committed in Darfur, does amount to genocide. In those circumstances, and with the best will in the world and recognising the merit of constructive discourse for the purpose of future progress, I find it incredibly difficult simply to take at face value the commitments that have thus far been made. It is especially difficult when those who have entered into those commitments and to whom we were particularly looking for statements and signatures are people who have themselves conspired to commit that genocide. As the Secretary of State will understand, I refer principally to the Government of Sudan.</p>
	<p pid="a.362.0/4">There has been a good deal of consensus among right hon. and hon. Members today, and, in a sense, it is healthy. I do not seek to puncture that for the sake of doing so, and I do not dismiss its merit in total, but it is important to issue this caveat: the present period is simultaneously one of great opportunity and one of supreme danger. I say &quot;supreme danger&quot; because in practical terms we must learn from the experience of the past. We are all fond of invoking the importance of learning from past experience, of seeking to develop better practices for the future and of acknowledging the need never again to tolerate genocide and mass slaughter, but what does that mean in practice?</p>
	<p pid="a.362.0/5">Let us think of what took place in Rwanda in 1994. If we are not careful, there could be a direct parallel between the Arusha peace agreement and the present situation. In the end, the Arusha peace agreement was signed and progress towards its implementation was starting to be made, but the extremists were planning the ultimate genocide. In other words, people of thoroughly ill will were planning to use a period in which there was a semblance of good will&mdash;and, dare I say it, perhaps accidental complacency&mdash;to force through the slaughter that they had in mind. I do not want something similar to happen in Darfur. I mention this&mdash;the Secretary of State's brow is momentarily furrowed&mdash;because I am concerned about the scale of the killing that might still be taking place, and it worries me that I cannot get accurate figures.</p>

	<p pid="a.363.1/1">That is a pertinent intervention from my hon. Friend. I have been unhappy for some months about the sequence of events. It seemed intolerable that earlier this year, foot-stamping by the Sudanese Government effectively vetoed an urgently required UN troop deployment. It was put off ostensibly until September, but it might prove to be longer than that.</p>
	<p pid="a.363.1/2">I want to focus briefly on the key issues. First, in so far as the African Union mission in Sudan is concerned, will the Secretary of State at least say something more about what is envisaged? What additional help will be provided, how much is it expected to cost, and which countries are, so far, committed to providing a contribution and at what level? Is there to be simply a ratcheting-up of numbers of personnel, or a change and a strengthening of mandate in the period between now and the start of October?</p>
	<p pid="a.363.1/3">It seems in no way alarmist but merely a sober reflection of reality for the Aegis Trust, a magnificent anti-genocide organisation and sponsor of the &quot;Protect Darfur&quot; campaign, to observe that unless significant action on security is taken now, there is a danger of a void that would, in its word, be &quot;disastrous&quot;&mdash;the threat then being that Darfur would deteriorate into what the trust describes as irretrievable chaos.</p>
	<p pid="a.363.1/4">I understand that the Secretary of State is not the sole player; he cannot act alone. However, at a time when we are saying that it is good that there is a peace agreement because it is much better that there should be than there should not be, it is important that we do not neglect our constitutional responsibility to ask exactly what is going to happen, when will it happen, who will ensure that it happens and, as a result, what can we expect to be the consequences of improved security.</p>
	<p pid="a.363.1/5">If we then press the fast-forward button to the intended transfer of responsibility to the United Nations, as far as one can reasonably foresee or guarantee, will that transfer take place on <phrase class="date" code="">1 October</phrase>? If it takes place on that date, does that mean that a full deployment will begin that day and be completed shortly afterwards? Or does it mean simply that some other agreement or statement will be the recipient of signatories on <phrase class="date" code="">1 October</phrase>?</p>
	<p pid="a.363.1/6">I do not wish in any sense to trivialise what is an incredibly important debate, in respect of which I have not the slightest doubt about the sincerity, integrity and commitment of the right hon. Gentleman; but in such situations, I sometimes worry that when we are told that something is going to happen&mdash;for example, that there will be a troop deployment and that it will begin in October&mdash;it is analogous to the conversation that one might have when ordering a taxi from a hard-pressed firm. One says to the controller, &quot;When will the taxi come?&quot;, and he says, possibly after a moment's hesitation, &quot;It'll be 15 minutes, sir.&quot; And one says, &quot;Do you really mean 15 minutes, or do you mean that you would like it to be 15 minutes, but in practice, it is much more likely to be half an hour?&quot; I would rather know. I ask the Secretary of State in all sincerity, will he give us a little more information?</p>
	<p pid="a.363.1/7">I admire the right hon. Gentleman greatly, and I think that he is an extremely good Secretary of State for International Development. I also happen personally to have a very high regard for the former Foreign Secretary, the Leader of the House of Commons, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1423" name="Jack Straw">the right hon. Member for Blackburn (Mr. Straw)</phrase>. I hope therefore that it will not be taken in the wrong spirit if I say that although I greatly esteem both right hon. Gentlemen, I do not exonerate the Government entirely from responsibility for the sorry saga that has beset the people of Darfur. It is not really good enough simply to blame others. DFID has done a superb job, but I have been much less sanguine about the foreign policy response of the international community, in respect of which the Foreign and Commonwealth Office has had a part to play.</p>
	<p pid="a.363.1/8">Today is not the day to explore in detail whether sequencing took place, inadvertently or calculatedly, but we must all examine our consciences very carefully and unsparingly, with a view to trying to ensure that foreign policy responses in the future are much more robust and that they reflect the words contained in international agreements and public protocols. I think, for example, of the United Nations' responsibility to protect and the UN millennium review summit, which was referred to earlier.</p>
	<p pid="a.363.1/9">We would like to have some idea, just on the numbers, of what the Secretary of State might consider an appropriate peacekeeping force. I was honest enough to say&mdash;and if I had not been, it would probably have been readily discovered in any meaningful exchange&mdash;that I have no expertise whatever in military planning, strategy or logistics. However, it worries me greatly that we still do not seem to have much sense of what the scale of the peacekeeping commitment is intended to be.</p>
	<p pid="a.363.1/10">On the one hand, the Aegis Trust has proffered into the public domain the figure of 25,000 troops, which it judges might be required for the peacekeeping task. On the other hand, General Romeo Dallaire, who is not exactly uninformed about such matters, having had the searing experience of trying to cope in wholly inadequate circumstances in Rwanda, long ago suggested that 44,000 troops would be required. There is also the view of Major General Collins Ihikere, the AMIS force commander, who is on the record somewhere as speculating that up to 60,000 troops could be required.</p>
	<p pid="a.363.1/11">There is a huge difference between the figure of 7,000 talked about for the African Union force and the figures that I have quoted; indeed, there are even huge differences between 25,000, 44,000 and 60,000. Is the truth of the matter that the judgment will not really be made on the basis of the peacekeeping requirement, but will end up being involuntarily made on the basis of the relative parsimony of the individual contributor nations?</p>
	<p pid="a.363.1/12">If that is the reality, we ought at least to be honest with ourselves about it. If we know that far more troops are needed, but that far fewer will be provided because countries are not prepared to cough up, let us please at least abandon the truly stomach-churning hypocrisy of claiming that the international community is now seriously concerned about bringing an end to the genocide. One might conclude&mdash;it would be sad, but probably inevitable to have to do so&mdash;that the international community was not that bothered about black Africans dying in Darfur, as opposed to people dying in Yugoslavia, Kosovo or Iraq.</p>
	<p pid="a.363.1/13">Will the Secretary of State tell us something about the interesting idea of police-keeping and apply his remarks to the real crisis of insecurity and the sense of terror that had been pervasive in the camps for too long? On both <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1850" name="David Drew">my visits, with the hon. Member for Stroud (Mr. Drew)</phrase> and subsequently with members of the Select Committee, the most striking feature was the spontaneous and unprompted response from people suffering in <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1982" name="John Barrett">the camps. As the hon. Member for Edinburgh, West (John Barrett)</phrase> knows only too well, when they were asked, &quot;What's your greatest concern? What is the biggest handicap you face? What is the most striking impediment to progress in your lives?&quot;, they all said, &quot;Lack of security. We are not safe. We are terrified.&quot; If then asked the supplementary question, &quot;From what have you fled and what are you frightened of?&quot;, the answer was, almost always, the Government of Sudan and the Janjaweed and other militias.</p>
	<p pid="a.363.1/14">I would be interested to hear more about security in the camps, because there is desperate concern that they will eventually prove to be not temporary places of refuge for a suffering, impoverished and starving population, but the permanent sanctuary of people who simply dare not go anywhere else for fear that they will be killed or raped if they attempt to do so.</p>
	<p pid="a.363.1/15">My last point for the Secretary of State, which I want to float with colleagues, concerns the significance of the International Criminal Court. I can be explicit and very generous, although no more generous than I think the facts warrant. The British Government have been completely robust and sound on the importance of referrals to the International Criminal Court. My impression is that both the Foreign Office and DFID have been committed from the outset. I believe that it is in no small measure due to the efforts of the Secretary of State and the former Foreign Secretary that the United States Administration came on side. I was quite worried about that because on one hand the United States Administration had been the first to say that there was genocide in Darfur, but on the other hand we know the real reservations about and even hostility to the International Criminal Court that President Bush and his team felt and articulated. The fact that the British Government had a hand in persuading the United States Administration not to veto a referral to the ICC was a very significant development indeed.</p>
	<p pid="a.363.1/16">As the Secretary of State probably knows, I am by nature and disposition a suspicious soul and I make no apology for that. I can well understand that there might be a point&mdash;it could even be now&mdash;at which some people would be inclined to say that I should not focus too much on that matter at the moment because it is important to establish security, to tackle the humanitarian crisis and to try to make progress towards referendums and the development of life and so on, and that it would rather cloud the issue if I were to bang on too much about referrals to the ICC. My view is that it is important to establish the position and get some commitments on referrals to the ICC.</p>
	<p pid="a.363.1/17">What worries me is that in the name of securing peace and preventing a resumption of aggressive hostilities by the Government of Sudan it might be suggested, either expressly or implicitly, that it would be a good idea to go gently on referrals. It is imperative that there should be no impunity for those who are guilty of slaughter. Those individuals, wherever they come from, who are suspected of genocide, war crimes or crimes against humanity must be dragged, kicking and screaming if necessary, before the International Criminal Court. We have the advantage of precedent and the knowledge that flows from it. Yes, important work has been done in relation to war crimes in Rwanda, but it is frankly a damning indictment of the international community that the whole process from start to finish will have taken approximately 14 years.</p>
	<p pid="a.363.1/18">I shall not refer in detail to any of those circumstances because we are debating Darfur, but right hon. and hon. Members will be aware of the controversy surrounding Charles Munyaneza who is suspected of responsibility for war crimes and attempted genocide in Rwanda and is currently living in Bedford in this country. We do not want, in years to come, individuals to seek asylum in Britain when they are suspected of bestial war crimes in Darfur and when it is said to be too late to do anything. I say that, as the Secretary of State knows, with no hostility to the legitimate pursuit of asylum. He will understand that on such matters I take a liberal conservative view. I greatly value the reputation of this country as one that gives sanctuary to those fleeing prosecution, but we cannot allow our procedures to be abused by those who are seeking to flee their just deserts and the acceptance of responsibility for what they have done.</p>
	<p pid="a.363.1/19">I want it to be made clear that the people who are suspected of such crimes will be referred, that we will get regular updates and be told what is taking place and that resources will be invested. There are two reasons for that. First, it is right that those who are guilty of slaughtering other people should pay the price&mdash;I mean that in strict juridical terms. I am not arguing for revenge, or calling for the death penalty; I do not believe in state murder. But they should be forced to accept responsibility for what they have done. Secondly, it is vital that they are brought to book for the simple reason of deterrence. If ever we are to reach a situation in which we can genuinely say that it will never happen again, we must ensure that we can show that those who did it before copped it as a result.</p>
	<p pid="a.363.1/20">I have spoken with some force and passion on these matters because I have immensely strong feelings about the subject. It has been so far a worthwhile debate. I listened with the greatest interest and respect to what the Secretary of State had to say, but we must focus on the details. We have to be particular and we have a responsibility, in a sense, almost to be pedantic. Better that we be pedantic in focusing on the detail than we be guilty of the rather unedifying spectacle of telling each other how well we have done. I do not think that we have a right to do that when so many have been killed and when so much suffering continues to take place. The truth is that far too many people in Darfur have suffered too much for too long with far too little done about it. Some progress is now being made and I have every confidence that the Secretary of State will exercise his good offices. I hope that he will take the prods that I have offered this afternoon in the positive spirit for the benefit of people in Darfur in which they were intended.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-05-18a.367.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1982" speakername="John Barrett" colnum="367"  time="016:27:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060518/halltext/60518h0092.htm#060518124000293">
	<p pid="a.367.0/1">The situation in Darfur is possibly the greatest humanitarian crisis of our time. If there is one part of the world where everything that could combine to cause the maximum of human suffering and misery did so, Darfur is it. Conflict, with the Arab militias and the Janjaweed, too many guns, a corrupt Government, global warming, religious divides, refugees, famine, human rights abuse, civil war and poverty: the scale of the problem, like the scale of the country, is different from here in the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.367.0/2">The debate so far has been excellent. I particularly commend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1463" name="John Bercow">the speech by the hon. Member for Buckingham (John Bercow)</phrase>, who is always a hard act to follow, but there have been excellent speeches from members of all parties. The Chairman of the Select Committee, whose report was mentioned earlier today, would have been here were the Select Committee not visiting the Democratic Republic of the Congo.</p>
	<p pid="a.367.0/3">The numbers might be estimates, but they are all staggering, with more than 3 million people needing food aid and up to 300,000 estimated by the UN to have died in Darfur during the conflict. Millions have fled their destroyed villages with many heading for camps near the main towns or over the border into Chad. The Janjaweed patrol outside camps: Darfurians are killed and women raped if they venture too far in search of firewood or water. Some 200,000 Darfurians have sought safety in Chad, but many are camped along the border and in danger of attack. There are also those who, although they have not been displaced, have been impoverished by the collapse of the rural economy caused by the continuing violence in the countryside.</p>
	<p pid="a.367.0/4">Early in 2006, a total of 3.5 million Darfurians, more than half of the region's population, were in need of humanitarian assistance. Nowhere is Sudan's humanitarian crisis as acute as in west Darfur, and the United Nations estimates that 716,000 people have been uprooted and have taken refuge in internally displaced persons camps over the past two and a half years.</p>
	<p pid="a.367.0/5">The images from my last visit are lodged in my mind, and they will be brought back to life this summer when I hope to return. They are images of villages burned out, attacked in a co-ordinated way from the sky and the ground, and of Antonov bombers and helicopter gunships sitting side by side with the white helicopters of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1862" name="Andrew Mitchell">the AU, mentioned by the hon. Member for Sutton Coldfield (Mr. Mitchell)</phrase>. They left me and others with no doubt about what had been happening and who were involved.</p>
	<p pid="a.367.0/6">We visited camps where we met women and children and old people but relatively few men: the men were either dead, fighting or missing. We watched people walking for miles with nothing and starting again with the few basics of life&mdash;PVC sheets, food, some soap, containers for water, but not much more. We saw women taking their lives in their hands as they risked everything to obtain firewood, while in the distance they could see men waiting to rape them or possibly kill them.</p>
	<p pid="a.367.0/7">I pay tribute to the non-governmental organisations and the workers, who are doing an excellent job. Many of them are young and some are inexperienced, but they have real commitment. They are from various organisations including M&eacute;decins sans Fronti&egrave;res and Oxfam. However, I pay special tribute to Save the Children, who pulled out of Darfur following the execution of two of their staff in a roadside incident. That incident followed another two of its staff being killed by landmines.</p>
	<p pid="a.367.0/8">Even with the work that is going on in Darfur, the UN estimates that it has no access, or only limited access, to about 650,000 civilians who need assistance. Those people are living close to the edge of a cliff that has a very long drop. Relief workers are struggling to reach hundreds of thousands of civilians in dire need of food and water, shelter and protection from further attacks. Jan Egeland, the UN's emergency relief co-ordinator said recently that humanitarian access was the worst it had been since the spring of 2004, and that</p>
	<p pid="a.367.0/9" class="indent">&quot;The world's largest aid effort now hangs in the balance...If we are to avoid an imminent, massive loss of life, we need immediate action&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.367.0/10">The work being done by those agencies in villages with no water, no sanitation, no food, little healthcare and little security makes the task ahead&mdash;at least to restore security, which, as the hon. Member for Buckingham said, is the basic requirement; the rest will follow&mdash;all the more important.</p>
	<p pid="a.367.0/11">DFID's role in the reconstruction and the funding promised by others are important. I pay tribute to the Secretary of State for once again briefing Members immediately on returning from his trip. It is not the first time that he has done so. I clearly remember that after visiting the earthquake in Pakistan he flew straight back and reported to the House.</p>
	<p pid="a.367.0/12">I would like to raise a number of issues following on from that visit and the recent signing of the peace agreement. The UN force must be deployed as a united force, not as a common enemy from outside. As the Secretary of State said, there is no reason for it to be a problem. If the UN force can continue to hold the peace in the south and to bring peace in Darfur region, it will have been a great success.</p>
	<p pid="a.367.0/13">Even in areas where humanitarian agencies have had safe access to civilians, the Sudanese Government have obstructed relief activities, as we heard from <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1850" name="David Drew">the hon. Member for Stroud (Mr. Drew)</phrase>. In fact, one could go so far as to say that they had conducted a campaign of administrative harassment; the restrictions included delaying visas and travel authorisations, using laws to regulate the activities of NGOs and imposing arbitrary and onerous regulations on humanitarian agencies.</p>
	<p pid="a.367.0/14">We saw that happen also during the 21-year civil war in south Sudan; the Government regularly blocked humanitarian agencies, using tactics ranging from outright denials to flight bans and an array of other obstacles. Those delays must not be allowed to continue in Darfur. The role of the Sudanese Government was mentioned by the hon. Member for Buckingham, who is not known for mincing his words.</p>
	<p pid="a.367.0/15">The recent peace treaty almost assumes that the Sudanese Government are an innocent party, hoping to resolve the problem by incorporating the rebels into the army and the police. To a certain extent, the fact that up till now there has been co-operation between the Sudanese Government and those groups is being ignored. That point was raised by the hon. Member for Sutton Coldfield.</p>
	<p pid="a.367.0/16">We can learn from what is happening elsewhere. Following the conflict in Sierra Leone much training was given to former combatants in carpentry, mechanics and blacksmithing, but, because the economy had not taken off, there was little or no demand for those skills or the products that they produced. Blacksmithing tools are now lying stored in a warehouse. It is important that the wealth of the country is spread, or the divide will remain and the frustration will grow. The unemployed youth who previously went out to fire a gun will be even more frustrated if he is trained and then finds out that no one wants his skills. The country is rich in oil revenues, which must be spread throughout the country, so that the economy can once again come to life. There is a risk that if the economy remains poor, or remains in the hands of a few, conflict will return.</p>
	<p pid="a.367.0/17">Avoiding a return to violence after it has stopped is a challenge for all involved, and much reconstruction work is required. The basic infrastructure of roads, water supply, health facilities and education is lacking in many parts of the country. The democratic institutions need to be rebuilt and such basics as water supply will make a huge difference.</p>
	<p pid="a.367.0/18">We must take heed of what is happening in the south after the signing of the peace agreement and the civil war. The war caused the death of about 2 million people. According to humanitarian agencies the death toll was one of the highest in any war since 1945. It ended with the signing of a peace agreement, but in the fight for control of southern Sudan one in five of the southern Sudanese population was killed.</p>
	<p pid="a.367.0/19">Expectations in the south have, however, been raised, and those who have been fighting are waiting for a peace dividend. If there is no sign of that the ingredients for conflict will be present, and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1783" name="Susan Kramer">the conflict could resume. My hon. Friend the Member for Richmond Park (Susan Kramer)</phrase> mentioned compensation. The danger in compensation is that individual political groups will try to outbid each other in offering large amounts. That will raise expectations and, when those are not fulfilled, the frustration may end in violence.</p>
	<p pid="a.367.0/20">We look forward, following the signing of the peace agreement, to elections to regional government in Darfur. However, I have a word of warning: we should not expect that the advent of elections will necessarily bring immediate peace. When the Select Committee recently took evidence, a witness answered our question about what factor was most often overrated in post-conflict situations by saying that it was elections: often, there is an expectation that conflict will reduce after everyone has had their vote, when, in reality, there is usually a lull before the elections, when everyone thinks that they will get their way through the ballot box, but conflict resumes when they lose.</p>
	<p pid="a.367.0/21">I hope that those who have suffered most will have access to compensation to help them rebuild their lives. They are starting from a low level and will not need a huge amount to get them back on the bottom rung of the ladder. However, what is needed in Sudan and Darfur is good leadership and the recognition that those who led the fighting are not always the best people to lead the reconstruction. We look to Sudan and Darfur to produce politicians whom we can trust. That has not been the case so far.</p>
	<p pid="a.367.0/22">Other hon. Members have mentioned the permanence of the camps. That will be a problem. The World Food Programme has been successful in supplying food to those who are hungry. Oxfam and M&eacute;decins sans Fronti&egrave;res have been providing water, sanitation and health care facilities. People are now being urged to go back, if peace holds, to their villages, where there are few, if any, of those facilities.</p>
	<p pid="a.367.0/23">We must also keep in mind the contribution of other parts of the world to the conflict in Sudan. There are, as I said earlier, too many guns in the country. There have been concerns about the rise in imports to Sudan from Libya. Libya has had sanctions lifted and can now import weapons. Old, second-hand weapons are leaving Libya and crossing the border into Sudan. There is also concern about the supply of arms from Russia and the fact that Sudan's oil is going to China. As was mentioned earlier, it is all part of one, large problem, because the oil from Sudan is fuelling the fastest-growing economy in the world, which has one of the most rapidly growing rates of pollution. That affects global warming, which affects the very nomads and herdsmen who find that they have nowhere to feed their animals and there are conflicts over land rights.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-05-18a.371.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1669" speakername="Hilary Benn" colnum="371"  time="016:43:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060518/halltext/60518h0092.htm#060518124000296">
	<p pid="a.371.0/1">With the leave of the House, I would like to respond to this excellent debate. I say that not because there has been a cosy consensus, to address <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1463" name="John Bercow">the point made by the hon. Member for Buckingham (John Bercow)</phrase> directly, but because, in the past two-and-a-bit hours, we have laid bare the practical and moral choices and challenges that we face in trying to do something about the trauma that the people of Darfur have suffered. I shall take each speech in turn and do my best to respond to the many points raised.</p>
	<p pid="a.371.0/2">I begin by paying tribute to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1862" name="Andrew Mitchell">the hon. Member for Sutton Coldfield (Mr. Mitchell)</phrase> for the interest that he has taken, for his visit, for the pertinent questions that he asked, and for going to the heart of the moral challenge that we face. I shall try to respond to each of his questions. As far as humanitarian access is concerned, one bit of progress&mdash;they are small steps&mdash;was made earlier this year. I raised this point during my visit a couple of months ago. The Government of Sudan have been operating a fast-track process to clear humanitarian workers' visas and permits. They proposed to bring that process to an end, but others were able to persuade them to extend it to the end of the current year.</p>
	<p pid="a.371.0/3">That is one example of the constant struggle&mdash;I use the word deliberately&mdash;that we must engage in to get a lobby as each case comes up. It is a responsibility of the ambassadors and representatives in Khartoum and of each Minister to play our part. I will continue to do what I have done throughout: if people bring cases to my attention, including hon. Members taking part in this debate and others, I will take them up. Experience has taught me that that is the only way to keep up the pressure.</p>
	<p pid="a.371.0/4">During the course of my visit, one of the questions concerned AMIS's difficulty using the el-Fasher airport at night. It had been said that the problem was a lack of lighting. Because of my visit there, I was able to say to the Minister, &quot;Well, that's very curious. I've seen the lighting on the apron and the runway, and as far as I understand it, the problem is you providing someone to open up the control tower, turn on the lights and provide air traffic control after the hours of darkness so that if AMIS wishes to fly in and out, it can do its work.&quot; It was as absurd as trying to apply a curfew to AMIS in Darfur in the interests of security instead of applying it to those causing trouble.</p>
	<p pid="a.371.0/5">Have the Government of Sudan complied? Self-evidently, none of the parties has complied. That is why one of the individuals against whom sanctions have been applied is someone from the Government of Sudan military. The Select Committee report to which the hon. Gentleman referred asked the Government to get on the case and do something about it. That is why we have been working so hard to get the sanctions committee to do its work&mdash;to look at a list of names, to weigh up the evidence and, if the evidence is sufficient to justify sanctions, to get on and apply them. That is how to send a message. It is not by saying to the parties, &quot;Please do what you promised&quot;; it is by demonstrating the consequences.</p>
	<p pid="a.371.0/6">Have others in Africa helped? As well as paying tribute to President Obasanjo, I pay tribute to President Konare, as he is known, of the African Union and President Sassou-Nguesso, the chair of the African Union. They both came to the final stages of the negotiations in Abuja and lent their weight and moral authority on behalf of the nations of Africa. They put pressure on the parties, who were invited in one by one to sit at the table and be asked, &quot;Are you going to sign? What's the problem? Why won't you do it?&quot; I do not think that the one signature, that of Minni Minnawi, would have been achieved if the African Union had not demonstrated its determination to help in that practical way.</p>
	<p pid="a.371.0/7">On the African stand-by force, I can tell the hon. Gentleman that the G8 countries that committed to help with that training are well on target to meet their commitments on training requirements, and that the AU is making progress in setting up the necessary logistics to make the force work. If he is interested in more information about that, I shall be happy to provide it.</p>
	<p pid="a.371.0/8">The hon. Gentleman raised a point about the UN force, as did the hon. Member for Buckingham and others. We have heard various estimates in this debate, ranging from 12,000 to 40,000. To be honest, I have no more expertise than the hon. Member for Buckingham. That is why the UN Department of Peacekeeping Operations exists. It needs urgently to get in there and make its assessment through a UN technical assessment mission so that it can confirm what the right numbers are, what the mandate should be and how the force should be composed. UN Security Council resolution 1679, which was passed recently, was important because it called for that to be done by <phrase class="date" code="">23 May</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.371.0/9">The hon. Member for Sutton Coldfield is absolutely right to want practical steps. The first practical step to answering all the questions about how the UN force should work and be composed is getting the team in so that it can work. But in all honesty, because of the loss of time, the chances of getting a force up and running by <phrase class="date" code="">1 October</phrase> are very slim. That is the truth, because that team has not been able to get in and start the process of preparing.</p>
	<p pid="a.371.0/10">One issue that the UN force is going to face is providing water for troops. I spoke to the deputy head of the DPKO in New York a month and a half ago, and I remember that she put her hand on a map of Darfur and said, &quot;There is not a lot of water north of this line.&quot; Such practical considerations will have to be addressed if the force is to be able to do its job. I assure hon. Members that we will press for a sufficient number of troops and a strong mandate at the UN Security Council in exactly the same way as we did in the debates, about a year ago, on the size of the MONUC&mdash;Mission of the United Nations in the Democratic Republic of the Congo&mdash;force in the DRC. Some people did not want an increase in those forces at all, and some wanted a lot. Britain pressed very hard for an increase.</p>
	<p pid="a.371.0/11">NATO has already been providing logistical support, including heavy lift, to get the AU troops in and out of Darfur as their terms have rotated. All of us in the international community, including NATO, need to consider what further practical support to the AU mission is required. Another practical thing that Britain has done is to provide vehicles, because AMIS said that, &quot;If we don't have vehicles, we can't get out and do our job.&quot; That is why we have taken responsibility for one of the fuel contracts, so that there is enough fuel to put in the vehicles and helicopters for AMIS to do its work. I have to tell hon. Members that about 90 per cent. of helicopter hours currently available to AMIS are spent resupplying its own troops. Its representatives need more capacity to spend a greater proportion of their time going out and about and doing their jobs.</p>
	<p pid="a.371.0/12"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1783" name="Susan Kramer">The hon. Member for Richmond Park (Susan Kramer)</phrase> made an extremely well-informed speech. She is absolutely right to say that this is a tense and fragile moment. I very much welcome what she said about the African Union. She reminded us about the tribal make-up of the conflict when she talked about the Fur. That is important, because it is one of the layers of complexity in Darfur. It is not a reason for not trying to do something, but it is important that we understand what we are dealing with.</p>
	<p pid="a.371.0/13">I want to address the hon. Lady's point about compensation directly, because I feel strongly about this. I spent a lot of time in Abuja trying to point out to Abdel Wahed and his people what is in the agreement. I entirely accept her point about the importance of compensation psychologically and politically. It is part of the culture: you kill my family, you take my goods. Compensation is one of the ways in which the people make amends. We may find it hard to understand that the loss of life can be expunged by the payment of money, but that is part of the culture in Darfur.</p>
	<p pid="a.371.0/14">As for any help that anyone else can give to try to get the point across, it is all in the Darfur peace agreement, which provides for the setting up of a compensation commission, which would have wide powers on the form and nature of compensation, including that for loss of life and loss of land. You name it, it is there. The draft that the AU tabled said that the Government of Sudan would make a contribution to the compensation fund, but no sum was mentioned. So the second thing that we did in Abuja was to ask the Government of Sudan what they were going to do. They said, &quot;We will make an immediate initial contribution of $30 million.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.371.0/15">There is also provision in the Darfur peace agreement for a reconstruction and redevelopment fund. The Government of Sudan have committed to put into that fund $300 million this year and $200 million next year and the year after, making a total of $700 million. Perhaps I should not say this, but I will: if we want to be creative once we have signed an agreement and are getting on with implementing it, it is perfectly possible to say, &quot;As an aid to reconstruction and redevelopment, people will need to resettle themselves in the places that they have been burnt out of.&quot; There is a big pot of money that could also be used to make payments in recompense for loss of livelihood, animals and household utensils if one cared to look at what has actually been negotiated by the rebel movements and had the confidence to say, &quot;Look, you wanted compensation: look what we brought back.&quot; I say this with force and passion, because I learned something most forcefully during those peace negotiations, which was my first opportunity to participate in such negotiations. I learned that the texts and demands are important, but there comes a moment when we have to decide whether to make the psychological step from being a victim and a demander, a fighter and an outsider, to saying, &quot;I am now going to take that step for peace and be part of trying to implement a solution to the crisis&quot;. I could see Minni Minnawi doing that, and through the medium of this debate&mdash;though I do not know whether he will read it&mdash;I would plead with Abdel Wahed to do the same.</p>
