	<p pid="b.75.2/1">I am grateful to have the opportunity to raise this extremely important matter. It arises from significant changes that have been made to the level of competence and the experience required to obtain a boatmaster's licence in order to operate on British waters. Those changes, effective from <phrase class="date" code="2007-01-01">1 January</phrase>, will mean an inevitable lowering of safety standards. That will have a particular impact on the tidal Thames, where conditions and the potential for accidents are almost unique.</p>
	<p pid="b.75.2/2">The purpose of the debate is to make the strongest possible case for special status for the tidal Thames requiring a licence that maintains our traditional high standards. However, those standards were swept away&mdash;I hope that the House will forgive the nautical term&mdash;on <phrase class="date" code="2007-01-01">1 January</phrase> at the behest of the European Council.</p>
	<p pid="b.75.2/3">I shall describe the changes that have been imposed on us. To comply with European Council Directive 96/50/EC, the boatmasters directive, the Maritime and Coastguard Agency has introduced a new licence for passenger and non-passenger craft of more than 24 m on all inland waterways, and it allows European boatmasters to operate in British waters.</p>
	<p pid="b.75.2/4">Until <phrase class="date" code="2007-01-01">1 January</phrase>, a licence granted by the Worshipful Company of Watermen and Lightermen and the Port of London Authority demanded five years' experience on the Thames and four exams&mdash;practical, oral and written. To qualify, applicants had to be certified by five separate masters as being able to manage their craft. The old licence therefore created a maritime elite, reflecting the ability to handle craft of different types, speeds and sizes over a wide range of tidal, visibility and weather conditions&mdash;and with detailed local knowledge.</p>
	<p pid="b.75.2/5">That licence is now defunct. However, the new licence has not yet been issued. All a that waterman can produce at the moment is proof of posting of his application for the new boatmaster's licence&mdash;a Post Office receipt. Therefore, the Post Office is currently&mdash;I hope that hon. Members will forgive me another pun&mdash;in charge of administering Thames licences.</p>
	<p pid="b.75.2/6">The new licence demands only two years' experience and one practical examination. That demonstrates the ability to manage one craft on one occasion under one set of river conditions. The National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers and Transport and General Workers Union are right to be concerned that those requirements are not sufficient to qualify a master to navigate safely on the tidal Thames.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-01-10b.77.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1891" speakername="Angela Watkinson" colnum="77"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070110/halltext/70110h0001.htm#07011055000544">
	<p pid="b.77.2/1">I thank the hon. Gentleman for that intervention. We seem to be quite consensual thus far in our common desire for the highest possible safety standards on the Thames and the highest degree of professionalism that can be achieved.</p>
	<p pid="b.77.2/2">Traffic on the river has increased significantly since 1989, and it is likely to increase even more with construction traffic in the preparations for the 2012 Olympics and the tourist traffic during the games, when large numbers of visitors will be in the capital. Local knowledge is essential to ensure the safe use of the entire length of the tidal Thames from Teddington to Lower Hope point, and not only the Woolwich to Putney part of the most dangerous stretch, to which the new examination applies.</p>
	<p pid="b.77.2/3">The Port of London Authority's application for local knowledge area for the entire length of the Thames was made as recently as October 2005, but it now supports the shorter section. What has brought about that change of mind? The area above Putney is characterised by restricted tidal navigation where the river is shallower and narrower. That area is often congested by vulnerable leisure users with no professional training, and it is also used by passenger boats at least as far as Hampton Court&mdash;some even go as far as Henley and Oxford on the upper Thames. The area below Woolwich is where approximately 90 per cent. of the 50 million tonnes of the port of London's annual cargo is handled. Add to that the sailing clubs and private motor yachts that use the estuary to cross the channel and, considering the estuary's sandbanks and the sunken wreck of the Montgomery, the potential for an accident is enormous.</p>
	<p pid="b.77.2/4">The new boatmaster's licence will enable captains to qualify for an even more limited zone in the local knowledge area. Passenger-carrying vessels may, for example, be restricted to the stretch between Westminster and Tower piers, but if another accident or emergency that required evacuation similar to that of July 7 2005 occurred outside that restricted zone, such vessels would not be able to respond. On July 7 2005, approximately 100,000 people were evacuated from central London and Canary Wharf by river in a well organised operation that involved several passenger-vessel operators.</p>
	<p pid="b.77.2/5">The Maritime and Coastguard Agency and the Port of London Authority are apparently confident that safety standards will not be undermined by the new boatmaster's licence on the grounds that the shorter qualifying times will be more intensive. I am at a loss to understand how the daily activities of each candidate could be monitored in such detail. The suggestion that much of the former five-year qualification period was spent sweeping the decks simply cannot be substantiated.</p>
	<p pid="b.77.2/6">Shore-based training has been reduced from a mandatory 10 weeks, plus other optional courses and two examinations for underpinning knowledge, to one week of safety training and only one examination for underpinning knowledge&mdash;a reduction of 90 per cent. Qualifying service has been reduced from five years to 30 months, which is a reduction of 50 per cent, while the number of days that candidates are required to work has been reduced from 750 to 360&mdash;a reduction of 55 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="b.77.2/7">The number of days per year required for the revalidation service has been reduced from 50 to 24, which is a reduction of 52 per cent, and the number of examinations to be taken is down from four to one or two&mdash;a 50 or 75 per cent. reduction. The minimum level of local experience is down from two years to six months&mdash;a reduction of 75 per cent.&mdash;and examiners will not, in future, necessarily be locally experienced watermen. What consistency in the standard of examiners can be demonstrated to ensure consistency of qualifying performance in applicants? Can all examiners match the knowledge of a waterman?</p>
	<p pid="b.77.2/8">Practitioner testimonies are down from six to one, which is an 83 per cent. reduction. In September 2002, the Baxter-Eadie study of the competencies and skills required by operators on the River Thames identified that about 500 skills are required. It would be impractical, if not impossible, to test all those skills in one practical test. Competence could only be guaranteed in the conditions prevailing on that day. A test taken on a nice sunny day in June under calm conditions would not qualify someone to work at night, in a storm, in fog or any other of the multitude of conditions that prevail on skippers who regularly use the river.</p>
	<p pid="b.77.2/9">Practical examination has been a welcome addition for a large passenger vessel endorsement to the waterman's licence. It was introduced without a reduction in the length of qualifying service and is currently held by approximately 50 per cent. of watermen. Continuous assessment is a reliable and proven means of assuring extensive practical competence. The testimonial system is one form of continuous assessment, but signatories should be made more accountable to achieve transparency, and the addition of practical testing should not come at the expense of reductions in other elements of the qualifying process. The candidate logbook does not offer true assessment, as it testifies only to a candidate having assisted in tasks. The fact that the merchant navy model has discounted the use of practical testing stresses that that form of assessment can prove unworkable.</p>
	<p pid="b.77.2/10">An additional requirement has been introduced for all licence holders to hold valid certificates in firefighting, first aid, personal survival and, in the case of passenger vessels, passenger management. That is very welcome, and I am rather surprised that it was not put in place after the 1989 accident.</p>
	<p pid="b.77.2/11">The generic licence, plus the passenger operations endorsement, is very similar to the provisional waterman's licence followed by the full waterman's licence. There is no difference in the application of the qualification, as both licence holders will need to be qualified to command a passenger carrying vessel. However, the new modular route to qualifying can now be completed in half the time that was previously required.</p>
	<p pid="b.77.2/12">Currently, other freight and towing operations are covered by the PLA craft registration policy and management guidelines on competencies&mdash;byelaw 12 of January 2002. The recommended qualifying service defined in those guidelines for towing vessels is nine years, now reduced to 30 months, and the guideline levels of experience for motor barge skippers is five years, now also reduced to 30 months.</p>
	<p pid="b.77.2/13">The new legislation covers all passenger operations including ferries, but its application to other freight vessels is limited to those over 24 m. That will leave many vessels, including craft-towing tugs and workboats, unregulated within the boatmaster's licence regulations. That issue exposes grey areas that require urgent clarification. The use of a tier 2 boatmaster's licence on the tidal Thames in London for passenger operations has not been ruled out by the Maritime and Coastguard Agency, yet only the tier 1 boatmaster's licence offers the standard outlined in the quantitative summary comparison.</p>
	<p pid="b.77.2/14">The boatmaster's licence established in 1993 ensured that local knowledge assessment was guaranteed for all category A, B, C and D inland waters. That requirement has been removed and therefore standards have been lowered, except for those with local knowledge assessment.</p>
	<p pid="b.77.2/15">It is madness to lower our standards in this way to accommodate visiting European craft. They are very welcome to visit&mdash;indeed, they are encouraged to do so&mdash;but they must use standards born of the experience of professional users of the Thames. How could an employer ensure that an applicant is fully competent on a different vessel from the one used for the one single practical examination? Under the old waterman's licence an employer was guaranteed that the applicant had appropriate experience in vessels of a variety of characteristics and propulsion systems, gained during five years of training.</p>
	<p pid="b.77.2/16">The new licence has been designed as a national system. The density of traffic and variety of craft on the tidal Thames, with its tides, currents and bridges, are incomparable with other waterways and make it deserving of special status. There may well may be other UK waters for which the new generic licence is not appropriate.</p>
	<p pid="b.77.2/17">Old London bridge supported bustling houses and businesses and had so many columns, or starlings&mdash;14 from memory&mdash;that the flow of water was slowed down to such an extent that the Thames would freeze in sustained periods of cold weather. Hence, there were frost fairs when oxen were roasted on the ice. Watermen in those days, who were also the taxi drivers of their time, had no option but to raise their oars and pray as they went through the narrow arches under the bridge. It was so dangerous that, in the 16th century when King Henry VIII was rowed down from Hampton Court, he would not risk going through by boat. He was set down at the steps before the bridge and rejoined the boat after it had safely emerged downwater. Those currents still prevail, as was demonstrated to me yesterday, when I was on the river and saw tugs towing heavily laden barges. The boatmasters knew exactly which course to steer to navigate the bridges safely and each bridge has its own characteristics.</p>
	<p pid="b.77.2/18">I am unclear whether the MCA and the PLA is the final authority on the tidal Thames and whether it is possible under the law to obtain an opt-out from the new boatmaster's licence and reinstate the former qualifying standards.</p>

	<p pid="b.83.0/1">I am glad to be able to make some brief comments, because I appreciate that other hon. Members want to contribute to this important debate. I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1891" name="Angela Watkinson">my hon. Friend the Member for Upminster (Angela Watkinson)</phrase> on her excellent speech, which brought all the issues out into the open.</p>
	<p pid="b.83.0/2">I obviously represent a central London seat, which is at the heart of the Thames and the City. Tragically, it was in my constituency that the horrendous events involving the Bowbelle and Marchioness took place 18 years ago. All London Members on both sides of the House have a great passion for our city, and the Thames is at the heart of the city. That is particularly true of hon. Members in the centre, although the same applies, of c<phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1783" name="Susan Kramer">ourse, to the hon. Member for Richmond Park (Susan Kramer)</phrase>, whose constituency is not quite in the centre, but which is, none the less, a Thameside constituency.</p>
	<p pid="b.83.0/3">We recognise the importance of the Thames, which has been at the heart of London's economic and recreational growth. As <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1528" name="Howard Stoate">the hon. Member for Dartford (Dr. Stoate)</phrase> rightly said, however, it has also become increasingly busy in recent years. Five million passengers and 50 million tonnes of goods are carried on the Thames every year. The hon. Gentleman also referred to the Rhine, and I hope that the Minister will give clear consideration to that issue. The same point also applies to the Danube, which is an important part of Romania, one of the new EU nations. Special rules apply on those two rivers, so it would seem sensible that such rules should also apply on the Thames.</p>
	<p pid="b.83.0/4">There has been a long struggle over this issue. In considering the 10-year struggle of those who lost loved ones and near ones on the Marchioness, we recognise our impotence and powerlessness as Members of Parliament. At times, those people must have thought that they were having to break down the walls of bureaucracy&mdash;to some extent, that is one thing that I hope all of us, as Members of Parliament, can do on behalf of our constituents&mdash;to bring in new rules and regulations.</p>
	<p pid="b.83.0/5">All Opposition Members look with a certain scepticism at any new regulations, and there is always a sense in which business should not be over-regulated. Above all, however, there is an issue of public safety. Of course, we do not want such stringent rules on any of our rivers&mdash;or, indeed, on any form of transport&mdash;that it is impossible for people to go about their everyday business. Inevitably, any form of transport will always involve an element of risk, and the idea that we can entirely eliminate risk is unrealistic. Equally, however, we need to ensure that, as far as possible, we strike the right balance between ensuring that the Thames is a great place for pleasure and commerce and a safe place.</p>
	<p pid="b.83.0/6">I therefore entirely endorse the views of my hon. Friend the Member for Upminster. She was right to say that we need to consider the Thames alongside the Rhine and the Danube, and I hope that the Government will make strong representations on the issue in Europe. We do not expect special treatment, and it is quite sensible to apply the proposed rules to many of our other rivers, but the Thames will be increasingly important.</p>
	<p pid="b.83.0/7">Another important issue will be some of the river's tributaries, most importantly those around the Lea valley. I spent last Sunday walking around the Olympic site, although, rather depressingly, little work seems to have been done in the 17 or so months since we won the Olympic bid. However, significant work has been done on the towpaths in the upper Lea valley to make them safe and to ensure that the site is attractive for the many millions of people who will visit the Olympics, as well as for those who will live and work in the area in the years ahead, when the site ceases to be an amalgam of former industrial sites. That shows the important role that water will play for London's economic growth in the future, and we need to have an eye to the safety aspects.</p>
	<p pid="b.83.0/8">I have just one other comment at this juncture. It has been suggested that the watermen and lightermen's company is some sort of trade union that is looking after its own interests. It is probably fair to say that that was its underlying raison d'&ecirc;tre when it started up in the 16th century. However, it now plays an important part not only in London's history, but in ensuring that the Thames is safe and that those working on it can go about their business. I praise the watermen and lightermen's livery company for playing an important social role, as do many of our livery companies in London. Indeed, if one walks down Penge high street, one will see almshouses going back to the 17th century, which were run by the watermen and ligthermen's company. The company is now working with the London borough of Bromley to ensure that many dozens of people can live happy lives in one of our London suburbs.</p>
	<p pid="b.83.0/9">When it began its life, the watermen and lightermen's company, like many livery companies, may have focused on acting as a guild for its members, but it now plays a much more important social role. Part and parcel of that role are the representations that the company has made to Members of Parliament in London and beyond, and I hope that the Government will give clear consideration to what it has to say. It is the expert in this field, and I sincerely hope that the recommendations of my hon. Friend the Member for Upminster will see the light of day in the Minister's comments and, more importantly, in what is done in the months and years ahead.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-01-10b.85.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1624" speakername="John McDonnell" colnum="85"  time="010:06:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070110/halltext/70110h0002.htm#07011055000551">
	<p pid="b.85.0/1">I speak as chair of the National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers parliamentary group, and I refer hon. Members to my entry in the Register of Members' Interests in that regard. I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1891" name="Angela Watkinson">the hon. Member for Upminster (Angela Watkinson)</phrase> on securing the debate. She set out our views in a detailed way. As interventions have shown, there is consensus across the Chamber, and I think that that will remain the case.</p>
	<p pid="b.85.0/2">It is important for the RMT that we place on record its concerns expressed over the past 18 months as part of the consultation. When a Government intervene on safety regulations, the most important thing is that people have confidence in that intervention and that the Government take everybody with them. My concern about the process so far is that despite the long consultation period, the Government do not seem to have listened to the representations made by various parties on a number of issues, and it is important that the Minister listens this morning.</p>
	<p pid="b.85.0/3">I share the anxieties expressed about statements made to the <i>Evening Standard </i>yesterday, and I would welcome the Minister clarifying the position and amending some of them. The primary objective of everybody who has been engaged in the consultation process and other discussions has been to improve and maintain safety on the Thames. There have been no attempts to protect individual interests, and the issue for those involved has been the interests of the people who work and sail on the river, as well as those of passengers. It is unacceptable to describe those who take that attitude as being part of a cosy club, and I hope that the Minister will resile from that view.</p>
	<p pid="b.85.0/4">The debate is not simply about European standards either. During the consultation process, we accepted, as I think the Government did, that EU standards could apply but that we should have the right to apply higher standards in this country if we specific issues have to be addressed. One thing that has come out of all the debates and consultations is that we are dealing with a river that has complications in its navigational system. That requires higher standards, and that is what we should aim for. Indeed, all the inquiries into the various disasters on the Thames have increased standards at each stage, and the one thing that we do not want to do is to step back from those.</p>
	<p pid="b.85.0/5">On that basis, I urge the Government, even at this late stage, to start listening to those on the front line who deliver the service&mdash;the professionals who have operated the service over the years on such a difficult stretch of the river. The RMT's concerns replicate those set out by the hon. Lady. The union is anxious about the significant cut in mandatory college-based training. That training was one of the key elements that the professionals whom we brought to discuss the issue with the Minister said should be maintained. As the hon. Lady said, apart from the weak safety training, it looks as though there will be a cut of up to 90 per cent. The replacement of four examinations with one is not acceptable to the union as it does not encompass the full range of testing that is required. Many professionals view the 75 per cent. reduction as a retrograde step.</p>
	<p pid="b.85.0/6">The reduction of time in which to gain local knowledge is baffling to most people who operate on the Thames. The change is based on a limited risk assessment undertaken by the PLA which was contested by many parties involved in subsequent discussions. The Minister should re-examine that urgent matter. Having only six months instead of two years in which to gain local knowledge represents a 75 per cent. reduction, and people do not understand why we are stepping back from the very issue that has been highlighted in report after report: the need for detailed local knowledge of the Thames. This is not an attempt to exclude Europeans who want to sail or undertake work on the Thames, but a recognition of the difficulties with this piece of water. The change from five years to two regarding qualifying services does not replicate what is happening elsewhere in Europe, and significantly reduces the potential for people to become used to the river and to become professionals.</p>
	<p pid="b.85.0/7">Will the Minister clarify the situation as regards to being in command of a vessel on the Thames? The current PLA Watermen and Lightermen Byelaws 1992, as amended, provide that a passenger vessel on the Thames must not only be under the command of a licensed waterman but be navigated by a fully qualified licensed waterman. Under the new proposals, inland waterways vessels carrying cargo or passengers will be under the command of a licensed boat master, but any person whom the boat master believes is competent to do so will be allowed to navigate the vessel. If that is the case, it is a significant worry for many who work on the Thames because it means that a passenger vessel may be navigated by someone who is not fully qualified or who does not fulfil the age or medical conditions, such as those on eyesight and colour blindness.</p>
	<p pid="b.85.0/8">People were explicit in the consultation. Following a detailed consultation with its members who work on the river, the National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers concluded that the new system will have potentially disastrous consequences for tidal river safety. The RMT and others have discussed the matter with people who tragically experienced what happened with the Marchioness and the Bowbelle.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-01-10b.87.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1831" speakername="Simon Hughes" colnum="87"  time="010:15:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070110/halltext/70110h0003.htm#07011055000554">
	<p pid="b.87.2/1">First, I pay tribute to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1891" name="Angela Watkinson">the hon. Member for Upminster (Angela Watkinson)</phrase>. She excellently set out the practical reasons why, at this last stage of the proceedings, this debate has commanded so much support from parliamentarians across the House who know about these issues because they have been involved with the Thames and the people who work on it. We represent those people and are therefore telling the Minister that we want him not only to hear what we are saying, but to implement the request that comes both from this debate and the prayer in the Order Paper that the regulations dated <phrase class="date" code="">4 December</phrase> and laid before the House on <phrase class="date" code="">7 December</phrase>, for which the statutory period in which the House can make a decision has not yet ended, should be annulled.</p>
	<p pid="b.87.2/2">We are in the ridiculous legal position, which you will know well, Mr. O'Hara, that the Government can lay a statutory instrument that can come into force before the end of the time in which the Houses of Parliament can decide whether they agree with it. Although the new regulations technically came into force on <phrase class="date" code="2007-01-01">1 January</phrase>, at this moment the House can say no to them. We ask the Minister to tell the business managers that we want a debate on the regulations in Government time at the earliest opportunity. At that stage, we would like the Government to say that they will take back the proposal and listen to the advice that they have heard from hon. Members on both sides of the House. If he is not persuaded by the advice and views that he has heard today, I assure him that there is plenty of supporting evidence and advice available elsewhere.</p>
	<p pid="b.87.2/3">My constituency name reflects that it is a riverside constituency. The Southwark borough has sent MPs here since the 13th century to represent the riverside community. Bermondsey has sent MPs here for over 100 years to represent an archetypal riverside community&mdash;the docks community&mdash;and it was hugely populated by people with a docks and Transport and General Workers Union background. When I was first selected, I came to this House from my constituency by boat to represent that importance.</p>
	<p pid="b.87.2/4">This is not about self-interest and protection but a matter of public interest and the safety of the people who use the Thames. I was the MP for North Southwark and Bermondsey on <phrase class="date" code="1989-08-20">20 August 1989</phrase> when the Marchioness sank at 2 am. I received a call about three quarters of an hour later and I was on the riverside that night. I worked with colleagues such as the former Member for Newham, South, and Lord Brooke, who was then the Member for Cities of London and Westminster and with families and survivors, including the Dallaglio and Perks families, for 10 years. Eventually, the Deputy Prime Minister, to his great credit, agreed that there should be a public inquiry. That is one thing for which I shall always be grateful to him because it was his decision and the public inquiry was held.</p>
	<p pid="b.87.2/5">At the inquiry, which I attended, Lord Justice Clarke was very clear. He made 74 recommendations in his two reports. There were two follow-up reports in November 2001 and February 2003. The reports made absolutely clear the danger of the Thames. I have been on the Thames often enough in good weather and bad. I have been on the tidal and non-tidal Thames and I have even fallen in it once&mdash;actually, I was thrown in, but that is another story&mdash;so I know from my good and bad experiences that it is a dangerous river.</p>
	<p pid="b.87.2/6">We are trying to bring tourism to this capital city. If we think that it is in Britain's interest in the run-up to the Olympic games to risk a reduction in safety in the Thames, we are sadly misguided. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1897" name="Kate Hoey">My friend, the hon. Member for Vauxhall (Kate Hoey)</phrase>, and I are trustees of the Mayor of London's Thames Festival Trust&mdash;I am the chair. Over 10 years, the festival has brought hundreds of thousands of people to celebrate the river. It is partly a celebration of the fact that the river is now a much safer place for people to use for travel. What do we want of the river? We want it to be an even safer place. We want it to have more business, not less. We want more freight on it, not less. We want it to be more busy, not less busy.</p>
	<p pid="b.87.2/7">So, what should we do? We should listen to the expertise of people who know what they are talking about. The problem in this debate is that the Company of Watermen and Lightermen is a name that sounds medieval, so people think that its views must be medieval. That medieval background comes from the fact that it has hundreds of years of experience. I shall cite one example of that from a letter that I received on this subject from a licensed waterman and lighterman, who lives in Deptford but was born in Rotherhithe, in my constituency. It stated:</p>
	<p pid="b.87.2/8" class="indent">&quot;I have had the pleasure of conveying you on the vessel I was captain of at the time, the Mayflower Garden. Like all watermen we have all had a legal apprenticeship...I am from a Rotherhithe family and have worked the River for 61 years...My grandfather was drowned at work and I have lost three of my personal friends through drowning at work. I am therefore not unfamiliar with the danger&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.87.2/9">of the Thames.</p>
	<p pid="b.87.2/10">This is the sort of experience that we are talking about.</p>
	<p pid="b.87.2/11">This is not a closed shop, because there are about 600 licensed watermen and lightermen, and about 60 new people join every year. That is the rate of application from young people and there is no barrier to people coming&mdash;people who were born in Orkney, Shetland, Scilly or abroad can join. I was at a local fire station the other day, and I know that firefighters who were born in America work in the London fire service. There is no barrier or discrimination on this matter, but there is one requirement&mdash;that people are well prepared and are willing to come to do the particular apprenticeship that is required to ensure that they do the job properly.</p>
	<p pid="b.87.2/12">The directive was published in 2006. I have read the good briefing notes and the explanatory memorandum on the regulations being proposed and the directive. They make it clear that the UK can derogate, as the Minister knows. The explanatory memorandum states:</p>
	<p pid="b.87.2/13" class="indent">&quot;The Department has taken advantage of the derogation in article 3(2) of the Directive, which permits Member States to exempt boatmasters from the requirement to hold an EU-model boatmaster's certificate where they operate exclusively on waterways not linked to a waterway of another Member State.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.87.2/14">That situation applies, and therefore the Government have said, &quot;Yes, we will do our own thing.&quot; Having decided that we will do our own thing, it is clear to me that we are allowed to decide in law that we can have a particular regime for a particular place. In a way, this is not the same as the situation in respect of the Rhine, because that river crosses different countries, whereas the Thames runs through just one country. Therefore, we are allowed to have a requirement.</p>
	<p pid="b.87.2/15">All the notes make it clear that the Government can impose higher standards than the minimum standards required under the EU legislation. I understand the case for EU legislation, and I do not oppose such legislation, but we are required to say that there is a particular reason involved here. People can apply from anywhere in the world to get the standard, but they must have the required training and qualification.</p>
	<p pid="b.87.2/16">In July, some of us took a petition to Downing street with watermen and lightermen. We talked to both them and the unions before, during and after that event, up to today. Thus we are clear that this matter is about ensuring that, if it is humanly possible, there is never another terrible tragedy like the sinking of the Marchioness. They want there to be jobs for people of this great city on the river, as that is a valid concern, but their first concern is that the experience of centuries should not be lost.</p>
	<p pid="b.87.2/17">I ask the Minister respectfully and sincerely to say that it would be the greatest foolishness to go down the road that the Government propose. They might have all the professional advice from the Maritime and Coastguard Agency that they need, but if they do not listen to the experience of the people who work the river and their representatives, they are taking incomplete and insufficient advice.</p>
	<p pid="b.87.2/18">There is a chance to change this proposal. I hope that in the next few days we shall have the opportunity to debate it and that the Government will announce that they will re-examine it. I hope that they will come up with the requirement to sustain the higher level of qualification for work on the Thames than is required elsewhere. It needs to be higher because this is the most dangerous river in this country and there is a requirement to ensure that people who travel on it are safe.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-01-10b.93.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1479" speakername="Julian Brazier" colnum="93"  time="010:34:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070110/halltext/70110h0003.htm#07011055000561">
	<p pid="b.93.3/1">I am so sorry. I had a slip of the tongue. What I meant from down here in Westminster Hall was on the Floor of the House. I thank the hon. Gentleman for correcting me.</p>
	<p pid="b.93.3/2">The River Thames is unique in Europe with 50 million tonnes of goods and 5 million passengers carried each year. It has waters that rise and fall by as much as 25 ft twice a day. Boatmen must navigate 27 bridges and negotiate the waters with as many as 12,000 vessel movements a month. It is little wonder that from time to time things go wrong. The consequences can be massive, final and tragic.</p>
	<p pid="b.93.3/3">A great deal has rightly been said about the tragedy of the Marchioness. When 52 innocent people were killed in the London underground the year before last, the Government promised measures to help to prevent a repeat of the tragedy. We have had new legislation, and billions of pounds have been committed to try to prevent another such outrage. Yet in 1989, 51 people&mdash;only one fewer&mdash;died needlessly and nastily in the waters of the Thames. The inquiry called it a</p>
	<p pid="b.93.3/4" class="indent">&quot;catastrophe which should never have happened&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.93.3/5">There were many causes of that terrible waste of life and Lord Justice Clarke's investigation was detailed. He made 44 recommendations, which were formally accepted by the Deputy Prime Minister in 2000. In his report, Lord Justice Clarke praised the watermen and lightermen licence for requiring</p>
	<p pid="b.93.3/6" class="indent">&quot;a two-year apprenticeship followed by three years as a professional waterman&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.93.3/7">before anyone can captain a passenger vessel on the Thames. Evidently, he did not regard that as a cosy closed shop.</p>
	<p pid="b.93.3/8">I shall summarise a few of the differences between the old watermen and lightermen licence and the new boatmaster's licence. To master a boat requires only 30 months' qualifying service, not the five years formerly demanded. When one considers that the minimum age demanded has fallen from 21 to 18, there will be boatmasters with much less experience of both the river and life trying to negotiate one of the world's busiest rivers. It is a lethal cocktail of goods, passengers, youth and inexperience. It is a recipe for carnage, especially in the run-up to the Olympics, as another hon. Member pointed out. One week of safety training will replace the mandatory 10 weeks; one shore-based examination will replace the two of old; 750 days on the river will be scaled down to 360; four exams will be cut to one or two; and the number of current practitioners vouching for the applicant will be reduced from six to one. The most dangerous aspect of the new regime is the amount of local knowledge demanded. A captain will need only six months' experience of the river, where before a minimum of two years' local knowledge was expected.</p>
	<p pid="b.93.3/9">I, too, was on the Thames yesterday, and I endorse everything that colleagues who were there have said. The most striking factor was the emptiness of the water compared with the water in the height of summer, when I was also privileged to be there. It suddenly struck me: if somebody had been taking a test yesterday, would that really have shown whether they were ready to take it during peak conditions in July, when there are perhaps three or four times as many vessels on the water in the busiest areas? The section of the Thames to which the provisions apply simply stops at the Thames barrier; there is no local knowledge requirement beyond that. Is it right that somebody who has never worked in tidal waters should be able to take charge of a vessel after just six months and one test? Surely, it is not, and like others, I urge the Minister to reconsider the legislation.</p>
	<p pid="b.93.3/10">I welcome some aspects of the new scheme, some of which have already been mentioned. The need for certificates in fire control, passenger management, first aid and personal survival is a good advance, although all new applicants must pass those four tests anyway. Like my hon. Friend the Member for Upminster, I welcome the fact that for the first time, tugmasters and captains of freight vessels will have statutory licences, although, as she pointed out, the proposals are incomplete.</p>
	<p pid="b.93.3/11">I urge the Minister to reconsider the workings of the scheme. A unique alliance has been formed against the new licence. The National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers and other unions have united, as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1624" name="John McDonnell">the hon. Member for Hayes and Harlington (John McDonnell)</phrase> pointed out, with one of the City's oldest livery companies, the Worshipful Company of Watermen and Lightermen, which is a great institution that proved its worth yet again through its reaction to the bombings on <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-07">7 July 2005</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.93.3/12">I must also congratulate one of the company's members, Alex Hickman, who has done a wonderful job leading the campaign with Margaret Lockwood Croft to bring to Parliament and to the public an understanding of just what is being proposed. Together, the group collected thousands of signatures in a petition against the measures, which we presented to the Prime Minister in September together with a cross-party delegation of MPs.</p>
	<p pid="b.93.3/13">I shall quote two other sources. First, from the unions, Nick Bramley, the president of the European Transport Workers Federation, which is based in Switzerland, said that</p>
	<p pid="b.93.3/14" class="indent">&quot;the ETF has a very real concern that the levels being proposed in Britain are below these standards&quot;,</p>
	<p pid="b.93.3/15">and he questioned the usefulness of the proposals. He continued:</p>
	<p pid="b.93.3/16" class="indent">&quot;The ETF would sooner welcome UK National licensing provisions based on former arrangements through the provisions for certificating Watermen and Lightermen of the River Thames or a system based on the current Rhine Patent.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.93.3/17">Secondly, Scott Newton, captain of the Woolwich ferry, on which I have travelled many times, wrote to a number of hon. Members, wanting to</p>
	<p pid="b.93.3/18" class="indent">&quot;highlight concerns arising from the imminent reduction of safety standards on the River Thames&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.93.3/19">The Rhine and Danube rivers present us with a good model. I have been privileged on a couple of occasions to travel down the Rhine on a yacht; it was a very frightening experience. As I am sure the Minister will tell us, the sheer volume of commercial traffic on the Rhine is much higher than on the Thames, but the difference between the Rhine and the Thames is that vast numbers of pleasure boats do not mix with commercial traffic on the Rhine. We hardly saw another boat that was not a barge as we travelled down the river.</p>
	<p pid="b.93.3/20">The Rhine patent was negotiated by the practitioners on the rivers and the relevant countries. It allows only those people who have six years' experience and who have been thoroughly examined to become master of a boat on either the Rhine or the Danube, and the Rhine has far fewer pleasure boats on it and far fewer passengers exposed to risk. The German and Austrian Governments in particular fought hard for that exemption, and they have successfully and rigorously maintained safety standards on the two rivers. That is all the more reason why the Thames should be granted similar exemption. We should by all means accept the continental standards, but we should add some local extras to maintain our standards.</p>
	<p pid="b.93.3/21">Many hon. Members from all parties have made it clear that they want nothing to do with the new licences. I urge the Minister at this last moment to think again. I have the highest respect for the Minister&mdash;my constituency neighbour&mdash;as an MP and as a human being. He is just as anxious as every other Member who has spoken to ensure that there is no ghastly tragedy on the Thames. He must reconsider the provision. I urge him to return with better proposals that are designed to meet the challenges of safe navigation on the Thames.</p>

	<p pid="b.97.1/1">The recommendations include those. I shall provide some details because Members seem to have formed the view that I have plucked the recommendations out of the air, when they resulted from consultations held over a long period. The initial proposals were formed as a result of two working parties set up in February 2003&mdash;the freight standards steering group and the boatmaster's licence working group. We conducted a non-statutory consultation on the first proposals between December 2003 and February 2004, and a second one in 2005. We conducted a statutory consultation between April 2006 a July 2006, and in 2006, we held ministerial meetings that involved myself and other Members of Parliament, the RMT and other representatives of boatmen.</p>
	<p pid="b.97.1/2">As a consequence, we improved significantly the original proposals. We have said that a person will not gain their local knowledge of the Thames during the two years in which they obtain their generic licence, but during six months of training afterwards. So we have already gold-plated the original recommendations precisely as a result of listening to representations from people who complained to me about the original proposals.</p>

	<p pid="b.98.4/1">Nobody is arguing that there cannot be changes or improvements&mdash;the Minister has set out many of them&mdash;but the European norm will be four years of training. Does the Minister not understand that the central objection to the proposal is that the minimum training barrier in the one of the most difficult rivers in Europe will be half of what it is across Europe? If he is willing to change that and one or two of the other matters raised, we could agree on a package that is an all-round improvement, not one that improves some areas, but leaves a great hole in the middle.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-01-10b.102.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1377" speakername="Nick Herbert" colnum="102"  time="011:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070110/halltext/70110h0005.htm#07011055000581">
	<p pid="b.102.1/1">I agree with my right hon. Friend's concern, and shall refer to the prison that he mentioned in one moment.</p>
	<p pid="b.102.1/2">We know from a document that was written by the governor of Ford and leaked to the press on <phrase class="date" code="">3 August</phrase> that instructions have come down from the director of operations at the Prison Service, stating that</p>
	<p pid="b.102.1/3" class="indent">&quot;local prisons must review prisoners serving short sentences for non-sexual or violent offences who are relatively low risk and likely to be suitable for transfer to open conditions...we are likely to get more very short termers, some who should really be in Cat C conditions&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.102.1/4">She added:</p>
	<p pid="b.102.1/5" class="indent">&quot;Ministers have been briefed to this effect and are taking this risk.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.102.1/6">In other words, she knew that Ministers were taking the risk and that they knew that unsuitable prisoners were being transferred to category D prisons, including Ford. Plainly, if unsuitable prisoners are placed in open prisons in the first place, and if they then go on the run, there are serious implications for public safety. When, on <phrase class="date" code="">20 November</phrase>, the Home Office eventually admitted that there had been 70 escapes since the beginning of the year&mdash;three made by prisoners serving life sentences for murder&mdash;it said that 28 of the 70 were still at large. Have those prisoners been returned? What penalties have they faced? We do not know; perhaps the Minister can tell us.</p>
	<p pid="b.102.1/7">We do know that last weekend, Phil Wheatley, the director general of the Prison Service, said that he was embarrassed to admit that he did not know how many inmates were on the run from open prisons. When such prisoners abscond, there is simply no central database or record of them having done so.</p>
	<p pid="b.102.1/8">My next concern is specific. The leaked staff briefing, written by the Ford prison governor, also suggested that a category C prison should be built at Ford. That is of particular concern locally. There is a formal statement of intent and agreement between the governor and the local community as represented by Arun district council. It states that there should be no more than 200 prisoners serving life sentences for violence or serving sex or arson sentences at the prison.</p>
	<p pid="b.102.1/9">I find it extraordinary that the governor should have gone to a meeting with the council about the renewal of that agreement without mentioning her proposal that a category C prison should be sited at Ford. That proposal breached the spirit of that agreement, which has now expired. Confidence has broken down to the extent of there no longer being a formal agreement between the local community and the governor.</p>
	<p pid="b.102.1/10">Such matters are serious, and a number of issues must be dealt with. First, I urge the Minister to undertake a proper security review of the prison. The fact that a prison is an open prison cannot mean that it has no security. Security at Ford is plainly inadequate, and I am not convinced that there is proper monitoring of offenders going in and out of it. As recently as December, the Minister told me that there were no plans to bring forward the Ford prison security audit, which will begin on <phrase class="date" code="">5 March</phrase>. In view of everything that has happened, it would make sense for the Minister to bring forward that review and rebuild confidence in the community.</p>
	<p pid="b.102.1/11">Secondly, there is a serious issue about risk assessment review procedures. We are constantly being told by the governor, and no doubt by the Minister, that all the prisoners have been risk-assessed. However, that assessment must include the risk of absconding. Prisoners are absconding, which undermines the assessment itself. In any case, the whole thing is undermined when it is revealed that procedures are secretly being relaxed. We know about that only because of leaked documents; it was never admitted to the public or to hon. Members.</p>
	<p pid="b.102.1/12">My third point is that there should be a proper system for tracking offenders. It is absurd that we do not know how many offenders are still on the run from Ford and other prisons. Fourthly, the Government must address the questions of prison overcrowding and of unsuitable prisoners being transferred to open conditions. As all the experts now agree, that is unacceptable and places the public at risk. If there is to be a category C prison at Ford as part of the solution to those problems, that must be properly and openly discussed with local Members and with the council. So far, that has not happened.</p>
	<p pid="b.102.1/13">That leads me to the issue of transparency. The governor must be straightforward with public and elected representatives, including me and the council. She has not been; there is a culture of secrecy at the prison and among the Government generally. Getting information from the Government has been very difficult, and that must change if confidence is to be rebuilt.</p>
	<p pid="b.102.1/14">The Minister will be only too aware of the catalogue of blunders at the Home Office, including yesterday's revelation that the serious convictions of 500 criminals have not been recorded on the police national computer. No doubt we shall hear about them later. However, my overall contention is that it is wholly unacceptable that two offenders should walk out every week from the prison. That severely undermines confidence, and I worry about the complacency that says that it does not matter and is all perfectly routine.</p>
	<p pid="b.102.1/15">The greatest concern must be about an absconding prisoner going on to commit or having already committed serious offences. That happened following an escape from Sudbury prison in <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1536" name="Patrick McLoughlin">the constituency of my right hon. Friend the Member for West Derbyshire (Mr. McLoughlin)</phrase>. Jason Hope escaped on <phrase class="date" code="">4 May</phrase>; 21 days later, he sexually assaulted a 13-year-old boy. If such a thing happened at Ford after all the concerns raised about escapes, there will be most serious consequences for the governor and the Minister. I am sure that the Minister knows that. I urge him to recognise that the local community and I have genuine concerns about security at Ford prison. I urge him to address them.</p>

	<p pid="b.108.3/1">In the two minutes that remain, we can get into a debate about sentencing. In 2003, the Government introduced indeterminate sentences so that people who are a danger to society could be kept in prison, unlike what was happening before. We are trying to rebalance the criminal justice system, and that is why we announced in July that we want people to have confidence in what goes on and to understand sentencing policies, and we have given undertakings in respect of that. I hope that the Opposition will be helpful in the discussions that need to take place on that.</p>
	<p pid="b.108.3/2">As an Adjournment debate is too short for dealing with such issues, I am prepared to meet the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs and to visit Ford. We will consider in detail the issues that he raised. I hope that we can set up that meeting as soon as possible.</p>

	<p pid="b.109.1/1">Last October, as vice-chair, I led a delegation from Friends of Cyprus to the island. I draw attention to my entry in the Register of Member's Interests in relation to the costs of the visit.</p>
	<p pid="b.109.1/2">The debate on Cyprus seems to have become an annual event&mdash;recently under your chairmanship, too, Mr. O'Hara. I know that you take a particular interest in the matter. Regrettably, over the past year, there has not been a great deal of progress. When we were in Cyprus, it was clear that the Greek Cypriot view is that the world has forgotten the basic cause of the problem: the injustices of invasion, occupation, Turkish troops and settlers and development of their property. The Greek Cypriots feel disappointed by the lack of progress since Mr. Mehmet Ali Talat became President of the so-called Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus. Many Turkish Cypriots would privately agree about that, which is shown by the slipping of electoral support for the Republican Turkish party&mdash;the CTP&mdash;and apparent growing division within the CTP.</p>
	<p pid="b.109.1/3">The focus in the north and for Turkey is on upgrading their status, consequent to the EU process. The Republic of Cyprus will not agree to delegations seeing TRNC leaders in their offices, as that is seen as supporting that upgrade, but Mr. Talat and others will now only see visitors in their offices. That reduces the prospect for visitors to get both sides' views and to debate and test those views with the other side's leaders.</p>
	<p pid="b.109.1/4">After the failure of the Annan plan, rather than reaching out to the Greek Cypriots to reassure and engage with referendum &quot;no&quot; voters, who will have to be won round to support any future settlement plan, the Turkish Cypriot leadership only harks back to its community's &quot;yes&quot; vote and the injustice that it perceives of its continued isolation, which is seen as a breach of faith by the international community. That has the effect of alleviating pressure on Turkey, which supported a referendum &quot;yes&quot; vote, and of turning Turkish Cypriot and international disapproval on to the Republic's leadership and especially President Papadopoulos.</p>
	<p pid="b.109.1/5">The demonising of the President is counter-productive and drives the communities further apart. Attacks should be directed at policies, rather than personalities, and Mr. Talat should not be encouraged to see such attacks as acceptable by the attitudes of some in the EU. Having the CTP in government in the north has relieved Turkish Cypriot political pressure on Turkey, as there was no one left to organise it. As one of the prime movers of the former common vision movement said to me, &quot;We're back to square one&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.109.1/6">Questions have to be raised about whether the CTP Administration is slipping back into the old ways and failing to reflect Turkish Cypriot opinion to Turkey, as they were elected to do. The Administration in the north believes that they have international support and can achieve much of what they want through that. We were told that that was now debated as &quot;Eurotaksim&quot;, or partition through Europe. In the south, the Turkish EU accession process is seen as leverage. Both sides are regrettably playing it long.</p>
	<p pid="b.109.1/7">Time is objectively not on the side of settlement. Facts are being created on the ground in the north, with building on Greek Cypriot land&mdash;a negative by-product of the failure of the Annan plan&mdash;and the increase in the population from Turkey. Although the green line has been opened, resulting in 15 million crossings and the removal of the physical barriers to trade and movement, so&mdash;inexorably, given the present climate&mdash;a green line of the mind is being erected to replace it, with reducing meaningful bi-communal contact at every level. Although personal friendships across the divide can be maintained, that does not read through politically.</p>
	<p pid="b.109.1/8">We heard that recent polls&mdash;one has to be sceptical, sometimes, about polls in Cyprus&mdash;showed that a majority on both sides wanted division. That runs a risk of coming not with a bang but a whimper, and there is a growing risk that such an outcome will become inevitable through default and neglect.</p>
	<p pid="b.109.1/9">The UN initiative is led on the island by the self-styled &quot;optimist on duty&quot;, Michael Moller, who has made clear that there is no UN plan B. Since the leaders of the two communities were brought together by UN Under-Secretary-General Gambari in July 2006, the agreements that were then reached have dissolved in the face of disputes about how to take the process forward, and talks about talks have assumed an identity of their own. On <phrase class="date" code="">15 November</phrase>, Mr. Gambari wrote to both leaders to set out proposals that were formally accepted by both sides on <phrase class="date" code="">18 November</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.109.1/10">Kofi Annan, in his <phrase class="date" code="">1 December</phrase> Security Council report on Cyprus, said:</p>
	<p pid="b.109.1/11" class="indent">&quot;The stage is therefore now set for positive forward movement&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.109.1/12">He urged both parties to show good will and determination to overcome deep mental distrust and suspicions, and he hoped that the blame game would be stopped. Whether the new Secretary-General will embark on a good offices initiative will depend on progress. In response, there was a welcome announcement on <phrase class="date" code="">28 December</phrase> by Turkish Cypriot leader Mr. Talat that the bridge will be immediately removed, so that the Ledra street crossing point can be opened. I believe that demolition started yesterday, despite objections from the military.</p>
	<p pid="b.109.1/13">Although there are protestations of no linkage on both sides of the green line, in practice that is unavoidable when one considers the position on the Cyprus issue and on Turkish accession to Europe. Turkey certainly sees a link, as was seen at the review of its accession process at the December European Council and its failure to open its ports, airports and airspace to the Republic of Cyprus, even though it previously undertook to open them.</p>
	<p pid="b.109.1/14">The embargo is far wider than most appreciate and affects not just Cyprus, but the whole EU, as it applies to any ship or aircraft with the remotest connection with the south. A recent absurdity concerned the wish of the Italian chief of staff, who had arrived in Cyprus after inspecting troops in the Lebanon, to fly direct in an Italian plane to Afghanistan from Larnaca across Turkey. The Turks refused permission, so he had to return to Rome before he could fly across Turkey to Afghanistan.</p>
	<p pid="b.109.1/15">Turkish general elections are due by <phrase class="date" code="">4 November</phrase>, and the presidential election, in which Mr. Erdogan may be a candidate, is due before May this year, so the profile of EU accession and the stand-off over Cyprus assumes an added importance. Turkish Prime Minister Erdogan has toughened his position. His public pronouncements that Turkey's ports will not be opened match his private discussions&mdash;megaphone diplomacy, if I may say so, without the diplomacy.</p>
	<p pid="b.109.1/16">Equally, the Republic's single-minded concentration on Turkey fulfilling the legal obligations of the customs union overlooks the fact that Turkey simply will not recognise the Republic of Cyprus, as administered by Greek Cypriots since 1964. The embargo on the Republic has implications across Europe. As Cyprus has the second biggest fleet in Europe&mdash;the 10th biggest in the world&mdash;and given that Limassol is a key shipping centre alongside London and Athens, the ban must inevitably affect the cost of shipping rates, reducing available supply.</p>
	<p pid="b.109.1/17">One commentator suggested in the <i>Financial Times</i> on <phrase class="date" code="">19 December</phrase> that the biggest losers are Turkish importers, as freight rates to Turkey would be significantly lower if Cyprus-flagged ships had access to Turkish ports. That issue will become even more important with the recent opening of the BP-operated Caspian oil pipeline from Baku through Turkey to the Mediterranean if tankers from Cyprus continue to be banned from calling.</p>
	<p pid="b.109.1/18">Turkish Cypriots feel hard done by because of the EU's failure to honour its pledge, as they see it, to permit direct trade. As is often repeated, including by our own Government, to quote that commitment selectively is a misinterpretation of the EU Council of Ministers' 2004 decision. Yes, that decision was to end the isolation of the Turkish Cypriots, but it was qualified by emphasising that that was to be considered in the context of moving towards the economic integration of the island, as well as in those of improving contacts between the two communities and with the EU and helping to reunify the island.</p>
	<p pid="b.109.1/19">Everybody accepts that direct trade is meaningless in economic development terms&mdash;it is worth at best 10 million Cypriot pounds&mdash;but it has assumed great political importance as a status issue. The Turkish Cypriots believe trade with the EU would upgrade their status, which they see as an important bargaining tool in the wider issue. For the same reasons, that symbolism had led to greater efforts to avoid status recognition of the TRNC by the Republic of Cyprus and thus to its opposition to meetings with Mr. Talat in his office.</p>
	<p pid="b.109.1/20">There is also a serious question about whether the policy is being advanced by the TRNC with clean hands. We heard of a documented example&mdash;we saw the documents&mdash;of how the TRNC frustrated a deal worth 1 million Cypriot pounds to export potatoes from the north through Limassol, stating that no Turkish Cypriot goods should go through that port, in clear opposition to the EU green line regulations that were designed to facilitate trade across the line.</p>
	<p pid="b.109.1/21">There are suggestions, too, that the green line is being illicitly abused to export Turkish&mdash;as opposed to Turkish Cypriot&mdash;produce into the south, including agricultural produce containing DDT insecticide, which is permitted in Turkey but banned in the EU. In the first half of November, 370,000 kg of onions were brought from the north into the south over the green line&mdash;a quantity that could not possibly have all been grown in the north.</p>
	<p pid="b.109.1/22">Against that background, the Finnish presidency of the EU bravely attempted a compromise proposal that involved the opening of two ports in Turkey. Famagusta port would jointly be administered by Greek and Turkish Cypriots to permit EU trade and Varosha would be returned to UN administration without the right of return. Both sides squared up to reject the proposal straight away. Turkey and the TRNC did so because it did not include Ercan&mdash;Tymbou&mdash;airport and direct flights to the north, and they condemned it as a rehash of earlier proposals from President Papadopoulos. The Republic of Cyprus did so because it did not provide for the return of refugees to Varosha, nor that Turkey would open all its ports, as it had already agreed to do.</p>
	<p pid="b.109.1/23">The net result of the EU summit was that the opening and closing of eight chapters were blocked by the European Council; and Cyprus continues to block the closing of seven other chapters. Although the EU is about to propose the opening of new chapters, at least one will be blocked by Cyprus until Turkey properly implements the customs protocol.</p>
	<p pid="b.109.1/24">On a more positive note, I am pleased to say that the &euro;259 million aid package to the north is being released, and a programme team office established in the north to administer it. However, enthusiasm in Turkey for EU accession appears to be waning. Another problem is that Cyprus failed to persuade the EU to set a fresh deadline for Turkey to meet its obligations, and the Republic will soon come under renewed pressure over direct trade.</p>
	<p pid="b.109.1/25">All those issues should be taken into consideration before the EC recommends, or the Foreign Ministers meeting in January decides, a further opening of direct links with northern Cyprus, which I believe will inevitably drive prospects for settlement further away. There is no direct link arrangement for ports or airports that will not increase the pressure to develop more Greek Cypriot property. That must await comprehensive settlement.</p>

	<p pid="b.114.1/1">The hon. Lady makes an important point. The Foreign Office strengthens its advice from time to time, but in the light of the Orams case to which I hope to refer shortly it could be made stronger still.</p>
	<p pid="b.114.1/2">There generally seems to be far less formal bi-communal activity. That is the product both of the breakdown of trust, and of attacks within each community on those who work bi-communally. Although good relationships continue at a personal level&mdash;as evidenced by a Greek Cypriot crossing back south, who gave us a lift after meeting a Turkish-Cypriot chess-playing friend to plan a joint birthday party for their wives&mdash;it does not translate into a political benefit, but indicates the desire for a settlement on an individual basis.</p>
	<p pid="b.114.1/3">That is not to say that there are no bi-communal activities. We found a most interesting history project that is trying to bring to schools an understanding of shared experience. It is planning to renovate a building in the buffer zone for seminars, a library, exhibitions, meetings and receptions, as well as working on its primary project, which is historical research and dialogue. It needs financial support; perhaps the Government would consider helping it.</p>
	<p pid="b.114.1/4">The bi-communal choir has more support than ever, and it has recovered well from difficulties after the April 2004 referendums. However, there appears to have been a general overall chilling effect, putting a settlement into the deep freeze, as one leading Turkish Cypriot told us.</p>
	<p pid="b.114.1/5">As for politics in the north, the governing coalition of CTP and the Democratic party ended, and a new coalition formed between CTP and three deserters from the DP and the National Unity party&mdash;the UBP. The irony is that the right-wing UBP and DP parties, which had in the past expelled left wingers from their parliament, were now boycotting parliament themselves and protesting outside on the pavement.</p>
	<p pid="b.114.1/6">There appears to be increasing dissatisfaction with Mr. Talat's regime. It has not delivered the progress CTP promised, and its popularity is waning. The risk is of a return to right-wing rule, with a majority of settlers in the north, over the Turkish Cypriots. That could lead to a realignment, a settler party, and even the possibility of a referendum for taksim, or partition. Turkish influence is clear. The north is already more Turkish than Turkish Cypriots, but if that scenario turns out to be correct, it will foil completely Turkey's bid for EU membership and will encourage Turkish Cypriots to claim their land in the south by moving back to the Republic.</p>
	<p pid="b.114.1/7">As always, a plethora of legal actions impinge on the political process in Cyprus. The most famous recently is the Orams case, in which a Greek Cypriot is trying to enforce through the UK courts a Cypriot judgment against a British couple who bought a property on the Greek Cypriot's land in the north. The British judge upheld the basic principles of the judgment, but would not enforce it. The case will ultimately go to the European Court of Justice. The Loizidou case is before the European Court of Human Rights for enforcement of earlier debts. The Arestis case concerns Greek Cypriot property in Varosha. The ECHR seems to have ruled on the effectiveness of the local remedy that Turkey put in place to comply with earlier rulings, awarding &euro;800,000 compensation. However, the issue remains one of restitution. The total cost, if only Varosha people were to claim, has been estimated at &pound;5 billion.</p>
	<p pid="b.114.1/8">The question is whether Turkey has a budget for that, or whether an extra lever might be provided to persuade Turkey to hand back Varosha. The local remedy is the property commission under the TRNC. We were told in the north that 55 Greek Cypriots had applied, and that four of five cases had been decided, including one restitution. Further progress depends on how the Arestis case ruling is interpreted and whether similar sums are awarded. In the meantime, apart from a few dozen urgent cases, 1,500 outstanding European Court of Human Rights cases have been stayed.</p>
	<p pid="b.114.1/9">The Arif case in the Republic concerned a Turkish Cypriot who moved back south and was resident there. The Republic court ordered restitution, the Greek Cypriot family living in his property were removed and the property was handed back. More Turkish Cypriots who were either resident in the Republic or living overseas before 1974 are now claiming restitution of their property. Turkish Cypriot newspaper editor Sener Levent is bringing a European Court of Human Rights case in relation to his desire to be a candidate in Republic elections. He claims he was discriminated against as he had to fill in a form, which he refused to do as it was not required of Greek Cypriots. On a more positive note, the various prosecutions against him by the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus and the Turkish military have been dropped.</p>
	<p pid="b.114.1/10">Again, on a more positive note, the UN committee on missing persons is working effectively on a bi-communal basis. Some 184 sites have been identified: 160 in the north containing about 1,000 bodies and 24 in the south containing about 300 to 350 bodies. Bi-communal teams of archaeologists and anthropologists are recording the sites and recovering the bones. The laboratory in the UN buffer zone is on UK land, using a UK building and is functioning bi-communally with Argentinean experts. The job is extremely skilled and involves matching up jumbled piles of bones. I visited the lab and saw the amazing and complicated work that takes place. However, funding is a problem; they need &euro;3 million a year to keep going and uncertainty of the funding means the Argentinean team is only on a two-month rolling contract&mdash;we could perhaps do more to help with that.</p>
	<p pid="b.114.1/11">Demining is proceeding well as a UN project, funded by the EU through the work of a UK-based company. Demining has been completed in the Republic, and buffer zone demining of 13 Turkish mine fields has been completed. The UN now wants to move further afield and the United Nations Peace-Keeping Force in Cyprus is negotiating with the Turkish army to include the remaining mine fields in the buffer zone.</p>
	<p pid="b.114.1/12">I visited the enclaved Greek Cypriots in the Karpas. The conditions in which they live, the petty restrictions to which they are subjected, and the general intimidation and lack of protection from the law they experience amount to an appalling abuse of human rights. In Rizokarpaso only about 230 people remain and there are not many more in the remainder of the Karpas. Of the 12,000 people who stayed on in 1974 the rest died or gave up in the face of oppression. Those still there are terrified of drawing attention to their condition for fear of victimisation. Indeed, two of the people with whom we spoke were questioned by the police almost immediately after we left.</p>
	<p pid="b.114.1/13">I have raised the issue of the enclaved people with the Secretary-General of the Council of Europe and I believe we should be doing more to raise this firmly with Turkey as part of its accession process. Near the end of last year, David Hencke, a <i>Guardian </i>reporter, visited the enclaved people and wrote an accurate article for <i>The</i><i>Guardian </i>fully describing that oppression. Regrettably, that was shelved by the editors because it was seen as too &quot;pro-Greek&quot;. I find it appalling that <i>The</i><i>Guardian, </i>which should have a good record on human rights, has fallen into the same trap as far too many others. It has overlooked that appalling abuse because it does not fit its political agenda and because the victims are Greek Cypriots and the story does not promote Turkish accession.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-01-10b.119.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1873" speakername="Roger Gale" colnum="119"  time="015:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070110/halltext/70110h0007.htm#07011055000613">
	<p pid="b.119.2/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1628" name="Andrew Dismore">the hon. Member for Hendon (Mr. Dismore)</phrase> on securing the debate so early in the new year and so soon after the appointment of Georgios Iacovou as the new high commissioner to London. I am sure that hon. Members on both sides of the House would wish to welcome Mr. Iacovou to his post, and I had the opportunity to do so formally in Margate at the blessing of the seas on Sunday. We should place on record our appreciation for the work that he has done and for the work that we hope he will do.</p>
	<p pid="b.119.2/2">The hon. Gentleman's grasp of Cypriot politics is arguably second to none in either House of Parliament, and he also has a grasp of the legal issues, so I do not propose to go over the same ground. Instead, I want to put a human face on the issue, and I can almost hear the groans coming from one quarter as I mention the name of George Geroletiou. He is well known to colleagues who take an interest in Cyprus affairs. Indeed, that is literally true, because he is a personal friend in many cases. He also happens to be one of my constituents, although the Minister probably does not know him.</p>
	<p pid="b.119.2/3">George is British. He was born in January 1913, so he is 94 this month. He was born in Komi Kebir, which was quite a thriving town close to the Karpas, but which is now almost a ghost village. He was born in a house in which his father and his grandfather had lived before him. He emigrated to the United Kingdom in 1935 to work and seek his fortune, and he did well. He joined the Royal Air Force at the start of the second world war and served in it for four and a half years. For part of that time, he served with Glafcos Clerides, the former and distinguished President of the Republic of Cyprus. He served in India, Burma and Ceylon&mdash;he was not sitting on his backside in pretty places. As a citizen of the United Kingdom, he served this country and put his life on the line, as so many people, including former President Clerides, did at that time.</p>
	<p pid="b.119.2/4">In 1970, long after the war, and having concluded a successful business career, George Geroletiou and his British wife, Ivy, decided to live back in Cyprus, the land of George's birth. They built a villa outside Famagusta, in a hamlet called Tricomo, right on the coast. It was a beautiful place in a beautiful location, with a view over the sea. The villa was completed in 1970, and George and Ivy spent two winters in their home before moving there for what they thought would be the whole of their retirement. They hoped to see their family&mdash;their children and their grandchildren&mdash;enjoy the property.</p>
	<p pid="b.119.2/5">By 1974, Tricomo was on the Turkish side of the green line, and George Geroletiou's property had been appropriated by the Turks. He did not go back until relatively recently. He came to see me in the Central Lobby in 1983, shortly after I was elected to the House. He asked me to use my good offices as his Member of Parliament to get him back his home, or what he and Ivy had come to regard as their home. For 23 years, I have been trying to do just that, with a signal lack of success, I have to say. I do not want to point too many fingers, however, because there have been failures on the part of successive Governments. I am as deeply ashamed of the lack of progress made by the Conservative Governments of the 1980s and 1990s as I am of that made by the current Government.</p>
	<p pid="b.119.2/6">George is 94. He was hospitalised last summer, although, happily, he has made a recovery. I told him that he has to go on for two reasons. First, I want him to get his telegram from the Queen. Secondly, he has damn well got to stay alive until he gets his property back, however long that takes&mdash;and he could become the oldest citizen in the country if we have to wait too much longer. What he cannot understand, however, is why his country&mdash;the country for which he fought and in which he worked and paid taxes&mdash;is prepared to do so little to help him get back his stolen home.</p>
	<p pid="b.119.2/7">A couple of years ago, after the green line was opened, George and I went up to Komi Kebir and saw the place of his birth. It was a pretty little cottage, which is now occupied by a Turkish Cypriot lady of advancing years. She actually remembered George just before he left Cyprus in 1935. She invited us in, and we sat down and had coffee with her. I did not understand a word that they were saying, but they jabbered away for yonks in a Cypriot dialect that was part Greek and part Turkish. Of course, that is the kind of relationship that exists between Turkish Cypriots and Greek Cypriots when they are allowed to get on with their own lives, although, in the main, they are not allowed to do so now, at least in Cyprus.</p>
	<p pid="b.119.2/8">From Komi Kebir, George and I went down to Tricomo and saw his villa, although we were not allowed into it. It was &quot;owned&quot; by a Turk, and there was a Turkish name by the little post-box slotted into the gates. A bulldozer was digging a swimming pool in George Geroletiou's garden for the illegal Turkish occupant's use. Imagine how that old man felt. Imagine how he and others living and working in this country feel about our Government.</p>
	<p pid="b.119.2/9">I have to tell the Minister, however, that it gets even worse than that. Following the referendum, in which the Cypriots dared to say no, as was their complete democratic right, the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom went to Ankara and condemned the Republic of Cyprus in terms for daring to vote no. That referendum was largely constructed by the now Lord Hannay, who, as far as I can see, has been ennobled for his failure. It was impossible for Cypriots who understood the future of Cyprus to vote yes, because the referendum, which was held under Annan V, the plan to which hon. Members referred earlier, did not deal with the three key issues.</p>
	<p pid="b.119.2/10">The plan did not deal with the settlers, illegal immigrants and Anatolian Turks whom Turkey dumped in the north of Cyprus. That has now resulted in the literal exclusion of Turkish Cypriots, who have left their island in droves. There is a myth that such movements are just a Greek Cypriot problem, but they are also a Turkish Cypriot problem. Those of us who have been to the island understand only too well that a generation of settler children have grown up on the island and regard themselves as Cypriot. As Cyprus is the only home that they have ever known, they have to be regarded as Cypriot, but that has compounded the problem.</p>
	<p pid="b.119.2/11">Nor did the referendum deal with the issues of armed forces of occupation in the north. It said that there would be a phased scaling down of Turkish troops in the northern part of the island and that a token presence would be ultimately left. Would the United Kingdom, having fought the war in the Falklands, seriously have tolerated a token Argentine force on the islands, on British territory? Of course it would not. If soldiers from another country wish to come to the United Kingdom at our invitation and train and work here and mix with our own servicemen and women, that is their business&mdash;at our invitation, but not imposed.</p>
	<p pid="b.119.2/12">The second key issue was not dealt with in Annan V. The third issue&mdash;the one that I have spent rather too much time dwelling on&mdash;is property, and that was not dealt with either. There was no solution to what Cypriots&mdash;Turkish Cypriots and Greek Cypriots&mdash;regard as one of the key problems.</p>
	<p pid="b.119.2/13">When George Geroletiou and I went through the green line up to see his home, we passed scores&mdash;hundreds&mdash;of little boxes. They were white concrete &quot;Stop me and buy one&quot; villas, most of which had the names of British businesses outside them as marketing agencies and very many of which have been acquired by citizens of the United Kingdom&mdash;many living in this country&mdash;as holiday homes. The hon. Member for Hendon pointed out that that has done no good at all for the tourism industry in the north of Cyprus, because all the people who were going and staying in hotels are now going and living in their villas, and they expect to be able to go on doing so for a very long time.</p>
	<p pid="b.119.2/14">That has compounded the settlement problem, because now those people have to be dealt with as well. They may have been warned by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office in small print on a website that it was a bad idea and that they might lose their properties, but no Minister yet has been prepared&mdash;although perhaps this Minister will be this afternoon&mdash;to stand up and say, &quot;You will lose those properties, so your &pound;10,000, &pound;15,000 or &pound;20,000 is money down the drain&mdash;lost, gone&mdash;if you buy stolen property. That is what is happening.&quot;</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-01-10b.123.4" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1532" speakername="Bob Laxton" colnum="123"  time="015:15:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070110/halltext/70110h0008.htm#07011055000625">
	<p pid="b.123.4/1">I could not agree more. Had the result in the referendum been different, we would certainly be in a different position and hopefully we would have been moving forward.</p>
	<p pid="b.123.4/2">Following the referendums in 2004, EU Foreign Ministers took a decision to ease the restrictions on the Turkish Cypriots. According to that decision, the EU agreed on regulation on financial assistance and on direct trade. In May 2004, the UN Secretary-General published a report of his mission of good offices in Cyprus and clearly stated that the restrictions on the northern part of the island should be lifted.</p>
	<p pid="b.123.4/3">However, as the Greek Cypriot Administration became a member of the EU, implementation of the EU regulations that I have referred to was blocked by the Greek Cypriots. Two and a half years after the referendums, the Turkish Cypriots, who supported the unification and settlement and thereby gained, one could claim, the moral high ground are still suffering from restrictions due to the Greek Cypriot obstruction in the EU.</p>
	<p pid="b.123.4/4">The fundamental aim of the Greek Cypriot side is to change the established parameters of the Cyprus issue. They want to stall the UN's efforts to find a comprehensive settlement and involve the EU in the problem. That is a platform on which Turkey and Turkish Cypriots are not members, and Greece and the Greek Cypriot Administration have a right to veto and chances to manipulate the process in their favour. The Greek Cypriots also appear to be trying to remove the vested rights of Turkish Cypriots and downgrade them to the level of &quot;minority&quot;. Furthermore, Greek Cypriots are trying hard to open a direct negotiation channel with Turkey and push aside the Turkish Cypriot leadership, whom they disregard as a counterpart, yet the Greek Cypriot leadership's method of finding a comprehensive settlement has always been through the Turkish Cypriot authorities. Turkey and Greece&mdash;the motherlands&mdash;together with the UK are the guarantor powers who must overlook and participate in the efforts to find a solution.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-01-10b.125.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1831" speakername="Simon Hughes" colnum="125"  time="015:23:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070110/halltext/70110h0008.htm#07011055000628">
	<p pid="b.125.0/1">On <phrase class="date" code="">29 December</phrase>, I was on my way back from a short visit to Israel and Palestine and was at a stopover at Istanbul airport when I was approached by some constituents&mdash;something that happens in this job. They said, &quot;Simon, it is very nice to see you. Are you coming to our event on <phrase class="date" code="2007-01-09">9 January</phrase>?&quot; &quot;What event is that?&quot; I asked. They told me that it was the annual new year event of the Cypriot elders centre in Southwark, where Greek and Cypriot people have for years met and enjoyed an extremely good community facility. My constituents had been in Turkey for a meeting about the future of Cyprus.</p>
	<p pid="b.125.0/2">Yesterday, I went to that evening event and found that both Turkish and Greek Cypriots&mdash;like many hon. Members in the Chamber, I represent both&mdash;overwhelmingly want peace, settlement and justice in Cyprus. They want the politicians to get their act together, so that they can go back to normal life north or south of what is now the border in the place where they come from. I have never held a brief for one or other side of the argument, but I hold one for the rule of law&mdash;as I do in relation to Palestine and Israel.</p>
	<p pid="b.125.0/3">To me, the rule of law says simply that there was an invasion in 1974. However difficult the times before that were or how much injustice there was, in the end, there was an invasion of one country by another, which caused a division. The northern part of Cyprus has been occupied since then. That is against international law. There cannot be peace when any country holds territory to which it is not entitled in another country. That does not mean that I am against the Turkish Cypriots having their say or that I am against Turkey. We have to reach a balanced, fair resolution in which the troops withdraw and the Cypriots decide their own future.</p>
	<p pid="b.125.0/4">I add my criticisms to those of my colleagues around the table and say to the Minister that the Government have been very feeble and weak on this issue since the invasion. We were the colonial, empire power and are now the guarantor power&mdash;Cyprus is a Commonwealth country&mdash;yet we have barely ever sought to drive the process. That is a terrible frustration and indictment. We are also the power with sovereign bases there, so we have a direct interest. Some of my family have lived there, and I have visited them there. We have a huge interest in trying to drive the process towards peace.</p>
	<p pid="b.125.0/5">There was a referendum after lots of UN work, but I share <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1873" name="Roger Gale">the view of the hon. Member for North Thanet (Mr. Gale)</phrase> on that. If a question is put to the people in a referendum and both halves of the island are required to reach a common view, they cannot be criticised if one side says no, but the Government did that completely unjustifiably. Both sides were required to say yes before the proposition could go ahead, but they did not say yes, so it was not an acceptable proposition&mdash;end of story. They should then have gone back to work and tried to find an acceptable proposition.</p>
	<p pid="b.125.0/6">I am conscious that lots of opportunities have come and gone, one of which was Cypriot membership. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1532" name="Bob Laxton">The hon. Member for Derby, North (Mr. Laxton)</phrase> said that the Greek Cypriots got membership of the EU as a reward for voting no in the referendum, but that is a complete distortion of the facts. Cyprus joined because it passed the criteria for membership of the EU, and it was rightfully allowed to come in, as Bulgaria and Romania have been this year.</p>
	<p pid="b.125.0/7">There was another opportunity, which is where the backstop is found. I agree with <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1628" name="Andrew Dismore">the hon. Member for Hendon (Mr. Dismore)</phrase>, whom I compliment on his knowledge and congratulate on securing the debate, that the longer this problem goes on, the more difficult it is to heal and the more likely partition is. That is against the interests of the people, who want to go back to the generally happy co-existence and lives that they had before. The one backstop issue is the Turkish application to join the EU. I support the application, but they have to understand that they must abide by the rules and comply with the requirements put on them by the EU. Therefore, they will have to open their ports to the lawfully recognised Cypriot Government and open up trade.</p>
	<p pid="b.125.0/8">I am a realist and I appreciate that such matters are unlikely to be easy in an election year, but by the end of the year, there will have been both parliamentary and presidential elections in Turkey. I request that the ground is laid now with the UN and led by the EU and our Government, so that immediately the Turkish elections are over, there is a serious and determined effort to ensure that the position is resolved. That is not impossible. There are issues to do with housing, land and disappearances, but the will is there among the people if only international pressure and leadership can be given to the politicians. I hope that the UK Government will be slightly more effective in their leadership than they sadly have been in respect of a country of whom we are the guarantor but whose guarantee we have not upheld for the past 33 years.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-01-10b.129.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1371" speakername="Graham Brady" colnum="129"  time="015:39:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070110/halltext/70110h0009.htm#07011055000634">
	<p pid="b.129.0/1">It is a pleasure to take part in such a good debate. I join other Members in congratulating <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1628" name="Andrew Dismore">the hon. Member for Hendon (Mr. Dismore)</phrase> on securing it and on the knowledgeable way in which he opened it. There have been some excellent contributions, not least from <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1873" name="Roger Gale">my hon. Friend the Member for North Thanet (Mr. Gale)</phrase>, who gave a moving personal insight into some of the tragedies that occur when an island such as Cyprus is divided as it has been. It is also a pleasure once again to follow <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1869" name="Jeremy Browne">the hon. Member for Taunton (Mr. Browne)</phrase>. True to his diplomatic lineage, he teasingly alluded to the fact that he has personal sympathies, but left us hanging, wondering what they might be.</p>
	<p pid="b.129.0/2">The debate is timely, because the important and difficult issue of Cyprus is in danger of slipping down the order of priorities. The hon. Gentleman's securing of the debate gives us a chance to reinforce its importance and to remind the Minister and the Government, gently, of the importance that hon. Members attach to seeking a resolution. There is an apparent state of deadlock that is really quite frustrating. There was palpable frustration in the opening speech, similar to that which many people in Cyprus feel about the lack of movement and about the difficulty that can sometimes now exist in seeing a possibility of movement.</p>
	<p pid="b.129.0/3">The opportunity for discussion about Cyprus is particularly welcome when so many other pressing international issues could easily divert our attention. It is also well timed in view of the arrival of a new Secretary-General at the United Nations, which the hon. Member for Taunton mentioned. Kofi Annan clearly had very great experience in dealing with Cyprus, and he invested a huge amount of personal energy into seeking a settlement. I hope that the Minister will assure us that the Government will do everything possible to ensure that his successor picks up that baton with the same degree of determination for progress.</p>
	<p pid="b.129.0/4">As <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1831" name="Simon Hughes">my hon. Friend and the hon. Member for North Southwark and Bermondsey (Simon Hughes)</phrase> said, Cyprus is a particular problem for the United Kingdom, both as a guarantor power and as a Commonwealth partner of Cyprus within the European Union. That is a special status that applies only to Cyprus, Malta and the United Kingdom, and it should give us cause and opportunity to exercise influence.</p>
	<p pid="b.129.0/5">The Opposition are in broad agreement with the Government's objectives and efforts for progress. We share their desire to see a settlement that enjoys the consent of both communities, which is the only kind of settlement that can work. We want Cyrpus reunited, and as a step on the way to that elusive goal we want warm and positive relationships in trade and free movement to be established and improved for the Cypriot people.</p>
	<p pid="b.129.0/6">From time to time the Opposition have differed from the Government in style and emphasis. We took the view, as mentioned by my hon. Friend, that it was counter-productive for the British Government to criticise the electorate of the Republic of Cyprus for voting against the Annan plan. We also questioned whether more progress might have been possible before the opening of the Turkish accession negotiations during the British presidency. To the extent that there has been a loss of trust in the relationship between the British and Cypriot Governments, we think that that will make progress harder. However, we share a common purpose, and we wish the Government well in its efforts.</p>
	<p pid="b.129.0/7">As has been said, a resolution to the problems of Cyprus is increasingly tied up with the whole question of Turkish membership of the EU and the debate on that. However, it is essential that such a resolution should not become contingent on Turkish accession, and it must not wait for eventual Turkish accession. There must be no linkage in the timetable. Nevertheless, there is no question that the process of movement towards accession provides a crucial opportunity for applying pressure and encouragement for settlement. Before Christmas, the Foreign Secretary and the Minister were clear in their view that the suspension of eight chapters of the accession negotiations for Turkey was too severe a penalty, and we wholeheartedly endorse that view. I particularly look forward to the Minister's comments&mdash;I want to leave time for him to make them&mdash;on how that process can be brought back on track in the context of the Cyprus question.</p>
	<p pid="b.129.0/8">I am sure that the Minister will also agree that it would be particularly unwelcome if those EU member states that are antagonistic to Turkey were allowed to exploit the Cyprus question as a means of blocking accession talks. In that context I hope that the Minister's winding-up speech will include an assessment of what can be done to work towards lifting the suspension of the negotiations on certain chapters, and of the timetable for that. Given that Germany, in particular, is less than enthusiastic&mdash;I think that that is a fair view of its position&mdash;about Turkish membership, will he also say whether there are any prospects for priority to be accorded to such related matters by the Germany EU presidency?</p>
	<p pid="b.129.0/9">Along with the hardening of attitudes in Cyprus, one of the least helpful things that could happen would be for Turkey's experiences in relation to Cyprus and to accession to cause it to turn away from accession. The <phrase class="date" code="">19 December</phrase> issue of the <i>Financial Times</i> reported, I believe, that Turkish support for EU membership had already fallen by that point from 75 to 50 per cent., largely because of the experiences of the last year. I hope that the Minister will be able to give hope in that regard.</p>
	<p pid="b.129.0/10">Many of the problems are difficult and complex diplomatic issues. Some, however, can be addressed at a more local and human level. I hope that the Minister will focus not only on the big and apparently intractable diplomatic issues, but on the smaller ways in which we might be able to help to build relationships between communities across the green line.</p>

	<p pid="b.134.0/1">It is no secret that I have spent a considerable amount of time during the past few months talking with political leaders in Greece and Turkey and on the island. Those efforts are continuing and form part of a wider context, which I am outlining. There is no lack of effort by the British Government in trying to secure a just and lasting settlement.</p>
	<p pid="b.134.0/2">An important development was the meeting between UN Under-Secretary-General Ibrahim Gambari and the two leaders on <phrase class="date" code="">8 July</phrase>, when they agreed a set of principles and decisions. That, along with the leaders' subsequent agreement to the proposals set out in Mr. Gambari's letter of <phrase class="date" code="">15 November</phrase>, provides a new opportunity for the resumption of fully fledged settlement negotiations. Whether the path to that settlement is long or short&mdash;obviously, we hope that it will be the latter&mdash;the settlement will be determined by the willingness of the parties to engage purposefully with the UN and each other. We will support that process in whatever way we can to achieve the ultimate goal of a reunified Cyprus within the EU and of peace and stability in the eastern Mediterranean region.</p>

	<p pid="b.134.2/1">Again, as a member of the European Union with a significant interest in Cyprus, we were closely involved with our Finnish colleagues in trying to find a way through the various issues without linking a settlement in Cyprus directly to the requirements of European law. The Council's decision was practical and sensible, and it indicated the European Union's concern about the failure of Turkey to implement European law while allowing the negotiations to continue in all but eight chapters. That is a practical solution to the problem and means that we have the opportunity to move forward. It will continue to be discussed but, as hon. Members said, a breathing space was required and the decision in December allowed for that. I hope that that breathing space can be used to maximum advantage in Ankara and the UN process. As the outgoing UN Secretary General said, it is important to recognise that both sides must show the political will and flexibility to bridge the gap between words and deeds, and to implement the <phrase class="date" code="">8 July</phrase> agreement without delay. Whether a comprehensive settlement can ultimately be reached rests with the leaders of both communities. I recognise the absolute determination of the people of the island to achieve a settlement, but it is important that both sides are prepared to recognise that they must both move to allow that settlement to occur.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-01-10b.138.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1903" speakername="Denis Murphy" colnum="138"  time="016:15:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070110/halltext/70110h0010.htm#07011055000647">
	<p pid="b.138.1/1">I agree with the right hon. Gentleman. A platform would also provide an opportunity for an extensive park-and-ride interchange for Wansbeck general hospital.</p>
	<p pid="b.138.1/2">Phase 3 would be the full reopening of the line from Benton junction to Bedlington, via Newsham. That would permit the potential for two full connecting services, the first being from Newcastle to Ashington, via Morpeth and Bedlington, and the second being from Newcastle to Ashington and Woodhorn, via Benton, running through Blyth valley and offering full metro interchange. There are also further possibilities to extend beyond Woodhorn to a reopened station at Newbiggin-by-the-Sea. It would be possible also to run trains north of Ashington, to Widdrington and Alnmouth.</p>
	<p pid="b.138.1/3">More than 200,000 people in south-east Northumberland live close enough to the Ashington, Blyth and Tyne line to use it regularly. Since my debate in 1999, more than 1,500 new houses have been built. Well over half the population commute to jobs outside Wansbeck, with 65 per cent. of them travelling south to Cramlington and Tyne and Wear. The proportion travelling by car is growing, increasing from 60 per cent. in 1999 to 74 per cent. today. At the same time, the number of bus users has decreased from 20 per cent. to 9 per cent. That does not surprise me, however, for the Wansbeck and Blyth valley fleet must be the worst in the country. Arriva, the bus operating company, invests the bare minimum in its buses to ensure that the company complies with the law. The buses are certainly not attractive and are generally noisy and dirty. The only saving grace is that the drivers are usually pleasant and helpful.</p>
	<p pid="b.138.1/4">Anyone travelling into Ashington, Bedlington or Blyth early in the morning will generally have a clear run, with few traffic hold-ups, as all the traffic is travelling out of those towns and heading to work in Tyneside. Every one of those several thousand cars crosses the Ashington, Blyth and Tyne line at some point in its journey, either heading for the Tyne tunnel south or for the western bypass. The Newcastle A1 western bypass is one of the most congested roads in the country. It desperately needs widening, and a second crossing over the Tyne is urgently required near the current tunnel.</p>
	<p pid="b.138.1/5">The majority of cars that currently block the western bypass from the north come from south-east Northumberland. Congestion would therefore be significantly reduced with a new passenger rail service. The new rail service would have the effect of delivering Government policy on the ground. Environmentally, it could substantially reduce our carbon footprint, while economically it would further enhance the significant investment already made by the Government, by giving access to a wider jobs market for those who are unable to find work locally. A new rail service would enable people to travel into Wansbeck and Blyth valley to enjoy many of the facilities that I have listed.</p>

	<p pid="b.149.0/1">It is a pleasure, Mr. O'Hara, to serve under your chairmanship. I enjoyed and found stimulating <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2009" name="Pete Wishart">the way in which the hon. Member for Perth and North Perthshire (Pete Wishart)</phrase> introduced this important debate. He has already declared his registered interests. Rather more modestly, I can only declare that I do not think that I have any hip hop recordings; I doubt whether Lonnie Donegan counts. However, I have a fine collection of Runrig CDs, the originals and not bootleg recordings&mdash;probably the finest library of Runrig in Croydon. I am a serious fan.</p>
	<p pid="b.149.0/2">I note <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1989" name="John Robertson">the contribution made by my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, North-West (John Robertson)</phrase>. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1483" name="Kevin Brennan">My hon. Friends the Members for Cardiff, West (Kevin Brennan)</phrase> and for Brigg and Goole (Mr. Cawsey) might have wanted to catch your eye, Mr. O'Hara, despite it being a half-hour debate, but because they are Whips they are not able to speak. They are here because of their interest, and because of their artistic input to our culture. Those, I think, are the right phrases for this occasion.</p>
	<p pid="b.149.0/3">More seriously, the Gowers review considered intellectual property and policy. I hope, Mr. O'Hara, that you will not be offended if, for brevity, I refer to intellectual property as IP. The number of responses to the call for evidence&mdash;more than 500&mdash;and the wide variety of those who responded were unprecedented for what has in the past been regarded as a rather specialised and dry area of law. That illustrates the important role that intellectual property now plays throughout society. Indeed, it will grow in importance.</p>
	<p pid="b.149.0/4">Why is IP so important? The answer is simple. The hon. Gentleman has given his analysis. In a changing world the United Kingdom's current and future success in the global knowledge economy depends on the ability of our creative and high-tech industries to compete. That is certainly true for music, something in which Great Britain excels. For example, the creative industries accounted for 7.3 per cent. of gross value added in 2004.</p>
	<p pid="b.149.0/5">IP is critical to those key businesses, as it allows them to protect their investment. They therefore need an effective and balanced IP regime. That is why an independent review of our IP framework was commissioned. I am pleased to say that the Gowers review found, generally speaking, that the current system does not require any big fixes. However, it recognised that the IP regime faces challenges from globalisation and increasing digitisation.</p>
	<p pid="b.149.0/6">In an increasingly global world, many aspects of IP rights are territorial. Despite improvements to the European patent system, it remains more costly for businesses to protect their ideas here than in comparable markets such as the United States and Japan. Digitisation brings with it great opportunities for new markets but also increased opportunities for piracy and counterfeiting. For example, in 2005 the UK music industry estimates that it lost more than &pound;500 million through pirated CDs and online file sharing.</p>
	<p pid="b.149.0/7">The review makes practical recommendations on how we can respond to those challenges and opportunities, and I am pleased that the Government welcome the report and will be taking forward those recommendations for which we are responsible. I would like to consider three key areas: strong and effective enforcement, which was referred to by my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, North-West; reducing costs and complexity for businesses; and improving access to content.</p>
	<p pid="b.149.0/8">The Government are committed to a strong and effective enforcement regime for rights holders. IP crime not only damages rights holders and our industries, but impacts on consumers, small businesses, our creative industries and on people's lives and their health. For instance, the World Health Organisation estimates that up to a tenth of the world's medicines are fake, which reminds us that it is a wide issue. Music is one important area, but there are others.</p>
	<p pid="b.149.0/9">The review recognises that the national lP crime strategy has played an important role in providing a co-ordinated approach. It makes important recommendations for improving the framework in order to maximise the effectiveness of our work. I am delighted that the Home Office recognises IP crime as an area for police action, as a component of organised crime, within the updated national community safety plan.</p>
	<p pid="b.149.0/10">We will increase penalties for online infringement of copyright, which is currently a maximum of two years' imprisonment, to bring them into line with the penalty for physical infringement of copyright, which is currently a maximum of 10 years' imprisonment. Trading standards officers will be given new powers and duties to enforce copyright infringement, with an additional &pound;5 million in 2007-08, to assist with the early implementation of that new role. My colleagues at the Department for Constitutional Affairs will be considering a number of issues, including ways to promote mediation as a cheaper and more effective way to resolve disputes.</p>
	<p pid="b.149.0/11">The review identified that the costs and complexity of the IP system can sometimes be prohibitive for businesses. To address that, we are already exploring opportunities for work-sharing agreements for patent processing with Japan and the US. We will continue to work with our European partners to seek improvements in the current patent system in Europe&mdash;for example, by reducing translation costs, through the London agreement, and ultimately by working towards a community patent.</p>
	<p pid="b.149.0/12">We will also be working with industry to improve the support and advice on IP that we give to businesses both here and abroad. In addition, we will build on the success of the Lambert model agreements, already recognised in a pan-European context, by working on consortia agreements. Those measures have simplified the transaction costs for university to business licensing, and we will work with industry to draw up business to business model IP licences.</p>
	<p pid="b.149.0/13">Consumers will benefit from an improved access to content. Gowers recommends changing the law to clarify when consumers may format-shift content that they have purchased&mdash;for example, setting out when music fans will be able to transfer their CDs on to their MP3 players. Naturally, a balance between consumers and rights holders has to be maintained. That will not provide carte blanche for unlimited copying; it will be for personal use only. Improving access to content also means ensuring that consumers know what they are buying and what they can do with it. We will therefore need to consider clearer labelling of digitally protected works. If appropriate access is hindered, there should be a simple mechanism for reporting it, so that something can be done.</p>
	<p pid="b.149.0/14">The academic, educational and heritage sectors are important to our future success and our cultural identity. They will benefit from exceptions that respond to the needs of the digital era, such as enabling distance learning via secure sites and permitting the easier preservation of works for posterity.</p>
	<p pid="b.149.0/15">Another recognised area of difficulty concerns orphan works&mdash;those works for which the copyright owner cannot be found. Gowers recommended a voluntary database, on which copyright holders can register their ownership. More contentiously, it recommended developing an orphan works provision. That is not something that the UK can do. It is a matter for the European Union, and we will be informing the EU of that recommendation.</p>
	<p pid="b.149.0/16">The terms of protection for sound recordings were very much the focus of the hon. Gentleman's introduction. The Gowers review looked closely at the terms of protection for sound recordings and performers' rights in sound recordings, including commissioning an economic study to assist them. It is important to emphasise that that issue is a matter of EU competency. That is why the recommendation of the Gowers review was made to the European Commission. The Commission will be looking at the issue as part of its work programme in 2007. It will be up to the Commission to evaluate both the Gowers analysis and any further work in that area when it considers the question. The hon. Gentleman calls for continued debate and an opportunity for representation. With the Commission considering the issue this year, it seems to me that there are adequate means for his industry in the UK and across Europe to make representations. I am about to conclude, but I shall give way to the hon. Gentleman.</p>
