	<p pid="a.400.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1536" name="Patrick McLoughlin">the right hon. Member for West Derbyshire (Mr. McLoughlin)</phrase> on securing the debate. The issue is important and is likely to affect not only the east midlands but many communities in the country. I am sure that many of the concerns that the right hon. Gentleman has raised today are shared by police officers, residents and, indeed, Members of Parliament from south Wales to Suffolk. It is regrettable that several hon. Members have had to seek Adjournment debates on the issue as a result of the Government's attempts to sidestep debates on the Floor of the House on such a hugely important matter.</p>
	<p pid="a.400.0/2">I shall start by outlining the areas in which I and my party agree with Government policy. It is clear that in some instances small police forces do not possess the resources to deal effectively with some serious crimes. Several recent high-profile cases in which a particular force required assistance&mdash;Soham is just the most obvious example&mdash;have demonstrated that the Government were right to explore ways in which police forces could better co-operate and support each other; that much is not in doubt. It would be wrong to suggest that Liberal Democrats oppose closer co-operation between different forces and agencies. For example, we have called for a national border force to bring together the disparate agencies that deal with border security, including the relevant police, customs and immigration officers. We have also called for a new national body to deal with financial crime, which seems to be a low priority for the Government.</p>
	<p pid="a.400.0/3">I do not agree, however, that the nuclear option, if I might use that phrase in this context, of axing entire police forces is a sensible way to deal with the issues. In my view, the answer is staring the Government in the face. The recently established Serious Organised Crime Agency gives the police a ready-made resource on which they can call if they need to. If SOCA could take responsibility for level 2 crime, as my party has suggested, we would have the ideal solution, because serious crimes and crimes that take up disproportionate resources could be tackled without, in effect, bankrupting smaller forces and, crucially, local communities in the east midlands and beyond would remain strongly linked to their local police forces.</p>
	<p pid="a.400.0/4">My experience of local government in the past10 years has demonstrated to me in the clearest possible terms that, despite their rhetoric, the Government remain committed to centralisation. They seem to believe that an office in Whitehall can deal with community policing better than a local beat bobby can. One has only to speak to local police officers in a constituency to realise that much of their work is dictated by Home Office targets and politically inspired initiatives. Worrying, that trend is replicated across a broad spectrum of services, including the NHS, where central mismanagement has led to local funding crises, and local authorities, which must somehow reflect local priorities while trapped in the central Government straitjacket.</p>
	<p pid="a.400.0/5">In pursuing the regionalisation of police forces, we need to remember that current regional structures in the east midlands, as in the rest of the country, are the result of arbitrarily drawn administrative boundaries with no democratic structures underpinning them. The amalgamation of police forces would result in the abolition of police authorities and the loss of the link to elected councils through local authority members. Although the Home Office argues that new structures of accountability can be built around basic command units, that would create the worst of both worlds, because such structures would be too distant from local communities to provide meaningful discussion of neighbourhood priorities, and too fragmented to provide meaningful scrutiny of decisions that are taken at force level.</p>
	<p pid="a.400.0/6">I turn now to the practical pitfalls of the mergers policy as it affects forces in the east midlands and elsewhere. Like all regions, the east midlands is diverse, with large metropolitan areas and distinct rural localities. Should the proposals be implemented, there is a real danger, as has been said, that officers and other resources will be drawn away from the quieter areas to police urban crime hot spots. Chief constables of smaller forces act as champions for their areas and can lobby for a fair share of resources, but that simply will not be possible under the new model.</p>
	<p pid="a.400.0/7">In addition, there is precious little evidence that big forces perform better than small ones, which serves only to confirm suspicions that the real motive behind the policy is to save money. The HMIC baseline assessment in 2004 found that, regardless of size, all forces were classed as &quot;fair&quot; or &quot;good&quot; at tackling level 2 crime. If the resources required for mergers come from the neighbourhood policing strategy budget, that would signal in the clearest possible terms that the Government's priorities lie with centralisation, not local policing.</p>
	<p pid="a.400.0/8">Amalgamation would also reduce police accountability and responsiveness by distancing force HQs physically and figuratively from the communities that they serve and by sacrificing coterminosity with local authority boundaries. However, it is not only coterminosity with local authority boundaries that is threatened, because the relationships between other agencies, such as&mdash;</p>

	<p pid="a.402.2/1">I congratulate my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1536" name="Patrick McLoughlin">the Member for West Derbyshire (Mr. McLoughlin)</phrase> on securing this debate, and I welcome the Minister to his new position. His predecessor as Minister for Policing, Security and Community Safety lasted for two weeks; I hope that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1618" name="Tony McNulty">the hon. Member for Harrow, East (Mr. McNulty)</phrase> lasts longer. Commentators have described the mini-reshuffle that took place yesterday as reshuffling the deckchairs; I hope the Minister enjoys life on the deck of the Titanic. When icebergs appear, it does not make sense to steer the ship straight towards them, but thatis what the Home Office has been doing in relationto police amalgamation, in a totally unnecessary distraction from the job that the Department should have been doing. It is clear that the previous Home Secretary was too distracted by this process. I hope that the Minister and the new Home Secretary will think again&mdash;we hear that they are considering doing so.</p>
	<p pid="a.402.2/2">My right hon. and hon. Friends raised a number of important concerns about the absurdly tight timetable for the amalgamations and the lack of consultation with local people. I shall wish to focus on three points made by the hon. Member for High Peak (Tom Levitt, because I think he was wrong on all three counts.</p>
	<p pid="a.402.2/3">First, the hon. Gentleman made some suggestions about local accountability and people's ability to get hold of their divisional commanders and to have their e-mail addresses. He suggested that the survival of the basic command unit, although that is not assured in respect of the one he referred to in west Derbyshire, would be an adequate substitute for the loss of the chief constable. He said that nobody minded about where their chief constable resides, but actually, that matters a great deal, especially for a force that will cover an area of 6,000 sq miles and serve 4.2 million people. It matters, not only for the reasons that my right hon. Friend the Member for West Derbyshire suggested in terms of direct access on the part of Members of Parliament, but because power and decision making has to lie somewhere. Ultimately, somebody has to run the force and decide where resources will be deployed, and it would be a fiction to pretend that a BCU commander will be able to respond to people in the local community and say, &quot;Yes, I will do this,&quot; or &quot;I will do that,&quot; when in fact the force is run by the chief constable who is miles away. All Members will feel the loss when we find that our local communities are no longer able to have any influence at all over the proper decisions being made by the chief constable.</p>
	<p pid="a.402.2/4">Secondly, the hon. Member for High Peak suggested that the federation of forces was not a viable option. I think that he is wrong. There is plenty of evidence in the midlands that federation, or the sharing of services between forces, is a viable alternative&mdash;look for example at the midlands counter-terrorism support unit, which operates in the east midlands. The option of sharing services was suggested by the Prime Minister, no less, as an alternative to amalgamation, which his own strategy unit warned would be a risky undertaking. It has not been properly considered by the Government. It was recommended by the Association of Police Authorities, but the impetus to achieve co-operation between forces has now been lost because there will be no incentive on the part of the strategic forces, some of them much smaller than the east midlands force, to share services.</p>
	<p pid="a.402.2/5">Finally, on funding, I hope the Minister has seen a copy of the paper prepared by the Association of Chief Police Officers' head of finance, the chief constable of Gloucestershire, which was reported in <i>The Daily Telegraph </i>last Friday. If he has not done so, he should read it. The ACPO conference will debate it this week. The report represents a salutary warning to those who believe that amalgamation will somehow allow a reinvestment of resources into enhancing protective services. We all agree that there is a gap and that protective services need strengthening; the question is how we do that. ACPO's head of finance warns that because of the triple counting of services, and because amalgamations will cost money&mdash;&pound;77 million in respect of the east midlands force&mdash;resources will not be available for investment into protective services and there will be an impact on neighbourhood policing.</p>
	<p pid="a.402.2/6">I end by quoting the conclusion of the report:</p>
	<p pid="a.402.2/7" class="indent">&quot;Ultimately unless additional funding is identified the early years of Force amalgamation are likely to be a period not of service improvement but a period of rapid and significant reduction in service provision as the new forces desperately try to balance their books.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.402.2/8">If the Minister does not take account of that warning, he is making a severe mistake. I urge him to listen to what almost everybody has said this morning, and to think again.</p>

	<p pid="a.404.1/1">None the less, it has been an extraordinarily useful debate, certainly for me, given my current circumstances. I congratulate the right hon. Member for West Derbyshire and others on both sides on the broad tone of the debate. It has been essentially non-partisan, or cross-party&mdash;whichever way one wants to view it&mdash;and it has been well informed. I would expect no less from the MPs of the east midlands.</p>
	<p pid="a.404.1/2">As a London MP, I find that policing in London is different from policing elsewhere, but I do, and will increasingly, appreciate what policing means outside London and in other areas. By the bye, I do notthink that I heard <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2016" name="Mark Hunter">the hon. Member for Cheadle (Mark Hunter)</phrase>, who speaks for the Liberals, congratulate the Government on leaving his Greater Manchester force alone, which I thought a bit churlish.</p>
	<p pid="a.404.1/3">The points that right hon. and hon. Members have made are important, but most&mdash;not quite all&mdash;of them started from the premise that the status quo is not terrible. Our broad position starts from that. As hon. Members will know, the Government's plans for assorted forces up and down the country are clear. However, none of the speakers went to the ditch to defend, in absolute terms, where we are now with policing. I am enormously grateful that that is the starting point. The present model is some 30 years old and, purely in terms of the development of society since then, bears greater scrutiny.</p>
	<p pid="a.404.1/4">I take on board all that has been said about merger being at one end of the scale&mdash;the nuclear option, I think it was called&mdash;and all sorts of collaborative work and other options on the road to merger being at the other end. We should be clear that the proposed merger model does not preclude that sort of collaboration,or a federated structure, beyond and outside regions. As <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1726" name="Patrick Mercer">the hon. Member for Newark (Patrick Mercer)</phrase> suggested, there must be ever greater collaboration across the country and across regions, not least on counter-terrorism, as he says.</p>
	<p pid="a.404.1/5">Before I come to matters of substance, let me say that I take on board what has been suggested about the timetable. If hon. Members feel that they have not had sufficient face time&mdash;for want of a better phrase&mdash;with Ministers to talk through the issues in detail, I am more than happy to ensure that that happens. I am not sure that I would welcome all 44 east midlands MPs in the same room, all barking and baying at me at once, but we can certainly look into the details of how that should happen. I would welcome that opportunity, too. However valuable the Adjournment debate is, we can discuss these matters in far more detail in much smaller groups. I am more than happy to do that, whether on a county basis or otherwise, and I will afford the same facility&mdash;because it would help me as much as anyone&mdash;to the Front Benchers; I will come and hear their concerns.</p>
	<p pid="a.404.1/6">Many of the complaints about what the Government are trying to do&mdash;quite naturally, in terms of hyperbole and rhetoric&mdash;involve attacking straw men and putting forward simplistic models. If all that the Government were offering was a rush to merge regional authorities, many of the concerns about accountability, remoteness and day-to-day operational policing would be well made.</p>

	<p pid="a.420.0/1">I congratulate my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1755" name="Andrew Smith">the Member for Oxford, East (Mr. Smith)</phrase> on securing this debate on Sunday trading. One matter that I want to focus on is work-life balance, although I must say that I do not like that phrase and wish we could find a better one to describe the subject. <i>[Interruption.]</i> Yes, time off. That is an excellent idea. Another related matter is the effect that these longer hours would have on families.</p>
	<p pid="a.420.0/2">As we have heard, there simply is not a demand for longer shopping hours on Sundays. I hope the Department of Trade and Industry takes not of that; I am speaking as a former DTI Parliamentary Private Secretary. Survey after survey and opinion poll after opinion poll says that that is not wanted. The strongest opposition to longer hours comes from those who are concerned about the likely effects on family relationships and community life, and we have heard some excellent contributions demonstrating that.</p>
	<p pid="a.420.0/3">Let us look at the submission from Shirley Dex, professor of longitudinal social research&mdash;whatever that is&mdash;at the university of London's Institute of Education. She observes that recent changes in the labour force</p>
	<p pid="a.420.0/4" class="indent">&quot;have shown that very large proportions of mothers and fathers, sometimes both, work on Saturdays, Sundays or both weekend days&quot;,</p>
	<p pid="a.420.0/5">and adds that that proportion would inevitably increase as a result of further deregulation.</p>
	<p pid="a.420.0/6">Professor Dex also notes that a number of studies have found significant dissatisfaction among parents working atypical times, with the amount of time they have spent with their children being of serious concern to them. That dissatisfaction was shared by children. We have talked about parents today, but the effect on family life is also a worry for children, who will not be able to see mum and dad as much as they would like.</p>
	<p pid="a.420.0/7">The professor concludes that the main benefit of working at weekends is additional household income, but the majority of parents who work at weekends find that that seriously interferes with their ability to have a family life.</p>
	<p pid="a.420.0/8">However, in this context we are not just talking about children. As has been mentioned, there is also an impact on people with caring responsibilities, such as for an elderly or disabled relative or somebody who is terminally ill. They have even fewer options for finding somebody to look after that relative than parents do for their children. It is phenomenally difficult for people to get somebody in to look after an elderly relative&mdash;perhaps somebody suffering from Alzheimer's.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-05-23a.425.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1631" speakername="Mark Prisk" colnum="425"  time="012:12:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060523/halltext/60523h0099.htm#06052399000676">
	<p pid="a.425.2/1">I begin by congratulating <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1755" name="Andrew Smith">the right hon. Member for Oxford, East (Mr. Smith)</phrase> not only on securing the debate but on making incisive and thoughtful remarks about the entity of the debate. Hon. Members will, I suspect, be more interested in hearing what the Minister has to say, so I shall attempt to be reasonably brief.</p>
	<p pid="a.425.2/2">As we have discovered in the debate, Sunday trading is an issue about which many people understandably feel strongly. It is a complex issue: it appears on the surface to be about retail trading hours, but it is also about employment rights. It would seem to be merely an economic matter, but self-evidently it is fundamentally a social issue as well. Sunday trading hours are a matter for families as consumers and as workers.</p>
	<p pid="a.425.2/3">The Government, as we know, have undertaken an initial consultation. It did not start out as an initial consultation but it has suddenly become that. They have now commissioned a cost-benefit analysis, which has been discussed in this debate. Ministers have said so far that they are considering the balance of views, but we have yet to hear a clear statement of intent from Government. I hope that the Minister will correct that omission and put on record the direction in which the Government intend to travel and, indeed, whether they intend to ensure that their Back Benchers take that path with them in the form of a whipped vote. My view is that the Government need to be very careful in ensuring that they get a sensible balance between the needs of families, workers and retailers, so that those who shop may choose to do so but those who choose not to work are properly protected. There has to be a clear case for change.</p>
	<p pid="a.425.2/4">The Sunday Trading Act 1994, and its amendment through the Christmas Day (Trading) Act 2004, were the result of a classic British parliamentary compromise. The 1994 Act was designed to reflect the different concerns of those who I have mentioned and of many Christian groups. It also reflected the nature of retailing in society in 1994. Clearly society and our lifestyles have changed since then. We live in a more mobile and multicultural world. We are, whether we like it or not, a more consumer-led society. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1907" name="Helen Jones">The hon. Member for Warrington, North (Helen Jones)</phrase> articulately expressed why that is often a bad thing in our society. Whether we like it not, for many people in this nation, shopping is an essential part of their leisure. We have seen the arrival of the internet. We now face the peculiarity of being able to shop online with Tesco at 6 o'clock on a Sunday evening, but not being able to go to its supermarkets.</p>
	<p pid="a.425.2/5">There have been notable changes in habits in relation to retailing. I am told by experts in the industry that whereas 10 or 15 years ago, we used, on the whole, to go to the supermarket once a week&mdash;I say &quot;we&quot;; it is usually my wife, I admit&mdash;now the pattern is to go there two or three times a week. Habits have changed and the result is that the convenience sector is growing faster than the traditional supermarket. That is why large retailers entered the convenience sector a few years ago and are competing directly with the independents. In many of our communities&mdash;I am surprised that this was not debated today&mdash;the large retailers can circumvent the Sunday trading laws because they own convenience stores that are below the 3,000 sq ft threshold. It is important to remember that when considering any change in the law that the Government may be thinking about. In many of our towns, the Sunday trading laws are irrelevant to the debate between large and small retailers.</p>
	<p pid="a.425.2/6">It can be argued&mdash;many people do&mdash;that in a free market it is up to retailers to decide when they trade, based on consumer demand, and there is much to be said for that argument, but it depends on the market being free, open and fair. In recent years, many small shops have closed. I think that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1454" name="David Lepper">the hon. Member for Brighton, Pavilion (David Lepper)</phrase> said that about 2,000 such shops had closed in 2004. Many more are threatened. There is a growing chorus of concern about the pricing tactics employed by larger retailers when opening new stores.</p>
	<p pid="a.425.2/7">The recent decision by the Office of Fair Trading to refer the whole of the grocery market to the Competition Commission confirmed that there are clear problems in that market. The inquiry must be comprehensive. A narrow inquiry that failed to address the allegations, whether the issue was predatory pricing or unfair contracts, would leave a shadow over the market. That would be bad for consumers and for retailers, large and small.</p>
	<p pid="a.425.2/8">Some people have argued that with that significant inquiry under way, the Government should delay their plans to change the Sunday trading hours. What does the Minister think? Does he recognise that if he implements legislation in the next year, before the commission has concluded its work, that could adversely affect the very basis of the inquiry? I suspect that the whole House would want to hear his reply.</p>
	<p pid="a.425.2/9">The starting point in this debate is the consumer. People should be free to make their own choices. It is not the role of Government or politicians generally to dictate where people should spend their leisure time; I shall come to working time in a moment. For many people&mdash;I say this with some incredulity&mdash;shopping is their favourite leisure activity. As, perhaps, a typical middle-aged man, I find that prospect truly ghastly, but who am I&mdash;who are any of us&mdash;to tell people how they should spend their time?</p>
	<p pid="a.425.2/10">The converse of being free to shop on a Sunday is the right not to be forced to work on that day. Although the current law works well in some respects, I have much sympathy for what the Union of Shop, Distributive and Allied Workers and many of its members have said on that issue. We have to recognise that there is informal pressure, but we also have to be clear that legislation often cannot deal with such pressure. The Government need to be careful to ensure that whatever they do, those who do not want to work on a Sunday can make that choice without it unfairly affecting their job or their prospects.</p>
	<p pid="a.425.2/11">I shall now deal briefly with the question of family life. Of course, Sunday trading is a much broader question than just economics. I understand and have much sympathy with the position of groups such as Keep Sunday Special. To me, a practising Christian, Sunday is a special day, different from the rest of the week. It is also right to say that in a society in which often both parents work, the time that parents have for each other and for their children is under incredible pressure. As a society, we may be financially richer, but sadly the price is that we are time poor. Of course in a multicultural society, Sunday is not everyone's Sabbath; but the principle of a day of rest nevertheless can and should be recognised if we are to give our relationships the time that they need to grow.</p>
	<p pid="a.425.2/12">Sadly, the time for my speech to grow is not with me. I look forward to the Minister's response to the questions that have been raised.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-05-23a.446.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1756" speakername="Evan Harris" colnum="446"  time="013:27:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060523/halltext/60523h0103.htm#06052399000707">
	<p pid="a.446.3/1">It is fair to say that the broader animal welfare movement is split, with the WWF supporting, and indeed instigating, the REACH regulations. However, to be fair to anti-vivisection organisations&mdash;I am always keen to be fair&mdash;have made representations to the Science and Technology Committee, on which the hon. Gentleman and I serve, opposing those regulations because of the number of animals used.</p>
	<p pid="a.446.3/2">I want to concentrate on the false arguments used by the animal rights lobby on the validity and value of animal research for the production of medicines, and, before that, on getting insights into the development of disease, both veterinary and human.</p>
	<p pid="a.446.3/3">It goes without saying that I condemn unreservedly the violence, intimidation and harassment used by animal rights activists. I urge the mainstream animal rights organisations to condemn unreservedly violence, intimidation and harassment, and not by saying, &quot;We condemn violence against both people and animals,&quot; because there is a difference, even if some choose to define research using animals as violence. One is lawful and sanctioned by Parliament, and tightly regulated; the other is wholly unlawful criminal behaviour. The two should not be mixed. Therefore, condemning violence against people and animals, in the way that some organisations do, is not an acceptable way of claiming to condemn those techniques.</p>
	<p pid="a.446.3/4">Mainstream organisations need to condemn that violence, because it will enhance them and their cause if they dissociate themselves from what they must recognise, and many do, as not representative of the vast bulk of people who care about animal welfare, nor even of those people who describe themselves as animal rights activists.</p>
	<p pid="a.446.3/5">To turn to the general issues of which I have given the Minister notice, the Department of Health, the NHS and the pharmaceutical industry need to do far more to explain to, and educate, the British public&mdash;through the media, but also on occasion by educating the media&mdash;about the value and essential nature of research using animals. That is not done sufficiently.</p>
	<p pid="a.446.3/6">Perhaps the Minister can help me with this, but I have not found a speech by a Secretary of State for Health in which the main issue was the value to our health service of the work done by beleaguered scientists, including those in Oxford, who work in basic science or do pre-clinical work to produce new insights into disease, new targets for drugs and new drugs.</p>
	<p pid="a.446.3/7">People working in the NHS, whom I accept are hard pressed, do not recognise that they, too, have a roleto play in taking every opportunity, within reason, to make it clear what work has been done on animals to help to provide the health care that they deliver. Clinicians are busy people, so there is the following strong argument to be made about research, whether it is sponsored through NHS research and development funding, or worked on by the Department of Health or the Medical Research Council: somewhere in press releases about breakthroughs in human&mdash;that is, clinical&mdash;trials, there should be, perhaps in the notes to editors, a statement that the therapy was developed through animal models.</p>
	<p pid="a.446.3/8">That statement should detail what those models were, and, when applicable, what animals had been used to test efficacy and safety before the relevant medication was put into man. It should also point out that the use of animals was an essential part of the process. The onus would then be on the media to report that part of the story.</p>
	<p pid="a.446.3/9">We should make the provision of such information a general rule, so that individual scientists would not feel singled out when it was provided. When I volunteered for tests on a putative HIV vaccine, I made it clear, as best I could, in live interviews&mdash;otherwise it was edited out&mdash;that I had done so knowing, and being grateful for, the fact that the vaccine had been developed using animal models. It had been tested on animals for efficacy, at least in respect of immunogenic impact; primate models had developed the immune response that researchers were looking for.</p>
	<p pid="a.446.3/10">I do not want to blow my own trumpet, but we need more people to seize every opportunity to make that point. If they do not, we shall not convince the public of the need to safeguard animal research. We can rejoice&mdash;if that is the right word&mdash;in the recent convictions and long sentences. We can welcome, as I certainly do, the actions of the young people in the Pro-Test movement in Oxford. They put the case positively for research using animals, rather than simply opposing the extremism. We can welcome all that, but those acute, short-term effects have to be sustained.</p>
	<p pid="a.446.3/11">I worry about polls that reveal the high number of school leavers who have a negative view of animal research, think it cruel and unnecessary, and have read and accepted the propaganda of the animals rights movement. I speak generally; the counter-argument has been more successful among those who have been exposed to debates on the subject.</p>
	<p pid="a.446.3/12">There is an overwhelming argument for using the opportunity of medicines labelling to make the case for animal research. It has two bases. First, the educative one: it is right that the key role that animals have played in the development of the therapeutic option, in identifying what the drug is targeting and in testing for the efficacy and safety of it&mdash;any and all of those, as they apply&mdash;should be explained to consumers at the point of use. That is important; it is not done, but it needs to be.</p>
	<p pid="a.446.3/13">Secondly, informed consent means that people are entitled to know about the contentious issue of whether drugs have been tested on animals. People are entitled to know that, whether or not it would make a difference to whether they would choose to use a drug. We label as to whether food is GM-derived, even if there is no GM product left in it, on the basis that consumers have a right to know and should be able to choose whether they want to support GM technology.</p>
	<p pid="a.446.3/14">I do not think that many people would refuse to use animal-tested medicines if such labelling were introduced&mdash;I hope that very few or no people would&mdash;but it is important that people should have that right. The argument that we should not label in that way because people might choose on ethical grounds not to have treatment only proves me right. That view is paternalistic; we must recognise that competent adults have a right to make such decisions for themselves. That paternalistic argument is the worst that could be used, because it sells the pass on the right of people to give informed consent for their treatment.</p>
	<p pid="a.446.3/15">The Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry has said to me, and said on the radio this morning, that the issue is difficult. Well, labelling is difficult. It would involve legislation, and it might be difficult or inequitable for it to be introduced in this country and not others, but we have requirements for labelling in this country and in the European Union. I want the Government to say that they accept that a good case has been made and that they will explore what can be done to bring such labelling about.</p>
	<p pid="a.446.3/16">I come back to the point I made at the beginning of the debate. One reason for animal rights activists not targeting the food industry is that they know it would be difficult to argue, as they have on animal research, that such testing is useless. Everyone who eats meat, and presumably enjoys doing so, recognises that there is a direct benefit from having the meat industry. However, what they do not see&mdash;unless and until, sadly, they are ill, and it might be explained to them&mdash;is the direct benefits of research using animals. They see it as testing things for other people, not for them.</p>
	<p pid="a.446.3/17">In the same way, as the Minister will be aware, people do not necessarily correctly quantify the risks, if there are any, from mobile phones and mobile phone masts. They see the benefit of the mobile phone that they use, so they discount their fear of the risk, even though the dose from their phone might be greater than that from a mast. They do not see a direct benefit from mobile phone masts, even though they might use a mobile phone&mdash;one might consider that a little quirky, to say the least&mdash;so large numbers of them campaign against the masts.</p>
	<p pid="a.446.3/18">Animal rights campaigners recognise that there is a similar issue here, which is why they do what they do, and we must counter that. I fear that the climate will not always be such that the vast majority of the public believes that animal research is essential. However, if we can conquer animal rights extremism and unlawful behaviour through the efforts of the police and the intelligence services, that will bolster public opinion in support of animal research. If we are successful, we can then go back to the battle, which I am happy to have, to secure public support for animal research that does not rely, in a strange way, on the animal rights extremists' counter-productive activities.</p>
	<p pid="a.446.3/19">I hope that the Minister will offer me some comfort on the points that I have made, particularly on the lead that Health Ministers can take by backing the admirable work done by Lord Sainsbury, the science Minister, and, on occasion, by the Prime Minister. I also hope that there will be action on the design of press releases to ensure that the press have the option of reporting on animal research.</p>
	<p pid="a.446.3/20">Finally, I hope that the Government will look seriously at allowing patients to give informed consent and at educating the public generally through medicines labelling.</p>
