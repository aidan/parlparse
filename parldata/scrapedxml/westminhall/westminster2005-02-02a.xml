	<p pid="a.251.3/1">I am indebted to Mr. Speaker for choosing the proposed fundamental rights agency of the European Union for general debate this morning. I shall, even outside the House, do my best to persuade my fellow citizens to vote for the European constitution. In 1997, the Government failed by not having an immediate referendum to give them the right to join the euro when they considered it fit. I have now made my position clear, so any strictures that I might have about the European Union must be put into that context. I am a Europhile, but I hope not a Europoodle.</p>
	<p pid="a.251.3/2">I am a member of the Committee on Legal Affairs and Human Rights of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe. I was elected to the Parliamentary Assembly by my colleagues in the Yorkshire group of the parliamentary Labour party. I am the rapporteur on the overlapping jurisdictions of various human rights organisations in Europe: the Council of Europe, the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe, now possibly the European Union and, ultimately, the United Nations. It is important therefore that their roles should be defined carefully and that there should be no turf wars that could only be to the detriment of the citizens of Europe.</p>
	<p pid="a.251.3/3">The proposed constitution of the European Union was a carefully negotiated document. It sought to define the roles of the Parliament, the Commission, the Council of Ministers and member states, based on the principle of subsidiarity. The proposed fundamental rights agency threatens to undermine that careful arrangement by the creation of a new institution with a yet undefined role, vague powers and no statement of its relationship to any of the existing institutions of the Community. It is a prospective gift for Eurosceptics, who can frighten their children before they put them to bed by telling them about the new ogre that will invade the civil and human rights of every free-born citizen of this country. It is a new institution with potentially wide-reaching powers, which never surfaced in the long discussions about the new constitution.</p>
	<p pid="a.251.3/4">Lest it be thought otherwise, I should say that I welcome in principle and in theory the proposed new agency. Individual citizens in the Community have no rights against Community institutions if their human rights are infringed by them. They might have such rights&mdash;and should have&mdash;if the constitution is accepted and the Community signs up to the European convention on human rights. There is no proper system in the Community to examine European Union legislation in a manner similar to that carried out in this Parliament by the Joint Committee on Human Rights, as was pointed out in reply to the Commission's consultative document in a letter written on behalf of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/821" name="Jean Corston">the Committee by my right hon. Friend the Member for Bristol, East (Jean Corston)</phrase> on <phrase class="date" code="">9 December</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.251.3/5">Furthermore, a power for a new agency to examine thematic matters throughout the member states of the European Union would be a most welcome innovation. For example, procedures on the European arrest warrant could be examined to find out its implications for human rights in member states. So far, I am supporting the idea that was suddenly sprung on us with so little thought and so little preparatory work. The proposal was the result of a deal between Austria&mdash;which, at present, has the headquarters of the European monitoring centre in Vienna&mdash;and Italy at the European Council meeting in Brussels on 12 and <phrase class="date" code="2003-12-13">13 December 2003</phrase> at which representatives of the member states,</p>
	<p pid="a.251.3/6" class="indent">&quot;stressing the importance of human rights data collection and analysis with a view to defining Union policy in this field, agreed to build upon the existing European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia and to extend its mandate to become a Human Rights Agency to that effect.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.251.3/7">What did &quot;to that effect&quot; mean? Did it mean that the agency would deal with racism and xenophobia or something far greater? On <phrase class="date" code="">25 October</phrase>, we received our reply. The Commission published a communication containing a public consultation document on the establishment of a fundamental rights agency of the European Union, in which it set out detailed ideas, options and questions regarding the field of action of such an agency, the tasks to be entrusted to it, its relations with civil society, the Council of Europe and other bodies, and its operational structures. Those three main options were pretty vague.</p>
	<p pid="a.251.3/8">A general public meeting was held last Tuesday in Brussels at which such matters were discussed and at which the Commission, to a degree, revealed its hand. Although acceptable in many ways, that hand left many issues unresolved and undecided. For example, let us consider the relationship of the agency with the European Parliament, the Council of Ministers and the Commission. To whom would it answer? What powers will it have? Will it initiate inquiries? Will it initiate work or will it just relate to suggestions or proposals put to it? How will it be governed? What will be the scope of its work, given that it was supposed to be established on the basis of the European monitoring centre, which has a limited staff and limited finances?</p>
	<p pid="a.251.3/9">The Commission, however, has put forward the idea that the agency will have a greatly expanded role and will therefore need more people working for it and extra finances. I am not necessarily against such things, but we do not know the thinking behind them. The real problem for us all is the degree to which the development will deal with the acquis developed by the Council of Europe over the past 55 years, which has encompassed not only standards on civil and political rights, social and minority rights, treatment of people who have been deprived of their liberty and the fight against racism, but importantly, European monitoring of the respect for such standards by its member states.</p>
	<p pid="a.251.3/10">Such monitoring is carried out by several well established independent human rights bodies, with recognised expertise and professionalism on both a country-by-country basis, through country visits and on-the-spot investigations, and, increasingly, thematically. Two examples are the Council of Europe's human rights commissioner and the European Commission against Racism and Intolerance, which deals with racism, anti-Semitism and xenophobia. Through those mechanisms, the Council of Europe monitors respect for the range of human rights obligations of its member states and identifies issues of non-compliance. It addresses recommendations to member states and, in the case of the European Court of Human Rights, issues judgments binding on states' parties when the standards are not respected.</p>
	<p pid="a.251.3/11">It is important to make clear in relation to such matters the fact that the Council of Europe covers all the countries of the European Community as well as more than a score outside the EC. There are established European standards of human rights, obligations and ways in which to work. The fear is that, if the new fundamental rights agency of the European Union duplicates any or all of the spheres of work of the Council of Europe, we may have a two-tier system of human rights standards in Europe: one tier for the richer countries in the European Union and one for those outside it.</p>
	<p pid="a.251.3/12">One of the great advantages of Council of Europe membership has been that, in states newly emerged from communism or other dictatorships, independent organisations, lawyers, non-governmental organisations and independent citizens have been able to appeal to the general European standards to which countries joining the Council of Europe must seek to adhere, thereby ensuring that there can be no going back to the standards that existed before the fall of the Berlin wall. Such matters are of the greatest importance.</p>
	<p pid="a.251.3/13">The Council of Europe does important intergovernmental work on various human rights themes, leading to the adoption of reports, new legal instruments, treaties, recommendations and guidelines by the Committee of Ministers, which also has a political monitoring procedure. In addition, significant human rights achievements result from the practical assistance work carried out to facilitate the attainment of requisite standards as well as from the work of Council of Europe institutions with a broader remit. Linked to that work are numerous activities in the field of human rights education and awareness raising, which seek to develop a genuine human rights culture in European societies. Indeed, last week the Parliamentary Assembly discussed in detail the important proposed conventions on trafficking and terrorism and found them both lacking in important respects. It was therefore able to carry out a thorough investigation of the matters by virtue of the common standards that member countries all accept.</p>
	<p pid="a.251.3/14">I now come to the role of the new agency. To avoid duplication of the work of the Council of Europe, and to a lesser extent of the OSCE, the work done by the new agency should be fully defined on three levels: first, the field of action and its mandate; secondly, the tasks that it will be given; and thirdly, its working methods and management structures&mdash;notably the need to co-operate and co-ordinate closely with the Council of Europe and the need for Council of Europe participation in its management structures. I would go so far as saying, as would be the opinion of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, that adequate representation of the Council of Europe on the governing body of any new organisation should be mandatory to ensure that there is no overlapping and to draw on the expertise of the Council of Europe in certain fields. If the relationship is ad hoc rather than laid down in statute or clearly defined, there will be a tendency for the new body to want to go its own way and to react to problems in its own fashion rather than having what it might see as outside interference. That would be very dangerous indeed. Given the tasks for the new agency, it has to be adequately financed and staffed. Its proposed role, even in the minimalist scenario, will not be possible with the present staffing and financing of the European monitoring committee.</p>
	<p pid="a.251.3/15">I have a number of questions to put to the Minister. Do the Government agree that establishing an agency with monitoring powers over member states compliant with human rights standards would be tantamount to giving the EU a general human rights competence, contrary to the careful balance achieved in the constitutional treaty of last year between the responsibilities of the EU and its member states? Will the Government ensure that the agency will operate exclusively in the scope of Community law? Do they agree that the Council of Europe is the pre-eminent organisation in matters relating to the promotion and protection of human rights in Europe?</p>
	<p pid="a.251.3/16">Will the Government ensure that the fields of action, tasks and powers of the agency will be carefully circumscribed in order to avoid duplication with the role and activities of the Council of Europe? Do they agree that it is important to avoid such duplication, not only in theory, but in the operational practice of the agency, and that it will therefore be essential to ensure that the regulations setting up the agency make mandatory provision for the full participation of the Council of Europe on the agency's management and executive boards, as is currently the case with the EU monitoring centre?</p>
	<p pid="a.251.3/17">Furthermore, do the Government agree that the debate on the EU human rights agency illustrates the need to clarify who does what in Europe in matters concerning the protection and promotion of human rights? Do they agree that the Council of Europe has an irreplaceable role to play, particularly in ensuring a European framework for co-operation in the field of human rights, democracy and the rule of law? Will they ensure that the up-coming third summit of the Council of Europe will be used to lay the foundations of a stronger, more structured and better defined relationship between the EU and the Council of Europe? Will they make it a priority to set up procedures to ensure that the EU signs up quickly to the European convention on human rights?</p>
	<p pid="a.251.3/18">I am indebted to the Government for their initial reaction to the EU proposals, as posted on their website. I read it with interest and encouragement. I also found useful the document prepared by our former colleague, Terry Davis, now secretary-general of the Council of Europe, and the discussion paper produced by the Library of the House.</p>
	<p pid="a.251.3/19">The Government have a unique opportunity to put their firm imprint on the future of the new agency. We will shortly assume the presidency of the European Union, which will give my right hon. and hon. Friends an opportunity to ensure that there will be no federalising creeping encroachment by the Commission in the field of human rights and that it will not seek to intervene with the well-tried human rights mechanisms of so many member states in the EU. Although I will not be able to question Ministers, I will be watching with interest from my retirement to see how they measure up to the task that I have put before them today.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-02-02a.255.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1052" speakername="Tony Lloyd" colnum="255"  time="009:50:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/vo050202/halltext/50202h01.htm#50202h01_spnew1">
	<p pid="a.255.0/1">I am sure that several hon. Members in this Chamber were a little mystified when they first saw the title of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1081" name="Kevin McNamara">the debate secured by my hon. Friend the Member for Hull, North (Mr. McNamara)</phrase>, and that around the precincts of the Palace of Westminster many people are scratching their heads and wondering what the debate is all about. However, this debate has real importance for how we steward the human rights process throughout Europe. Like my hon. Friend, I should say that as a member of the British delegation to the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe and to the OSCE, I come with motivation to put a certain case.</p>
	<p pid="a.255.0/2">A turf war about who does what in the unfolding Europe&mdash;fighting for the rights of one institution relative to another&mdash;would be pointless. Let us consider the important issues in the debate around a fundamental human rights agency. As my hon. Friend said, we have a long established and well tried system and structures for the delivery of the culture of human rights and for monitoring the way in which those rights are implemented&mdash;through the Strasbourg court, the human rights commissioner of the Council of Europe and bodies such as ECRI and the Venice Commission. That is not to say that there is no role for the European Union in human rights. My hon. Friend made a good case for where there can and ought to be competence for a fundamental rights agency in enshrining those fundamental rights within the European Union, but the agency must not be in competition with bodies that already do such work.</p>
	<p pid="a.255.0/3">I say that not simply to defend the Council of Europe, but because competing agencies will almost inevitably result in confusion and give those who want to avoid the strictures of a proper culture and framework of human rights an opportunity to find a way through the system. My hon. Friend referred to double standards, and such standards would not simply be high in the European Union and possibly lower elsewhere, but multi-tiered. Those who sought to avoid the strictures would be able to move in and out of the different institutions as it suited them, to pursue their own case or to avoid being brought to some accountability for the human rights of the European populations.</p>
	<p pid="a.255.0/4">The Council of Europe already does a remarkably good job. In this Parliament there are many whose experience of the Council of Europe would testify to the fact that the existing institutions have steadily expanded the culture of human rights across the European continent and, indeed, beyond&mdash;to all our advantage. The debate around the fundamental rights agency and the period of reflection between now and the third summit is therefore an opportunity to begin to establish a proper framework for delivering the architecture of the Europe that is already emerging, ensuring that the boundaries between different institutions are well defined.</p>
	<p pid="a.255.0/5">I do not wish to say much more than that, because I am here to support my hon. Friend. I say to the Minister that even though the debate might seem a little arcane, it does matter. It is important that we get these things right. It is important that we are not aggressive, trying to prevent the EU from taking competences in areas where it ought to have them, but that we are clear about what we want of the agency, about the parameters of its operation and about where&mdash;geographically and in terms of content&mdash;and how it can operate. If we establish that, we will profoundly strengthen the culture of human rights in both the EU and wider Europe. We have an opportunity to make what already exists work better and to allow the new agency to work properly. If we get it wrong, we will have a period of confusion, rivalries and competition, which in the end cannot assist anybody, least of all those who have proposed the creation of the agency.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-02-02a.256.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1119" speakername="Michael Moore" colnum="256"  time="009:55:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/vo050202/halltext/50202h01.htm#50202h01_spnew2">
	<p pid="a.256.0/1">It is a pleasure to follow <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1052" name="Tony Lloyd">the hon. Member for Manchester, Central (Tony Lloyd)</phrase>, who possibly revealed the truth about our attitude to the debate. I admit that, when I saw it on the Order Paper last week, I reached for the textbook to brief myself on the proposed agency. I pay tribute to the hon. Gentleman and, most importantly, to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1081" name="Kevin McNamara">the hon. Member for Hull, North (Mr. McNamara)</phrase> for bringing the matter to the House's attention and giving us an opportunity to consider it and hear the Government's views. As both have highlighted, the debate about human rights and how they are monitored and checked is a key area for us in Europe. It is vital that we maximise the impact of our scrutiny and efforts, and do not create competition between different institutions in different parts of Europe.</p>
	<p pid="a.256.0/2">The work of the European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia, which was established in 1997, has been extremely important. The collection of objective, reliable and comparable information in these key areas is of use in Europe as a whole. In principle, we certainly support the intention to expand that role to a broader human rights agency. Fundamental human rights are at the heart of the European Union, and never more so than now. The new charter of fundamental rights in the constitutional treaty is an important development, as is the stipulation that the Union will accede to the European convention on human rights.</p>
	<p pid="a.256.0/3">As has been made clear in the debate, at the heart of all the different discussions and inputs about the new agency is the question of its purpose and scope. The European Union as an entity has long been committed to the principles of liberty, democracy, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, and the rule of law, as set out in treaties past and present, in keeping with the founding principles of the member states themselves. Explicitly, the European Union respects fundamental rights as guaranteed in the European convention on human rights.</p>
	<p pid="a.256.0/4">The key issue as the agency is set up is whether it should monitor the activities of the European Union's institutions or take a broader role in overseeing the compliance of member states with the principles that they are committed to upholding. For our part, we believe that the agency should have a narrow remit, focused on the bodies and institutions of the European Union. That is important in principle and for practical reasons.</p>
	<p pid="a.256.0/5">In principle, it is important that the European Union should respect subsidiarity. Each member state has obligations to respect human rights under the European convention and its monitoring mechanisms, not least through the Council of Europe. There are also clear political channels for member states to deal with each other when concerns emerge about human rights issues in a particular country. We must not underestimate the key role that NGOs such as Amnesty International and others play in that process.</p>
	<p pid="a.256.0/6">In practical terms, the efficiency of any human rights agency surely requires a degree of focus, and its effectiveness will depend on a manageable remit. Regardless of the political issues involved, it is not realistic to envisage a suitably resourced agency taking on responsibilities beyond the scrutiny of the EU institutions. However, we believe that it is important that the body be established. The EU is strong on declarations, but sadly not always great on monitoring or enforcing them, so, within a well defined area, the agency will tackle that deficiency.</p>
	<p pid="a.256.0/7">The Commission's consultation paper raises further issues about the extent of monitoring within the EU framework and asks specifically whether the agency's scope should include a review of compliance with the charter of fundamental rights. We are keen supporters of the charter, and we welcome its inclusion in the new constitutional treaty on the basis that is clearly set out: it is not mandatory or legally binding and that its provisions apply, as is often stated in the treaty,</p>
	<p pid="a.256.0/8" class="indent">&quot;In accordance with national laws.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.256.0/9">That is an important statement, but given the explicit flexibility of interpretation, it would be difficult for any human rights agency to be efficient or effective in monitoring that&mdash;quite apart from difficulties that we might have with the principle of subsidiarity. We believe that the agency should have a role in considering the policies that have been developed in the EU, particularly extending work that is already done on racism and xenophobia and in key areas of policy making such as immigration and asylum.</p>
	<p pid="a.256.0/10">There are critical tasks for the agency to undertake, the most basic of which&mdash;the collection of reliable data&mdash;is already carried out by the monitoring centre. It is vital that as the agency is set up it develops links with civil society and the institutions about which we have already heard this morning. It is fundamental that the agency should not be in competition with the Council of Europe or national institutions that have already been set up for the purpose of overseeing human rights. Therefore, within a limited remit, it should be properly resourced and it should have suitable expertise and, above all, independence.</p>
	<p pid="a.256.0/11">The agency is important. I am pleased that we have had an opportunity to debate it and, along with other hon. Members who have spoken, I hope that in this important year for the Government, as they hold the presidency of the European Union, we will see the agency move from theory to practice.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-02-02a.258.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/749" speakername="Graham Brady" colnum="258"  time="010:03:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/vo050202/halltext/50202h01.htm#50202h01_spnew3">
	<p pid="a.258.0/1"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1081" name="Kevin McNamara">The hon. Member for Hull, North (Mr. McNamara)</phrase> suggested that those of my outlook might want to frighten our children at bedtime with stories of the fundamental rights agency. I assure him that at bedtime I want to calm my children, which I do by reassuring them that we will have a resounding no vote in a referendum on the constitution. If I want to get them straight to sleep, I read them the constitution, which works very quickly; I recommend it to hon. Members who have young children to get to sleep at night.</p>
	<p pid="a.258.0/2">I congratulate the hon. Gentleman on securing the debate. He said that he is pro-constitution, but stressed that he is a Europhile, not a Europoodle. He set out some of his concerns about the proposed agency, and he raised worries about the vagueness of the powers that it may have, the uncertainty of its remit and the opportunities that it will apparently provide for people to use it as a weapon against the European project. He stressed that he is in favour of the constitution, but the irony of his remarks is that nearly all his reservations about the agency apply just as strongly to the constitution as a whole. The vagueness of purpose, the uncertainty over its powers and the endless grey areas that need to be defined by case law in the European Court of Justice apply equally to the constitution, particularly to the charter of fundamental rights.</p>
	<p pid="a.258.0/3">The hon. Gentleman has rightly pointed to those matters with regard to the fundamental rights agency, which whatever else its functions may be, will have a clear remit in the field of interpreting the charter of fundamental rights. I hope that he will reflect on his entirely reasonable, proper concerns about the agency and how it may be brought into being, and perhaps in so doing also reflect on his support hitherto for the constitution. I hope that in due course we will see him joining us in urging people to oppose the whole thing, not just any one aspect of it.</p>
	<p pid="a.258.0/4">Examples abound of how vague and uncertain the charter of fundamental rights is and, therefore, how vague and uncertain the scope and remit of the agency might be. To give just one example, article I-15(3) of the constitutional treaty says:</p>
	<p pid="a.258.0/5" class="indent">&quot;The Union may take initiatives to ensure coordination of Member States' social policies.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.258.0/6">Is that a fundamental right? Apparently, it is. I think that all are comfortable with the work of the European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia, but extending its remit as far as monitoring the co-ordination of member states' social policies would be truly remarkable and would transform something being done to monitor racism, which is clearly valuable and proper, into something much wider. That ought to raise concerns throughout the House. I am sure that the Minister will be very clear that the Government intend not that the agency's scope and remit be that wide, but that it should be clearly defined, limited, and restricted to aspects of EU, not domestic, law. The question, to which I will return, is whether they can deliver on that commitment.</p>
	<p pid="a.258.0/7">Another instance of the uncertainty to which I refer arises in the article of the charter of fundamental rights on the rights of the child, which I have pursued with Ministers through written answers. It is remarkable that Ministers are unable to give assurances about the scope of the provisions in the charter. They say that they believe it applies only to EU law, although if an agency were set up that had the powers to monitor, comment on and perhaps investigate actions that were relevant to the charter of fundamental rights, its work may spread into the domestic law not just of the United Kingdom but of other member states.</p>
	<p pid="a.258.0/8">This debate is welcome and I hope that before we have a referendum we have many more such discussions on the implications of the proposed constitution. The Opposition are unpersuaded of the need to expand the role of the monitoring centre, or to risk undermining its work. That was raised as a concern by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1052" name="Tony Lloyd">the Law Society. The hon. Member for Manchester, Central (Tony Lloyd)</phrase> was concerned that changing the institutions could undermine some of the good work that is done by the monitoring centre and that we could move backwards during the process of changing the structures and institutions of the European Union. The hon. Member for Hull, North also referred to the good work of the Council of Europe.</p>
	<p pid="a.258.0/9">This is a clear example of what we might term institutional mission creep. Institutions gather momentum to reform themselves, expand their role and move into new areas, not necessarily because of the pressing need for them to do so, but simply because they are there and they start to look at what else they might do.</p>
	<p pid="a.258.0/10">We need to ask some fairly fundamental questions about the proposed agency. First, are our domestic agencies failing? Secondly, is the existing monitoring centre performing usefully and effectively? If the answer to the first question is no, our domestic institutions are not failing and are working well, and the answer to the second is yes, the monitoring centre is doing an effective and proper job, the proposal for a new EU-wide agency with new competences needs very close examination.</p>
	<p pid="a.258.0/11">I have a number of other concerns. If the role of the agency is based on the charter of fundamental rights, surely it should not be under construction before ratification of the constitution, which I believe is likely never to happen. Surely Commissioner Frattini was talking nonsense when, in relation to the establishment of the agency, he said:</p>
	<p pid="a.258.0/12" class="indent">&quot;The EU charter of fundamental rights is now part of the EU constitution so we are morally and politically obliged to do this&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.258.0/13">Notwithstanding Mr. Frattini's recent helpfulness to my party in matters of asylum and immigration, his remarks on the agency do not bear scrutiny. Is this not yet another step towards the creation of a binding EU justice and home affairs policy? Will the Minister confirm that it is Her Majesty's Government's view that the agency should concentrate more on human rights than fundamental rights? If so, does that not show the tension between UK attempts to limit the widening of EU competences and the inexorable institutional momentum towards seeking wider powers?</p>
	<p pid="a.258.0/14">Furthermore, do the Government believe that the agency should have a role in applicant countries or in assessing non-EU countries' human rights records? Is it the Government's view that the agency should have a role in assessing action under article 6, which might result in the suspension of the rights of member states in the Council of Ministers?</p>
	<p pid="a.258.0/15">What will the new agency do that is not now done in the UK by the Equal Opportunities Commission, the Commission for Racial Equality and the Disability Rights Commission, which are themselves shortly to be combined into the commission for equality and human rights? Is it not inevitable that the agency will result in duplication in EU institutions, given that the Council of Europe performs some of the important functions, and in member states? Should the agency's remit extend to member states such as the UK or to proposed European Union law only?</p>
	<p pid="a.258.0/16">What estimate has the Minister or the Commission made of the cost of expanding the role and function, and establishing the agency, as opposed to the existing costs of the monitoring centre? What will be the UK's contribution towards those costs? I assume that the intention is that the new agency will be based in Vienna, where the monitoring centre has its headquarters. Can the Minister confirm that that is the case, as I have not seen any clear statement to that effect in any of the documents that I have looked at? Will the agency's function be solely relevant to EU legislation and institutions?</p>
	<p pid="a.258.0/17">In that context, the Luxembourg presidency has spoken of the priority for a draft framework decision on criminal suspects' rights. Do the Government support that? Similarly, the Luxembourg presidency has mentioned a draft framework decision to harmonise penal sanctions for racist offences . Do the Government support that, and, if so, why?</p>
	<p pid="a.258.0/18">Even though organisations such as Amnesty International have supported the proposal in general terms, it is worth noting that Amnesty International did so with some scepticism. It warned that the agency is likely to have a marginal role as member states will not allow it</p>
	<p pid="a.258.0/19" class="indent">&quot;to exercise any real oversight of the respect for human rights in their own countries.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.258.0/20">Is there not a danger that the proposal could fall between two stools? If the Government&mdash;I hope that they will&mdash;assure us that they would seek to limit the agency's role to EU law and EU institutions, is there a danger that it will contribute nothing new and that the whole exercise will turn out to have been pointless? I look forward to hearing the Minister's response to hon. Members' questions. The challenge that faces him is profound: to give clear guarantees and assurances about something that is undefined. He must explain the need for a body which arises from a constitution that is not in force and that in all probability never will be.</p>
	<p pid="a.258.0/21">So far, all who have spoken in this debate have favoured a narrow remit and the preservation of the role of important institutions such as the Council of Europe in protecting human rights. The question is not just whether Her Majesty's Government say that they agree with that narrow remit, but whether they can deliver on that. So far, the indications are that they either cannot or will not stop the institutional creep or the spread of competences in the European Union. If the constitution were ever to be in force, that process would accelerate and be ever harder to control.</p>

I read with interest his report to the latter Committee on the plans to set up a fundamental rights agency for the European Union.</p>
	<p pid="a.261.0/2">We have had an interesting debate and I am pleased that there appears to be little difference between the views of my hon.

Our position was set out in our response to the consultation document issued by the European Union Commission on <phrase class="date" code="">25 October</phrase>. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/749" name="Graham Brady">The hon. Member for Altrincham and Sale, West (Mr. Brady)</phrase> raised a number of issues that I thought were dealt with very clearly in that consultation document.

	<p pid="a.261.1/1">The difficulty in dealing with matters of EU legislation is that the Government make clear their position, but the eventual outcome can be completely different. Will the Minister give an undertaking that the Government would veto any developments that are not entirely in keeping with the commitments given and the views expressed in that consultation?</p>

	<p pid="a.261.2/1">The hon. Gentleman knows the rules of the game; he knows that we are at the beginning of a negotiation and that the outcome on the fundamental rights agency requires unanimity across Europe. He knows that; I know that. We are having a serious discussion about the role of human rights across Europe and the role that a fundamental rights agency would play. The Government do not go into negotiations presupposing their outcomes&mdash;he knows that. Indeed, all Governments have taken that view over the past few years.</p>
	<p pid="a.261.2/2">Fundamentally, like my hon. Friend the Member for Hull, North, the Government welcome the decision of the European Council to extend the remit of the European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia in order to create a fundamental rights agency. Also like my hon. Friend, we believe that the role, remit and powers of the agency deserve careful consideration if it is to add value to the existing protections for human rights in Europe. That said, it is important to point out that, as I said to the hon. Member for Altrincham and Sale, West, we are still at the very early stages of negotiation on the remit and powers of the proposed agency, and this very Adjournment debate contributes to that process.</p>
	<p pid="a.261.2/3">We are interested in hearing what others say. A final decision on the agency will require a unanimous decision by all 25 member states, so our presidency of the European Union later this year will have an important task in leading member states towards an agency that will genuinely add value to Europe. That has been at the nub of this debate. We have heard a range of views, and it might be useful if I gave some background on the proposal.</p>
	<p pid="a.261.2/4">In December 2003, the European Council decided to extend the remit of the monitoring centre to convert it into a human rights agency. In October 2004, the Commission sought member states' views on the agency's field of interest, its remit, its geographical scope, the task that it might be given and its structure and size. The Commission proposed two options, based on two alternative visions of what shape the agency might take. The first option would confine the agency's remit to Community law. As my hon. Friend the Member for Hull, North knows, that option would avoid duplicating the work of other bodies that operate at national and international level, and would complement the existing Community system of protecting and promoting fundamental rights, as my hon. Friend the Member for Manchester, Central was keen to ensure.</p>

	<p pid="a.262.0/1">The House of Commons Library note on this debate quotes a United Kingdom Government representative who insisted that the agency's remit should be confined to EU law. He added:</p>

	<p pid="a.262.0/3">The Minister has welcomed the extension of application to fundamental rights. Does that indicate a change in the Government's policy on this matter? If not, can he give an indication of what that representative meant by what he said?</p>

	<p pid="a.262.1/1">There is no change. I have made the Government's position clear. If the hon. Gentleman allows me, I shall go on to explain that that remit is specific to EU institutions. There is a role for a fundamental rights agency to play; that is what we proposed in the published document on our website, which I encourage him to read.</p>

	<p pid="a.262.2/1">I think that I understand from the Minister's answer that he believes that a role in fundamental rights with regard to EU institutions would be appropriate. I think that he said that. Is he making that distinction: the agency should be relevant to human rights only when it considers things other than EU institutions, but its remit could extend to fundamental rights in reference to EU institutions?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-02-02a.262.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1033" speakername="David Lammy" colnum="262"  time="010:16:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/vo050202/halltext/50202h01.htm#50202h01_spnew9">
	<p pid="a.262.3/1">I did not talk about rights in the way that the hon. Gentleman puts it. I talked about European Community law, and in that sense I do not accept the rather simplistic distinction&mdash;I hope that he will forgive me&mdash;that he draws between fundamental rights and human rights per se. I talked about European Community law, and I shall stick to that position for the purposes of <i>Hansard</i>.</p>
	<p pid="a.262.3/2">The second option proposed by the Commission was for an agency with a more interventionist role and a very wide remit on freedom, democracy and the rule of law, in addition to fundamental rights. We sent our response to the Commission on <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-10">10 January</phrase>. Hon. Members will be pleased to know that it indicated our clear preference for the first option. We expect the Commission to produce a draft regulation in June to establish the agency, following in-depth consultations with all involved in the development of fundamental rights in the EU. Once the draft regulation has been issued, member states will begin negotiations on an agreed final version in consultation with the European Parliament. We hope during our presidency to complete the work necessary to bring the agency into existence, with a view to its commencing its business on <phrase class="date" code="">1 January 2007</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.262.3/3">The UK Government strongly believe that the new agency should focus its attention and energies on ensuring that the institutions of the European Union comply with human rights when they propose new laws and implement existing ones. All member states are required, of course, to observe the European convention on human rights. However, the EU has not yet established an independent body to advise its institutions on how best to take into account the need to respect human rights, and the new agency should fill that distinct gap.</p>
	<p pid="a.262.3/4">Such a role is very important, as our Joint Committee on Human Rights has shown continually in the domestic context. The proposal fits with the Government's intention to establish a commission for equality and human rights that would take forward that promotional role and ensure that our domestic institutions are doing the job of promoting human rights. In the same way, that work can be done within our EU institutions and there is a role to play there.</p>
	<p pid="a.262.3/5">We believe that the agency's primary purpose should be data collection and analysis. In doing that, it would build on the functions of the monitoring centre and expand its reach from anti-discrimination into the wider field of human rights. I say again to the hon. Member for Altrincham and Sale, West that there is now a broad consensus about the key relationship between the fields of equality and discrimination and of human rights. Human rights underpin all those issues, competing and conflicting as they may be, to ensure that that human rights-inclusive goal can meet the aims of all in society who experience a particular discrimination, because of gender, race, sexuality or whatever. That is a broad consensus, and I am surprised to hear that the official Opposition are departing from it.</p>

	<p pid="a.263.0/1">The Minister is&mdash;I am sure inadvertently&mdash;misrepresenting the Opposition's position. I have made no comment against the combination of the various agencies to ensure equality. My question was whether it was not the case that the UK agencies are able to fulfil those functions and do not need to be augmented by an EU agency that might interfere with, or possibly diminish, their role.</p>

Gentleman has said that the official Opposition will support us on the establishment of the commission for equality and human rights when we bring forward that Bill later this Session.

	<p pid="a.264.0/1">Five minutes ago, the Minister said that one of the agency's roles would be to monitor human rights performance in member states. He really needs to be more consistent in his position. Will he now be clear? Will the agency have that monitoring role or not?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-02-02a.264.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1033" speakername="David Lammy" colnum="264"  time="010:16:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/vo050202/halltext/50202h01.htm#50202h01_spnew13">
	<p pid="a.264.1/1">We are entering something of an oxymoron. I talked about data and analysis and that key role for European institutions. I thought that that was patently clear, and I am surprised that the hon. Gentleman has failed to understand the point. There is a key role in Europe, as there is domestically. That is why the Government put forward their proposals a few weeks ago. The agency should operate in areas in which it can best add value, instead of trying to cover the whole range of human rights issues. It should prioritise its work thematically&mdash;my hon. Friend the Member for Hull, North said much on that&mdash;and concentrate its activities where the need for more information and increased awareness of fundamental rights is greatest. However, as all hon. Members except the hon. Member for Altrincham and Sale, West have said this morning, we must avoid duplication.</p>
	<p pid="a.264.1/2">The Government do not see the agency as a body that will examine the policies and practices of individual member states. Such a remit would be inconsistent with the principle of subsidiarity. The agency's focus should be on EU institutions and on member states only when they are implementing EU legislation. We are worried that to give the agency a wide remit would result in substantial duplication and possible conflict with existing agencies. Above all, we do not want unwelcome and inefficient duplication with established or developing institutions in the Council of Europe, the EU or member states, or the creation of another source of authority on the interpretation of human rights in Europe. The Council of Europe and the European Court of Human Rights already give a strong and internationally respected lead on that. To create new sources of authority is likely to lead to confusion, a dilution of authority and, perversely, a weakening of protection for fundamental rights.</p>
	<p pid="a.264.1/3">There is, therefore, an important path to tread and an important line that we must not cross. That is what the Government will seek to do as we enter the negotiations. I hope that that gives my hon. Friends the Members for Hull, North and for Manchester, Central and the hon. Member for Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale the assurance that they seek. We do not believe that the fundamental rights agency should play a policy or operational role in human rights issues in third countries. There might be merit in giving it a role in assisting candidate states to membership of the EU, but that should not replicate the work of other institutions in assessing candidate states. Rather, it should complement existing initiatives, providing an educational and supportive role. The agency might work alongside civil society in candidate countries, including with NGOs, universities and community groups, with a view to ensuring the long-term sustainability of human rights promotion in the country.</p>
	<p pid="a.264.1/4">The monitoring centre was established in 1997 to provide the community and member states</p>
	<p pid="a.264.1/5" class="indent">&quot;with objective, reliable and comparative data at a European level on the phenomenon of racism, xenophobia and anti-Semitism in order to help them when they take measures or formulate courses of action within their respective spheres of competence.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.264.1/6">That is important work, which needs to continue. We must ensure that it is not diluted in any way.</p>
	<p pid="a.264.1/7">The tasks of data and information gathering carried out by the monitoring centre and the transmission of its findings to Community institutions and member states to help influence policy formulation have proved beneficial. For example, the monitoring centre has produced important reports on anti-Semitism and on the way in which the education system in EU states is still failing migrant and minority pupils. It has also highlighted continuing racism in Europe against the Roma community. Indeed, if we get it right, the fundamental rights agency can bring even greater value to all of us across Europe.</p>

	<p pid="a.265.0/1">I support all that my hon. Friend said about the achievements of the monitoring centre.

	<p pid="a.265.1/1">At the heart of what my hon. Friend asked about is the key relationship between the two bodies. We are keen to ensure that the Council of Europe retains its authority. The example of the monitoring centre gives us an established format for establishing that relationship. That is an option that member states will discuss in the negotiations. My hon. Friend will understand that, at this stage, it is difficult to say what the outcomes of those discussions will be, but the Government's position is clear: the existing agencies, including the Council of Europe and its authority, should not be undermined by the new FRA. The structures of the FRA will have to take that fact clearly into account.</p>

	<p pid="a.265.2/1">I am grateful for that carefully phrased answer.</p>
	<p pid="a.265.2/2">I am also concerned because, when the Commission's representative discussed the options in Brussels last week, he did not support the concept of an active role for the Council of Europe on a new management body. That is the attitude of the Commission. In my talks with them, representatives of the Commission have taken a &quot;Sinn Fein&quot; attitude towards the Community and shown a desire to go it alone without any representation from elsewhere. That is why I raised the issue. I urge my hon. Friend and his colleagues in the Government to ensure that the creeping power that the Commission seeks does not emerge.</p>

	<p pid="a.265.3/1">My hon. Friend could not have put that concern any more strongly. It is heard and understood. He knows that if he wants to continue that dialogue, meet the Government and take forward any intelligence nuances that he picks up as the process goes forward, he is welcome to do so.</p>
	<p pid="a.265.3/2">As well as the importance of continuing work on racism and xenophobia, there are likely to be other areas of social or legal policy in which similar data gathering and opinion giving could be of real relevance and value to EU institutions and member states when implementing Community law. For example, data on discrimination, including disability discrimination, may help to provide evidence about the impact of EU policy in the area of employment rights. The agency could usefully gather data on the impact of new EU legislation in the workplace, such as the recent directives prohibiting discrimination on the grounds of religion or sexuality. In addition, the agency could perform a useful role in assessing the extent to which data protection practices ensure respect for private life. So, we believe that the agency should gather data in co-operation with member states, the Council of Europe and civil society, but it will be necessary for the agency to ensure that data gathering does not replicate the work undertaken by the Council of Europe's bodies or by national human rights institutions.</p>
	<p pid="a.265.3/3">The hon. Member for Altrincham and Sale, West asked how much the agency will cost. There is an estimate. The annual budget of the monitoring centre in 2003 amounted to about &pound;4.5 million. The European Community subsidy was the principal revenue of the centre in 2003. The centre also receives financial support from the Austrian authorities. That is the basis on which we go into these discussions.</p>

	<p pid="a.266.0/1">I am grateful to the Minister for telling us the current budget of the monitoring centre.

	<p pid="a.266.1/1">We have an existing budget as an indicator. We go forward at the beginning of negotiations with a clear view, as a Government, of what the outcome should be, but clearly other member states will take a different view. For that reason, it is difficult to suggest today what the eventual budget might be. The hon. Gentleman may wish to inquire further down the line when the matter will be clearer, but, as I have said, the budget of the monitoring centre was &pound;4.5 million in 2003.</p>
	<p pid="a.266.1/2">We recently announced our intention to legislate for a commission for equality and human rights in order to promote equality and human rights together and to challenge discrimination. We think that the fundamental rights agency could replicate much of the work going on domestically. I welcome the position of the official Opposition on having a commission for equality and human rights in this country; that is very helpful. It is for those very reasons, which are now shared by parties across the House, that we welcome a fundamental rights agency. I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Hull, North again on securing this debate.</p>

	Structure Plan (Kent and Medway)
</major-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-02-02a.267.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1342" speakername="Derek Wyatt" colnum="267"  time="011:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/vo050202/halltext/50202h02.htm#50202h02_spnew0">
	<p pid="a.267.1/1">Thank you for granting me an opportunity to discuss the Kent and Medway structure plan, Mr. Deputy Speaker. It is a wholly good thing for a county such as Kent&mdash;I include Medway&mdash;to take stock and to reflect on the needs and aspirations of its people. If we do not have the chance to dream, and to dream big, and to back those dreams with more detailed plans, we are the lesser for it.</p>
	<p pid="a.267.1/2">I shall be interested to hear from my hon. Friend the Minister how the plan was initially conceived. I know of no public meetings, no bus that went up and down the county, and no polls that were taken, but a plan has come from somewhere. It seems that the plan was started back to front: to have an aspiration or some idea of where the county should be in 2021, the people of Kent should have been talked to.</p>
	<p pid="a.267.1/3">Kent and Medway together are the largest local authority area in the country, with a turnover of billions of pounds. It has not been possible to find out the gross domestic product of the county, so may I suggest to the Minister that GDP figures be produced for each county, district and, where possible, constituency? Such figures would help the people of Kent to understand better what we have and, as important, what we need, especially when we are discussing the future needs of the county through the structure plan.</p>
	<p pid="a.267.1/4">We know a great deal about poverty indices and which wards in Kent suffer from neglect. Kent had a necklace of poverty around its coast for much of the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s, but thankfully, under the Labour Government's stewardship, there are signs of green shoots everywhere, not least in my constituency, where the Government are investing more than &pound;300 million. That investment includes &pound;44 million for the northern distributor road in Sittingbourne, &pound;21 million for the Rushenden link road, which we hope will happen soon, and between &pound;40 million and &pound;60 million for the new secondary schools for the Isle of Sheppey. We have already had a &pound;13 million new community hospital and our new &pound;100 million bridge is being built as we speak. Sadly, all that may be at risk, as the Tories have announced the closure of the Thames gateway should they win the next election. In that event, my constituency and many others in Kent would be returned to boom-and-bust economic policies and poverty and deprivation would rear their ugly heads once more.</p>
	<p pid="a.267.1/5">For Kent and Medway to be the best in Britain is no longer enough. The Kent and Medway structure plan needs to have at its core an understanding of the impact of globalisation, as India and China threaten Europe and America's economic hegemony over the coming two decades. The plan needs to demonstrate a better understanding of the impact that formula 1 high-speed broadband will have on our communities. I am not sure that the plan understands either of those profound changes.</p>
	<p pid="a.267.1/6">In 2002, as the founder of the Oxford internet institute I was invited to lecture in north Sweden, in a region called Lulea. It is not possible to go much further north before reaching the Arctic circle, yet Sony Ericsson has its 3G research centre at Lulea university of technology. In 2004, I visited Helsinki to meet the owners of M-real, which owns UK Paper in my constituency, but I took time out, thanks to the UK ambassador to Finland, Matthew Kirk, to visit Nokia and to spend some time with the mayor of Helsinki. Like Singapore, Helsinki is a smart city&mdash;completely online and completely broadband, some of it wireless&mdash;and it is incredible to consider that the whole country is too. Finland has a population of 5 million and is incredibly mountainous, but it is online and broadband. That broadband was paid for by the regional development agency. It is not just any kind of broadband&mdash;not the 512 k on offer from BT, but 2G and 4G. It is more formula 1 than model T.</p>
	<p pid="a.267.1/7">Interestingly, as a result of such provision, the north Baltic area, including Sweden, Finland, Latvia and Lithuania, has the fastest-growing GDP in the whole of Europe. Landlocked, cold and distant by 20th-century standards, it is smart and already connected by 21st-century standards. A history of the 20th century written in the mid-1970s would have failed to include venture capital, the personal computer, the mobile phone and wireless and broadband. The Kent and Medway structure plan must have those values underlying the activities; it does not.</p>
	<p pid="a.267.1/8">If we were debating this issue in February 2021&mdash;when I will be 72&mdash;what could we say about Kent and Medway and the place that we bequeathed to our children and their children? Our duty would have been to provide enough added-value employment opportunities in a greener environment, with new housing that we could be proud of and an infrastructure to match. Only aspects of that are available today in Kent and Medway. We do not have enough added-value or smart employment opportunities, we have been slow on a green audit, few of our housing estates have any architectural value or merit, and our infrastructure, especially our road and rail investments, needs more attention.</p>
	<p pid="a.267.1/9">The greatest centres of added value are to be found in California, mainly in the bay area. Those centres in San Francisco, San Jos&eacute;, silicon valley and Oakland gave birth to the modern economy. They had at their core two great universities&mdash;the university of California at Berkeley and Stanford university, the private university founded by Leland Stanford. Those institutions have embraced globalisation and they have as the heart of their being the biosciences and technological industries that make for smarter communities. The Kent and Medway structure plan needs to have biosciences and technology as the added value for our children's sake.</p>
	<p pid="a.267.1/10">The Kent and Medway structure plan has no vision or understanding of where we need to be as a county. The largest local authority in the country has no world-class university and no plans to create one, or to bring one in from outside, or to initiate a franchising arrangement with an Oxford or a Cambridge&mdash;or a Stanford or a Berkeley, for that matter. How can we have such low expectations?</p>
	<p pid="a.267.1/11">The Kent and Medway structure plan needs to be re-thought. It lacks vision, and the county continues to fail to attract world-class businesses. It is shameful that the whole computer industry passed us by. Motorola chose Swindon, Slough and Basingstoke. Microsoft and Oracle opted for Reading. Apple and Cisco Systems homed in on Stockley park. Hewlett Packard&mdash;now HP&mdash;made a base in Bristol. Intel also settled at Swindon. Not one chose Kent, which is worrying, especially as both Microsoft and Intel continually feature in the top five companies in the world. One of the fallouts from that failure is that Kent has still not made inroads into establishing a venture capital base.</p>
	<p pid="a.267.1/12">In the 1960s, the Robbins report on higher education highlighted the need for new universities. Out of that came the new university of Kent at Canterbury. Since its establishment, it has welcomed the Open university, Christ Church university college, Canterbury, and more recently the university of Greenwich, which used to be Woolwich polytechnic. I know that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1100" name="Robert Marshall-Andrews">my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Medway (Mr. Marshall-Andrews)</phrase> has always wanted a university for Medway, and he has now realised part of his dream.</p>
	<p pid="a.267.1/13">Kent and Greenwich universities have been working together to find common ground. The science of computing has spawned spectacular successes where a university has developed a spin-out science park. Surrey was the first to do so. Surprisingly, Cambridge and Oxford were relatively slow to come to the dancefloor, but their respective parks now make a substantial contribution to the UK's GDP. They have drawn their success from the example of the Ivy league universities in America, especially Stanford, which spawned Hewlett Packard, Yahoo and, more recently, Google.</p>
	<p pid="a.267.1/14">Into this mix, in 1998 and 1999 the Labour Government introduced the regional development agencies. The South East England Development Agency&mdash;SEEDA&mdash;ignored the science park phenomenon, and chose instead to create small hubs or clusters. Perhaps it is too early to judge their success, but I believe that it was a mistake not to link them directly to our universities. Science parks have become the vogue, and in all cases they are attached to universities. Leeds university, Leicester university, Bristol university and Bath university announced science, technology or innovation parks in 2001. Liverpool university and Liverpool John Moores university followed suit last year&mdash;interestingly, funded by the local RDA&mdash;as did London and, more recently, Nottingham and Nottingham Trent, which all announced science parks.</p>
	<p pid="a.267.1/15">The Chancellor of the Exchequer is a science enthusiast and has increased science research funding substantially in the Budget. At the same time, he has ensured that our investment and share option tax breaks are better than those of California. The UK has the fourth-largest GDP in the world; California used to have the fifth, although it has slipped recently. That is why it is important that we follow the California model.</p>
	<p pid="a.267.1/16">According to the league tables of the <i>The Times </i>guide to universities&mdash;notwithstanding the usual reservation about league tables&mdash;Kent is placed 44th in the UK and Greenwich 94th. Kent has disappointed in comparison with other 60s universities: Warwick is fifth, York is seventh, Bath is 11th, Loughborough is 24th and Essex is 27th. However, we have a newcomer in Kent: Imperial college at Wye. Imperial is ranked third overall, after Cambridge and Oxford, and first in technology and science, although it is only a university college of London university. Imperial is hampered by its location in Kensington and it cannot develop a science park except at Ashford. I was the only MP who attended the Kent and Medway discussions on science parks in September. Kent county council said that there was no intention to develop a science park at Ashford&mdash; you couldn't make it up. Kent needs a world-class university, and Imperial is the only game in town.</p>
	<p pid="a.267.1/17">The two major science companies in Kent are Pfizers at Sandwich and Abbott's at Queenborough. We should be working with those two American companies to create an equivalent of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology at Ashford and a collegiate university system for Kent based on the university of California model that would enable university colleges to be sited at Ramsgate and Margate, Dover and Folkestone, Maidstone, Sittingbourne, Tunbridge Wells and Tonbridge, and Dartford along with those already established at Canterbury, Medway and Greenwich. Imperial would, over a 20-year period, subsume both Kent and Greenwich.</p>
	<p pid="a.267.1/18">Does the Kent and Medway structure plan have those two companies at the forefront of the bioscience and technology plans for our grandchildren? It does not. Instead the plan has identified four small science centres, none of which will be world class or an integral part of a university. One was called the Sittingbourne research centre until a name change last year. Now called the Kent science park, it is owned by the LaSalle pension fund on behalf of Mars and it wants to double its footprint. It wants to build an additional 10,000 homes on top of the 10,000 announced last week by the Government, and it wants a southern ring road to a new motorway junction of the M2. However, according to an anonymous phone call that I received last Friday, it will allegedly enrich two landowners to the tune of &pound;80 million.</p>
	<p pid="a.267.1/19">Can the Minister confirm that if that wretched scheme were to see the light of day the Government would introduce a substantial windfall tax on gains from farming land that is given planning permission for housing? In that way the cost of housing would be reduced, which would greatly help our younger families and our key workers who are frozen out of the property market in Kent. Above all else it is clear that the Kent and Medway structure plan has no real understanding of the place of biosciences and technology. If the plan is adopted our children and their children will be the poorer.</p>
	<p pid="a.267.1/20">Let me add a few comments about the housing needs for Kent and the lack of detailed infrastructure modelling, although Kent county council's &quot;Kent&mdash;What Price Growth?&quot; is more than a stab in the right direction. I have raised the matter continually over the past eight years and even proposed a ten-minute Bill on the subject. Incidentally, I wonder when the Government will respond to Kent county council's request for &pound;9.6 billion worth of infrastructure over the next 30 years.</p>
	<p pid="a.267.1/21">Wherever I look in my constituency, the new build housing has not had any section 106 gains. At Warden Bay we were promised a primary school; it never happened. Guess what? We were promised another on the Meads estate at Bobbing; it never happened either. Now I learn that the large Thistle Hill estate being built on the Isle of Sheppey will not after all have a primary school. Three different developers have reached a section 106 agreement with Kent county council, but have walked away smiling. They have lined their shareholders' pockets, but they have not improved the quality of life of my constituents.</p>
	<p pid="a.267.1/22">My constituency needs quality housing of every sort. We are desperate for housing estates in the great 19th century traditions of New Earswick and Port Sunlight, not the appallingly designed new rabbit hutch estates that currently adorn the north Kent coast. We need at least 3,000 houses for our young couples, our older people and our key workers. As Sittingbourne and Sheppey's economic base grows, we will need more housing to attract businesses.</p>
	<p pid="a.267.1/23">The structure plan is weak on how we build, side by side, both the hardware of the infrastructure and the software, by which I mean our people. We will have a shortage of water in the next five years. Without wind power from the Thames, Kent will not have enough power. Where do we get more carpenters, builders and painters from? Where is the skills audit in the plan and where are the plans to build co-operation between our secondary schools and our further education colleges? I could say more, but I know that my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Medway wishes to add something and so I will stop there.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-02-02a.271.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1100" speakername="Robert Marshall-Andrews" colnum="271"  time="011:13:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/vo050202/halltext/50202h02.htm#50202h02_spnew1">
	<p pid="a.271.0/1">I understand your semaphore perfectly, Mr. Deputy Speaker. I will indeed be brief, as we want to hear from the Minister on this important topic. I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1342" name="Derek Wyatt">my good and hon. Friend the Member for Sittingbourne and Sheppey (Mr. Wyatt)</phrase> on securing the debate, which he opened with a characteristically articulate and informed speech. He has been an outstanding Member of Parliament for Sittingbourne and Sheppey. He was rewarded by a massive increase in his vote in 2001. I do not suggest that those who did not receive massive increases in their vote are not outstanding Members of Parliament, but some of us take rather longer to mature than others.</p>
	<p pid="a.271.0/2">The debate gives me the opportunity to indulge in the rare, unalloyed, indeed practically unendurable, pleasure of congratulating the Government in very large measure on what they have achieved in terms of structure within my constituency during the last eight years. When I first became the Member of Parliament for Medway I was asked what I expected from my stewardship. After a certain amount of thought I replied that two things seemed to be needed more than any other to change the structural basis of the Medway towns. The first was a university: ours is the largest conurbation in Europe without its own university. The second was the development of the Rochester and Chatham riverside&mdash;a massive area of post-industrial dereliction caused by the death of the dockyard 17 years ago. I am delighted to say that although neither has been completed, both developments are now inevitable, due in no small measure to the Government's intervention.</p>
	<p pid="a.271.0/3">Some &pound;15 million has been given towards a new university based in the Medway towns&mdash;an outstanding contribution, which has made that development possible. Within 10 years we will have 10,000 students, which will change and revolutionise the intellectual and employment face of the towns in that part of Kent. Some &pound;26 million has been granted by the Government to underpin the development of the Rochester riverside on a site for which the expression &quot;brownfield site&quot; might have been newly minted. That, too, will transform my constituency. There is no word for gratitude in politics, but there is a word for achievement, and that is a considerable achievement, on which I congratulate the Government.</p>
	<p pid="a.271.0/4">I share my hon. Friend's reservations about the present structure plan. In my own constituency, I am concerned about the silence that radiates around development within the precious green areas that we have and that we must maintain. When I first arrived in my constituency, it had the most unenviable reputation&mdash;possibly in the country, and certainly in the south-east&mdash;for overdevelopment. That was probably linked to the fact that many of its councillors at the time were either developers or were linked to the development world. As a result, the Medway towns suffer in no small measure from a serious absence of green space, both within the towns and outside them. I hope that the Minister will take that into account when he responds to our points on structure and infrastructure in the Medway towns. I hope that he will say that the time has come to call a halt to development within and outside the towns.</p>
	<p pid="a.271.0/5">It is an unhappy fact that the threats to the green space in my constituency come from the council, which is now resurrected not quite in its old aegis but in something like it. Names such as Watts Meadow and Copperfields will mean little to you, Mr. Deputy Speaker, but they mean a great deal to my constituents. Those areas are currently threatened by a council that is remorselessly and recklessly selling off its own green space within the Medway towns as part of what it perceives to be a structural plan which is, in fact, no plan at all.</p>
	<p pid="a.271.0/6">I say this to the Minister and I hope that he will take it on board. The Hoo peninsula, which is part of my constituency, is a rare and wonderful green space, which I enjoy as much as any of my constituents. I am sure that you, Mr. Deputy Speaker, because I know your predilections and activities, would also enjoy it very much were you able to visit. If you ever manage to visit my constituency, I should be delighted to introduce you to it.</p>
	<p pid="a.271.0/7">We have fought battles over that land&mdash;for example, we successfully fought off incinerators. There is much talk now about development on the Hoo peninsula but, as far as I know, that is wholly false. There is nothing in any plan that I have seen&mdash;certainly not in one derived from the Government&mdash;that threatens development on the Hoo peninsula over and above the local plan that was agreed many years ago. I hope that that will continue to be the case, but I serve notice now, not simply on the Government and on local government, but on the developers who for many years have looked upon that area of Kent with salivation, that any attempt to concrete over or build on that wonderful and wild area will be resisted in precisely the same way in which my constituents and I made common cause to resist Cliffe airport, now of unblessed memory.</p>
	<p pid="a.271.0/8">There is much on which to congratulate the Government. There has been a great deal of expenditure, partly leveraged from Government by my colleagues in the Medway towns and myself. Sometimes it has been said, rather unkindly, that the more unpopular one becomes with one's Government, the more money they give for development in one's own constituency. I do not recommend that as a way of obtaining money from the Government, but it can be argued and might be true in my case.</p>
	<p pid="a.271.0/9">I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Minister and my hon. Friend the Member for Sittingbourne and Sheppey for allowing me to make this short contribution. I congratulate my hon. Friend again on obtaining a debate on one of the most important issues facing the south-east.</p>

	<p pid="a.273.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1342" name="Derek Wyatt">my hon. Friend the Member for Sittingbourne and Sheppey (Mr. Wyatt)</phrase> on securing this debate on the Kent and Medway structure plan. He is well known as a keen advocate of his constituency and for bringing issues such as these to the attention of the House.</p>
	<p pid="a.273.0/2">Given events that may or may not happen in a couple of months' time, I am not surprised by the unusual display of gratitude, recognition and loyalty to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1100" name="Robert Marshall-Andrews">the Government by my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Medway (Mr. Marshall-Andrews)</phrase>. The Government must be congratulated on delivering benefits to the hard-working families of Medway, and indeed Sittingbourne and Sheppey, despite events elsewhere.</p>
	<p pid="a.273.0/3">My hon. Friend mentioned some specific cases. He will appreciate that I cannot comment on the merits of individual planning cases because of the Secretary of State's appellate responsibilities. If he will forgive me, I will therefore concentrate on the broader planning issues.</p>
	<p pid="a.273.0/4">As I am sure my hon. Friend is aware, Kent county council, in partnership with Medway unitary authority, is preparing a new structure plan to cover the period 2001 to 2021, which has been the subject of an examination in public held by an independent panel. I understand that the two strategic planning authorities are still awaiting the panel's report. The authorities decided to continue with a new structure plan, although it will be superseded by the new south-east plan when that is adopted in 2007. In the meantime, local planning authorities in Kent will have to have regard to the structure plan, once it is adopted and until the south-east plan is in place, in preparing their local development frameworks.</p>
	<p pid="a.273.0/5">My hon. Friend opened his remarks by voicing some concerns about consultation. Let me emphasise that the Kent and Medway structure plan was published as a deposit plan in September 2003. That was preceded by extensive pre-deposit consultation, including the publication in March 2002 of a consultation document entitled &quot;Mapping out the future: Kent and Medway Structure Plan&mdash;Future Policy Directions&quot;, which was accompanied by publicity and public meetings in every district and borough. All the Kent Members of Parliament were consulted directly at this stage and on the deposit plan in 2003. The &quot;Future Policy Directions&quot; document specifically referred to the development of innovation hubs and clusters and the important links between higher education and research, about which my hon. Friend spoke so eloquently. A number of locations were discussed in this regard, including the Sittingbourne research centre, now the Kent science park. I shall come back to that later.</p>
	<p pid="a.273.0/6">My hon. Friend mentioned issues relating to infrastructure, water and so on. It is important to put on the record one point about water. During the consultation, Kent and Medway councils received no representations from the Environment Agency about any insurmountable constraints to development in Swale from a water supply perspective. Evidence to the examination in public confirmed that view, conditional on Kent and Medway structure plan quantities not being exceeded. Decisions by the councils arising from the panel report should be subject to similar consultation processes.</p>
	<p pid="a.273.0/7">On the need for homes for younger people, older people and key workers in the area, I am aware that the proposed housing numbers in the structure plan for the county as a whole show no significant increase over the previous plan, although there are two growth areas in the county. Indeed, representatives of the Government office for the south-east pointed that out to the examination in public in September last year and argued for higher numbers, in line with the Government's commitment to address the severe housing shortage in the south-east. We await the outcome of that examination in public. The panel is due to report early this year. I regret that it would be inappropriate for me to comment further on the details of the plan in advance of the report.</p>
	<p pid="a.273.0/8">The next formal steps in progressing the Kent and Medway structure plan will take place when Kent and Medway councils consider the panel recommendations and propose modifications arising from those recommendations. The proposed modifications will, in turn, be subject to public consultation. Kent and Medway hope to adopt the plan by the end of 2005. I believe that my hon. Friend has made the representations that he spoke about this morning directly to the process. When the modifications are proposed, he will get another bite at the cherry and will be able to re-emphasise his concerns if the modifications do not address them.</p>
	<p pid="a.273.0/9">There is also a statutory planning process to determine what the revised regional and sub-regional growth levels should be. At this stage, the South East England regional assembly is responsible for examining alternative spatial options as part of the preparation of the new south-east plan, which will include housing figures for districts in Kent. The regional assembly launched a public consultation on the matter on <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-24">24 January</phrase>. I cannot comment at this stage, because my comments would pre-empt the outcome of the consultation and the public inquiry that will follow.</p>
	<p pid="a.273.0/10">My hon. Friend rightly raised concerns about the infrastructure that will support development. Swale Forward is the local partnership that ensures that the area's infrastructure priorities are delivered effectively. It is co-ordinating a &pound;26 million programme that is supported by the sustainable communities fund. Swale Forward endeavours to ensure that the aims and objectives of its policies and programmes make the appropriate links with other relevant strategies, such as Swale's infrastructure needs, the Swale local plan, the Kent and Medway structure plan and the regional economic strategy.</p>
	<p pid="a.273.0/11">It is the role of Swale Forward to assess the infrastructure needs of the borough in delivering the required growth and regeneration. It is primarily the responsibility of Swale borough council to ensure, through the local plan and other strategies and plans, that sufficient infrastructure is provided to support agreed levels of housing growth. I am glad that my hon. Friend has put on record some of those developments. Two road schemes are under way&mdash;the second Swale crossing and the Sittingbourne northern relief road. Funding from section 106 agreements will support provision of other infrastructure requirements, such as health and education facilities and community needs. It is good to see that a new secondary school has been allocated for Sittingbourne, as well as the secondary school for Sheppey. A new community hospital has also been allocated.</p>
	<p pid="a.273.0/12">I share my hon. Friend's concerns about the Conservatives' decision to abolish the Thames gateway. That decision will have a massive effect in removing the opportunities for infrastructure development. My hon. Friend is right to point that out. Many of us were taken aback at the Opposition's decision to adopt that policy, which makes no sense. That decision does not fit easily with the simultaneous call of the Conservatives on Kent county council for &pound;9.6 billion of infrastructure regeneration cash. It seems to me that the local and the national are not working easily together.</p>
	<p pid="a.273.0/13">My hon. Friend mentioned issues around gains from developing land. I emphasise that, in her recent review of housing supply, Kate Barker recommended that section 106 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990, as amended, which provided for planning gain contributions relating to increased development value resulting directly from the grant of planning permission, be reviewed to provide more certainty and simplicity. I confirm that the Government are considering the option of a planning gain supplement that would, if introduced, address some of the issues that my hon. Friend raised. That debate is under way and I am grateful for his contribution. We will draw it to the attention of relevant Ministers.</p>
	<p pid="a.273.0/14">My hon. Friend raised a number of key points about the importance of the university development and the way that the structure plan creates the conditions for attracting bioscience and technology investment. I cannot comment on the plan because of my position in the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister. I draw his attention to parts of the plan that refer specifically to that development, not least to Pfizer, which is one of the companies that he mentioned. The plan identifies Pfizer as a company that may grow and respond to some of the concerns that my hon. Friend raised. However, it is up to us to see what the panel says and consider whether the modifications and developments provide solutions to the problems that he is concerned about.</p>
	<p pid="a.273.0/15">While I understand my hon. Friend's concerns about the make-up of the Kent science park, and the issues that he raised about the highway network, I point out that both Kent county council and Swale borough council support the expansion of that site as a science park.</p>

	Hazardous Waste
</major-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-02-02a.276.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1214" speakername="Jonathan Sayeed" colnum="276"  time="014:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/vo050202/halltext/50202h03.htm#50202h03_spnew0">
	<p pid="a.276.1/1">When I resigned my post as a shadow Environment Minister, the Government's waste and environment policy was a shambles, and 18 months later little has changed. The Government have promised to review their waste strategy this year. The review must consider the current problems with hazardous waste disposal that have arisen following the implementation of European directives. Unless the Minister acknowledges that the problems exist and says how they will be overcome, they are set to continue.</p>
	<p pid="a.276.1/2">We know that 5.2 million tonnes of hazardous waste is produced annually, a figure that increases 8 per cent. year on year. It must be disposed of safely and efficiently, and it must be our priority to ensure that the infrastructure exists to achieve that. Although environmentally sustainable methods of disposal should be explored and strongly encouraged, we cannot ignore the reality that 40 per cent. of hazardous waste is still sent to landfill. The implementation of the European landfill directive, the factor that continues to have the biggest impact on hazardous waste disposal, should be the focus of our debate today.</p>
	<p pid="a.276.1/3">I want to examine the Government's preparation for banning the co-disposal of hazardous and non-hazardous waste in landfill sites, following the directive implemented on <phrase class="date" code="2004-07-16">16 July 2004</phrase>. I believe that their approach had four flaws, relating to regulation, awareness, enforcement and communication, which continue to characterise their overall approach to hazardous waste.</p>
	<p pid="a.276.1/4">First, the Government did not provide the regulation required by the waste management industry to invest in the new hazardous waste treatment infrastructure demanded by the directive. Regulations bringing into United Kingdom law the waste acceptance criteria&mdash;WAC&mdash;that regulate pre-treatment standards passed through Parliament only in June 2004, one year before they came into force. Strict regulation of the waste disposal industry requires detailed legal guidance, which in turn can be achieved only with accurately targeted investment.</p>
	<p pid="a.276.1/5">Waste management companies, however, had only one year in which to identify potential markets, raise finance, gain planning consents, obtain environmental permits, construct facilities and conduct appropriate testing before finally accepting and treating hazardous waste. As it is a commercial decision whether to apply for a licence to treat hazardous waste and the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs cannot force companies to do so, the Department should have done everything it could to encourage investors, or should at least have made it feasible for companies to make the necessary commercial decisions to obtain a licence. However, far from leading the way, the Government, through their indecision, have created uncertainty and confusion.</p>
	<p pid="a.276.1/6">Secondly, DEFRA's lack of forward planning is underpinned by a lack of awareness and understanding of patterns and volumes of hazardous waste flows. Only six weeks before the ban on co-disposal, the hazardous waste forum's projections showed huge variations between best and worst-case scenarios: shortfall estimates varied between 350,000 tonnes in the interim year and, in the worst case, 2.9 million tonnes, an eightfold difference. However, that is not all. No account is taken of seasonal variations in hazardous waste levels as a result of fluctuations in the amount of contaminated soil produced by the demolition and construction industry. That problem is set to intensify as more brownfield sites are redeveloped.</p>
	<p pid="a.276.1/7">Thirdly, the enforcement of regulations has been flawed; their implementation is neither stringent nor consistent. Non-compliance tends to snowball. The more people get away with the illegal disposal of hazardous waste, the more the business case for waste management facilities is undermined. Fly-tipping will become an ever more attractive option if waste disposal costs increase while penalties and enforcement remain static. An Environment Agency report stated that people fly-tip because it costs &quot;money and time&quot; to dispose of waste properly. That is a statement of the blindingly obvious. As the cost and trouble of proper waste management increase, so will the incidence of illegal disposal.</p>
	<p pid="a.276.1/8">Will the Government accept the recommendation of the Environmental Audit Committee that the fines imposed should better reflect the seriousness of the environmental crime and act as a greater deterrent and punishment? Will the Environment Agency be directed by the Government so that we do not get what we did with the end-of-life vehicles directive? We do not want inadequately trained inspectors focusing on repeat visits to those tackling the task satisfactorily, but rather a concentration on the real rogues, who may not even be registered as producing hazardous waste. If matters continue as they are, all we will have is another Child Support Agency-type fiasco, where providing parents were pursued and the rogues ignored.</p>
	<p pid="a.276.1/9">Fourthly, communication by the Government and the Environment Agency with waste producers and managers has been inadequate. The Federation of Small Businesses has identified &quot;an information vacuum&quot; among many of its members. A survey by the Environment Agency itself revealed that, in 2003, 76 per cent. of businesses were unaware of their legal duty of care to ensure that waste was managed lawfully. I would like assurances from the Minister as to the strategies in place to make businesses aware of their duties resulting from new legislation.</p>
	<p pid="a.276.1/10">Subsequent to the implementation of the landfill directive, what has been the effect of the prior inaction and lack of forward planning? How has it impacted on both the hazardous waste industry and the environment? The immediate effect was to create a substantial shortfall in the capacity of the industry to treat hazardous waste. Only 11 merchant landfill sites are operational and, of these, only five can accept a wide range of hazardous waste streams. Infrastructure exists to dispose of only 1 million tonnes of hazardous waste annually, but 5 million tonnes are produced every year. This is compounded by the uneven distribution of commercial sites, which are concentrated in the north-east and north-west of the United Kingdom, while no sites able to deal with hazardous waste are located in Greater London. Hazardous waste must now be transported greater distances, which is costly, increases bureaucracy and risk, raises further capacity issues&mdash;as transportation must be with a registered carrier&mdash;and makes neither environmental nor economic sense.</p>
	<p pid="a.276.1/11">Economic factors are rarely the best drivers of environmental policy as they tend towards short-term myopia, while many environmental benefits are not financially quantifiable. However, cost must be considered when it has a direct impact on the level of compliance. Implementing the landfill directive has resulted in a threefold increase in the cost of landfill and a potential further increase after July. The &quot;polluter pays&quot; principle is probably the best way to operate environmental policy, but the Government must think realistically rather than adhering to that dogmatically. Costs must not be increased unfairly due to poor policy implementation and, ultimately, they must not discourage the safe disposal of hazardous waste.</p>
	<p pid="a.276.1/12">If enforced to the letter, the &quot;polluter pays&quot; principle will hit small and medium-sized companies hardest. Those with the tightest margins may begin to cheat, misclassifying their waste, disposing of it illegally or hiring unregulated, illegal contractors. Subsequent costs to society, regardless of the physical danger, could then outweigh the income garnered from making these smaller hazardous waste producers pay. Possibly, a fairer and more effective alternative would be for the Government to consider a threshold whereby small amounts of hazardous waste can be disposed of safely, at lower cost, and an incremental charge imposed thereafter.</p>
	<p pid="a.276.1/13">Hazardous waste disposal problems have not yet been resolved. The additional capacity required due to the landfill directive is not forecast to be met until 2009. Other key challenges have not even begun to be tackled. I am sorry to say that the Government seem to have learned nothing from implementing the landfill directive.</p>
	<p pid="a.276.1/14">The Government must rethink how they implement European directives. They must ensure proper parliamentary scrutiny of draft directives so that there is awareness and action well in advance of implementation, and only after industry-wide consultation. The main problem is not the directives, but the Government's approach to implementation, which has caused the United Kingdom to develop a far less comprehensive hazardous waste-treatment infrastructure than other member states have developed and has compounded their already weak performance on waste.</p>
	<p pid="a.276.1/15">The Government's approach is still characterised by the same four flaws. There are still no regulations and guidance from the Environment Agency to transpose hazardous waste regulations or to produce the WAC for monolithic waste. DEFRA has not allocated sufficient resources to communicate responsibilities to waste producers or for resource enforcement: the &pound;2 million available through the business resource efficiency and waste programme is inadequate.</p>
	<p pid="a.276.1/16">Lack of awareness continues, as there are no real-time data on waste flows, and DEFRA is only now developing a waste data strategy. In this interim year between the end of co-disposal and the enforcement of WAC, it is timely to assess the impact of the landfill directive on the Government's waste strategy and to press for the end to the lack of regulation, of information and of enforcement and the mis-communication that has been a characteristic so far. The current strategy is wasteful and is certain to prove hazardous to our environment.</p>

	<p pid="a.279.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1214" name="Jonathan Sayeed">my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Bedfordshire (Mr. Sayeed)</phrase> on securing the debate. I know that he spends a great deal of time worrying about the subject, which has always been high on his list of priorities, and he is doing us all a favour by bringing it to the attention of the Chamber today.</p>
	<p pid="a.279.0/2">At the end of the day, this is not a political issue in the party political sense of the word. Whatever the party we belong to, we know what we are trying to achieve. The quarrel is about how we achieve that and the administration of the policy. Waste, whether non-hazardous or hazardous, is a fact of life. It is part of our society, and given society's thunderous momentum, it is inevitable. The question is how we deal with it.</p>
	<p pid="a.279.0/3">The Government have good intentions, which I do not criticise. They are making a genuine effort, but there is a shortfall between what they say they want to achieve, their method, and what they actually achieve. In true Blairite style, they have the big vision and all the ideas, and local concerns are dealt with, but are we achieving the results and producing the initiatives that we need? As someone who represents a south London constituency, I know that waste is a very serious issue. London does not have enough waste facilities. Waste has to be taken out of London, and the Government do not have the courage to deal with the issue of incineration.</p>
	<p pid="a.279.0/4">A small illustration of the problem is the local municipal tip in south Croydon, which is being shut. It is open for only three days a week at a time when we need more tips and outlets. My hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Bedfordshire mentioned fly-tipping, and one of the problems is that small businesses must pay to use these tips. I might be off message so far as my party is concerned, but I believe that there should be no charge for municipal tips, because small businesses, deterred by the fact that they have to pay to use them, are engaging in increased fly-tipping. It is a serious problem in south London, and, in that regard, I am very critical of my local authority, which has not addressed the issue.</p>
	<p pid="a.279.0/5">Recycling is to be encouraged; it is very welcome. The problem is that it is weight based, so local authorities, in order to meet their worthy targets, are encouraging people to recycle things that need not be recycled&mdash;too much green waste, but not enough of the hazardous substances that ought to be recycled. There is not enough plastic being recycled, because it is not heavy. If there is a weight-based target for recycling, plastic, which is not only light but voluminous&mdash;a plastic bottle takes up a lot of space but not much weight&mdash;is not attractive to local authorities.</p>

	<p pid="a.279.1/1">Is my hon. Friend aware that, certainly two years ago, our party had a policy that involved setting a ratio between weight and volume? I think that it was 1 kg to 3 cu m. If the Government had adopted that, as was pressed on the now Minister for the Environment and Agri-environment, there would have been a greater chance of plastic and other light but voluminous materials being recycled.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-02-02a.280.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1147" speakername="Richard Ottaway" colnum="280"  time="014:12:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/vo050202/halltext/50202h03.htm#50202h03_spnew3">
	<p pid="a.280.0/1">My hon. Friend is absolutely right. In fact, he pre-empts my next remark, which is that that is the direction in which we ought to be going. Whether there should be a multiplier effect or a tariff of some sort to encourage local authorities to recycle more plastic, I do not know, but that is the way to go. I hope that the Minister who, I know, takes these matters seriously, will respond to that point.</p>
	<p pid="a.280.0/2">I come to the specific matter of hazardous waste. It is a tremendous problem. It is dealt with in a manner that was excellently described by my hon. Friend, and the rules of the game have changed. There are businesses that are prepared to dispose of hazardous waste commercially, meaning that when they invest, they want to make sure that their money is secure and they want to see a profit from it. However, the Government have not encouraged that process. As the deadline approached, investors complained that they had had inadequate detail from the Government about the criteria for the establishment of a hazardous waste disposal centre. They were prepared to invest, but they were not prepared to do so unless they knew what the criteria were&mdash;what the Government wanted from them. They wanted to know what the bottom line would be.</p>
	<p pid="a.280.0/3">This is the first time that the private sector has been asked to invest big time in waste disposal; we are talking about serious money. The Government have to take seriously the fact that businesses want to have every last t crossed and i dotted before they will invest. It should come as no surprise that there was, and still is, a problem over the disposal of hazardous waste, because there is not enough private sector investment&mdash;the Government are not doing enough to attract it. The lack of detail is critical.</p>
	<p pid="a.280.0/4">I said in opening that the Government are on the right track, but are not implementing the policy in the right way. This illustrates my point. Something can be done. It is well within our ability to deal with hazardous waste in a way that is acceptable to everybody, but the Government have not grasped the nettle, and they are not giving us enough detail. That is my central point to the Minister, and I hope that he will deal with it when he responds.</p>

	<p pid="a.280.3/1">I am grateful for that intervention, which makes it clear that this occasion is, indeed, unique. I am afraid, however, that that has nothing to do with the subject in hand, to which I shall now turn.</p>
	<p pid="a.280.3/2">I want exclusively to discuss the disposal of hazardous waste, because I have a constituency interest in the issue. As the Minister for the Environment and Agri-environment knows, I have a cement works in my constituency; it is operated by Lafarge and its operation has caused a lot of difficulty locally. That bears directly on the subject of hazardous waste.</p>
	<p pid="a.280.3/3">To a large extent, what we are really talking about today is the EU landfill directive, although it has not been mentioned as such. None the less, much of the pressure on us when it comes to the disposal of hazardous waste stems from the Government's need to be extremely careful&mdash;and rightfully so&mdash;about what we tip into holes in the ground. We would all agree that it is right for them to be careful about that, but my concern, which relates directly to what is happening at the Westbury cement works, is about the alternative. The worry in my constituency is that, instead of stuff being put into a hole in the ground, it is being put up a chimney without proper environmental controls.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-02-02a.281.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1267" speakername="Mark Tami" colnum="281"  time="014:20:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/vo050202/halltext/50202h03.htm#50202h03_spnew7">
	<p pid="a.281.0/1">Does the hon. Gentleman agree that some people see incineration as a panacea or a magic cure for the problem of waste, and particularly hazardous waste? They think that if we somehow keep burning this stuff, there will not be a problem any more. What we should be asking ourselves is why we produce so much of this stuff in the first place.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-02-02a.281.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1132" speakername="Andrew Murrison" colnum="281"  time="014:20:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/vo050202/halltext/50202h03.htm#50202h03_spnew8">
	<p pid="a.281.1/1">The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right. Of course, it is tempting to tip things into a hole in the ground or to put them up a chimney without thinking how best to deal with them. The best approach would be not to create them in the first place, or to recycle them in a way that did not have an environmental impact. Tyres, for example, can be recycled in a very environmentally friendly way because they can be turned into road surfaces. That happens extensively in America, but very little in this country. It does not happen here, I believe, because we are under an imperative to meet the targets generated by the EU landfill directive, and one of the only ways to do that in a reasonable time is to dispose of them in cement kilns, rather than develop the technology necessary to turn them into road surfaces, as happens in the States.</p>
	<p pid="a.281.1/2">The cement industry is all too willing to oblige the Government by helping to dispose of hazardous waste; it has certainly been disposing of tyres for some time, and it is now trying to do the same with recycled liquid fuel, which is an unholy concoction of all manner of poisonous substances that can be used as an alternative to fossil fuels in firing cement kilns. Of course, the cement industry is not necessarily altruistic, and it seeks, quite legitimately, to obtain a financial gain from its operations. My concern is that at least part of that gain should be used to ensure that the best available techniques are employed to dispose of hazardous substances, and I am not entirely clear that the industry has hoisted that on board sufficiently. Of course, we can ultimately filter just about anything out of the stack at a cement works, but there is a marginal utility in so doing, and it becomes increasingly expensive as fewer contaminants are released.</p>
	<p pid="a.281.1/3">Nobody will insist that every last particulate is removed from the material coming out of the top of a cement kiln. Nevertheless, we must ensure that at least some of the profits that I am convinced the cement industry is making from the disposal of hazardous waste are channelled back into best-available technique so that we at least reduce the amount of pollutants leaving cement works such as the one in Westbury. I am not sure that that is happening.</p>
	<p pid="a.281.1/4">The cement industry put pressure on the Environment Agency to reduce the standard for emissions from cement works, and that has happened. The standards for dedicated incinerators are much more rigid than those for cement works. That is extremely worrying. The Minister for the Environment and Agri-environment has given all sorts of sophisticated reasons as to why there should be a difference&mdash;for example, the temperature at which cement kilns operate&mdash;but few of them are convincing. I know from my chemistry days that halogens cling quite nicely to particulates. Both are produced in ample quantity if recycled liquid fuel is burnt. The worry is that the temperature will not affect them and that many particles full of halogens, which are potentially hazardous to human health, will exit the stack at Westbury. The case has not been made by the Environment Agency or the cement industry that what they propose is entirely safe. We should operate under the precautionary principle in this matter, but I do not believe that we are being precautionary enough.</p>

	<p pid="a.282.0/1">Does the hon. Gentleman agree that what matters to his constituents and anyone else is the quality of the emissions and the air that they breathe. It is of little consequence to people who suffer&mdash;if that is the right word&mdash;the emissions whether they come from a cement kiln or an incinerator. Therefore, should not the Environment Agency's concern be the standardisation of emissions rather than determining what process generates them?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-02-02a.282.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1132" speakername="Andrew Murrison" colnum="282"  time="014:20:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/vo050202/halltext/50202h03.htm#50202h03_spnew10">
	<p pid="a.282.1/1">I entirely agree with the hon. Gentleman. He is absolutely right. We need standardisation of emissions from incinerators, cement works and so on. The risk is that cement works will become quick and dirty incinerators. The Government are very reluctant&mdash;understandably so&mdash;to propose purpose-built incinerators with clearly understood standards. I fear that they consider cement works an easy, back-door way of incinerating material that offers the best prospect for rapidly satisfying their targets. The Government have leapt at this option. They have grabbed at it as an opportunity to achieve their targets in a way that is not too painful and that minimises the number of local inquiries that would undoubtedly be needed if they were to propose purpose-built incinerators.</p>
	<p pid="a.282.1/2">My constituents and those who live downwind of the cement works at Westbury are not at all happy with that, as it is all being done on the back of their health. I am keen to impress upon people who ask me that, in my view, the health effects of what goes on at Westbury are likely to be very small indeed, if they exist at all. It is important to say that and to put the matter into context. Nobody should be shroud waving.</p>
	<p pid="a.282.1/3">If we believe in the precautionary principle, however, we must do much more to monitor what is happening at sites such as the Westbury cement works and not be put off with blandishments from organisations such as the Environment Agency, which has not exactly covered itself with glory in this matter. That is why my district council is absolutely right to set up an independent committee to review the matter on behalf of the local people, who have lost all confidence in the agency. Expert advice is needed to reassure them that what is happening at Westbury is reasonable and will not damage their health.</p>
	<p pid="a.282.1/4">The issue is even more serious because of the amendment to the substitute fuels protocol, which I believe is a sleight of hand. It will re-badge waste as fuel. It will allow material to be classified as a fuel provided that more energy is generated by its burning than is needed for its burning. In other words, if we generate one calorie more by burning a substance, we can reclassify it as a fuel. That has a particularly insidious significance, because it would then allow material that is not allowed to be imported to the UK to be imported as a potential fuel. It opens up the door to the possible transportation of hazardous waste from the continent of Europe into this country for disposal.</p>
	<p pid="a.282.1/5">It is important that the Minister says quite categorically that that will not happen. Otherwise, we have the grisly prospect of tank-loads of such stuff trundling up from the south coast to works such as Westbury for disposal, with all the potential environmental consequences that that will bring, not least the cost in carbon of the transportation of a high-volume, low-value material such as recycled liquid fuel. My constituents and others would be up in arms if that were to happen. If it were to happen, and it is difficult to see how it might not, given the amendment to the substitute fuel protocol, it will be pinned firmly at the door of the Minister and his colleagues.</p>
	<p pid="a.282.1/6">I am doubly concerned because the Lafarge cement works recently had an admission to make. It told the public that what it describes as &quot;rogue employees&quot; had, over the course of two years up to December last year, falsified the content of batches of its cement. That was an extraordinary revelation, and to date the company has been opaque when asked for details about that episode. It has done a great deal to dent the company's already sketchy reputation in my constituency. I have written to the Health and Safety Executive to ask what investigation it has carried out into the implications of that revelation, to the Environment Agency to ask if it will review the data that it has from Lafarge and its consultants, and to the Minister for the Environment and Agri-environment. To date, I have had no meaningful response.</p>
	<p pid="a.282.1/7">I would have thought that such an episode should set the alarm bells ringing. So far, there has been a deafening silence. It is relevant to hazardous waste, because if Lafarge is trying to tell us, as the Environment Agency is saying, that the disposal of recycled liquid fuel in a cement kiln is safe, the company will use its own data to prove its case. Given that data relating to the content of its product have been shown to be false, what confidence can we have in its assertion that the disposal of hazardous waste at the Westbury cement works is safe? We would have to treat that assertion with a great deal of caution, and I hope that the Environment Agency will mount an investigation on the back of that company's revelation. I look forward to the written reply from the Minister for the Environment and Agri-environment to the letter that I have sent him on the subject.</p>
	<p pid="a.282.1/8">I hope that given the doubt that has been cast upon the veracity of data coming from that company, West Wiltshire district council will redouble its efforts to ensure that there is some form of independent scrutiny of what is going on at that plant, and an assessment of the implications for the local population of the disposal of hazardous waste. Even at this late stage, I strongly urge the Minister to revise his thoughts on how we should deal differentially between the cement industry and dedicated incinerators. We must apply universal standards to both to dispel the notion that has arisen understandably and correctly that there is no even playing field and that the Government are using cement kilns as a back-door way of quickly disposing of hazardous waste.</p>

	<p pid="a.284.0/1">Before I call the first of the three Front-Bench spokesmen, may I point out that we have 55 minutes left? The convention is to divide the remaining time equally into three parts, although no one is necessarily required to fill their time. However, bearing in mind that the purpose of these debates is to give the Minister an opportunity to give the Government's views and answer questions, the Chair would frown on anyone who exceeded a third of the time available.</p>

	<p pid="a.284.1/1">Thank you, Mr. Deputy Speaker, for that indirect warning. I assure you that I have no intention of exceeding a third of the time that is left. Indeed, it would be an interesting experience for one of these debates to finish early. We always miraculously seem to find just enough to say to occupy the hour and a half available on these occasions.</p>
	<p pid="a.284.1/2">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1214" name="Jonathan Sayeed">the hon. Member for Mid-Bedfordshire (Mr. Sayeed)</phrase> on securing this debate. He has a long interest in waste matters, as has already been said. He was, as he says, a shadow Environment Minister, and I remember serving with him on the Committee considering the Waste Emissions Trading Bill. We have had a bewildering succession of shadow Environment Ministers on the Conservative side&mdash;I am losing track of them all&mdash;but his knowledge of the subject made him one of the better ones. He is, therefore, well qualified to raise the matter this afternoon.</p>
	<p pid="a.284.1/3">Before I approach the issues that the hon. Gentleman raised, I want to follow up directly <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1132" name="Andrew Murrison">the matters raised by the hon. Member for Westbury (Dr. Murrison)</phrase>. He makes some powerful points, and I want the Minister to be in no doubt that those concerns are shared beyond the Westbury constituency, and indeed beyond the Conservative party. I assume that the hon. Gentleman is speaking for his colleagues on that matter as well.</p>
	<p pid="a.284.1/4">The basic principle of using cement kilns for incineration is one with which I am instinctively unhappy, because such kilns are designed to make cement, while incinerators are designed to incinerate waste. Mixing the two up in a cavalier manner is not satisfactory when we are considering public health, regulation of emissions and matters of that nature.</p>
	<p pid="a.284.1/5">Incinerators are largely unpopular up and down the country. In the view of local authorities, however, they are required: since the Government have been so late in transposing the EU landfill directive, the local authorities have no time to do anything other than build incinerators to meet their landfill reduction targets. As the hon. Gentleman says, there is considerable evidence that the Government, who do not want to get the blame for a chain of incinerators, are looking to do two things: shift the blame on to local authorities, and find a back-door way of dealing with waste. I fear that cement kilns are just such a back-door method.</p>
	<p pid="a.284.1/6">Like the hon. Member for Westbury, I do not wish to overstate the case, but I believe that emission levels and, potentially, public health are being brought into the equation unnecessarily because of that strategy. Again, I urge the Government to look at what that means in terms of emissions from cement kilns and, indeed, the use of cement kilns for hazardous waste. The substitute fuels protocol was published yesterday, as I am sure the Minister is aware.</p>
	<p pid="a.284.1/7">The hon. Member for Westbury also raised the question of transportation of waste from outside this country. I have looked into that in some detail.</p>

	<p pid="a.285.0/1">I admit that the hon. Gentleman has alluded to this, but should not the real question be the quality of emissions? There are brick-making kilns in Stewartby in my constituency. The only thing that matters to anyone is the quality of the emission howsoever it occurs, no matter if it is from brick-making, cement-making or a designated facility.</p>

	<p pid="a.285.1/1">I absolutely agree. Indeed, that was the content of my intervention on the hon. Member for Westbury a few moments ago.</p>
	<p pid="a.285.1/2">We were faced with an incinerator in Newhaven in my constituency, and I looked into the matter. As incinerators are now classed as producing energy from waste, there is no ban on the importation of material from elsewhere in the European Union for disposal of material&mdash;I call it disposal, they call it something else&mdash;in incinerators. Of course, one cannot import material for landfill, but it can be imported for incineration. There is the prospect, particularly for those of us who have constituencies close to mainland Europe, that such material will be imported, in the same way that the Government are increasing and encouraging the importation of nuclear waste, apparently to please the Treasury. Who is to say that waste will not be imported for disposal in incinerators?</p>

	<p pid="a.285.2/1">Does the hon. Gentleman agree that another damaging aspect of the substitute fuels protocol is the lack of public consultation that it ushers in? At the moment, there is a facility for public consultation that the substitute fuels protocol will degrade.</p>

	<p pid="a.285.3/1">I agree with that very good point, and I hope that the Minister will pick up on it when he responds.</p>
	<p pid="a.285.3/2">At the beginning of his contribution, the hon. Member for Mid-Bedfordshire talked about the lack of forward planning by DEFRA. I do not wish to be too down on the Government but it is a fact that, over the years, we have had a number of opportunities to make that particular point and nothing seems to get much better. We have had to deal with fridges, abandoned cars and next it will be batteries. There is to be a requirement to recycle 40 per cent. of batteries and there are no battery facilities, apart from the one that will be opened shortly. Yet again, we face mountains of waste, for which the Government are ill-prepared.</p>
	<p pid="a.285.3/3">The same argument applies to hazardous waste; the Government were clearly unprepared for the co-disposal rules on <phrase class="date" code="">16 July</phrase>, despite warnings made at great length by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/863" name="Sue Doughty">my hon.

	<p pid="a.286.0/1">If the hon. Gentleman does not mind, I would like to return to the subject of incineration for a moment. His opposition to incineration is well known, but how does he feel about combined heat and power? Is it all right to incinerate if something productive results from it, such as heat and power?</p>

	<p pid="a.286.1/1">I must not be tempted to go down the route of the entire waste strategy. The Government have a waste strategy, and my party adheres to it. My only complaint is that it is not implemented. In fact, it is implemented upside down in a sense, with landfill being encouraged most of all. Combined heat and power has a role, but we are not in favour of incineration, except for certain small quantities of hazardous waste&mdash;if that process can be properly controlled. Combined heat and power is clearly a better end result than letting heat drift out, but incineration is not necessarily implied in that process.</p>

	<p pid="a.286.4/1">I want to press the hon. Gentleman on this because it is an important point. One cannot have combined heat and power without incineration. If the hon. Gentleman is in favour of combined heat and power, logically he is in favour of incineration.</p>

	<p pid="a.286.7/1">I am conscious, Mr. Deputy Speaker, that we have had a warning not to overrun, and I have allowed about five interventions. I shall move on.</p>
	<p pid="a.286.7/2">One of the other matters raised by the hon. Member for Mid-Bedfordshire was the lack of sites for disposal of hazardous waste to landfill, irrespective of the landfill directive and its requirements. That is a serious issue for my constituency where there is now a proposal that has suddenly emerged to fill that void. There are no sites for the disposal of hazardous waste anywhere remotely near to my constituency. No such site to deal with hazardous waste has been identified in the East Sussex, Brighton and Hove waste plan, but a speculative application has arrived for a site in Chailey in my constituency, which is wholly unsuitable. The proposed site is the old Hamsey brickworks, and it is unsuitable because it will lead to the generation of a huge number of lorry movements. Because there are so few sites, and there are none for miles around, a large number of lorry movements from Kent, Surrey and West and East Sussex will all bear down on that site.</p>
	<p pid="a.286.7/3">It is interesting to note that when health authorities and primary care trusts are asked to comment on incineration facilities, the health issue they comment on most is the movement of lorries and the pollution that they generate, which is significant. There will be a massive increase in lorry movement if that proposal is accepted.</p>
	<p pid="a.286.7/4">The proposal would also place the site on top of a geological fault, of all things. It is close to a stream and it is very close to a residential area, and it would be a nightmare if that were allowed to proceed. However, I am afraid to say that the Conservative county council, which is in charge in my area, has seen fit to ask the applicant, Lloyds Environmental, to combine the application for a landfill site for hazardous waste with a materials recycling facility. They are quite clearly different decisions, but it is being asked that they be considered together. On behalf of my constituents, who have written to me in large numbers, I call on the county council to reject that application. I hope that those comments will be picked up and relayed to the county council.</p>
	<p pid="a.286.7/5">I also want to confirm my agreement with the hon. Member for Mid-Bedfordshire on the issue of what is happening to the waste. We were warned before the ban on co-disposal of hazardous waste came into force that there were no sites. The Government were ill prepared for that. The question that has not been properly answered by anybody is: what has happened to the waste that has not been disposed of properly? There may have been a rush to deal with some of it before the ban came in. We may be having a quiet winter and that may have helped people to stockpile waste. Some waste may have been disposed of improperly through non-hazardous-waste channels and some may have been fly-tipped&mdash;there is a real issue there.</p>
	<p pid="a.286.7/6">I have not had a decent answer to this question from the Minister when I have raised it before: what happens to a farmer who suddenly wakes up one morning and finds that he has got a field full of asbestos because someone else has tipped it there? He is faced with a choice. He can ring up the Environment Agency and say, &quot;I've got a field full of asbestos,&quot; to which it will say, &quot;Thanks very much. Here is the bill. We'll take it away.&quot; Alternatively, he is forced to pretend that the asbestos is not there in order not to incur a penalty for something that is not of his making. That is a difficult situation. I am afraid that it is quite possible that private landowners find material tipped on their land that they do not report because they will incur a financial penalty. What is the Minister's answer to that point and how will he deal with the issue? What reporting mechanism is in place to identify what hazardous waste is being fly-tipped on private land? The Minister seems rather occupied with his correspondence. Perhaps one of his officials will record my point and send him a note when he comes to reply.</p>
	<p pid="a.286.7/7">I am sorry to bring in a party note, but it is important if we are going to talk about the issue seriously. As I said, I have respect for the knowledge of the hon. Member for Mid-Bedfordshire on this issue. I would go so far as to say that I do not doubt the integrity and commitment of those who speak on the environment for the Conservative party. However, I am bound to say that their credibility has not been helped by the recent James report&mdash;the exercise carried out at the behest of the shadow Chancellor&mdash;which proposed swingeing cuts to the Environment Agency, which is the very body that we rely on to deal with the dumping of hazardous waste up and down the country.</p>
	<p pid="a.286.7/8">In a letter that was published in <i>The Times </i>yesterday, John Harman, the chairman of the Environment Agency, wrote:</p>
	<p pid="a.286.7/9" class="indent">&quot;The James report for the Conservative Party on the savings to be made from bureaucracy proposes cutting government grants to the Environment Agency by &pound;47 million, which it describes as cuts in 'intrusive enforcement by the Environment Agency'.</p>
	<p pid="a.286.7/10" class="indent">&quot;As the Environment Agency actually spends &pound;19 million on enforcement&mdash;acting on breaches of the law . . .&mdash;my board would dearly like to understand what else is for the chop . . .</p>
	<p pid="a.286.7/11" class="indent">My board takes the views and objectives of the major political parties extremely seriously, and it is part of our duty to the public that we understand them properly. In the circumstances we can hardly fail to conclude that Mr. James's recommendations have no basis in even the most rudimentary understanding of our business.&quot;</p>

	<p pid="a.288.1/1">The Environment Agency is not without fault, although I noticed that in the debate on the Clean Neighbourhoods and Environment Bill&mdash;yesterday, I think&mdash;the Conservatives proposed an amendment to give the Environment Agency more power to tackle fly-tippers. There seems to be some contradiction between cutting the powers of the Environment Agency and giving it more powers. The Environment Agency is not always as effective as it might be because it is under-funded. It cannot carry out the necessary inspections and the Conservative proposals would make that much worse. Tony Juniper, who has a key position as executive director of Friends of the Earth, said:</p>
	<p pid="a.288.1/2" class="indent">&quot;The Conservatives' plan to slash and burn spending at DEFRA is a dangerous attack on Britain's environment and countryside. Cutting Environment Agency staffing risks undoing some of the excellent achievements made over recent years . . . Oliver Letwin's plans are nothing short of madness.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.288.1/3">I want the Conservatives to be credible on the environment; I want people in all parties to argue for better environment protection, because that is how we will get it. I want serious action on global warming, for example, but we ain't going to get it with the recent half-baked proposals to cut budgets.</p>

	<p pid="a.290.1/1">Had they been more even-handed in their analysis of Gershon, as well as James, Conservative Members would have taken their comments much more seriously, as would those who are deeply concerned about the environment.</p>
	<p pid="a.290.1/2">My hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Bedfordshire has played a role in the Conservative party on which we continue to build. <i>Hansard</i> records that as early as May 2002 he alerted the Government to the problem of the delay and lack of preparation in signing up to the EU landfill directive. I am staggered that even now there are only 12 hazardous waste merchantable sites, which is a gross underestimate of what is required. By my hon. Friend's calculations, there are still 4 million tonnes with nowhere to go. That is very serious.</p>
	<p pid="a.290.1/3">My hon. Friend raised the serious concerns that we Conservatives have about the pre-treatment required and the lack of technologies to dispose of and prepare such waste under the new criteria that will be set. We want to take this opportunity to press the Minister on the matter. I am sorry not to have the company of the Minister for the Environment and Agri-environment, who I gather was in Cumbria yesterday and is even further afield today. However, I hope that our concerns will be conveyed to him.</p>
	<p pid="a.290.1/4">Of the 200 sites that were licensed before <phrase class="date" code="2004-07-12">12 July 2004</phrase>, only five were licensed to continue to operate past that date. On <phrase class="date" code="">16 July</phrase>, we had the capacity to dispose of only 1 million tonnes of hazardous waste, leaving a shortfall of 4 million tonnes. That significant amount of hazardous waste may well not be missing, but it is of great concern to us. The industry and the businesses concerned would welcome an assurance from the Minister that that shortfall is not missing and unaccounted for. Only eight sites had permission as of <phrase class="date" code="">12 December</phrase> last year to dispose of hazardous waste. On <phrase class="date" code="">12 December</phrase>, <i>The Daily Telegraph</i> apparently recorded that the cost of hazardous waste disposal had risen to &pound;50 per tonne, compared with &pound;10 per tonne for normal waste. Hazardous waste includes, among other things, computer monitors, fluorescent tubes and contaminated soil. More than 60 per cent. of hazardous waste is soil, according to the Minister for the Environment and Agri-environment.</p>
	<p pid="a.290.1/5">As recently as <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-23">23 January</phrase>, an article in <i>The Mail on Sunday </i>warned that mountains of TV sets could be joining that veritable electronic mountain. From August this year, they will also be considered hazardous waste. More than 2 million are disposed of each year. Industrial leaders and specialists in the field, such as the Environmental Services Association, say that no plans have yet been made to deal with the problem. Biffa says that there is no reason not to think that this will be a rerun of the fridge saga. That echoes the points made by my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Bedfordshire: this is clearly another example of the Government's failure to plan for EU directives and of a deepening of the hazardous waste crisis.</p>
	<p pid="a.290.1/6">Other newspaper stories have something like 120,000 fridges being discarded on banks in Manchester. In spite of the fact that 2.3 million fridges and freezers are discarded each year, the Government can account for only 1.3 million. Perhaps the Minister could tell us where the other million have gone.</p>
	<p pid="a.290.1/7">On <phrase class="date" code="2004-12-12">12 December 2004</phrase>, it was reported that the London 2012 Olympic bid will lead to a crisis in hazardous waste disposal due to the removal of contaminated soil to construct the athletes' village. The cost of that would be immense, at more than &pound;50 per tonne. In a further alarming report on <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-30">30 January</phrase>, <i>The Independent on Sunday </i>reported that nuclear waste may have been dumped near Totnes.</p>
	<p pid="a.290.1/8">We have also identified the forthcoming battery mountain. We have a number of questions for the Minister and would like some clear answers and assurances. It is extremely important that the UK Government do not agree to something that we cannot implement by the due date. Our battery recycling levels are very low, so can the Government supply a route map, showing how they intend to reach the standards set, before signing up to the directive?</p>
	<p pid="a.290.1/9">We need an open assessment of the UK's battery recycling capacity. I understand that Britannia recycling of Bristol went into receivership in November 2003 and closed down, leaving only one company in the west midlands, of which I do not have the name. That one company appears to be the sole recycler of household batteries in the country.</p>
	<p pid="a.290.1/10">Without adequate recycling capacity, the likelihood is that we shall continue to send batteries to France and other continental countries to be recycled. That is environmentally unsustainable. Will the Government state what plans they have&mdash;presumably through the Waste and Resources Action Programme&mdash;to grow the required capability in the United Kingdom? There is much good will among the public about the need to recycle batteries. We need to facilitate that and make it as easy as possible for the public to take batteries to accessible recycling points. These may well be best placed in schools, supermarkets or other easily reached facilities. The Minister's Department has maintained&mdash;</p>

	<p pid="a.291.0/1">Is my hon. Friend aware that, under the IMO carriage regulations which deal with the transport of hazardous waste by sea, it is quite likely to be impossible or prohibited to send a battery which contains acid by sea?</p>

	<p pid="a.291.1/1">It is just as well that we have my hon. Friend's expertise in commercial transport by sea&mdash;not least by the Royal Navy&mdash;on our side so that we can give the Minister some possible direction in that regard. That was a very helpful intervention.</p>
	<p pid="a.291.1/2">The Minister's Department's stance is that such minor collection points may need a waste management licence&mdash;which would take time and money to acquire. That is not the best nor the most appropriate route. The European Commission, in correspondence with Dr. Caroline Jackson MEP, who speaks for us in the European Parliament, has maintained that the batteries directive does not require such a licence, nor does other associated legislation. That seems therefore to be an area where we need less bureaucracy and more common sense. As schools, supermarkets or other facilities may soon be wanting to put in such collection points, will the Minister state once and for all that such collection points will not require the full panoply of detail&mdash; and burdensome administrative procedures&mdash;of a waste management licence, which was surely never intended for such small sites?</p>
	<p pid="a.291.1/3">I echo what my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Bedfordshire said regarding hazardous waste, which&mdash;if it is unsorted&mdash;will have waste acceptance criteria applied to it from <phrase class="date" code="">16 July</phrase> this year. They will require hazardous waste to be treated to a specified standard before it can be accepted into a hazardous landfill site. My understanding, however, is that the UK's hazardous waste treatment infrastructure is the least developed of any EU member state. For example, there are 16 high-temperature incinerators operating in France, compared with only two in the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.291.1/4">As for contaminated land, developers begin clearing land prior to developing in spring. Therefore, an increase in the amount of contaminated soils needing management is expected shortly. Contaminated soils account for 20 per cent. of all hazardous waste&mdash;approximately 1 million tonnes&mdash;so I wish to press the Minister on a number of points. Conservative Members want to see the licensing process speeded up, so that more merchant-dedicated hazardous waste sites are opened as soon as possible. I am grateful to the Minister for the Environment and Agri-environment who, in response to a series of parliamentary questions in August 2004, brought us up to date on the number of site applications there had been until then. In many cases, planning applications had been refused pending planning permission being granted, but a number were refused outright. Will the Minister bring us up to date again on whether the total of 12 is correct?</p>
	<p pid="a.291.1/5">The official Opposition would introduce stricter penalties for the fly-tipping of hazardous waste, including making it an arrestable offence. Like <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/710" name="Norman Baker">the hon. Member for Lewes (Norman Baker)</phrase>, who also raised this issue, I am only too aware of the prospect that in a deeply rural constituency such as mine it is only too easy to dump contaminated soil, asbestos and other forms of hazardous waste, including fridge-freezers and other items, on the land without the knowledge or permission of the landowner. Increasingly, that is causing great concern. I understand from the Minister for Rural Affairs and Local Environmental Quality, speaking in Committee yesterday, that the Government are saying that that will be an arrestable offence&mdash;arrestable, that is, by a police officer. However, we all know that a police officer can never be found in rural areas at precisely the moment one is required. We therefore hope that it will be considered important to extend similar powers of arrest to the Environment Agency officers, who are the very people being asked to tackle the issue.</p>
	<p pid="a.291.1/6">The Government have so far not released any recent figures showing how many hazardous waste sites are in operation. Will the Minister do so today? What effect has the 85 per cent. decrease in hazardous waste sites as of July and August last year had on the environment? Does the Department have any evidence of an increase in fly-tipping of hazardous waste to date?</p>
	<p pid="a.291.1/7">The Environmental Services Association and the Environment Agency agree with the Government that there is no longer any significant amount of missing waste. Will the Minister confirm that that is correct and give details of what has happened to the waste produced between July last year and now? Some 4 million tonnes are produced annually, but only 1 million tonnes have been accounted for.</p>
	<p pid="a.291.1/8">There is no waste strategy in place. A waste strategy and/or guidance regulations drive investment, which was the point that my hon. Friends the Members for Croydon, South and for Mid-Bedfordshire made. We increasingly rely on commercial operations, without which there would be no investment. That is particularly important for the waste acceptance criteria, which come into effect on <phrase class="date" code="">16 July</phrase>. The criteria require treatment of contaminated waste before it is landfilled. However, as the Department has published no framework, there has been no investment to date and the treatment technologies are not available.</p>
	<p pid="a.291.1/9">The Government have persistently demonstrated that they cannot be trusted to deal with hazardous waste effectively. Tens of thousands of fridges have blighted the landscape and they will soon be joined by hundreds of thousands of TVs. There are more than 2 million TVs a year to be disposed of, but no plans to recycle them. We face the increasing challenge of household batteries and no recycling point easily identified, yet the Government are poised to sign up to the new EU directive. The Government seem totally unprepared for the fact that TVs will soon become hazardous waste. What is the Minister doing to prevent a TV mountain being created before August?</p>
	<p pid="a.291.1/10">We have also built up a body of evidence, not least from proceedings on the Clean Neighbourhoods and Environment Bill, to show that the Government do not consult properly, if at all, with the waste management industry. What plans does the Minister have to change that? If people can, allegedly, dump radioactive waste in Totnes, what hope do we have of the Government preventing people from dumping less dangerous but equally serious waste? Again, where are the 1 million fridges?</p>
	<p pid="a.291.1/11">I welcome this opportunity to debate the issue and would like to record again my appreciation of my two illustrious predecessors, most recently my hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, South, and previously my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Bedfordshire. I assure <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1132" name="Andrew Murrison">my hon. Friend the Member for Westbury (Dr. Murrison)</phrase> that we have no immediate plans to convert cement kilns into incinerators, but we see scope, albeit limited, for combined heat and power. I do not think that we shall match the giddy heights reached in Denmark of 58 per cent. of household waste incinerated&mdash;I bow to the knowledge of Denmark that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1152" name="Nick Palmer">the hon. Member for Broxtowe (Dr. Palmer)</phrase> has&mdash;but we would look favourably on any possibilities for micro-generation from combined heat and power.</p>

	<p pid="a.293.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1214" name="Jonathan Sayeed">the hon. Member for Mid-Bedfordshire (Mr. Sayeed)</phrase> on securing this debate and apologise for the absence of my hon. Friend the Minister for the Environment and Agri-environment, who, as many hon. Members know, is one of the world's leading experts on the subject. He is unavoidably abroad on ministerial business.</p>
	<p pid="a.293.0/2">I apologise also to hon. Members who have participated in the debate and to those following our proceedings that, as a consequence of my hon. Friend's absence, some of the answers to the questions asked, particularly those asked by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1073" name="Anne McIntosh">the hon. Member for Vale of York (Miss McIntosh)</phrase>, will not be as satisfactory as they would have been had he replied to the debate. I shall deal in writing with anything that I do not manage to cover in my short response this afternoon. I apologise in advance to my officials for the extra work involved in that.</p>
	<p pid="a.293.0/3">It may help if I give some background to the current state of affairs on hazardous waste, and the way in which the Government envisage things progressing. Approximately 5 million tonnes of hazardous waste was consigned in England and Wales in 2002. Some 70 per cent. of that came from four categories: 25 per cent. was construction and demolition waste and asbestos; 20 per cent. was oil and oil and water mixes; 12 per cent. was from organic chemical processes; and 13 per cent. fell into the category of &quot;not otherwise specified&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.293.0/4">Approximately 39 per cent. of all that hazardous waste was disposed to landfill. In addition to consigned waste, some 4.5 million tonnes of hazardous waste was treated or disposed of at the site where it was produced. The solid element of that waste amounted to 500,000 tonnes. As we shall see, those amounts of hazardous waste are set to decline in coming years, as additional controls drive waste producers to consider waste prevention and minimisation above treatment and disposal.</p>
	<p pid="a.293.0/5">Some of those significant changes to the management of hazardous waste have already taken place in the UK, and more changes are due in the coming year. The most significant, as hon. Members have already mentioned, relate to the implementation of the EU landfill directive, which was agreed in 1999. Most notable is the ban on the co-disposal of hazardous with non-hazardous waste in the same landfill cell. From <phrase class="date" code="2004-07-16">16 July 2004</phrase>, hazardous waste destined for landfill has had to go to a dedicated landfill site for hazardous waste.</p>
	<p pid="a.293.0/6">In addition, however, the landfill directive allows so-called stable non-reactive hazardous waste to go to a separate cell in a non-hazardous landfill. The term &quot;stable non-reactive&quot; denotes waste whose leaching behaviour will not change adversely in the long term under the landfill design conditions. Examples of a stable non-reactive hazardous waste would be asbestos or contaminated soil mixed with concrete. In addition to the co-disposal ban, there is a requirement from <phrase class="date" code="2004-07-16">16 July 2004</phrase> that hazardous waste be pre-treated before it is placed in landfill.</p>
	<p pid="a.293.0/7">Further changes to the treatment of hazardous waste for landfill are being made this year. On <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-16">16 July 2005</phrase>, the waste acceptance criteria will apply to hazardous waste going to landfill and to stable non-reactive hazardous waste going to separate cells in non-hazardous landfill. The waste acceptance criteria do not create new wastes, but set limits on the amounts of substances&mdash;mainly heavy metals&mdash;that are permitted to leach from the waste. To ensure that waste meets the criteria it must be tested, and guidance is available on those testing requirements.</p>
	<p pid="a.293.0/8">The changes will improve the management of hazardous waste. They are already leading to more sensible decisions by waste producers and waste managers and are broadly welcomed by the industry. We are already seeing benefits, with early indications of a reduction in hazardous waste going to landfill since July last year. Waste producers must now consider the costs of hazardous waste management and be aware of the new controls, especially on landfill. They also have responsibilities to know what waste they are producing, its characteristics and how it might be treated.</p>

	<p pid="a.295.4/1">I did preface my remarks with a reference to the absence of my hon. Friend, and perhaps I might have hoped for more graciousness from the hon. Gentleman. I shall write to him on the point that he raises. Hon. Members can interrupt as often as they like to try to trip me up, but it will not achieve much for their constituents.</p>
	<p pid="a.295.4/2">As a result of the changes, no longer can the response to hazardous waste management be either &quot;dig and dump&quot; or &quot;that is someone else's problem&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.295.4/3">One issue that was raised today, not least by the hon. Member for Mid-Bedfordshire, who initiated the debate, is what will happen to waste electronic and electronic equipment&mdash;known as WEEE&mdash;once the new directive is implemented. We will see greater treatment and recycling of WEEE. New capacity is already being developed for the proper treatment of such waste; only two weeks ago, a plant opened in Wales that has the capacity to deal with 500,000 television sets a year. Once the treatment requirements of the directive are in place, and if they are communicated and enforced, industry will develop the necessary treatment. I assure the House that there is no prospect of what the hon. Member for Vale of York unhelpfully called television mountains.</p>
	<p pid="a.295.4/4">Overall, the Government are committed to reducing the UK's reliance on landfill in order to reduce the environmental impact of waste and because, with landfill, we miss the opportunity to recover value from the waste.</p>
	<p pid="a.295.4/5">The hon. Members for Mid-Bedfordshire and for Croydon, South (Richard Ottaway) suggested that there had not been enough consultation on some of the decisions, and that people had not been given enough time to make the necessary investment decisions&mdash;the hon. Member for Croydon, South particularly mentioned private businesses. That surprises me, because only the UK and Sweden have transposed the decision before the July 2004 deadline; all the other member states have yet to do so. We have gone through the compulsory consultation process. We have set up the hazardous waste forum. The Federation of Small Businesses, to which the hon. Member for Mid-Bedfordshire referred, apparently complained that it had not been consulted or included, but it is represented on that forum. I will certainly respond to the hon. Gentleman's criticisms, but they surprise me.</p>

However, the global impression that we get from his Department is that we are signing up to EU directives without having the necessary infrastructure in place and without giving business the lead time to prepare for them. It would help the Minister if we did not sign up to any more until we have the facilities in place. Further to that, Denmark and Sweden are incinerating and have stopped recycling because of the transport problems mentioned earlier by a number of hon. Members.</p>

	<p pid="a.296.6/1">I shall come to the transport problems if I have time. I take the hon. Lady's point that it is important not to sign up to EU directives; indeed, I am always extremely careful about what I sign up to, especially if I feel that we have not had enough consultation or that we have not considered the potential impact of what is proposed.</p>
	<p pid="a.296.6/2">The hon. Member for Mid-Bedfordshire asked whether we approved of increased penalties for fly-tipping, as recommended by the Environmental Audit Committee. Yes, we do. I am not going to join the party political mudslinging that we heard earlier, but I am somewhat surprised at that comment given the official Opposition's opposition to the Clean Neighbourhoods and Environment Bill. That Bill will do exactly that; it will raise the maximum fine for fly-tipping from &pound;20,000 to &pound;50,000. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman is aware of that, and I hope that he will try to persuade his Front-Bench colleagues to change their stance on the Bill.</p>
	<p pid="a.296.6/3">The changes are beginning to have a positive impact, but we cannot achieve our waste strategy goals alone. We need the active involvement of waste producers, the waste industry and the regulators if the very real benefits are to be realised.</p>
	<p pid="a.296.6/4">As for the regulators, I decry the sort of language that was used by the hon. Member for Vale of York, when she described the chairman and chief executive of the Environment Agency as stooges. I do not always agree with <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/710" name="Norman Baker">the hon. Member for Lewes (Norman Baker)</phrase>, but he was right to criticise the hon. Lady for saying that, and I look forward to her promised rebuttal of the Environment Agency's criticisms of the official Opposition's spending proposals.</p>
	<p pid="a.296.6/5">The Environment Agency has been working hard; its work in this area is vital if we are to address the problems that were raised today by official Opposition Back Benchers. In addition to landfill and treatment site inspections and audits, the agency has undertaken more than 1,800 targeted producer inspections, numerous cradle-to-grave audits, more than 2,200 stop-and-search vehicle checks and audits of port facilities, and reports that there is no evidence from those checks that waste is deliberately being stockpiled or misdescribed in large volumes. The hon. Lady sought assurance on that. The agency will continue to monitor the situation and take enforcement action where necessary, but it needs the funds to do so. It is clear that the regulator is taking the issue of compliance seriously.</p>
	<p pid="a.296.6/6">The issue of capacity has been raised. There were concerns, last year, that we would not have enough hazardous waste landfill capacity, but, as the Government predicted, that is not the case. Industry responded to the need for capacity by minimising hazardous waste, and there is now sufficient hazardous waste landfill capacity to meet current needs. Concerns were expressed that not all regions have a dedicated merchant hazardous waste landfill&mdash;Wales and south-east England have been given as examples&mdash;but each of those regions has separate cells in non-hazardous landfill for stable non-reactive hazardous waste.</p>
	<p pid="a.296.6/7">We must not exaggerate the problem of transport. In response to the question raised by the hon. Member for Lewes, the proximity principle, whereby waste is dealt with as close as possible to where it arises, is clearly important, but hazardous waste has always been transported to the most suitable or best-value sites for treatment and disposal, regardless of distance. There are only two merchant high-temperature incinerators in the UK&mdash;at Fawley and Ellesmere Port. They are able to deal with our most intractable hazardous waste, which often has to travel some distance to those facilities.</p>
	<p pid="a.296.6/8">We should not forget that our overall aim must be to reduce our reliance on landfill, which is at the bottom of the waste hierarchy, and simply leaves the problems of contamination and hazard for future generations.</p>
	<p pid="a.296.6/9">Another plank of our controls on hazardous waste relates to its tracking and movement. That issue that was also raised by the hon. Member for Lewes. The hazardous waste directive provides controls in that area, and the Government have embarked on a review of the main controls implementing the directive&mdash;the special waste regulations. The Government had a consultation on revised hazardous waste regulations last year, which closed on <phrase class="date" code="">29 October</phrase>. They will introduce the final regulations in the spring, with the intention that they should come into force on <phrase class="date" code="">16 July</phrase>, to coincide with the application of the landfill directive waste acceptance criteria.</p>
	<p pid="a.296.6/10">The new controls will provide a streamlined system. That is important, given that the amount and types of hazardous waste were increased in the EU in 2002. The new controls provide for a system of notification to the Environment Agency for sites producing hazardous waste, with exclusions for low-risk producers such as shops, offices, farms and charities. Companies that move hazardous waste off site will, as now, have to ensure that a consignment note describing the nature of the waste travels with it. However, the current requirement that companies obtain permission from the Environment Agency before moving hazardous waste will be dropped, as it adds little to the controls.</p>
	<p pid="a.296.6/11">Overall, the focus of the controls is to move from the waste manager, who is already subject to regulation and permitting, to the hazardous waste producer. Thus, the regulatory effort can be directed at the beginning of the chain of hazardous waste management. The agency will be able to offer advice to waste producers on techniques to minimise their waste and on methods of treatment, and will be able to better target its enforcement on those that do not comply, which is in the interests of better regulation.</p>
	<p pid="a.296.6/12">An important part of the controls in the hazardous waste directive is the ban on mixing different categories of hazardous waste, or mixing hazardous waste with non-hazardous waste. That is sensible, because mixing can make it more difficult for waste to be recycled or recovered, and can lead to higher costs if more hazardous waste results. The new regulations will apply the mixing ban, which we propose to apply to producers of hazardous waste.</p>

	<p pid="a.298.0/1">The Minister may not be able to deal with my question&mdash;in which case, I hope that he will make sure that the Minister for the Environment and Agri-environment does&mdash;which is about having incremental charges, particularly on small and medium-sized producers.</p>

	<p pid="a.298.1/1">I will certainly ensure that my hon. Friend the Minister for the Environment and Agri-environment writes to the hon. Gentleman on that issue.</p>
	<p pid="a.298.1/2">Let me deal briefly with the constituency issue about the cement works raised by the hon. Member for Westbury, on which he indicated that he had had a long-standing correspondence with my hon. Friend the Minister for the Environment and Agri-environment. I am unable to comment on the specific case, but I will ask my hon. Friend to respond to the points the hon. Gentleman raised.</p>
	<p pid="a.298.1/3">In general&mdash;also dealing with the concern of the hon. Member for Lewes&mdash;cement kilns are and will be subject to the strict emission controls in the waste incineration directive. There is no prospect of lowering those standards. Cement kilns provide a useful outlet for some wastes. The recovery of energy from waste, to reduce the burning of fossil fuels, is good for the environment&mdash;something that I hope all hon. Members would welcome.</p>
	<p pid="a.298.1/4">I should say a little about the hazardous waste forum. The Government set up the forum in 2002, in response to concerns about the impending changes to hazardous waste management. That forum has been an important body, offering advice to Government and the Environment Agency on the direction of policy, and giving us the mechanism better to communicate changes to businesses, including the interests of the Federation of Small Businesses, which is represented on the forum.</p>
	<p pid="a.298.1/5">A survey of the forum's members has confirmed that its work is welcomed by both industry and business. We will maintain the forum in its current form, although we are always open to suggestions&mdash;from both sides of the House&mdash;as to how we can improve its work and outlook.</p>
	<p pid="a.298.1/6">We have had a worthwhile and interesting debate.</p>

	<p pid="a.299.0/1">In the time available, will the Minister deal with a point that I raised, as did the hon. Member for Vale of York? One of the reasons hazardous wastes may not appear to be a problem in some quarters is because it is illegally dumped on private land. There is then no incentive for the landowner to report that&mdash;in fact, there is a disincentive, because he faces a penalty. Could the Minister&mdash;or his colleague, in writing&mdash;clarify the Government strategy for identifying how much hazardous waste has been put on private land? Is it their intention that the private landowner who is innocent in this equation bears the bill? Would that appear to be the position at present?</p>

	<p pid="a.299.1/1">Further to the Environment Agency's assessment that the problem had not increased, there are extra measures which the hon. Gentleman knows are included in the Clean Neighbourhoods and Environment Bill. I am afraid that I will have to write to him on the other points on which he requested clarification.</p>
	<p pid="a.299.1/2">We have had a worthwhile and interesting debate. We have heard a number of concerns about the future management of hazardous waste. Overall, the combination of the landfill and hazardous waste directives controls will improve the management of hazardous waste in this country. That will benefit the environment now and for generations to come.</p>

	Premium Rate Services (Ofcom Review)
</major-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-02-02a.300.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1344" speakername="George Young" colnum="300"  time="015:28:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/vo050202/halltext/50202h04.htm#50202h04_spnew0">
	<p pid="a.300.1/1">I make no apologies for again raising the abuse of premium rate services by unscrupulous operators who are fleecing our constituents. There cannot be a Member in the House who has not had constituents with unexplained telephone bills because of scams operated through computers, or through text messages on mobile phones about wholly fictitious prizes, or people ringing them at home asserting that they have won &pound;5,000. Such scams require calls to be made to an expensive 090 number, which enrich the fraudster and impoverish our constituents. The related ring tone scam is particularly obnoxious because it is focused on children.</p>
	<p pid="a.300.1/2">First, let me set the scene. What has happened&mdash;almost by default&mdash;is that a new currency has been invented. Traditionally, our telephone bill simply paid for telephone calls; now, it can pay for information and services. The revenue is shared between BT, NTL or Telewest on the one hand and the service provider on the other. Most of the services are entirely harmless&mdash; the weather, the traffic, news from &quot;Big Brother&quot; or &quot;Who Wants to be a Millionaire?&quot;. Others&mdash;the so-called adult services&mdash;are slightly less so. A few, of which more in a moment, are simply frauds. The account for one's telephone, whether fixed line or mobile, has become a new form of cash, like a credit card, paying for services or content, but, crucially, without the associated safeguards.</p>
	<p pid="a.300.1/3">Secondly, with technological advance and the breaking down of geographical barriers, more people outside the direct regulatory control of the UK can access our telephones and computers and use the new currency to siphon money out of our accounts. The rate of technological development and the ingenuity of the fraudsters mean that the target is always changing: they are now moving on from 090 numbers to international numbers and 0871 numbers, to which I shall come in a moment.</p>
	<p pid="a.300.1/4">Thirdly, the complex structure of the industry&mdash;what it is pleased to call the value chain&mdash;means that the fraudsters get their revenue up front from the telephone companies. In some cases, that happens long before we know that a huge debit has been placed on our bill and even longer before the bill is to be paid, which makes enforcement difficult and compensation impossible.</p>
	<p pid="a.300.1/5">Fourthly, the regulatory regime has lagged behind all those developments. ICSTIS&mdash;the Independent Committee for the Supervision of Standards of Telephone Information Services&mdash;was in meltdown last year. Although it is now on the path to recovery, complainants are told that they will not get a personal response to their complaint, but that they should look at the website adjudications for an outcome, which might come 12 months after the original complaint. There has been, and there remains, regulatory failure on a massive scale.</p>
	<p pid="a.300.1/6">Finally, every number that is allocated to the fraudsters has been allocated by a public body and the money is collected for them principally by our reputable national telephone suppliers. Ofcom gives them the licence to print the money and BT collects it for them. One would have thought that with those two gatekeepers at each end of the operation&mdash;Ofcom on the one hand, and BT and the telecom companies on the other&mdash;we might have closed the scam down, but we have not.</p>
	<p pid="a.300.1/7">Let me give specific examples of what is happening as we speak. A constituent writes:</p>
	<p pid="a.300.1/8" class="indent">&quot;I am a constituent at Redenham Park. I receive on average six nuisance telephone calls per day informing me that I have won a fantastic prize and to claim that prize to call back on a phone number that begins with 090&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.300.1/9">I had one such message on my constituency office voice mail on Friday, telling me that I had won a cruise or &pound;5,000. I, too, was invited to ring an 090 number, with no mention that it was a premium rate number. The use of automated dialling equipment to call home numbers is illegal, but that has not deterred the fraudsters. The Information Commissioner is meant to be dealing with the issue. No service provider has approval for such service, but it is happening.</p>
	<p pid="a.300.1/10">There is also fraud based on mobiles. At the end of November, I got the following text message on my mobile:</p>
	<p pid="a.300.1/11" class="indent">&quot;Private! Your 2003 Account Statement for&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.300.1/12">it then gave my number, which I do not propose, for understandable reasons, to read into the record&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.300.1/13" class="indent">&quot;shows 800 un-redeemed S.I.M points. Call 0871 8738005 Identifier Code 46892 Expires 22/11/04&quot;,</p>
	<p pid="a.300.1/14">which was the day after I got the message. That was another scam. I did not call the number, but I did call ICSTIS, which was helpful. It said that this seemed to be</p>
	<p pid="a.300.1/15" class="indent">&quot;an operation designed to run up relatively small revenue through pre-recorded waffle.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.300.1/16">I then wrote to Ofcom to find out to whom it had given the number and what it proposed to do. Its letter, which is dated <phrase class="date" code="">22 December</phrase>, started by saying:</p>
	<p pid="a.300.1/17" class="indent">&quot;Your experience is far from uncommon and it would appear that this 0871 number is beginning to be used in a way that is similar to matters that ICSTIS has been investigating in relation to Premium Rate Numbers&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.300.1/18">There then followed a rather laid-back sentence:</p>
	<p pid="a.300.1/19" class="indent">&quot;Ofcom will look further into whether there is any consumer detriment taking place in this instance.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.300.1/20">That, of course, was after I had told it of specific consumer detriment, but perhaps MPs do not count as consumers.</p>
	<p pid="a.300.1/21">The really depressing part of Ofcom's reply was its response to my question about to whom the number had been given. Ofcom wrote:</p>
	<p pid="a.300.1/22" class="indent">&quot;Turning to specifics, it transpires that&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.300.1/23">it then gave the number&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.300.1/24" class="indent">&quot;is part of a block of 10,000 telephone numbers allocated by Ofcom to a company called Band-X Limited in December 2003.</p>
	<p pid="a.300.1/25" class="indent">Band-X subsequently allocated much of that block, including this number to another provider called Allied Telecommunications Ltd, who has in turn supplied this number to a service provider Iberian Holdings Ltd.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.300.1/26">I was told that I could contact that company in New York on a US number, or in the UK&mdash;this was the final insult&mdash;on an 0871 number. So, if I wanted to ring the service provider to complain that he had ripped me off, I got ripped off again. There was, however, a morsel of good news. I was told that</p>
	<p pid="a.300.1/27" class="indent">&quot;the company that sent you the initial text message may be in breach of the Privacy and Electronic Communications (EC Directive) Regulations 2003.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.300.1/28">I am told that the Commissioner for Information Society and Media is on the case.</p>
	<p pid="a.300.1/29">Iberian Holdings Ltd probably paid nothing for that number because it offered to share the revenue with the next company up the chain. If someone is deceived into calling the number, Iberian Holdings Ltd might be paid within seven days; in due course, BT will collect the money from the customer, who might not have realised that he was making a very expensive call.</p>
	<p pid="a.300.1/30">Given the changing nature of telecommunications, to which I referred, and the abuse, it is entirely inappropriate to issue 0871 numbers as though they were raffle tickets. The letter says that there is no requirement for any member of the chain to be a resident of, or be a company registered in, the United Kingdom.</p>
	<p pid="a.300.1/31">There is also the ringtone scam. Two constituents e-mailed me to say:</p>
	<p pid="a.300.1/32" class="indent">&quot;Recently our nine year old daughter had the misfortune to watch a TV programme during which adverts were shown offering cheap downloads for mobile telephone ringtones. Our daughter thought she had bought and downloaded a 50p musical ringtone. The scam was that after the initial 50p downloads she then kept receiving unsolicited offers by text on her mobile which cost her &pound;1.50 a time (her mobile is a pay as you go). As well as highly distressing for her it soon proved very expensive and annoying for us as we had bought the telephone as a way for her to keep in touch with us when she was out playing with her friends (a necessity in today's world).&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.300.1/33">They went on to say:</p>
	<p pid="a.300.1/34" class="indent">&quot;The adverts did show legal messages . . . but on a rapidly scrolling bar that an adult would have difficulty following never mind a child! Basically our nine year old daughter managed to enter into a contract that should not have been binding. On finding a website for the company it was found that the contract could only be cancelled in writing and the termination would take effect at the end of the month following the month of notice . . . in this case the end of October. In the meantime the company would continue sending the text messages and would be scamming about &pound;20 a week on texting our daughter! Of course the company had no telephone or email address that we could contact directly, only a postal address.</p>
	<p pid="a.300.1/35" class="indent">In the end we had to purchase a new SIM card for the mobile. Our telephone shop said they had numerous instances of this where children had been misled by these adverts . . . We would like to know if there are any measures in place or planned that are going to curb these telephone bandits. There seems to be no regulating authorities to prevent these scams from happening. I could provide details of the company&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.300.1/36">They provided details of the company, and concluded:</p>
	<p pid="a.300.1/37" class="indent">&quot;British Industry whinges about too much regulation but when you rely on them to self regulate and provide an honest decent service to consumers you get sharks like these ripping off children.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.300.1/38">Another constituent with the same problem wrote:</p>
	<p pid="a.300.1/39" class="indent">&quot;My son has recently fallen foul of the mobile phone ringtone scam. He downloaded a single pop ringtone for 35p without realising that he was entering into a contract to receive monthly downloads of further ringtones until he actively un-subscribed to the service. These additional downloads were costing him &pound;4.50 per month. This facility is cleared aimed at children, as they want their phone to have the latest trendy ringtone. However as children they are likely not to be aware of the on-costs relating to these services. These on-costs are not made clear in the marketing adverts, and the process to cancel a subscription is also not made obvious. Given that these services are advertised on television and in the national press, I am surprised that they are actually legal. It appears to me as a means of obtaining money by subterfuge. Please could you let me know if there is anything being done to try and prevent this practice continuing.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.300.1/40">I hope that the Minister for Small Business and Enterprise, whom I welcome to the debate, accepts that there is a problem with some so-called service providers.</p>
	<p pid="a.300.1/41">The Ofcom review makes it clear that some terminating communications providers, which are in the middle of the chain between the consumer and the service provider, are responsible for a disproportionate number of the abuses. More than half the fines levied by ICSTIS have been against only five of the 70 terminating operators, so why not stop giving them more numbers until they have cleaned up their act? This is what I have been told&mdash;I quote from the review&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.300.1/42" class="indent">&quot;Some stakeholders have argued that OFCOM should play a more active role in policing PRS by withholding or withdrawing premium rate numbers from TCP's (Terminating Communications Providers) who have been involved in persistent breaches of the Code of Practice.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.300.1/43">That strikes me as plain common sense. It continues:</p>
	<p pid="a.300.1/44" class="indent">&quot;However, OFCOM's legal advice is that such a policy would be incompatible with the requirements of the EC Authorisation Directive.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.300.1/45">What on earth is going on? Everybody knows that scams are taking place. We know who is responsible, but the EC tells us that the people complicit in carrying out the scams cannot have their numbers taken away. The service providers are also cocking a snook at the regulators. From January to September last year, ICSTIS imposed fines totalling &pound;2.03 million on 91 service providers. Half the fines were unpaid as of <phrase class="date" code="">17 September</phrase>, and of the 17 largest fines&mdash;those over &pound;50,000&mdash;14 were imposed on overseas service providers, on which we have the least hold.</p>
	<p pid="a.300.1/46">Let us have a system of bonds, as I proposed during the last debate that I initiated on this subject. If companies had to put up bonds before they could offer services, they would have an incentive to behave, because if they did not, they would lose their bonds; in addition, we would have a means of compensating their customers. Disappointingly, the review says only that my proposal should receive &quot;further consideration&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.300.1/47">One of the review's recommendations relates to the revenue-sharing arrangement. It proposes that the so-called seven-day rule, to which I referred earlier, be replaced with a 30-day rule. That seems eminently sensible, as it would mean that the company at the end of the chain providing the so-called service would have to wait for 30 rather than seven days for its cash, thus increasing the likelihood that the scam would be discovered and the cash frozen. Is that rule now in operation and, if not, when might it be introduced?</p>
	<p pid="a.300.1/48">I turn now to consumer redress. The review says:</p>
	<p pid="a.300.1/49" class="indent">&quot;We also understand that there are likely to have been very few cases in which the customers affected by a breach of the Code of Practice will have received a refund, let alone compensation.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.300.1/50">However, the review is not very forthcoming about that. I know from my postbag that BT is still chasing people for money that, in my view, is not payable. Let me repeat the advice that I am giving my constituents: if they have taken their complaint to ICSTIS and ICSTIS has confirmed that the call is part of a scam, they should not pay. I stand behind any of my constituents who refuses to pay for calls that he has not made.</p>
	<p pid="a.300.1/51">Some of the changes mentioned in the review can be made only after a three-month consultation period. Can the Minister tell us whether that period has started and whether there is any way of reducing it so that we can implement the changes quickly?</p>
	<p pid="a.300.1/52">To sum up, I would like to see faster and more effective action taken against the minority who abuse premium rate services: we need to cut off the numbers more quickly to freeze the flow of cash. There should be a proper compensation process, funded out of bonds. We should name and shame the guilty parties and stop them playing the game; provide better consumer information; reduce the 12-week period for investigating complaints; and increase the maximum fine, as proposed by the review.</p>

	<p pid="a.304.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1344" name="George Young">the right hon. Member for North-West Hampshire (Sir George Young)</phrase> on securing the debate and highlighting a scandal of fraud and ineffective consumer protection under the present regime. The Minister for Energy and E-Commerce apologises for not being with us today, and has asked me to respond.</p>
	<p pid="a.304.0/2">ICSTIS is charged with protecting consumers, regulating companies and tackling unethical business practices. It is responsible for regulating premium rate services. Last year, thanks to increasing numbers of consumer complaints and representations from many of our colleagues, ICSTIS became aware of the scam that the right hon. Member has highlighted and acted immediately in response to the problem: emergency action was taken to cancel the numbers as soon as ICSTIS suspected scam dialler activity. I am advised that ICSTIS can shut down a company&mdash;prevent use of its numbers&mdash;in two hours. Last year, it cancelled more than 90 numbers following consumer complaints.</p>
	<p pid="a.304.0/3">A bar was imposed on B and B services LLC, which had installed a dialler in consumers' computers without them being aware of it. It was fined &pound;100,000, and two other operators were also fined &pound;100,000. Last year, ICSTIS levied 95 fines totalling more than &pound;2 million. Regrettably, although B and B Services paid its fine, 33 operators failed to do so. Many are based abroad, but several are based in Britain, such as DCL (NW) Ltd in Liverpool, which has failed to pay one penny of its fine. KT Promotions in Cheltenham was fined &pound;10,000, and according to the data I received this morning, it still remains unpaid. Another Liverpool company, Mr. J. Harrison t/a TIS UK, owes &pound;3,000 in fines. Most disturbing of all is a case for which I require an explanation from ICSTIS and about which I will inform Ofcom: it concerns a Stockport-based range of companies, each of which has had a &pound;10,000 fine levied on it. They include Dynamic Promotions, James Promotions, Quality Sign Services and Resource Promotions Mobile Services Network, and the common thread linking them, apart from not paying fines after having been guilty of malpractice, is that they are all based at Bromley House, Woodford road, Stockport, Cheshire. I shall ask ICSTIS whether it is able to ensure that anyone operating from that address is investigated, so that if they are connected, action will be taken to end the fraudulent activities for which fines have been levied.</p>
	<p pid="a.304.0/4">The right hon. Member highlighted several areas in which he wants immediate action. He complains quite rightly that reputable telecom companies&mdash;the network companies&mdash;are profiteering from such scams by ensuring that they pay the supplier, the fraudster, too quickly. He called for a 30-day delay to allow consumers to see their bill, lodge their complaint and have a payment stopped so that no one loses out. That approach is wholeheartedly endorsed by the Government and forms one of the 18 recommendations that Ofcom made last year, which we hope will be implemented. In the meantime, I urge all telecom operators to take immediate action to renegotiate contracts with other companies, especially where they suspect there may be fraud, to ensure that the delay is built in and the fraud prepared for. It is wrong that they should profit, just as it is wrong that the fraudsters should get away with such bad and illegal practice. Telecom operators can take that step without delay in order to restore public confidence. There are many reputable companies operating in the telecommunications field: the sector legitimately contributes about &pound;1 billion to the economy and it is wrong that a few rotten apples, exploiting consumers who, as the right hon. Member said, are unwittingly suckered into their schemes, should tarnish the whole industry.</p>
	<p pid="a.304.0/5">It is important to recognise that the potential profits from such scams are huge. I therefore welcome Ofcom's second recommendation that the maximum fine that ICSTIS can levy for breaches of its code of practice be increased from &pound;100,000 and that it be made commensurate with an estimate of the profits that have been made. I hope that Ofcom and ICSTIS will not delay the implementation of that and several other key recommendations.</p>
	<p pid="a.304.0/6">I was disappointed to read that 12 weeks has been allowed for public consultation and responses from companies. I hope that reputable companies respond favourably and well within the 12 weeks. There is then a further 12 weeks for the European Commission to consider the recommendations. The Government will vigorously lobby the Commission to ensure that it fully understands the scale of the problem in Britain and that it co-operates with us in implementing Ofcom's recommendations to try to end the scandal.</p>
	<p pid="a.304.0/7">In the meantime, we want Ofcom to use its emergency powers. I am advised that it can close a line down in two hours. It can act quickly if it gets a series of complaints about any number. It is to act as quickly as possible so that consumers&mdash;many of which are small businesses, for which I have ministerial responsibility&mdash;are not subject to further scams of this nature.</p>
	<p pid="a.304.0/8">I hope soon to place in the Library a list of all the companies that have been fined by ICSTIS and details about whether they have paid their fines. I hope that appropriate action is taken without delay by Companies House, or whichever body is most appropriate, against the British-based companies that I mentioned.</p>

	<p pid="a.306.0/1">The Minister is being very helpful. Would he expect any numbers used by companies that have not paid their fines to be cancelled until such time as they have paid their fines?</p>

	<p pid="a.306.1/1">I can give the House an assurance that the numbers are cancelled&mdash;generally, when a scam is detected. The fine is then levied and collected. I am assured that relatives and associates are also banned from offering any premium rate service in the UK and that Ofcom or ICSTIS is determined to name and shame the individuals who are involved in such companies. I hope that the House will be reassured by that information.</p>
	<p pid="a.306.1/2">I want to be clear about this: public confidence in ICSTIS and Ofcom is undermined by such scams. We expect ICSTIS to continue to use its emergency powers and procedures to take enforcement action against those who abuse the PRS charging mechanism. In the meantime, we also want to emphasise consumer education and awareness, strongly to advise people to install anti-virus software on their computer to avoid the problem, and to warn the young, vulnerable consumers that the right hon. Member rightly highlighted against mobile phone scams. ICSTIS has recently improved its website to inform members of the public about rogue internet diallers. I urge people, as they are already connected, to go to the ICSTIS website and follow its advice.</p>
	<p pid="a.306.1/3">I am aware that countries such as Germany have banned certain premium rate services. I stress that such services are valuable businesses in Britain and the vast majority of them are legitimate. It would be a terrible loss not just to business but to consumers as well if there were to be a reaction along German lines to such scams. I am assured that the proposals will help to eliminate scams by building in a delay and therefore preventing payment from being made too quickly. It is important to allow companies to retain that money and pass it back to the consumer, not on to the fraudster. I know this is perhaps not Ofcom's finest hour, but the right hon. Member and I will do all in our power to put a bit of spine in the regulation.</p>

	<p pid="a.306.2/1">It sounds as if the Minister is working himself up to his peroration. Will he say a word about the suggestion that bonds be put up before services are offered? They were considered in the review and a number of people are keen on them, but, as I said in my speech, the review's response was, &quot;No, not yet, but we will look at it.&quot; Does he have a view on whether bonds would be a useful safeguard to prevent abuse, and to compensate consumers?</p>

	<p pid="a.306.3/1">The issue is not whether bonds would be a safeguard, but rather the ramifications of introducing them. Of course they could be useful. They are being considered as part of the implementation of the Ofcom report and I am advised that they have not been ruled out. I shall draw the right hon. Member's comments and strong advocacy of bonds to Ofcom's attention. It is important that the range of issues is looked at quickly and efficiently and that consumers are not left vulnerable while that happens. That is why I am a strong advocate of the emergency procedures. We want to see them acted on, and we want to see the culprits' names published. I intend to put those procedures in the House of Commons Library as soon as ICSTIS is able to confirm all the details.</p>
	<p pid="a.306.3/2">I am grateful to the right hon. Gentleman for raising the issue. I assure him that it is being addressed seriously. I shall ensure that he is kept well abreast of developments.</p>

	ENTERPRISE PROMOTION (LEEDS)
</major-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-02-02a.308.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/790" speakername="Colin Challen" colnum="308"  time="015:57:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/vo050202/halltext/50202h05.htm#50202h05_spnew0">
	<p pid="a.308.1/1">I am grateful for the opportunity to speak of the great city of Leeds and its enterprise culture. In June 2003 I launched early-day motion 1488 calling for an award to be created, along the lines of the European city of culture, for the European city of enterprise. Naturally, my view was that Leeds should win that title. Since then, much has happened and Leeds has been shortlisted for the title of 2005 British capital of enterprise. The city has a strong case to make and I would like to look at some of its achievements this afternoon and consider some of the issues that still contrive to hold us back.</p>
	<p pid="a.308.1/2">My own constituency of Morley and Rothwell, which suffered the demise of its mills and mines a generation ago, illustrates well some of the steps we have taken in the district as a whole. Unemployment has practically halved since 1997, and employment has never been higher. Many new jobs have been created, although only a few years ago the future looked bleak. My hon. Friend may recall a visit he paid to my constituency in 2002 to help me to launch my business survey&mdash;one of the first steps I took as a newly-elected MP. Some of the comments I received were enlightening. Many employers were calling for better education for young recruits. When we look at getting people into jobs, we must ensure that we get the right skills. In that regard, I was pleased to learn that the fifth of my five local high schools was awarded specialist school status last week. Bruntcliffe high school will from now on be known as the Bruntcliffe business and enterprise college. The school has reached out to the local community, and has been involved with local businesses in the development of its plans. That will go a long way to meeting the needs of today's employers.</p>
	<p pid="a.308.1/3">Only last Friday, I was at the awards ceremony celebrating 50 years of the Joseph Priestley college, which is largely based in my constituency. The college, too, reaches out into the community&mdash;it was not long after the Minister's visit that I was at the opening ceremony of the college's highly accessible high street IT learning shop in Morley. The college intends to deliver high-quality education where it is needed and make it easy to access.</p>
	<p pid="a.308.1/4">Elsewhere in my constituency thousands of new jobs have been created. Only recently, 300 more jobs with mobile phone company mmO <sub>2</sub> were announced at its premises at the Arlington business centre. Some 160 jobs with DePuy International will be created at the White Rose office park, while Northern Foods will establish its headquarters at Thorpe Park. Not all jobs will be maintained or created by outside companies. Since last year I have been working with the Morley chamber of trade and commerce on a retail regeneration strategy designed to stimulate retail interest in parts of the town that have suffered a decline. I am sure that my hon. Friend will agree that we need strategies in place to deal with disparities that persist within larger, economically successful areas. It is probably true that out-of-town shopping centres, such as the successful White Rose centre, have created jobs, but many of them have come at the expense of local shopping centres. In that context I welcome the prospect of business improvement districts&mdash;BIDs&mdash;so that local people and local businesses can develop their own plans to revitalise defined areas of need. We must ensure that the benefits of economic success do not conceal areas where problems must be addressed. That is one reason why I support such initiatives as the local sustainability proposals, among others, that the New Economics Forum has put forward.</p>
	<p pid="a.308.1/5">Over the past 20 years, during which we have had a Labour-controlled council, Leeds has become the UK's best performing city for creating jobs outside London. Some 90,000 new jobs have been created in all, which is an astonishing 30 per cent. increase. It would be remiss of me not to mention the distinguished leadership of the council through some of those years, which included <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1126" name="George Mudie">my hon. Friends the Members for Leeds, East (Mr. Mudie)</phrase> and for Hemsworth (Jon Trickett). They and their successors demonstrated that, with a clear vision and the city council acting as a genuine partner, new enterprise would find the city attractive. Since the local elections last June, which resulted in a confusing coalition of convenience, the leadership has been shared alternately by the Liberal Democrats and the Conservatives. Such a Tweedledee and Tweedledum style of leadership cannot be good for the long-term interests of the city. We are, after all, talking about people who would have held back the regeneration of the city centre by opposing the creation of the Millennium square, which has levered in &pound;15 million of private investment, which is more than &pound;3 million more than the cost of the improvement works.</p>
	<p pid="a.308.1/6">In the civic quarter as a whole, where the Millennium square sits, &pound;150 million has been invested, which shows how much confidence there is in city centre commercial development. People&mdash;not just Labour people&mdash;find it odd that w<phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1016" name="Charles Kennedy">hereas the right hon. Member for Ross, Skye and Inverness, West (Mr. Kennedy)</phrase> has declared that the Liberal Democrats would never form a Government with the Conservatives, he is happy to abandon Leeds to that awful fate.</p>
	<p pid="a.308.1/7">I digress, however. Leeds and those of us who represent it cannot afford to become complacent and say, &quot;There we are&mdash;we're the top dog, the capital of the north&quot;. After all, Manchester is trying hard to catch up. We must also ensure that, when we talk about the future enterprise prospects for Leeds, we mean sustainable enterprise. By that I mean not only that employment should be maintained, but that new development should be environmentally sustainable. In that sense, one of the biggest negatives of more employment is more congestion. My parliamentary colleagues and I&mdash;as well as just about everyone else in Leeds and elsewhere in the region who has given the matter any serious thought&mdash;all back the Leeds Supertram bid. Despite the revision of the bid, which has impacted on my constituency in a way that I would have preferred it not to have, the fact remains that Leeds urgently needs to start work on a new mass rapid transport system. Leeds is the largest European city that does not have one.</p>
	<p pid="a.308.1/8">The benefits of going ahead are impressive. The increase in accessible jobs in neighbourhood renewal areas is estimated to total 83,000. They are not new jobs, but the measure of how people in poorer areas will have improved access to employment opportunities. The estimate of new jobs created in the wake of Supertram is about 28,000 by 2014. The new jobs that are created in Leeds must be accessible to the people of Leeds. It has been suggested that without Supertram, 70 per cent. of the new jobs created could go to people living outside the city, which would further compound the congestion problem.</p>
	<p pid="a.308.1/9">I hope that my hon. Friends will press those points on the Secretary of State for Transport, as have those of us who represent the city. It is important that as the Leeds economy grows its opportunities are made available to all. Large cities tend to have doughnut shapes of poverty around their core that miss out on the dynamic growth of the city centre. Now that we tend to talk more of city regions, that is even more important. Until we acknowledge that the Yorkshire-Humber region does not get its fair share of transport finance, the development of sustainable economic growth in the region will be stunted.</p>
	<p pid="a.308.1/10">Does Leeds deserve to win the 2005 British capital of enterprise award? If it did, it would not be the first award it has won. In the last couple of years, independent judges have found Leeds to be Britain's best city for business, the UK's favourite city, the visitor city of the year, the best place in Britain to live, the best UK university destination and, perhaps allied to that, the No. 1 city for clubbing&mdash;as a member of the Ackroyd street working men's club, I wonder if the award includes clubs in that category. With more than 100,000 students in higher education in Leeds, it is not surprising that the place has a youthful feel. It is relevant to the debate that a survey has shown that 50 per cent. of students in Leeds expect to run their own company. Many of those young people choose to stay and live in the city in which they graduate, adding to the increasingly diverse economy that drives employment in the city.</p>
	<p pid="a.308.1/11">Although it still has a significant manufacturing sector employing more than 48,000 people, Leeds has become one of the UK's most important financial services centres, where employment has reached nearly 100,000 people. In 1991, only 57,000 worked in that sector, which shows how well Leeds was able to realign its economy after the second Tory recession. I acknowledge that some of those jobs are in the much-derided call centre sector and are the kind of jobs that are prone to offshoring. However, when considering recent analyses, it could be argued that more jobs have come to the UK as a result of increased markets in those sectors where call centres operate, so we must be sure that locally we are in a position to capitalise on such two-way traffic. The overall strength of the financial sector in Leeds can weather any storms on that front, which must be one of the key features to consider when judging what is enterprise. It is one thing to get something started but another to keep it going. As things stand, it is anticipated that the financial sector in Leeds will deliver another 28,000 jobs over the next 10 years and that 40 per cent. of all the new jobs will be developed in the Yorkshire-Humber region.</p>
	<p pid="a.308.1/12">The Leeds Initiative&mdash;a partnership between public and private sectors&mdash;is charged with the task of driving the Leeds enterprise strategy forward. It is one of the first initiatives of its kind and has spawned several other initiatives in which partnerships and relevant interests can influence developments. It has set itself seven challenging measures of success: increasing the wealth created in Leeds and the region every year; creating at least 50,000 new jobs; improving Leeds and the region's productivity performance by at least 15 per cent.; improving Leeds and the region's ranking in the European innovation index; increasing the proportion of the work force employed in high-tech or knowledge-based jobs every year; being recognised as the best UK city for business and students; increasing the number of Leeds residents moving into work.</p>
	<p pid="a.308.1/13">One of the city's strongest emerging sectors is in media, and the Leeds media initiative has identified more than 1,600 media companies in the city with over 13,000 people employed, which represents a 50 per cent. growth since 1993. It is a sector that tends to rely on small companies with 10 people or fewer. It provides one of the most exciting opportunities for further development of Leeds's diverse and multicultural nature, both in the city and in the wider region and I predict further strong growth in that area.</p>
	<p pid="a.308.1/14">One last fact convinces me that Leeds deserves to be called the British capital of enterprise: the last census showed that Leeds was the only city in the country outside of London whose population actually grew. Normally, as wealth is created, one expects to see a flight to more leafy locations, but Leeds has become a place for city living. Other cities have lost population as they struggle to adapt, but if people can be attracted to live and work in an area, it means more customers and enterprise. On that measure alone, Leeds is indisputably the 2005 British city of enterprise.</p>

	<p pid="a.311.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/790" name="Colin Challen">my hon. Friend the Member for Morley and Rothwell (Mr. Challen)</phrase> on securing the debate and championing the cause of Leeds. As the Minister for small businesses, I had the pleasure of meeting him and his constituents and seeing at first hand some of the leading small businesses in Yorkshire.</p>
	<p pid="a.311.0/2">Leeds has undergone a remarkable transformation in the past 10 years, from an industrial city in decline to recently winning the title of Britain's best city for business. More than 85,000 jobs have been created in Leeds in the past 20 years&mdash;more than any other UK city&mdash;representing more than a third of job creation in the region. Leeds has the most diverse economy of any major city in the UK outside London, with 17,500 VAT-registered businesses in a wide range of sectors. In the past three years, more than 100 companies have moved into Leeds, representing key sectors from manufacturing to financial and business services, retail, media distribution, transport and leisure. In the past 20 years, Leeds has become a major centre in the UK for financial and legal services, creating more than 40,000 new jobs, accounting for more than a quarter of the income value of Leeds. Leeds has been a model of economic growth in many sectors. Modern creative industries account for 70 per cent. of local self employment bringing &pound;269 million a year into the Leeds economy. Tourism has grown by more than 30 per cent. in three years, bringing 20,000 jobs and &pound;750 million into the Leeds economy. As well as being Britain's best city for business in 2003, Leeds was named visitor city of the year in 2004.</p>
	<p pid="a.311.0/3">That success is not accidental. It is underpinned by the stable economic conditions achieved by this Government, which have enabled sustained development of the Leeds economy. However, the true success of Leeds comes from the people. They have built the communities and developed partnerships, especially over the past 15 years, to create an enterprising environment. The Leeds Initiative was set up to bring together the main institutional stakeholders and to set out a development agenda for the city. A strong belief in partnership working and co-operation was instrumental in creating conditions for the transformation of Leeds city centre, from the relocation of the Royal Armouries museum, where I spoke with manufacturers in October, to the remodelling of public spaces such as Millennium square and the Victoria Quarter.</p>
	<p pid="a.311.0/4">I am grateful for the acknowledgement of the part played in Leeds' transformation by the Government's policies on the regions. The creation of regional development agencies and the increasing funding channelled through them has been instrumental in supporting the transformation of the city centre. More than &pound;15 million from Yorkshire Forward, the regional development agency, has been committed to major regeneration schemes in Leeds, including the &pound;3 million Round Foundry and &pound;1 million for the Leeds city centre masterplan. That regeneration has, in turn, levered in considerable private sector investment and inward relocation of major businesses. In the past decade or so, &pound;2.4 billion of investment has been made in large property development schemes, with a further &pound;1 billion-worth under construction and &pound;3.4 billion-worth in the pipeline&mdash;a total of &pound;6.8 billion. As the local strategic partnership, the Leeds Initiative has enterprise and the economy as a key theme in its second vision for Leeds. The vision addresses a wide range of issues that contribute to an enterprising economy.</p>
	<p pid="a.311.0/5">Leeds has recognised the vital importance of education and skills in achieving an enterprise culture. Partners have worked hard to improve education standards in Leeds. Key stage 2 results for 2004 show that Leeds pupils are now above the national average for English and maths attainment. GCSE results have shown a steady improvement, rising from nearly 40 per cent. of students achieving 5 or more A to C passes in 2001, to 45 per cent. in 2004.</p>

	<p pid="a.312.0/1">The thought has just occurred to me that with the announcement from the Government that Bruntcliffe high school is to be awarded the status of a business and enterprise college, this might be an appropriate time to invite the Minister to visit my constituency to congratulate the school on that award and to visit one or two local companies. One company, a small engineering firm called Ace Engineering, won an award against competition from China, which is a tremendous achievement.</p>

	<p pid="a.312.1/1">It is always a pleasure to visit Leeds. I am reinvigorated by what I see. I thank my hon. Friend for his kind and warm invitation.</p>
	<p pid="a.312.1/2">The excellence in cities programme was designed to raise educational standards and opportunities in city areas. Partners with the underperforming schools&mdash;businesses and community groups&mdash;are able to embed enterprise in schools. The Education Leeds Business Alliance, which provides the formal mechanism for the partnerships, is doing a sterling job. Every secondary school in Leeds has been adopted by at least one local business. Department for Education and Skills enterprise advisers also support Leeds schools in disadvantaged areas.</p>
	<p pid="a.312.1/3">Leeds has been innovative in the development of family learning centres, which link disadvantaged groups to employment and enterprise opportunities. Four family learning centres have been established in deprived areas of the city. At the core of each centre are employment access and training teams, which help people to make the transition from welfare to useful work. The family learning centres work with a wide range of other partners, including local colleges, Leeds Metropolitan university, local schools, Sure Start, Jobcentre Plus, and public and private sector employees. More than 1,000 people have now obtained jobs by such means.</p>
	<p pid="a.312.1/4">Universities in Leeds are at the heart of developing the enterprise culture. The university of Leeds and Leeds Metropolitan university combined have 46,000 students, who contribute to the local economy and, more importantly, to the quality of life in the city. Some 5,000 students have benefited from enterprise learning at the university of Leeds since 2001. Every year, around 1,500 Leeds Metropolitan university students study modules on enterprise. The result is that 50 per cent. of students in Leeds expect to run their own businesses at some point in their career. The universities are key partners in a range of enterprising activities. For example, the university of Leeds is a key partner in the Department of Trade and Industry's manufacturing advisory service, which operates four of the regional centres for industrial collaboration funded by Yorkshire Forward to develop commercial applications for research. Leeds Met has implemented a graduate business start-up programme in partnership with Business Link. That is now operating across the whole of west Yorkshire to provide business space, equipment advice, mentoring training and resources to all Leeds students, graduates and alumni who seek help.</p>
	<p pid="a.312.1/5">Businesses in Leeds can access a wide range high-quality business support to ensure the success of their enterprise. Support is available on all aspects of start-up, business growth, export, and inward investment, as well as property search services and sector-specialised advice and networking. That support is provided through strong partnership working. The partners include Leeds city council, Leeds chamber of commerce, Business Link West Yorkshire, the Asian business development network, Asian trade link, which I have visited on several occasions, and many others. Most Leeds businesses are small or medium-sized enterprises. About 20,000 of them employ up to 10 people each, comprising 15 per cent. of the Leeds work force. In the financial year 2003&ndash;04, 1,448 individuals inquired about starting up a business in Leeds and 557 businesses were started. Some 3,500 established businesses were given specialist advice.</p>
	<p pid="a.312.1/6">A range of regeneration funding has come into Leeds to support economic regeneration, including &pound;98 million from the single regeneration budget. Some &pound;12 million has been provided for the first phase of the regeneration of the Aire valley. The project includes the release of more than 350 hectares of land for development and is expected to create about 5,000 jobs and to safeguard a further 10,000. An investment of &pound;20 million has been generated and major businesses are relocating in the Aire valley, including Arla Foods, Alvis Vickers and Royal Mail. To date, the project team has helped more than 500 people get jobs with inward investors. In addition, the Government's neighbourhood renewal fund has provided &pound;37.5 million to help to improve services in the poorest communities in Leeds. For example, in the Beeston hill and Holbeck neighbourhood renewal area, more than &pound;30 million of additional capital investment has been attracted in the past five years, including four new schools and a health centre.</p>
	<p pid="a.312.1/7">The Government recognise the importance of transport infrastructure to increasing the success of the Leeds economy. That is why they have already provided &pound;16.6 million for integrated transport and maintenance in Leeds in 2004&ndash;05. Leeds has also benefited from the &pound;63.3 million spent on transport in west Yorkshire in 2004&ndash;05. In addition the Government have fully approved funding for two major road schemes in Leeds&mdash;the Leeds inner ring road and the east Leeds link road.</p>
	<p pid="a.312.1/8">The proposal for the Leeds Supertram is clearly a significant component in the local strategy, which is why the Government agreed in 2001 to provide public funding of up to &pound;355 million towards the Leeds Supertram, of which 75 per cent. was to come direct from the Government. Sadly, since that decision was made, the project's estimated costs have increased to more than &pound;500 million. No Government could simply sanction such an increase without ensuring value for taxpayers' money. Particularly in the light of the National Audit Office report on light rail, we need to consider how light rail can be made more cost effective, and whether it is always the best solution. I assure my hon. Friend that the Department for Transport is currently working closely with the promoters of the Leeds Supertram together with Leeds city council on new costings for the project and alternative proposals. They are in the process of discussing the bid with promoters and obtaining further information from them. Representatives of the Department have met Metro and Leeds city council representatives several times at official level. The main issues that are being discussed at the moment are, I am advised, the scheme appraisal and the promoter's proposed procurement and risk-sharing approach.</p>
	<p pid="a.312.1/9">At the conclusion of the discussions a final decision will be made, but all the work that is presented will be considered carefully, and decisions will be based on value for money, including wider benefits and affordability, as happens with all light rail proposals. The Government recognise the importance of good public transport for the future development of Leeds, and we are working on cost-effective solutions to the city's transport needs of the 21st century. I thank my hon. Friend for giving me the opportunity to join him in praising the great achievements of Leeds and its citizens.</p>
