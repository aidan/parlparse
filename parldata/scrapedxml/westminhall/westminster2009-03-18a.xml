<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-03-18a.234.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2023" speakername="Bob Neill" colnum="234"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090318/halltext/90318h0001.htm#09031893000444">
	<p pid="a.234.3/1">I pay tribute to my hon. Friend and his experience of those matters, which is very much greater than mine. That is why I was grateful for his intervention, and he is absolutely right. If we are to make sense of the single market, something to which I am committed, we have to create a genuine level playing field, but that simply does not exist at the moment. The difference between Germany, where online gambling is virtually outlawed, the monopolistic approach in France and other European jurisdictions, makes a level playing field impossible, and responsible British operators are often disadvantaged by that climate. It is very difficult for the various bodies trying to ensure that gambling is dealt with responsibly in the UK to counteract the inevitable penetration of the British market by unregulated bodies and the EU's broad approach. If we cannot get right the approach in the EU, it will be very difficult for us to have any great authority when we try to argue with jurisdictions outside the EU about adopting the same common and responsible approach.</p>
	<p pid="a.234.3/2">I hope that the Government will respond favourably to the approach of Mr. Harbour MEP, because it seems to be a balanced and sensible route towards standardisation, which in turn appears to be both the only way that is consistent with single-market principles and social responsibility, to which I think all parts of the House are committed. That is important not only because of the growth of unregulated sites and the variety of regulation, but because of the downside of gambling.</p>
	<p pid="a.234.3/3">Gambling can be a legitimate form of enjoyment, and it produces a good deal of money for the UK, but it is a matter of concern. It is certainly a matter of concern for the constituents who have contacted me, because problem gambling appears to be growing faster online than in other areas of gambling, which is demonstrated by the Gambling Commission's prevalence study. The figures on page 95 of the study demonstrate that internet gambling is the area where, by the commission's two measures, the growth of problem gambling seems to be the greatest, and clearly that needs to be tackled. I am interested to see what proposals the Government have, on the back of those figures, to deal with the growth in problem gambling.</p>
	<p pid="a.234.3/4">I pay tribute to the good work done by the Gambling Trust, as do the other organisations that I have had dealings with. I am interested to know what plans the Government have to strengthen support given to that trust, and to organisations like it, which are dealing with the issues that I have mentioned.</p>
	<p pid="a.234.3/5">Given that we are not yet able to get common standards within the EU, we ought at least to be making sure that the maximum effort is made to ensure that there are proper standards in the white-listed jurisdictions. Can the Minister help? Do any of the white-listed or EU jurisdictions contribute towards the work of the Gambling Trust? I know that the trust receives financial contributions on a voluntary basis, but I am interested to know whether any of the EU or white-listed jurisdictions currently make such voluntary contributions and, if so, which ones. That may provide an interesting picture of the attitudes of the people that we are dealing with.</p>

	<p pid="a.236.1/1">For the benefit of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1677" name="David Taylor">the hon. Member for North-West Leicestershire (David Taylor)</phrase>, I certainly will not mention the words &quot;political correctness&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.236.1/2">Does my hon. Friend agree that there is an anomaly here with regard to the funding for the Gambling Trust, because many organisations might be considered to contribute to problem gambling, including the Government themselves through the national lottery, which allows people to gamble from the age of 16? Scratch cards, for example, strike me as highly addictive. Does he agree that if we want to tackle organisations that promote inappropriate gambling, the Government might want to contribute to that fund?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-03-18a.236.4" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2023" speakername="Bob Neill" colnum="236"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090318/halltext/90318h0001.htm#09031893000450">
	<p pid="a.236.4/1">The issue is very serious, and the Minister will have taken those concerns on board. It has clearly spread well beyond the occasional fringe scandal in the past. Now one finds it in mainstream sporting activities, with household names sometimes being implicated. That is damaging for the concept of sport, when in the run-up to the Olympics we are trying to encourage participation&mdash;it is scarcely a good role model for young people&mdash;and it calls in question the regulatory ability of some of those bodies. I hope that the Government will tell us what plans they have to take that issue on board, because it is topical at the moment. All these issues link together. It is a question of how we encourage greater harmonisation in the UK, support the work of the Gambling Trust and other jurisdictions and encourage a robust approach to the integrity of sport by the various regulatory bodies concerned.</p>
	<p pid="a.236.4/2">I turn now to the consistency and robustness of the regulatory regimes that we allow legitimately to have access to the UK market. I am grateful to the hon. Member for Bath for his detailed exposition in the February debate on the piece of delegated legislation that I mentioned earlier. He got to the nub of the issue, when referring to the statutory instruments, when he said that, although we do not regard an identical regulatory regime as being necessary, the white-listed jurisdictions</p>
	<p pid="a.236.4/3" class="indent">&quot;must operate a regime with 'similar intention and effect'.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.236.4/4">and must</p>
	<p pid="a.236.4/5" class="indent">&quot;'have embedded within their licensing regimes the values which underpin our licensing regime'&quot;.&mdash;[<i>Official Report, Third Delegated Legislation Committee, </i><phrase class="date" code="2009-02-04">4 February 2009</phrase>; c. 4-5.]</p>
	<p pid="a.236.4/6">That includes, among other things, the protection of the vulnerable, which I mentioned earlier, fairness and compliance, which are topical at the moment, and ensuring that crime is kept out. I am not convinced that we have the necessary assurance that that is so in respect of such jurisdictions. In some cases, that is probably fairly easy to achieve. For example, it is well known that some established white-listed jurisdictions have a good track record and one should not denigrate the work that they do. But there are concerns that, if we are not transparent about the criteria that we apply to white-listing, the value of the white-listing process&mdash;often involving jurisdictions with important connections with the United Kingdom&mdash;can be undermined in terms of the rest of the world. I hope that the Minister can assist me, following the issues raised in the February debate and subsequent developments.</p>
	<p pid="a.236.4/7">What are the current arrangements by which the Government test the robustness of the regulatory regime in white-listed jurisdictions? The hon. Member for Bath mentioned how difficult it is to get information on the submissions for white-listing. I understand that those submissions are not available for scrutiny, which the hon. Gentleman mentioned in respect of the difficulty that he faced on freedom of information applications. I would like to know the justification for that, as the Minister understands it. It has been suggested that commercial confidentiality is an issue&mdash;in my experience, it is usually the one that is raised most often. We would like to know whether that is so. Is that the sole reason?</p>
	<p pid="a.236.4/8">Are there any other reasons that might be advanced, or have been advanced, by way of exceptions to the Freedom of Information Act 2000, as to why those submissions should not be available? I should have thought that it would be in the interests of jurisdictions seeking white-listing for their submissions to achieve maximum transparency, because that would inspire confidence in the strength of their regimes. But it is also important for us, in respect of the due diligence that we owe to the British population, to be assured that there is a means by which the authorities in the UK can clearly and objectively compare the regulatory regimes of the various jurisdictions that apply for white-listing. We do not have that transparency or that assurance at the moment.</p>
	<p pid="a.236.4/9">The mystery shopper pilots were mentioned in February's delegated legislation debate. That is a well-established means of testing the system's robustness in respect of underage people and so on. There was an indication that the mystery shopper pilots were to be extended beyond the UK, but it was apparent that none of the pilots had taken place outside the UK. Can the Minister tell us what the position is now? When will those pilots be rolled out to jurisdictions outside the UK? Has that happened yet? If not, when is it going to start and on what basis?</p>
	<p pid="a.236.4/10">In that debate, reference was made to the Ascot conference and the minimum international standards document, which, as far as I am aware, is still not in the public domain. Is it proposed that it should be? It is difficult to understand why a document setting out minimum international standards should not be publicly available. That should be part of the process of robustness that we want to be available and that the House should be able to see as a measure of scrutiny of the regulatory regime's strength. If the document is not available, why not? Is it because of commercial considerations, or are there objections from certain jurisdictions&mdash;if so, which? We are entitled to know. In the absence of overwhelming reasons to the contrary, it should be placed in the public domain as soon as possible.</p>
	<p pid="a.236.4/11">Another aspect of white listing that was referred to in the debate is the situation in Antigua and Barbuda, which goes to the heart of ensuring faith in the robustness of the white-listing system. When I worked as a lawyer, I dealt with several commercial fraud and money laundering cases, and it was apparent that some jurisdictions throughout the world are susceptible to pressure from organised crime in several ways. Gambling and related activities have always been vulnerable and require particularly high standards to protect honest and legitimate operators&mdash;the majority&mdash;from such infiltration.</p>
	<p pid="a.236.4/12">The position in Antigua was a matter of concern to hon. Members during the debate in February. We have not had any information to assuage those concerns, which have since been heightened by what has happened since, particularly among cricket fans as the Allen Stanford scandal hit the headlines. It is worth remembering that Stanford's operations were based in Antigua and Barbuda. A particular concern to me is that unlike the UK, where the regulatory organisation for financial services is separate from that for gambling&mdash;that also applies is some other white-listed jurisdictions&mdash;the Antigua and Barbuda Financial Services Regulatory Commission is extraordinary in that it regulates not only financial services but online gambling. Its capacity and capability have inevitably been called seriously into question by what has come to light over the Stanford affair. If its capacity is subject to grave doubt&mdash;I say that as moderately as I can&mdash;on such an issue, we are entitled to be concerned about its ability to regulate online gambling to the standards that we expect of a white-listed country.</p>
	<p pid="a.236.4/13">In fairness to UK citizens, whose market the commission could be involved in, and the whole white-listing system, it is important for the Minister to make it clear what discussions the Government or the British regulatory authorities have had since February with those in Antigua and Barbuda, as well as what they are doing to satisfy themselves of the robustness of the regulatory regime in that jurisdiction and its ability to meet the appropriate regulatory standards. In February's debate, the response was that it was capable of meeting those standards, but that is not the same as an assurance that it does. Any risk management&mdash;that is partly what we are engaged in&mdash;needs a robust, embedded process, not an aspiration for the future. Nothing that I have seen or read suggests that we have that, and the Government owe us maximum clarity as regards the situation in that white-listed jurisdiction.</p>
	<p pid="a.236.4/14">I hope that those who are interested in related issues such as spread betting, betting exchanges and so on will forgive me if I do not trespass down that line. I have tried to limit myself specifically to the regulation of online gambling, although I suspect that other hon. Members will want to raise additional points. I hope that I have clarified which two areas particularly concern me. These concerns are cross-party, and they are not driven by ideological considerations. I hope that we can approach the matter with a sensible and balanced view. I also hope that the Minister will respond to the debate constructively. My hon. Friends and I have been critical of the Government on some issues, but we want to help them to improve the situation because responsible gamblers and businesses in the industry&mdash;the vast majority&mdash;are entitled to clarity and equity of standards, which we do not seem to have at the moment.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-03-18a.243.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1503" speakername="Mark Field" colnum="243"  time="010:09:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090318/halltext/90318h0002.htm#09031893000466">
	<p pid="a.243.0/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2023" name="Bob Neill">the Member for Bromley and Chislehurst (Robert Neill)</phrase> on introducing the debate. The issue is of great importance; indeed, we have come back to it, and I suspect that we will do so again. I hope that the Minister is not getting too bored of responding on these matters.</p>
	<p pid="a.243.0/2">My constituency is at the heart of many of the creative industries, and many large technology industries are also based there. In addition, many bookmakers are based there, and I have visited a branch of Ladbrokes on Charing Cross road in the past few weeks. Increasingly, of course, even the old-fashioned providers supply a high-profile, innovative online offering to their shops.</p>
	<p pid="a.243.0/3">I do not know whether this applies to other Members, but over the years during which I have been a Member of Parliament I have had the benefit of a close connection with the Betfair organisation, which was referred to earlier. It has assisted by providing me with general and specific briefing on technical matters. I shall touch on one or two of the issues that have been mentioned, particularly by my hon. Friend the Member for Bromley and Chislehurst.</p>
	<p pid="a.243.0/4">There exists a significant threat that United Kingdom remote gambling companies will be permanently impeded from trading freely and fairly across the European Union, despite operating under the robust UK regulatory regime. Although betting companies that are large-scale employers are committed to staying in this country rather than going offshore, they take the view that if they are playing the game under the Government's regulatory and licensing regime, they understandably expect the Government to stand up for that regime abroad. It is not meant as a threat by Betfair or any of the other operators, but they have the opportunity to go offshore, and they may use that option if they find not only that UK regulation is overly robust but that the regulatory playing field is not being defended abroad by the Government.</p>
	<p pid="a.243.0/5">The Minister will be aware that a number of EU member states, including Germany, France, the Netherlands and Greece, are seeking to implement, or already have in place, licensing regimes that restrict operators holding full UK remote gambling licences from operating in those other jurisdictions. As has been pointed out, that is in direct contravention of the free market principles of the EU, and at odds with the UK's own regime. I regret to say that the Government have done little to demonstrate either defence or advocacy of their regulatory system as compliant with EU free trade principles. Neither have they been willing to support remote gambling companies based on our shores.</p>
	<p pid="a.243.0/6">One could take a purist view and say that we do not want gambling companies onshore, perhaps because of the nefarious activities to which <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1744" name="Ian Gibson">the hon. Member for Norwich, North (Dr. Gibson)</phrase> referred. Indeed, we all have some concerns about the integrity of the gambling industry. My preference would be to encourage the gambling industry to stay onshore. From the Government's point of view, that creates significant income and employment; but it also gives us the opportunity properly to regulate the industry, so that we do not end up with a wild west show.</p>
	<p pid="a.243.0/7">Many Members will be aware, as is the Minister, of the European Court of Justice case between Betfair and the Dutch Government. It has pretty wide implications for the effective operation of the internal market. I shall not go into great detail about that case, as time is somewhat short, but the Government have the opportunity to make a submission to the ECJ in support of British companies, and in defence of the principle of the free provision of access to services across the EU. That is the principle upon which the UK's regulatory regime is based. I respect our regime, and I wish that we were able to stand up and make that case. Have the Government any plans to revisit their decision not to make a written submission in support of Betfair in its ECJ case against the Dutch Ministry of Justice, given that no fewer than 15 other member states have written in support of the Dutch?</p>
	<p pid="a.243.0/8">On a slightly more serious note, given the banking crisis of the past six months and the Government's reaction to it, what will be the Government's position on the Dutch Government's recent request of ABN AMRO? We should not forget that it is now wholly owned by Royal Bank of Scotland, more than 75 per cent. of which is now owned by the taxpayer. Given that the Government have a majority share, they should ensure that we implement financial transaction blocking against online gambling operators.</p>
	<p pid="a.243.0/9">My hon. Friend the Member for Bromley and Chislehurst referred to the report by the Danish MEP Christel Schaldemose. One disappointment&mdash;I suspect that it was in part caused by many MEPs not understanding precisely what they were voting on&mdash;is that all 19 of the governing Labour party's members voted in favour of the report, as it actively undermines the UK's regulatory regime for remote gambling. I realise that they may not have appreciated all the implications. Indeed, probably all Members of Parliament know of various times when we have voted, perhaps on a particular subsection, and only when our constituents get in touch with us subsequently do we realise that we may not have understood quite what was being voted on. It is a worry, and I hope that the Minister will give us some idea of how to ensure that all our MEPs make the case on behalf of British companies. As my hon. Friend the Member for Bromley and Chislehurst said, it is a matter that goes well beyond the confines of partisan politics.</p>
	<p pid="a.243.0/10">I fear that the Government have too often failed to stick to their principles and defend their own regulatory regime. Moreover, in these troubled economic times, the Government should actively support British companies. I speak only for myself and my party, but I believe that the Minister would receive support from both sides of the House for so doing. I take this opportunity to ask why the Government believe that companies in remote industries will stay in the UK if the Government choose not to defend their own regulatory system by supporting such companies in the EU and elsewhere.</p>

	<p pid="a.245.0/1">I inherited from my late father a number of things, one of which was a William Hill telephone betting account. He would have been very pleased that it was in credit at the time of his death; it contained &pound;7.33. I love gambling, and I make the occasional modest return. I have guarded my father's inheritance well.</p>
	<p pid="a.245.0/2">I am not an online better, but I am an avid reader of politicalbetting.com. I recommend it to the House, as it is one of the best commentaries on political odds&mdash;who is likely to win the next election, or who is likely to be the next leader of a party. Indeed, political betting is a growing part of online betting.</p>
	<p pid="a.245.0/3">In a previous debate, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1391" name="Don Foster">the hon. Member for Bath (Mr. Foster)</phrase> laid out the tremendous economic potential of online betting. In many ways, the Government were ahead of the game when they set up the present regulatory regime under the Gambling Act 2005. However, although the Gambling Commission is four times bigger than its predecessor body, not many of its staff regulate online gambling.</p>
	<p pid="a.245.0/4">A report about the commission's performance is to be published soon; we are looking forward to the Hampton review, as the commission has not undertaken a study of online gambling. There may be a variety of reasons for that. Tax may be one. That subject has not yet been mentioned, but the tax on online gambling is 15 per cent., which could tempt many online operators to go offshore.</p>
	<p pid="a.245.0/5">The Government were very progressive a few years ago when they abolished betting tax. The replacement tax has led to an increase in revenue. That was a brave move. I believe that we should integrate tax policy with regulation policy; otherwise, many in the Gambling Commission will be sitting around waiting for people to come onshore. So far, they have not done so in large numbers.</p>
	<p pid="a.245.0/6">My personal friend and neighbour, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1796" name="John Greenway">the hon. Member for Ryedale (Mr. Greenway)</phrase>, said that a code across Europe is essential so that those who operate in the European Union meet common standards. Equally, I support <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1503" name="Mark Field">the hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster (Mr. Field)</phrase> in asking the Government robustly to defend our regulatory regime in cases such as the Betfair one.</p>
	<p pid="a.245.0/7">I exempt my hon. Friend and fellow Bradford City supporter, the Minister, from this accusation, but because of all the political fuss that took place over the Gambling Act, I believe that the Government are reluctant to engage with gambling issues. When civil servants bring files on gambling to Ministers, many of them less knowledgeable than the sports Minister, they must be tempted to put them in a far-away tray, as they are fearful of engaging with gambling issues.</p>
	<p pid="a.245.0/8">It is some time since the Gambling Act was passed. I call upon the Government to defend our regulatory regime and to argue in Europe for tough codes that the whole of Europe will abide by. The situation will change worldwide, and I predict&mdash;perhaps I shall place an online bet&mdash;that, in President Obama's first term, US regulation and law will change, because arguments have already begun there about how prohibition does not work. Indeed, many of the problems with sports betting, which is completely unregulated in the US, and to which <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1744" name="Ian Gibson">the hon. Member for Norwich, North (Dr. Gibson)</phrase> referred, are far worse there than in the UK.</p>

	<p pid="a.246.1/1">I am a keen student of the Prime Minister's character and motivation, but I think that the hon. Gentleman is perhaps being a little unfair. I mentioned the revolution in betting tax; who abolished the betting tax, but the very same Prime Minister? I would not say, therefore, that that is the reason for the Government's reluctance. However, the hon. Gentleman was right to point out that many of the traditional bricks-and-mortar gambling firms, such as Ladbrokes and William Hill, are now as much into online gambling as anyone. The Government should be as vigorous in trying to open up European betting markets as they have been in opening up energy markets.</p>
	<p pid="a.246.1/2">We must face the fact that many of the traditional betting companies, such as those represented by the British Amusement Catering Trade Association, feel a little bruised, because while they have been very well regulated by the Gambling Commission, a large section of offshore online gambling has not. The commission should raise its game. We all look forward to the Hampton review, and I think that we have a friend in the Minister, but the Government need to engage with the issue much more than they have in recent years.</p>

	<p pid="a.246.3/1">It is a pleasure to be here with you, Mr. Wilshire. You will know from our conversation in Paris, last Friday, that I might have been in Azerbaijan right now. When I decided that I could not go, and discovered that we would be having this important debate, I realised that I had made the right decision, because this is an extremely important issue affecting many of our constituents&mdash;many more than perhaps we give credit for. The Chamber will know that I chaired the Joint Scrutiny Committee on the Gambling Act 2005 and that I am the chairman of the Responsibility in Gambling Trust, to which my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2023" name="Bob Neill">the Member for Bromley and Chislehurst (Robert Neill)</phrase>, whom I congratulate on securing this debate, referred. I was also a very strong supporter of the white list and, in particular, the Alderney Gambling Control Commission's successful application to be on it.</p>
	<p pid="a.246.3/2">Connected with online gambling are many issues, myths, facts and truths that are not fully appreciated. I want to focus on regulation. In the UK, the general consensus has been&mdash;the Joint Scrutiny Committee supported this view&mdash;that it was right that the Gambling Act sought to regulate the online gambling sector. However, as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1807" name="John Grogan">the hon. Member for Selby (Mr. Grogan)</phrase> just said, the majority of online operators have not been regulated in the UK, because of the level of tax. We should accept that and move on from that argument. We are where we are. The key question is: if online operators, based outside the UK, seek to exploit the British market, what regulatory arrangements are appropriate and possible to protect UK punters and consumers? What standards are appropriate in respect of consumer protection, the integrity of sport, to which a number of speakers referred, and the contributions made to organisations by UK operators, such as the levies to my trust, British horse racing and so forth?</p>
	<p pid="a.246.3/3">The white-list approach, to which my hon. Friend the Member for Bromley and Chislehurst referred, is based on the principle of equivalence of UK regulations for jurisdictions on the white list. It is based on very high standards in respect of the rights of consumers to complain and pursue their rights, of confidence that bets laid will be paid, of the integrity of the financial system being betted on, and of pre-agreed limits on gambling activity. Good, regulated sites do all those things already. Sites should deal with money-laundering regulations properly, and we should ensure that applicants for licences are fit and proper and that not everybody is given one. Furthermore, sites should provide for mystery shopping, to which he referred, and contribute to research, education and treatment. Those are licence conditions for UK operators. All that was agreed with the Alderney Gambling Control Commission and with the Isle of Man, which was white-listed about 18 months ago. I cannot speak for the agreement with Antigua, but I would be surprised if the same high standards had not been negotiated by the Minister and his team.</p>
	<p pid="a.246.3/4">Some colleagues mentioned sports betting. If there is haemorrhaging from the main UK industry, through betting shops or the Betfair site, a contribution should be made back to sport. That would be difficult to negotiate, but both main Opposition parties and the Government would be generally supportive. It is critical, however, to have proper memorandums of understanding on integrity and to ensure that suspicious betting patterns are reported. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1744" name="Ian Gibson">The hon. Member for Norwich, North (Dr. Gibson)</phrase> was right to refer to that.</p>
	<p pid="a.246.3/5">Everyone understands that the Gambling Act&mdash;this was the point of the white list&mdash;was designed to prohibit operators based outside the European economic area from operating in the UK by offering gambling services to UK consumers. However, the Government's view has always been that there is no legal basis for a ban on operators based in EEA jurisdictions. This is the nub of the problem. Not all other EU countries are quite so open: the Schaldemose report has been referred to, and a highly protectionist attitude exists in a number of other EU Governments, with the prohibition of online gambling altogether, which seems to be in clear breach of EU competition and internal market law. The Government should be more robust in pursuing the interests of British operators&mdash;colleagues have mentioned Betfair and Ladbrokes&mdash;which should be able to pursue the opportunities opened up by the internal market.</p>
	<p pid="a.246.3/6">A considerable number of online operators are based in other jurisdictions, especially in Malta and Gibraltar. In my three years as chairman of the RIGT, I have been arguing for common standards across Europe on all the issues that I have mentioned. In particular, I want contributions to research, education and treatment for problem gambling. A number of operators in Gibraltar and some of the biggest names in the online world make voluntary contributions already. The Minister knows that we have managed to agree with the industry that research, education and treatment will be funded to the tune of &pound;5 million a year for the next three years, and we look forward to him announcing, probably in April, after Easter, that he will agree to that.</p>
	<p pid="a.246.3/7">Consumer protection is paramount, but I despair at the lack of progress. It is not rocket science. More should be done by EU Governments. Instead of pursuing this protectionist, beggar-thy-neighbour, finger-in-the-dyke attitude, they should recognise that these activities will happen and protect their consumers through a common code and common standards. The RIGT created the GambleAware website, which has been visited by more than 350,000 people. Its purpose is to raise consumer awareness: to ensure that people understand how to bet on online sites, are aware of their rights and avoid becoming the problem gamblers of the future.</p>
	<p pid="a.246.3/8">My time is running out, Mr. Wilshire, but you and I are used to having to make brief contributions, and I have had rather more time today than I normally would have in Strasbourg. However, I will say in conclusion that gambling activity will occur. The issue is how we regulate it and how we get common standards. Above all else, if we are concerned, as my hon. Friend the Member for Bromley and Chislehurst was when he introduced the debate, to ensure that there is a safety net for people who have a problem with their gambling, we should be equally concerned to prevent people from becoming problem gamblers in the first place. That is the feature of the RIGT's work on which we must build. We must use some of this new money to raise awareness and improve education and prevention. Once again, I am grateful to my hon. Friend for giving us the opportunity to make these important points today.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-03-18a.248.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1391" speakername="Don Foster" colnum="248"  time="010:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090318/halltext/90318h0003.htm#09031893000473">
	<p pid="a.248.1/1">I am delighted to serve under your chairmanship, Mr. Wilshire. Like others, I wish to congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2023" name="Bob Neill">the hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst (Robert Neill)</phrase> on securing the debate and on his excellent contribution. I have enjoyed and learned from the contributions of many hon. Members. I particularly enjoyed hearing about how <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1807" name="John Grogan">the hon. Member for Selby (Mr. Grogan)</phrase> has looked after the inheritance bequeathed to him by his father.</p>
	<p pid="a.248.1/2">May I also say how delighted I am to be making my contribution immediately after <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1796" name="John Greenway">the hon. Member for Ryedale (Mr. Greenway)</phrase>? All Members of the House, regardless of party, owe him a great debt of gratitude for the enormous amount of work that he has done in this area and for his real commitment to addressing not only some of the many issues that have been raised but the concerns that many of us have about the large number of people who fall prey to the problems of gambling addiction. He is aware of the importance of education and research to prevent such addiction and of the work that is done to treat those who get into that sad condition.</p>
	<p pid="a.248.1/3">Internet gambling is very big business. It is estimated that there are about 6,500 such websites around the world. Sadly, 5,500 of those are in no way regulated. Only about 1,000 websites are regulated by one jurisdiction or another around the world. Punters spend about &pound;12.5 billion every year. Fortunately, some 80 per cent. of that is spent on a regulated website. We have real concern about the very large number of websites that are not regulated anywhere in the world.</p>
	<p pid="a.248.1/4">However we define online gambling, we have to acknowledge that it is at the harder end of gambling. Whether we look at the prevalence studies, the telephone calls made to the various helplines or the number of hits received by online support services, internet gambling comes very high on the list of those types of gambling that are likely to lead to addiction. Therefore, we are talking about the hard end of gambling. It is very big business, which, sadly, is largely unregulated.</p>
	<p pid="a.248.1/5">Much of the debate has rightly had to concentrate on areas in which there is regulation and in which we can have some influence. I am talking about the influence that we can have in Europe. Across Europe, far too many countries seem to be protectionist about their own gambling companies rather than being concerned about cross-EU regulation that would allow for the protection of people. I was disappointed with some of the discussions that took place in the lead-up to the debate in Europe on <phrase class="date" code="2009-03-10">10 March</phrase>. The European Parliament must consider some of these issues again and far more seriously, with a real concern about the problems that are being caused rather than about protecting individual companies.</p>
	<p pid="a.248.1/6">Moreover, we must consider some of those areas that have been touched on in the debate. I am grateful to the hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst for drawing our attention to the various concerns that I raised in an earlier debate in February and for pushing the Minister to get some of the answers that I, too, sought during that debate. Those who have studied that debate will know that we were debating white-listing. The hon. Gentleman rightly said that there were issues relating to those other jurisdictions outside the UK that are within the European economic area, and we must return to those. However, he rightly concentrated on those non-EEA jurisdictions that are deemed to be white-listed.</p>
	<p pid="a.248.1/7">To get white-listed status, a jurisdiction must prove to the Government that a set of regulatory standards are in place that are similar to and match the aims and objectives of our own regulatory regime. If a jurisdiction gets that status, they have the great benefit of being able to advertise their services within the United Kingdom. As a result, they will be able to pick up a large number of punters from the UK. About one in 10 adults in this country has been involved in some form of online gambling, whether it is through their computer, their mobile phone or their interactive television. Therefore, white-listed companies are given the privilege of being able to advertise within this country and, presumably, they get great benefit from it. We know that from some of the figures that we have seen.</p>
	<p pid="a.248.1/8">Some 11 per cent. of total worldwide internet betting&mdash;equivalent to about &pound;1.4 billion&mdash;comes from within the United Kingdom. Therefore, it is big business for white-listed countries. Yet, can we be convinced that we have done enough to secure the right deal with them, and that we are doing the right investigation to see that they are living up to the standards that we expect of them? We know that one third of internet gambling sites failed the earlier mystery shopper test, which could have allowed under-18s to gamble on those sites. More worryingly, since September 2007, the Gambling Commission&mdash;the body described as &quot;moving ahead gingerly&quot;&mdash;has done no mystery shopping in any of those white-listed jurisdictions. When we had the debate in February, the Minister assured us that mystery shopping was going to recommence in the near future. His word was&mdash;and he is a good user of this word&mdash;&quot;soon&quot;. My first question to the Minister is: can he tell us whether mystery shopping in white-listed jurisdictions has now begun? If not, when does he expect it to begin?</p>
	<p pid="a.248.1/9">When I asked the Minister how many prosecutions there had been, he was unable to answer. He has had over a month, so I am sure that he will now be able to tell the Chamber how many prosecutions there have been under the legislation in respect of this issue. Somewhat worryingly, he also said, in February, that he could not tell us what costs the United Kingdom has incurred as a result of the white-listing procedure. Again, he has had over a month. I am sure that in a few minutes he will tell us how much cost there has been.</p>
	<p pid="a.248.1/10">More significantly, I raised with the Minister the fact that if we were facing costs to enable white-listing, we had to have a mechanism of getting back some of that money. Therefore, will he please tell us how much we will get back, what the mechanism will be and what procedures will be put in place?</p>
	<p pid="a.248.1/11">Finally, in that debate, I said to the Minister that although there is a requirement in those jurisdictions to contribute to research, education and treatment, the contribution did not have to be to the United Kingdom. We have already heard from the hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst that all those operating out of the jurisdiction of Alderney currently contribute, as do a number from Gibraltar. I welcome that, but it is not compulsory. There should be a requirement to contribute, and I should like to know what the Minister is planning to do in that regard.</p>
	<p pid="a.248.1/12">In the minute or so left, may I also say to the Minister that I share the concerns about sports betting? Concerns have been growing ever since the Hansie Cronje case. I want to pay huge tribute to Betfair for the way in which it has been so open&mdash;desperate almost&mdash;to work with governing bodies to pass on information. Others are now doing so. Of the 47 cases investigated by the Gambling Commission, 35 arose as a result of information from gambling companies. I welcome the fact that they are acting.</p>
	<p pid="a.248.1/13">Will the Minister acknowledge that gambling on the internet is growing? I suggest that it is growing for two reasons. The first is that more people have access to computers, but the second&mdash;this is my concern&mdash;is that the Government have failed to act quickly in respect of softer gambling, whether in supporting bingo, as they did belatedly, or in sorting out stakes and prizes, which they are also doing belatedly. By creating problems at the softer end of gambling, the Government are driving more people towards the harder end, whether it is fixed-odds terminals in betting shops or internet gambling. I urge him to say that he will consider regulation, white-listing and issues within the EEA and European Union. However, he must recognise that action on softer forms of gambling is also important, and I urge him to continue considering that as well.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-03-18a.251.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1437" speakername="Tobias Ellwood" colnum="251"  time="010:41:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090318/halltext/90318h0003.htm#09031893000474">
	<p pid="a.251.0/1">It is a pleasure to participate in this important debate. I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2023" name="Bob Neill">the Member for Bromley and Chislehurst (Robert Neill)</phrase> on securing it and on his opening remarks. It is interesting that almost every one of us who has spoken began by admitting an interest in gambling, in some form or another, at a younger age.</p>
	<p pid="a.251.0/2">The debate touches on the bigger issue of internet use, which cannot be underestimated. It affects every walk of life. Its impact is considerable and permanent. It is changing how society functions. The 9 o'clock watershed is anathema on the internet. It does not happen. The internet does not sleep; it is always there, and it is challenging some of our values as a society. That obviously applies to the subject that we are discussing.</p>
	<p pid="a.251.0/3">The Conservative approach is simple. We support forms of gambling with the correct level of legislation, whether they are penny arcades, bingo, land-based casinos or on the internet. We should see gambling as a form of entertainment, where one is likely to lose, rather than a form of investment, where one thinks one might win. People who go in with that approach will not go far wrong.</p>
	<p pid="a.251.0/4">The problem we face, however, is that the playing field out there is uneven, a fact emphasised by a number of hon. Members. The UK approach is to allow internet companies to list in three ways: directly through the UK, through the so-called white list of countries&mdash;I will come to the introduction of Antigua and Barbuda a couple of weeks ago&mdash;and through the European economic area. In each of those cases, we find different standards for the level of gaming required. That cannot be right. Surely there should be one acceptable level agreed by all member states in the EU and any other jurisdiction with an interest in advertising here in the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.251.0/5">The EU market is flawed. In Germany, for example, internet gambling is outlawed entirely. In France, Sweden, Austria and other countries, it is nationalised to the point that UK companies cannot get into the market; in fact, it is illegal for them to try. By contrast, Unibet, an Austrian company, advertises and operates freely in the UK, whereas any UK company would run into severe problems getting into Austria. Le Croupier, a French-based company, is setting up in the UK, taking advantage of our open market while enjoying a monopoly back home. Surely that cannot be right. The recent Schaldemose report, by an EU committee with which the Minister should be familiar, endorsed the uneven playing field. It was British MEPs alone&mdash;I think they were Conservative MEPs&mdash;who put in a minority report to say, &quot;This isn't the way forward. This isn't what we should be doing.&quot; I hope the Minister will be able to comment.</p>
	<p pid="a.251.0/6">The scale of the problem is huge. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1391" name="Don Foster">The hon. Member for Bath (Mr. Foster)</phrase> and I may have slightly different statistics, but they amount to the same thing. I understand that there are 7,000 internet gambling companies online, about 6,000 of which are unauthorised. The Government seem happy to sit idly by while nothing is done to stop the surge of unregulated online gambling. With each year that passes, more people become addicted to such sites, which offer little consumer protection, an issue on which my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1796" name="John Greenway">the Member for Ryedale (Mr. Greenway)</phrase> has done much work. I offer my support for the evolution taking place through the Responsibility in Gambling Trust to ensure that research, education and treatment are given the respect and finance that they deserve.</p>
	<p pid="a.251.0/7">The 2007 prevalence study indicates the growth of internet gambling. Internet gambling alone is at 7.4 per cent., but spread betting is at the worrying level of 14.7 per cent. I met representatives of the Financial Services Authority&mdash;oddly enough, spread betting is overseen not by the Gambling Commission but by the FSA&mdash;who were not aware of any of the good work done by my hon. Friend the Member for Ryedale. They were not aware of the importance of ensuring a safety net for people. In fact, they were not even aware that there were spread betting operations in the UK that are not registered here and that they should be examining. The Minister needs to recognise that closer co-operation is needed between the Gambling Commission and the FSA to ensure that all bases are covered. Companies are slipping through the gap.</p>
	<p pid="a.251.0/8">The Gambling Commission also seems unable to cope with simple policing of the internet, as the hon. Member for Bath pointed out. I am curious to know whether the mystery shopping approach of visiting various websites to ensure that they meet standards has recommenced. I would also like to know how much it costs the Gambling Commission. I understand&mdash;I do not know whether it is true&mdash;that about one third of all sites, even British-registered ones, do not meet the standards required. The reasons may be technical rather than due to the full corruption we see at the worst end of the scale, but nevertheless, if we have minimum standards, surely they should be met.</p>

	<p pid="a.253.1/1">Will the Minister examine the relationship between the FSA and the Gambling Commission to ensure that a better relationship is developed on spread betting, which has an appalling 14.7 per cent. of problem gamblers? Finally, will he consider the Conservative proposal for a kitemark on UK-approved sites, so that users will know straight away whether a site plays by the high standards that we expect, and that when they sign on, the seven other people at the virtual table are not in fact all the same person but are genuine players?</p>
	<p pid="a.253.1/2">Those are the type of standards that we want to introduce. There should be a link between a company's ability to advertise and the high standards that we expect, so that the many internet companies with which many of us have good relationships are allowed to continue what they are doing, without the threat posed to them by rogue companies that choose to exploit those poor-quality rules.</p>
	<p pid="a.253.1/3">In conclusion, when Tim Berners-Lee created the worldwide web he introduced an invention that has arguably had a bigger impact than John Logie Baird's television or Marconi's radio. People of all ages in every corner of the country are exposed through the internet to information or opportunities, many of them financial, which would have seemed unimaginable just 30 years ago. The internet certainly can be a very positive tool, but unless legislation keeps pace with its evolution it can be used as a most efficient and powerful tool to exploit the user.</p>
	<p pid="a.253.1/4">I hope that the Minister, who is responsible for what happens in just a small slice of the internet spectrum, will acknowledge how far behind legislation is and also how unfair EU legislation is, to allow genuine online gambling companies, which are willing to meet high standards and indeed already meet them, to operate in a free but fair competitive market.</p>

	<p pid="a.253.2/1">Thank you, Mr. Wilshire. It is indeed a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship.</p>
	<p pid="a.253.2/2">I want to congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2023" name="Bob Neill">the hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst (Robert Neill)</phrase> on introducing the debate and for the spirit in which he did so. I congratulate him on the points that he raised and I will try to respond to all the points that hon. Members have raised. As time often runs out on these occasions, if I am not able to address a point made by a hon. Member, I will ensure that I write to them with a detailed response. I can tell <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1391" name="Don Foster">the hon. Member for Bath (Mr. Foster)</phrase> that he will shortly&mdash;&quot;soon&quot;, even&mdash;receive a letter with the answers he requires.</p>
	<p pid="a.253.2/3">It has been an informative debate. The Government take gambling regulation and protection of the public extremely seriously. I am grateful to hon. Members for their comments. This is an issue that I care passionately about. Indeed, today I will be meeting the Association of British Bookmakers to hear its concerns about some of the issues that have been discussed here this morning.</p>
	<p pid="a.253.2/4">The Gambling Act 2005 was the largest overhaul of gambling regulations in more than 40 years. It ensured that remote gambling was brought firmly within the robust regulatory framework that we had created. Gambling via the internet is still a relatively new phenomenon and one that poses unique regulatory and social policy challenges.</p>
	<p pid="a.253.2/5">The latest Gambling Commission figures show that 9.7 per cent. of people gambled online between March 2008 and December 2008, compared to 8.8 per cent. of people during 2007. However, when we take out the number of people who participate in the national lottery online, those figures fall to 5.6 per cent. in 2008, compared to 5.2 per cent. in 2007.</p>
	<p pid="a.253.2/6">The hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst asked what is being done to deal with the growth in problem gambling among online gamblers. The Gambling Commission's 2007 prevalence study, which has already been mentioned today, showed that 7.7 per cent. of people who bet online and 7.3 per cent. of those who play casino or poker games online could be categorised as problem gamblers. However, that 2007 study was the first to include questions relating to online gambling, so the evidence to date that indicates a growth in problem gambling among online gamblers is not certain in that sense.</p>
	<p pid="a.253.2/7">It has never been possible to say that one particular form of gambling is the cause of problem gambling. The 2007 prevalence study found that, on average, problem gamblers participated in more than six forms of gambling, so we are not talking about just one form of gambling; different types are involved. It thus becomes extremely difficult to single out any particular forms of gambling that are especially related to problem gambling.</p>
	<p pid="a.253.2/8">The hon. Members for Bath (Mr. Foster) and for Bournemouth, East (Mr. Ellwood) quoted statistics showing the number of online sites involved. They said that there were 6,000 sites. Industry sources tell us that there are 2,381 sites run by 493 companies licensed in 50 jurisdictions worldwide. so there are some discrepancies in the figures that we are using.</p>

	<p pid="a.254.0/1">I must make the specific point that those companies are licensed in other countries. Many companies that are based on the internet are not licensed anywhere. That is the point that I think that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1391" name="Don Foster">the hon. Member for Bath (Mr. Foster)</phrase> and I are trying to make. Someone can set up an internet company anywhere in the world, if they can get an internet service provider with access to the worldwide web. Those are the companies that are not authorised and that are threatening the good companies that are authorised.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-03-18a.255.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1441" speakername="Gerry Sutcliffe" colnum="255"  time="010:51:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090318/halltext/90318h0004.htm#09031893000481">
	<p pid="a.255.0/1">I understand that point. I purely wanted to say that there are disputes about the number of sites involved. None the less, I accept the point that the hon. Gentleman is making. Furthermore, regardless of the number of sites we still need to ensure that funding for research, education and treatment for all problem gamblers is one of our top priorities. I am grateful for the work that has been done by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1796" name="John Greenway">the hon. Member for Ryedale (Mr. Greenway)</phrase> and for all that he has done in helping us to secure the &pound;15 million that we require over the next three years to ensure that there is comprehensive provision in that area, and I look forward to making announcements about it shortly&mdash;just after Easter. Again, I congratulate the hon. Gentleman on all the work that he has done.</p>
	<p pid="a.255.0/2">Although the Gambling Commission's figures show that the popularity of online gambling is growing at a relatively steady level, the issue seems to cause, in equal measure, interest and alarm across the world. As has been said already, just last week the European Parliament adopted a controversial report on the integrity of online gambling, despite concerns and objections from a number of MPs, MEPs and the remote gambling industry, in respect of the report's impartiality and factual accuracy. Indeed, we briefed British MEPs on the Government's position.</p>
	<p pid="a.255.0/3">I know that hon. Members are aware of the changing landscape of gambling regulation in Europe, which has been brought about by the European Commission's numerous infringement proceedings against member states that prohibit online gambling from overseas without sufficient justification. As has been said, there is no harmonisation in the regulation of online gambling across the European Union. Gambling was excluded from the scope of the services directive, which means that member states have the latitude to regulate gambling as they see fit, albeit within the parameters of European Community law.</p>
	<p pid="a.255.0/4">All those issues demonstrate how important it is for us, as a Government, to ensure that we view remote gambling as an international, cross-border activity and that we continue to take steps to maintain the protection of the British public in a technologically fast-paced and ever-changing regulatory environment. That can be achieved in a number of ways. For example, we can provide greater education for consumers and increase their awareness of what to look out for when gambling on sites that may be regulated outside the UK. Protection can also be achieved through increased regulatory standards and enhanced international co-operation, which is something that the Gambling Commission is doing through its work with the Gaming Regulators European Forum and the International Association of Gaming Regulators.</p>
	<p pid="a.255.0/5">There seemed to be some criticism of the Gambling Commission. My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1744" name="Ian Gibson">the Member for Norwich, North (Dr. Gibson)</phrase> raised a point about integrity issues. I have asked the Gambling Commission to examine more closely how it deals with such issues. Integrity is a big issue, but there must be a good relationship between sport and the bookmakers. I think that good relationship is evidenced by the number of reports that have been made about betting patterns. None the less, it is an issue that I have taken up with the Gambling Commission and I will report back to hon. Members in due course about the aims we are trying to achieve and the process involved.</p>
	<p pid="a.255.0/6">There remains a key role for Government in keeping our policies and regulations under regular review, to ensure that they continue to be effective in the light of both international and domestic developments. As has been said, we must keep a close eye on developments in Europe, the United States and beyond in respect of how remote gambling is approached and regulated, in order to determine any policy implications for the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.255.0/7">There may be more we can do to put overseas operators that are able to advertise their gambling services in the UK on a more equal footing with British-based operators licensed by the Gambling Commission. As has been pointed out, during the recent debate on the advertising of foreign gambling I said that I would reflect upon a number of issues, in particular the contributions made by overseas operators towards research, education and treatment for problem gambling in the UK. It is only right that I should look at such issues and concerns, and in the coming months I intend to set out the process of how we will undertake to ensure that we get a return from those operators.</p>
	<p pid="a.255.0/8">Like other Members, I would like to see a fairer playing field for British-based operators in Europe. The Government are committed to the principles of freedom of establishment and freedom to provide services that are enshrined in the European Community treaty, and we have been active in supporting the UK gambling industry in recent months. For instance, last year the Minister for Trade, Development and Consumer Affairs and I wrote to Commissioner McCreevy about issues affecting the freedom of UK companies to operate in Europe. My officials have also attended key events in Europe to promote the benefits of the UK system of regulation, including the council working groups dedicated to studying gambling under the French presidency. We will continue to participate actively in European gambling discussions under the Czech presidency and beyond, identifying appropriate opportunities to share the achievements of the UK model with other member states. However, when we are conducting ourselves in Europe, we must be sure that we utilise the most appropriate and effective way to engage with European institutions and other member states, given the political and cultural sensitivities surrounding gambling.</p>
	<p pid="a.255.0/9">I understand the frustration felt by British businesses that pride themselves on their social responsibility standards but who are unable to offer their services within Europe when other European operators are free to offer their services in the UK. In particular, there is the issue involving Betfair. I understand the frustration felt by Betfair and Ladbrokes, but we looked at the issue very seriously, to try to make sure that it was appropriate for us to intervene. On reflection, it was not appropriate for us to intervene in that way and we had to look at the wider issues affecting gambling in the UK. I know that is frustrating for hon. Members.</p>
	<p pid="a.255.0/10">In the time that is left for the debate, I am not able to give the detailed responses on white-listing procedures that the hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst would like, but I will write to him to respond to his questions.</p>

	<p pid="a.259.1/1">The evidence from Sheffield Wednesday's Hillsborough stadium, a year ago, shows that water does not drain away from even professional pitches, never mind many community sports pitches. However, my hon. Friend is absolutely right to note that many sports clubs are very small, and are often run by groups of parents to support their children. That is a valid and important point.</p>
	<p pid="a.259.1/2">A rugby club in Cheshire has seen its drainage charges increase from &pound;796 to &pound;4,193.40. The issue has also been raised by sports clubs in my constituency, because it is affecting them to such an extent. United Utilities customers have been worst hit by the increases, although the company has at least announced a one-year moratorium, which means that their sports club customers will be charged at 2007-08 levels this year. However, we need a long-term solution to the problem, because a one-year moratorium will not solve it in the long term.</p>
	<p pid="a.259.1/3">We need a solution that will resolve the difficulties of all community sports clubs. The starting point for that must surely be to recognise that it is unfair that non-commercial organisations such as community sports clubs should be charged the same as commercial organisations for utility services. To assume otherwise fails to recognise the benefit that non-commercial organisations bring to the wider community. If we believe that principle to be right, we should legislate to create a new category of community building, similar to the arrangements for council tax charges. Buildings such as sports clubs, village halls and churches would then be charged lower fees for services such as water drainage. I feel strongly that the category should apply to other utility services, such as gas and electricity, and I await the Minister's comments on that issue.</p>
	<p pid="a.259.1/4">Utility charges are not the only issue concerning community sports clubs, for they also struggle with the cost of Performing Rights Society licences. Sports clubs do not only offer buildings, equipment and other facilities that allow people to participate in sport. They are also social hubs, where music plays a vital role in creating an atmosphere for social intercourse and engagement between members. We all remember the days when major works sports and social clubs created a great atmosphere in which workers could come together after participating in sport. In Stocksbridge, in my constituency, the entire sports structure, which is incredibly impressive, sprang from the works sports and social club.</p>
	<p pid="a.259.1/5">The average cost of a Performing Rights Society licence for a sports club is &pound;369, but many sports clubs use music only incidentally and are at a loss to understand why they should pay &pound;369 to hear programme theme tunes, or tunes during commercial breaks. Where clubs or other organisations choose to use music for income-generation purposes, it is reasonable for them to pay directly for that usage, but where the licence is payable because the club has a television or pay-per-view licence, the use of music is not of the club's choosing and the broadcaster will already have paid for the rights. Such incidental broadcasting of music does not compromise the rights of copyright owners, so requiring sports clubs to purchase PRS licences in those circumstances is excessive regulation and means that there is double payment.</p>
	<p pid="a.259.1/6">Unfortunately, things could get worse. The UK Intellectual Property Office is reviewing who should pay for Phonographic Performance Ltd licences. The PRS licence relates to songwriters, composers and publishers, whereas the PPL licence relates to the owners of the recorded music in question. The risk is that community sports clubs could end up having to pay for both licences. If 151,000 sports clubs were required to purchase PPL licences, at an average cost of between &pound;104 and &pound;163, the cost to voluntary sport would be between &pound;15.7 million and &pound;24.6 million. Such staggering sums could significantly undermine the work that the Government, Sport England and the clubs are doing to build the profile of sport and engagement in it, and to deliver the world-class community sports system that we want.</p>
	<p pid="a.259.1/7">The Intellectual Property Office proposals need to be changed to reflect the absolutely legitimate concerns of grass-roots community sports. Instead of extending the requirement to acquire a PRS licence to PPL licences, it is firmly in the public interest to extend the recording rights exemption currently available to not-for-profit organisations with regard to the PPL licence to include copyrights vested in music and lyrics&mdash;in other words, the PRS licence. The organisations we are talking about provide valuable community benefits and their use of music as defined in the exemptions does not compromise the interests of copyright holders. Extending the exemption currently available on PPL to PRS&mdash;rather than extending the requirements for sport clubs to take the PPL licence&mdash;would also remove the anomaly arising from the partial exemption that currently exists.</p>
	<p pid="a.259.1/8">I suggest to my hon. Friend the Minister that the exemption should also be drafted to apply to amateur sports clubs, whether they are registered as charities or not. That is an important point because voluntary sports clubs are clearly a special case, as defined by the rental and lending directive. That has been recognised on numerous occasions both by the European Commission and the European Court of Justice.</p>
	<p pid="a.259.1/9">The point about amateur sports clubs relates to what my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1694" name="Andy Reed">the Member for Loughborough (Mr. Reed)</phrase> said earlier. Many clubs are very small and it is not always realistic for them to go through the process of gaining charitable status. However, those clubs more than other types of club would probably suffer from the burden of having to purchase those licences. The proposed income threshold of &pound;20,000 as the eligibility for exemption should be removed, otherwise it has been calculated that 37,750 sports clubs will need to purchase PPL licences. That would result in an estimated annual loss to community sport of between &pound;3.9 million and &pound;6.1 million.</p>
	<p pid="a.259.1/10">Finally, I shall answer the obvious outstanding question: are there no circumstances in which sports clubs should be expected to pay for both licences to protect the interests of songwriters, composers and owners of recorded music rights? I agree that if a sports club runs a disco for profit, it should purchase licences. However, the way forward is to introduce a choice-and-purpose test as the basis for charging and to recognise, for example, that a rowing club that plays a CD when people are warming up is very different from a sports club that holds a disco to raise money for a summer campaign. There is a clear distinction. Under the choice-and-purpose model, equitable remuneration would be due where the user has chosen to use music to generate income. The CCPR and I believe that would be compatible with the aim of the rental and lending directive, and would ensure a proper balance between the rights of copyright holders and the interests of users. I look forward to hearing the Minister's response to the points I have raised.</p>

	<p pid="a.262.2/1">I have some sympathy with what my hon. Friend says, but far be it from me, as sports Minister, to impinge on the jurisdiction of colleagues in other Departments. As I said, I have some sympathy with what she has said, but we should reflect on the new changes in the sporting environment that we have instituted as a Government&mdash;for example, the Youth Sport Trust deals with school and youth sport, Sport England deals with whole sport plans though governing bodies, and UK Sport deals with professional and elite sport. An opportunity is needed to consider how we can support various sectors, particularly community sport, in the light of whole sport plans.</p>
	<p pid="a.262.2/2">I will take away the issues that my hon. Friend has raised today and consider in greater detail how we can ensure that community clubs fit into those structures. As <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1694" name="Andy Reed">the hon. Member for Loughborough (Mr. Reed)</phrase> said, there are variants&mdash;the term &quot;sports club&quot; can mean different things to different people. We have to strike a balance and make sure that the clubs about which my hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield, Hillsborough is talking&mdash;the small dedicated clubs that are below a certain threshold&mdash;are looked after and protected by the sports themselves to start off with. However, anything that we can do to help should be done.</p>

	<p pid="a.263.0/1">I wish to make an important point. As my hon. Friend knows, I have a long history of involvement with the CASC scheme&mdash;I introduced a ten-minute Bill on it seven or eight years ago. We have a fantastic opportunity to build on the scheme, but there are other areas that we need to deal with, for example, the campaign that has been run on gift aid for junior subscriptions. Community sports clubs always seem to fall into a strange category that does not really relate to any of the other categories. It would be useful if we, as the sporting community, could finally get some agreement across Departments about where community sports clubs generally sit in relation to all the different categories. CASC has helped with some tax issues and with rate relief, but community sport still falls between the arts, sport and other community organisations in relation to other matters.</p>

	<p pid="a.263.1/1">My hon. Friend is talking about the CCPR campaign &quot;Subs for Clubs&quot;, which has been taken up at our annual visit to the Treasury. It is on the list of issues that the Department for Culture, Media and Sport wants to have agreed. As yet we have won the argument, in the wider sense, but not the money, which is slightly frustrating. However, generally, and not just because of today's debate, I shall reflect on what we can do about the smaller clubs, because of the services that they provide throughout our communities.</p>
	<p pid="a.263.1/2">One big task we must undertake is to increase the number of coaches. They are expensive and small clubs cannot afford them, so we shall have to consider methods of funding, and how small clubs can become involved with increasing the number of coaches in the wider range of sports that we shall have to offer for people to enjoy.</p>

	<p pid="a.263.4/1">Is not the other crucial point that my hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield, Hillsborough is making that there is little point in the Government's teeming money in through whatever mechanism we are talking about if it is then ladled out from clubs through utility and licence costs, and the various other continuing cost outlets that my hon. Friend wants to close?</p>

	<p pid="a.263.5/1">Yes; you, Mr. Wilshire, have heard Governments talk about joined-up government, and we all believe in that. The reality is that sometimes the silo effect operates with unintended consequences. That is something that we want to think about, particularly in the present difficult times. Most clubs, in the present economic circumstances, are as fearful as everyone else, and we must find ways to support them.</p>
	<p pid="a.263.5/2">A good example of such support is the action that we have taken on free swimming. We managed to get several Departments to work together on free swimming for the over-60s and the aspiration towards free swimming for under-16s. Each Department could understand the impact that that programme would have on its intended objective, and how everyone could benefit. I agree that we need to take a view across Government, nationally and locally, to see what can be done to ensure that, as my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1770" name="Paul Truswell">the Member for Pudsey (Mr. Truswell)</phrase> says, while we pour money in to support sport we do not let it go out again because of taxation or utility or other costs.</p>
	<p pid="a.263.5/3">Whole sport plans will be important, because the national governing bodies will deliver. We want, through the new strategy, to deal with issues about the capacity of governing bodies. I believe in the whole sport plans and I intend to have meetings with several governing bodies soon, as we start to develop and make progress with the plans, about issues such as how the money is getting to the smaller, junior clubs that are the grass roots and that help all sports to develop. I want to know what the governing bodies are doing to ensure that we can attend to the relevant questions.</p>
	<p pid="a.263.5/4">In the time that is left I want to comment on points raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield, Hillsborough about music licences and performing rights. She is aware of the balance that is needed in matters of copyright and protection for people's creative abilities. However, she is also right that there are circumstances in which those matters should be taken care of for smaller clubs, or clubs that have difficulties. She has mentioned issues arising from PRS and PPL licence rights. I know that she is aware of the consultation on PRS licences; I understand that comments about the draft code should be made by <phrase class="date" code="2009-05-01">1 May</phrase>. I shall reflect on what my hon. Friend has said today about what responses we can make to the issues she has raised.</p>
	<p pid="a.263.5/5">As Minister with responsibility for licensing I am always aware of relevant matters in the creative world such as temporary event notices or such things as my hon. Friend has discussed. It is necessary to find a balance that covers the possibilities and includes the views of people who are in proximity to clubs when events take place. My hon. Friend is right to say that those are often small occasions that provide opportunities for people to get into the clubs. We intend to respond, across Government, to the consultation that closed on <phrase class="date" code="2009-03-11">11 March</phrase>. Ministers will consider the responses, and I undertake to work with colleagues in other Departments to see what we can do to bring about a positive response, as my hon. Friend discussed.</p>
	<p pid="a.263.5/6">If, as my hon. Friend suggested, there is a need for primary legislation, there will be a difficulty because of the time scale of the current Session, but that should not prevent people from considering what is possible. I congratulate my hon. Friend on securing the debate. She made some important points, to which I shall give consideration.</p>

	<p pid="a.265.2/1">I think that this is the first time that I have had the pleasure and honour of serving under your chairmanship, Mr. Jones. It is a great pleasure to be under your tutelage and guidance for this one and a half hour debate that I have managed to secure on primary care trust health funding.</p>
	<p pid="a.265.2/2">It would be remiss if we did not first put into context just where we are at present, and how far we have travelled in the past 10 or 11 years. We should remember that just before the 1997 election, my party said that we had 24 hours to save the national health service. When we look back at some of the things that have happened since that time, we can see that it was not an idle boast and that we have actually achieved it.</p>
	<p pid="a.265.2/3">One of the first things that we did, of course, was to ensure that we increased the pay of nurses, doctors, auxiliaries and technicians so that they no longer had to scratch around looking for jobs and additional work outside the health service. We put in place proper career structures so that they could see that there was progression from one post to another right the way through, and, much more important than all of that, we put many more staff in all sections and categories in the NHS.</p>
	<p pid="a.265.2/4">The effect of those changes has been dramatic: waiting lists are down dramatically and waiting times have almost been eliminated. In Wigan borough, the time between going to a doctor and seeing a consultant is down to 18 weeks. I doubt if it could get much shorter than that.</p>
	<p pid="a.265.2/5">When we compare the present with the years between 1979 and 1997, we see that improvements have been made. Forty-hour waits on trolleys in accident and emergency were not unusual. They were highlighted in the papers all the time. People were forced to go to private practice not because they wanted to but simply because they could not bear to see themselves or their families continue in ill health and in pain. They could not wait the two to three years that it often took before they could see a consultant, let alone get treatment. We had the unenviable and disgraceful situation of workers in other areas going out on strike to support nurses who were trying to get a decent wage for themselves. All that happened between 1979 and 1997, and we have managed to overcome it.</p>
	<p pid="a.265.2/6">Probably the worst thing of all was the Black report, smuggled out on the eve of a bank holiday so that it would not get into the papers and would not be discussed, even in Parliament. When it came out, it was totally ignored by the Government of the time. Why was it ignored? Because it showed the disgraceful health inequalities that existed in our country. Not only that, it demanded action.</p>
	<p pid="a.265.2/7">The improvements at every level since 1997 are absolutely huge. Let me list a few of the improvements that we have seen in the Wigan borough. We have a walk-in centre at Leigh and a new A and E and trauma centre at Wigan hospital. We have a new cardiovascular unit, and an orthopaedic centre at Wrightington hospital. Just to remind Members, Wrightington was where the first ever hip replacement operations in this country were carried out. It is a world centre for orthopaedics and it has been improved. We have the Thomas Linacre out-patient centre, and, if all that does not work, we also have a new mortuary.</p>
	<p pid="a.265.2/8">All those new facilities and all the additional staff&mdash;consultants, doctors, nurses, technicians and auxiliaries&mdash;have led to dramatic improvements in the health of the people of Wigan and the entire country. We have also seen improvements in primary care, which is vitally important. We have new general practitioner-led health centres, which do away with GP surgeries in two-up, two-down houses with no parking facilities, no disabled access and no facilities to do anything other than the most basic of investigations.</p>
	<p pid="a.265.2/9">There are new polyclinics. One is at Boston house, only a quarter of a mile from where I live. A renal dialysis unit, physiotherapy and mental health services, GPs and pharmacists are all in one centre. People can go there and get proper treatment in one place. Others polyclinics are at Clare house, and in Ince and Leigh, and there are many more to come. They are hugely important in improving access to primary health care and the level of service. They offer a massive range of services that will improve people's health&mdash;there is absolutely no doubt about that.</p>
	<p pid="a.265.2/10">However, we know that despite all those improvements, health inequalities still exist. Not only do they still exist but they have not really improved much in the past 10 years. Both the Secretary of State and the Minister are anxious to do something about that, and we want to help them to reduce health inequalities dramatically. When the current Secretary of State was appointed, he made it an absolute priority. He often quotes the statistic that for every station one passes on the Jubilee line going east from Westminster, people's life expectancy decreases by one year. He stated:</p>
	<p pid="a.265.2/11" class="indent">&quot;People in poorer areas, with lower life expectancy, have always had the least access to primary care. Cambridgeshire has more than twice as many doctors as Manchester, and men in Cambridgeshire will live six years longer.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.265.2/12">That is not acceptable in a modern society, and it is not acceptable in the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.265.2/13">I welcome the many initiatives that have been put in place by the Secretary of State and his predecessors to tackle health inequalities: the healthy towns initiative, spearhead PCTs, the extra GP surgeries that are going into my constituency and many other under-doctored constituencies right across the country, and the open access GP surgeries that will be provided as well.</p>
	<p pid="a.265.2/14">However, welcome as those things are, I do not think that they will actually solve the problem. There needs to be more recognition that initiatives should be backed up by more and more core funding in areas with health inequalities. That has been recognised: one of the first things that the present Secretary of State did when he took office was to ask the Advisory Committee on Resource Allocation to look at the formula for dividing up health funding.</p>

	<p pid="a.267.0/1">It is probably true that the Secretary of State inherited the decision. Nevertheless, what I was about to say was that having inherited the need to look at the formula, the Secretary of State told ACRA that it needed to ensure that the formula more accurately represented the health inequalities that exist in areas, and that the funding and weighting of various elements within the formula more accurately reflected them.</p>

	<p pid="a.267.2/1">I accept that. My hon. Friend makes an important point, and I could say the same about my constituency, which, broadly speaking, is very deprived. We have super-output areas in the most deprived 3 per cent. of areas, but equally, we have super-output areas that are above average for quality of life. They are within easy walking distance of each other, so I recognise the issue. However, it would not be fair to tell the Secretary of State for Health that he must ensure that funding reaches such areas; locally, people should be able to make allocations dependent upon need. That is why it is important for the primary care trust to get the right amount of money and to put it into the areas that need it, both in my hon. Friend's constituency and in mine, so that it goes to Pemberton&mdash;sorry, I do not know the equivalent area in her constituency&mdash;rather than to Standish and Shevington, which have fewer health needs. The PCT, given proper direction by the Secretary of State, must tackle health inequalities with its allocations.</p>

	<p pid="a.269.0/1">I accept that inner cities, particularly London and many of our other major cities, have major problems. They have transient populations; people do not register for whatever reason and the Office for National Statistics has problems ensuring accuracy in the number of people it counts. I recognise all that and hope that ACRA, when it compiles its report and tries to ensure that PCTs get the right amount of money, takes it into account. Importantly, we must have a formula that is as accurate as possible and reflects the real needs of areas. If it does not, I advise my hon. Friend to apply for a Westminster Hall debate, so that she can make her points in more detail. I have no desire whatever to take money away from areas that have major problems; I want to ensure that areas such as mine, Cornwall and others, which have significant underfunding difficulties, are properly funded.</p>
	<p pid="a.269.0/2">Returning to the point that the hon. Member for St. Ives made about allocations, I should say that the average allocation was 11.3 per cent. over two years, which is a welcome and significant increase in funding. There is no doubt whatever that throughout the country the health service has been transformed over the years and will continue to be transformed by the amount of money going into it. The other aspect of the allocation was that at the end of the two years no PCT would be at a distance of more than 6.2 per cent. from its target&mdash;the position of the PCT in Cornwall and many others. To ensure that those PCTs were brought up to 6.2 per cent., there had to be a floor of 10.6 per cent.; in other words, no authority would have its allocation reduced by more than 0.7 per cent.&mdash;the difference between the 11.3 per cent. average allocation and their 10.6 per cent. allocation.</p>
	<p pid="a.269.0/3">I support the principle of floors. When huge changes must be made to PCT funding or, indeed, to any Government funding, it is right that they are managed properly. However, when the floor becomes so large, at 10.6 per cent., and the differences so huge, great problems are created. If the floor becomes too high and is coupled with PCTs that are massively over-target, it will take far too long under a pace-of-change formula for areas such as mine and those represented by other Members present today both to get the money to which they are entitled, and for authorities to get down to such figures.</p>
	<p pid="a.269.0/4">One of the first speeches that the Secretary of State made when he took office was to the annual conference of local authority children's and adults' services directors in October 2008. He said that local authorities were</p>
	<p pid="a.269.0/5" class="indent">&quot;uniquely positioned to play a major role in tackling the wider determinants of poor health, such as housing and transport, not to mention schools and children's services... in partnership with the NHS&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.269.0/6">I agree. The PCTs and local authorities are working together, pooling resources and personnel. The public health director in Wigan, for example, is a joint appointment between the local authority and the PCT. That is replicated in many areas throughout the country. It is important that that happens.</p>
	<p pid="a.269.0/7">The problem arises where the local authority is as underfunded as the health authority&mdash;the PCT. For example, for 2010-11 Wigan is almost &pound;5.5 million&mdash;or 3.9 per cent.&mdash;below the amount that the Department for Communities and Local Government says it is entitled to under the formula. Hull is just over &pound;7 million below, which is 4.5 per cent; yet Richmond in London is &pound;18.5 million overfunded&mdash;a massive 193.8 per cent. When the &quot;Supporting People&quot; programme is added, Wigan is again underfunded to the tune of &pound;5.5 million and Hull is underfunded by &pound;2.3 million. The &quot;Supporting People&quot; programme is important and is trying to ensure that people are able to remain for as long as possible in their own homes, rather than having to go into more expensive and less desirable nursing homes, or other homes, and sometimes even into hospital. If we can get people out of those places and that is what they want, it is a cheaper and better solution all round. &quot;Supporting People&quot; is a good programme, but when it is underfunded, local authorities are underfunded and PCTs are underfunded too, there is a triple whammy of inability to supply the resources to satisfy the various health needs in the area.</p>
	<p pid="a.269.0/8">I just want to touch on the figures in the recent PCT allocations. I shall mention Wigan again, for obvious reasons. At the end of the two years we move &pound;56,000 closer to our target, with the distance from target being &pound;25,381,000. Using simple arithmetic, we can see that it will take us 453 years to achieve the target. I suspect that I will not be around then, but I take some comfort from the fact that looking at the issue in percentage terms, we would move 0.2 per cent. closer in the two years in question and we will only be 4.5 per cent. below. That will take only 22.5 years to achieve. I doubt whether I will be in the House then, but there is a chance that I will still be around to see that happen.</p>

	<p pid="a.270.1/1">Again, the hon. Gentleman is pinching my lines. His point is valid and important. The problem with underfunding, when it lasts for so long, is that it is not just &pound;25 million this year, but &pound;25 million last year and &pound;20 million in the previous two years, and way beyond the previous 10 years, with perhaps even 20, 30, 40 or 50 years of underfunding in terms of facilities and doctors. That has an impact on health. That is an important point. We are talking not about a one-off situation&mdash;one year&mdash;but about a cumulative build-up, which means that we have to allocate even more resources to overcome it.</p>
	<p pid="a.270.1/2">Hull is &pound;698,000 closer to target, on &pound;30 million, meaning that it will only take 45 years to reach the target, but in percentage terms, that is 0.2 per cent. in the time I am talking about, meaning 6 per cent. in total, so it will take Hull 30 years to get back to being allocated the resources it is entitled to under the formula. Richmond and Twickenham PCT is &pound;51 million away from target in 2009-10. Inexplicably, it will be &pound;52.25 million away in 2010-11, so in fact it is moving further away from target over those two years rather than getting closer to it. At that rate of change it will never, ever reach the target. At a rate of change of 0.1 per cent., when it is 23.4 per cent. over, it will take 234 years. That is not an acceptable pace of change. There is sufficient leeway in such areas to be able significantly to improve the rate of change.</p>
	<p pid="a.270.1/3">We need to take into account another element. HRG4&mdash;the health resource group funding&mdash;has just been announced. I welcome that because, again, it gives hospital trusts the right amount of money. My right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1755" name="Andrew Smith">the Member for Oxford, East (Mr. Smith)</phrase>, who is in the Chamber, and I have long campaigned together on the orthopaedic element of that to ensure that the extremely complex orthopaedic surgery that is carried out at the Nuffield and the Wrightington hospitals is properly recognised in the amount of funding. HRG4 does that, which is important, but its impact is enormous.</p>
	<p pid="a.270.1/4">Wigan PCT has estimated that if it just makes the mandatory payments, &pound;12 million extra each year will have go straight from the PCT to the hospital. If it does all the discretionary work as well&mdash;the discretionary part of the HRG4&mdash;it will cost &pound;24 million. I want hon. Members to hold those figures for a while. Some &pound;12 million will have to go and another &pound;12 million may go. The increase in funding to Wigan PCT in one year is &pound;27 million, so for primary care improvements, we will be left with &pound;3 million at worst or &pound;15 million at best. Obviously, all the drugs, pay increases and so on must come out of that sum. The effect will be that Wigan PCT will be in a reduced situation and will have to make changes to the way that it does things. If Wigan has to do that when it is &pound;25 million below target, it is not beyond the wit of areas such as Richmond and Twickenham&mdash;I have chosen it as an example, but there are plenty of others&mdash;which is &pound;50 million, &pound;60 million, &pound;70 million or &pound;80 million above target, to make similar changes.</p>
	<p pid="a.270.1/5">What can be done? We need to manage the changes. When the allocations were announced, inflation was somewhere between 3 and 4 per cent. I accept that the drugs bill has been announced and fixed, and wages agreements are in place for the next two years, but there will still be significant payments to be made in respect of the expenses that PCTs incur, even though those sums are significantly lower than anticipated, given the inflation rate when the allocations were announced. If we reduced the floor from 10.6 per cent. to whatever over a year, it would allow a significant amount of money to go to areas that are underfunded, bringing them closer to the target and increasing the pace of change.</p>
	<p pid="a.270.1/6">We need a faster pace of change, and the Minister should commit to that today. Targets that cannot be achieved for tens or hundreds of years are not acceptable, because of the impact on people's health, and because health professionals despair of ever being able to tackle inequalities properly. We should also have a debate on the allocations. It is amazing that we have debates on police allocations from central Government, on fire service allocations from central Government and on local authority allocations from central Government, but we do not have a debate on allocations to primary care trusts.</p>
	<p pid="a.270.1/7">My local authority in Wigan receives &pound;129 million of grant from central Government, and we have a half-day debate about that. We have consultation and debate and then confirmation or alteration of the amount. The health allocation to Wigan PCT is &pound;565 million, four and a half times as much, yet it goes through with no debate whatever, unless there is a Westminster Hall debate. That is a hangover from the Tory years when the Conservative Government did not want to talk about health inequalities and allocations. We thought ourselves lucky if we had a health allocation, let alone an increase. Ministers should relish the opportunity to champion all the good that has been done over the past 10 years, and to put the Opposition on the spot by saying, &quot;We know what we want to do about health inequalities and we know how we are going to tackle them, but where are you? We know what you did with the Black report. Have you changed?&quot; We should be able to look forward to an annual debate on health allocations when so much money is involved compared with police and fire authority allocations.</p>
	<p pid="a.270.1/8">If we do not make inroads, we will go on the merry-go-round of people being unable to see their doctor, clogging up A and E, or leaving problems until it is too late to treat them with primary care so that they have to be treated by health care, with primary care having to fund that instead of funding family care properly. That is a downward spiral. So many effects of health inequalities need personal intervention, because health workers must talk to people and guide them. Obesity is not an individual problem; it is a family problem. One does not see fat people; one sees fat families. That is unfortunate, but if someone's problem is only tackled individually, the mother or whoever does the cooking will continue to provide chips, pies and so on. It is unusual to hear someone from Wigan denigrating pies, but I accept that they are not a healthy pattern of eating. Smoking must also be tackled individually, so intervention is labour intensive and, therefore, expensive. If we do not have the resources to tackle it, we will not deal with health inequalities. Poorer health areas have below-target health and local authority funding, and do not have the resources to tackle such problems.</p>
	<p pid="a.270.1/9">I urge the Minister to commit to a debate so that we can raise the profile of health inequalities. I urge him to commit to a faster pace of change, and to considering the inflation element in the last year to see whether money can be pulled out and given to authorities that have less. The Minister could give a commitment today on those three practical areas, which would have a longer-term impact on health inequalities and ensure that this country is no longer scarred with areas where people have a mortality rate and morbidity rate of between 10 and 15 years higher than their more affluent neighbours.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-03-18a.272.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1755" speakername="Andrew Smith" colnum="272"  time="015:04:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090318/halltext/90318h0006.htm#09031893000510">
	<p pid="a.272.0/1">I congratulate my good friend, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1925" name="Neil Turner">the hon. Member for Wigan (Mr. Turner)</phrase>, on his excellent, well-informed and powerful speech, as well as on securing this vital debate. I want to focus on two issues: the allocation of funds to GP practices that serve poorer communities, and GP practices with a high proportion of student patients.</p>
	<p pid="a.272.0/2">First, ensuring that poorer areas receive their fair share of health funds is, as my hon. Friend said, at the heart of addressing health inequalities. It is not the only factor, and we know that housing, early years funding, schools funding and employment are also critical, but they compound the challenge because resources are not always allocated in proportion to need in those areas either. In Oxfordshire, the primary schools serving the most affluent areas receive virtually the same funding per pupil as the most disadvantaged areas, and that must also be true elsewhere. However great the other impacts, it is certain that we will not increase equality in health outcomes, even as overall health improves, as has been the case, unless there is fair funding for primary care services in poorer areas. That is a question not just of primary care services as a gateway to secondary and specialist treatment, but of the vital role that primary care and ancillary services at health centres provide in health education and prevention.</p>
	<p pid="a.272.0/3">There is an interaction between the funding mechanisms used at regional level and those used locally for practice-based commissioning. The money that ends up in a particular community is a product of both those stages. If a region is relatively affluent and with relatively good health, its regional allocation will be lower. We can all argue about the extent to which that may be the case, following the reviews of the formulae and so on, but within those more affluent regions, as my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1777" name="Karen Buck">the Member for Regent's Park and Kensington, North (Ms Buck)</phrase> said, it is all the more important that practices serving poorer areas and pockets of deepest deprivation are properly and fairly resourced. Yet demand pressures and historic factors suck resources in the opposite direction, or keep them in that opposite direction.</p>
	<p pid="a.272.0/4">It is disturbing that the excellent work by the <i>Health Service Journal</i> last autumn, which was reported in the Library's very good debate pack, shows that budgets have not matched their fair share as indicated by the toolkit methodology issued by the Department of Health and that the</p>
	<p pid="a.272.0/5" class="indent">&quot;inverse care law&mdash;which says those who need healthcare the most are least likely to get it&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.272.0/6">is, sadly, alive and well, so that some of the poorest parts of the country are being</p>
	<p pid="a.272.0/7" class="indent">&quot;systematically underfunded to the benefit of the healthiest and wealthiest.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.272.0/8">I was concerned to see in that article that in the league table of PCTs with the strongest tendency to underfund poor practices, mine in Oxfordshire was second. I know that the PCT is doing a lot locally&mdash;for example, with capital investment in new health centres&mdash;to improve primary care in some of the most deprived parts of my constituency and elsewhere in the county, but that aspect of ongoing funding to practices, and the inequalities uncovered by the <i>Health Service Journal</i>, must be addressed. I am sure that the Minister shares my concern, and it would be good to hear him say what he and his Department are doing about that. As my hon. Friend the Member for Wigan said, they cannot micro-manage absolutely every allocation everywhere, and one understands that, but there needs to be much greater transparency, and perhaps the Minister will tell us that his Department is already working on that.</p>
	<p pid="a.272.0/9">If the formulae interact properly, we should be able to compare primary care provision in a deprived community in Oxfordshire with that in a similarly deprived community in Sunderland. If the figures are similar, those communities should have similar levels of resourcing, although I suspect that the analysis would show that the Sunderland community was better resourced, but I might be wrong. Areas might be sucked up by the regional average, or resources might be sucked out of pockets of deprivation within regions by the historic overfunding of the most affluent areas.</p>
	<p pid="a.272.0/10">Whatever the theory behind the statistical analysis, the practical politics of correcting the problem are very hard. This is not totally a zero-sum game, and budgets have been increasing quite quickly. However, if we give relatively more and relatively more extra to one area, we will be giving relatively less extra to another. If that other area has more articulate and demanding constituents, and they are kicking off about the issue, the practical politics make it very difficult to get the allocations right. The Department needs to keep a close eye on how allocations are working out in practice across the country, particularly with the introduction of practice-based commissioning. PCTs face some hard choices in the guidance on practice-based commissioning if sufficient extra resources are to get into the areas that need them most.</p>
	<p pid="a.272.0/11">The second issue, on which I want to touch more briefly, is the situation of practices with a high proportion of student patients. That will not be a problem across most of the country, but it is certainly an issue in Oxford, as I expect that it is in Cambridge, Brighton and one or two other places. Changing practice funding to relate income more to long-term acute conditions and changes in the minimum income guarantee has a logic to it, and the Minister may argue that that is part of tackling the very inequalities that I have just mentioned. However, the exceptional situation of practices with an overwhelmingly high proportion of student patients could threaten their viability if their circumstances are not taken sufficiently into account.</p>
	<p pid="a.272.0/12">Will the Minister confirm that he is aware of the situation of practices with a high proportion of students? Although students obviously do not have a high incidence of long-term physical conditions, they do have a high incidence of mental health conditions and sexual health issues. When looking at PCTs' funding needs, it is important to take account of their patients' particular needs. It is important that the good service that PCTs give students is not undermined by funding changes. I would appreciate the Minister's assurance that the needs of such practices are being fully and properly addressed.</p>
	<p pid="a.272.0/13">I will bring my remarks to a close now to let others get in, but I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Wigan once again on securing this vital debate. He made a powerful point when he said that the importance of health allocations is such that they should be debated on the Floor of the House in the same way as local government, police and other allocations. This is as important an issue as any that the House ever addresses in terms of its impact on our constituents' quality of life, and it would bear a great deal more scrutiny and informed public debate. My hon. Friend's suggestion of a debate on the Floor of the House would help.</p>

	<p pid="a.277.0/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1925" name="Neil Turner">the Member for Wigan (Mr. Turner)</phrase> on securing the debate. I am most grateful to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1739" name="Christopher Fraser">the hon. Member for South-West Norfolk (Christopher Fraser)</phrase> for explaining his situation. It is valuable for us to be able to understand what has happened; we all have three or four things to do at once. I am most grateful to him; I was a little shocked, but am no longer.</p>
	<p pid="a.277.0/2">I was very impressed by my hon. Friend's opening contribution. He clearly outlined the shameful situation that the national health service was in before 1997 and the staggering range of services and level of investment that there has been in the NHS, certainly in the past 10 years. It has been overwhelming, in some ways, to see, in my patch, James Cook university hospital becoming one of the national cardiac centres. It has also been valuable that the university hospital of North Tees has developed teaching capabilities as well as serious competences in many areas of the health service. Like my hon. Friend I am keen to put on record the fact that the Government have supplied considerable investment. However, like other hon. Members I often feel that we have an inflexible formula, which works on averages, so that the chronically deprived areas in our constituencies, which frequently experience serious health hazards, are outside that formula.</p>
	<p pid="a.277.0/3">The special interest group of municipal authorities within the Local Government Association has often spoken to the Secretary of State for Health, and other Ministers. The point is always pressed that fair funding must be seen to be a fact throughout the health service and throughout Great Britain. I agree, but my problem is that I do not see fair funding. I do not have any problem with research-based hospitals and teaching-based hospitals receiving phenomenal increases in their funding. I realise that they must have them. However, I believe equally that the time is long overdue for us to pay attention to areas such as, in my own patch, Mandale and Victoria ward. There, average life expectancy is 58. In Hartburn and Fairfield there are very low levels of deprivation. It is delightful that they have people with above-average salaries, with the lifestyles that they accommodate. Those people have a life expectancy of 78. That is a serious issue, and it is long overdue to be dealt with. It has been sidelined by statisticians or by people who are trying to construct a formula that works for all people. I accept unequal spending, but not unequal treatment of people and their needs.</p>
	<p pid="a.277.0/4">In wards with a high deprivation factor the characteristics are pretty universal. I am convinced that all hon. Members would say the same about them. Those characteristics are: low birth rates for children; high rates of illegitimate births to teenage girls; obesity rates that are a significant contributor to poor health; and significant incidence of cardiac problems and cancer. The issue is not just health, but much more. It is a question of poor rented private housing, long-term sickness, pools of permanent unemployment, and part-time and low-paid work. All those contribute to the situation, as does cigarette smoking. Who am I to complain about that? I do complain, as hon. Members can well imagine, and ask people not to do it, but when they are dealing with enormous stress a cigarette becomes their friend. We must move in to support and help, reassure them and get their trust, and get them off that frankly filthy habit.</p>
	<p pid="a.277.0/5">The characteristics of parts of the wards in my constituency are the same as are found in other hon. Members' constituencies, so how is it that we still do not deal with the problems? Why does our funding formula, which may or may not be generous, not include the people in those areas? Why does it not involve asking when they went to the GP last and which clinic they visit? Those people do not trust and are not confident; they have no self-belief and do not put themselves first. They are the last in the queue. We&mdash;individuals&mdash;are persuading them to take up all sorts of opportunities, but it is the job of the national health service.</p>
	<p pid="a.277.0/6">My local authority works closely with the health service. The relationship between social services and the primary care trust is a keen one. As my hon. Friend the Member for Wigan said, our Supporting People grant was 177 per cent. off what it should have been. When I have made that argument I have received nods of sympathy and little else. Sympathy ain't what I am here for. I want action that drives resources to people who need them. Stockton's PCT and the local authority social services offer a model of excellence. They share knowledge and resources. They work the streets. However, it is a hard routine getting people to trust, to come on board, to hear the good news and to hear about the services that should be available to them.</p>
	<p pid="a.277.0/7">The absolute statement for me is that my local PCT is 6 per cent. below where it should be. Our Supporting People budget is below where it should be. Our health budget is below where it should be. We cannot ensure that the work that needs to be done in very high deprivation pools is done if we do not have the people to work those streets and the resources to employ them. I am therefore saying to my hon. Friend the Minister that we need greater specificity in the way that deprivation is handled in all budgets, but most particularly in the health budget.</p>
	<p pid="a.277.0/8">I was delighted to read some of the material from the Advisory Committee on Resource Allocation. It is clear that ACRA believes that we have to use weighted capitation. It is clear that it wants a separate health inequalities formula. It believes that if we are not specific about the work that we ask PCTs to do, we will never give to all people that which they deserve&mdash;fairness. Good health and good living standards should be theirs as of right, not because of someone fighting for that. I would appreciate hearing what the Minister has to say about ACRA. I want to know when the Government will come on board with this. I would like to believe that he will tell us that the Mandale, Victoria, Hartburn and Fairfield distributions will be acknowledged in the future and that all people will be treated fairly under the funding formula.</p>

	<p pid="a.281.1/1">I thank <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1830" name="John Pugh">the hon. Member for Southport (Dr. Pugh)</phrase> for cutting his comments short, but we want to hear what the Minister has to say.</p>
	<p pid="a.281.1/2">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1925" name="Neil Turner">the hon. Member for Wigan (Mr. Turner)</phrase> on securing the debate and on making a passionate contribution. He said exactly what I would have said, if I were a Back Bencher, and I agree fully on behalf of my town, which I may mention later.</p>
	<p pid="a.281.1/3">I wonder whether the hon. Member for Wigan recognises this:</p>
	<p pid="a.281.1/4" class="indent">&quot;Healthy Towns has all the failings of previous policies, indicating that the Government has learnt nothing from the past mistakes.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.281.1/5">It comes from the report of the Select Committee on Health, published on Sunday. I was a proud member of that Committee for many years, but it is still Labour-dominated, and has a Labour Chairman. Nevertheless, it has released a scathing report into health inequalities. If Members have not yet had the opportunity to read it, I ask them please to do so. Not only does it deal with many of the questions that have been raised today, but it sets out some ways in which we can go forward, which is what we all seek. We all wish to improve the quality of health for all our constituents in this great country. I was fascinated to read the report. In many ways, it follows on from the report on funding formula and deficits, which was published when I was a member of the Committee. That argument will go on and on, and I may touch on it in my short contribution.</p>
	<p pid="a.281.1/6">The Advisory Committee on Resource Allocation was rightly asked by the Government to look into the way in which health is funded. I was as surprised as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1840" name="Dari Taylor">the hon. Member for Stockton, South (Ms Taylor)</phrase> to read that those experts were not capable of working out how to address the inequalities argument. It is not a question of cash flying back and forth. If it were only about cash going into communities, Glasgow would have the best health outcomes and Wokingham the worst. As we know, Glasgow still gets the greatest amount of cash. We heard about the north-south divide, and the north-east gets a huge proportion&mdash;some 70 per cent. more in 2009-10 than other parts of the United Kingdom.</p>
	<p pid="a.281.1/7">I listened intently to the debate on the difference between the north and the south, but those on the Front Benches&mdash;I am sure that the Minister has found this when visiting the north-east&mdash;know that although they have some fantastic facilities in the north-east, and the area is very well funded, other parts of the country would love to have the same.</p>

	<p pid="a.282.0/1">I hope that hon. Gentleman will put into that into context. We were a long way behind in 1997, and we had a long way to go to get to the average point. Secondly, a great deal of that funding goes into acute medicine; again, I have no problem with that.</p>

	<p pid="a.282.1/1">The hon. Lady has raised an important point. My constituency gets disproportionately low funding compared with the midlands, let alone the north. That may be one reason why my acute hospital closed at the weekend&mdash;because of the lack of funding, it will close permanently.</p>
	<p pid="a.282.1/2">I shall touch quickly on the comments of other Members. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1755" name="Andrew Smith">The right hon. Member for Oxford, East (Mr. Smith)</phrase> raised the question of funding, and how it can disproportionately affect certain parts of our communities. One part of a community may be relatively affluent and another deprived, but nothing in the formula addresses that problem. That is the cause of real disparity; the poorer seem to get worse treatment. Nothing in the formula, not even the new one, deals with that problem. In my constituency, I have some of the most affluent villages in the south, but I also have three of the most deprived wards in the country. Nothing in the funding formula allows my strategic health authority to allow for that, and the PCTs struggle enormously.</p>
	<p pid="a.282.1/3">I listened carefully to what the hon. Member for Weaver Vale said about targets. I point him to the devastating report&mdash;a statement was made about it a few moment's ago in the Chamber&mdash;on the investigation into Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust. One of the most striking comments in the report was that at &quot;virtually every stage&quot; of emergency care, targets were being pursued to the detriment of patient care.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-03-18a.284.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1580" speakername="Ben Bradshaw" colnum="284"  time="015:49:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090318/halltext/90318h0008.htm#09031893000530">
	<p pid="a.284.2/1">Does my hon. Friend mind if I do not? So many Members have made so many points about allocations, and I really want to get to the nub of the debate, rather than have yet another debate about Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust. The Conservative argument that this is about targets has been totally demolished, as well as denied by the independent Healthcare Commission itself. I hope that that satisfies him.</p>
	<p pid="a.284.2/2">Let us get to the issue at hand. When this Government first came to power, health spending was just &pound;426 per head, but in 2010-11 it will be &pound;1,612. In December, we announced what PCTs will receive for the years 2009-10 and 2010-11&mdash;a total across England of &pound;164 billion. That means that PCTs will receive an average increase of 11.3 per cent. Given the current economic climate, that settlement is extremely generous. At this stage in an economic downturn, it is important to maintain investment, rather than cut it, as has been suggested by other political parties. Our investment means that PCTs and the NHS will have the necessary certainty to plan better services for their patients over the next two years.</p>
	<p pid="a.284.2/3">I shall turn to how the allocations are set. England is a highly mobile and dynamic society. The size, make-up and demographics of our communities are constantly changing, and the allocation of resources needs to reflect these changes. The formula that decides the allocations is drawn up by the independent Advisory Committee on Resource Allocation, which is made up of general practitioners, NHS managers and academics. ACRA regularly reviews and improves the funding formula to reflect changes in local communities as well as new data and improved techniques, and it is, of course, open to representations, including to those from hon. Members.</p>
	<p pid="a.284.2/4">The aim of the formula is to ensure that PCTs with similar needs have sufficient funding to commission comparable health services and to reduce avoidable health inequalities. A PCT's fair share, as calculated by the formula, is known as its target allocation. The formula is made up of a count of the population served by the PCT, with adjustments made to reflect factors such as the age of the population, the level of deprivation, unavoidable differences in costs, which are known as the market forces factor, and rurality.</p>
	<p pid="a.284.2/5">The new funding formula takes account of new information, changes in service provision and changes in health outcomes. It builds on, and improves, the previous formula, so that it continues to meet its objectives of equal access for equal need and the reduction of health inequalities. The review of ACRA's recommendations was comprehensive and led to a number of important changes, including an improved estimation of need. For the first time, that assesses age and other drivers of need together and includes out-patient data and a separate transparent health inequalities formula.</p>
	<p pid="a.284.2/6">Improvements have also been made to the market forces factor, reducing unrealistic variations between PCTs and hospitals. In addition, population estimates have been moved on to the latest sub-national population projections from the Office for National Statistics. When a new funding formula is introduced, the distance between a PCT's target and actual allocation will change&mdash;PCTs may move from over to under target, or vice versa. It all depends on the relative need of the PCT's population, as determined by the new formula.</p>
	<p pid="a.284.2/7">A change in target allocation does not mean that a PCT loses out&mdash;far from it. The new formula impacts on a PCT's funding target, not on the money that it actually receives. We are committed to moving PCTs closer to their fair share over time, but that must be balanced with the need to maintain continuity and stability in NHS funding. If a PCT is under-target, it will benefit from higher growth than others. In this sense, such PCTs actually gain from being under target. What matters most to the public is not distance from target, but the levels of increased funding. For example, at the start of 2009-10, Bassetlaw PCT will be furthest below target, at around 10.6 per cent. under target. Over the next two years, it will receive more than 17 per cent. additional funding, so that by the end of 2010-11 the gap will have been reduced to 6.2 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="a.284.2/8">Most of the hon. Members who have spoken in this debate live near, or represent, PCTs that will enjoy average, or above average, increases in allocations over the next two years. Cornwall is in the top decile, with 12.4 per cent.; Norfolk has 11.8 per cent.; Stockton has 11.5 per cent., and the PCTs of my hon. Friends the Members for Wigan and for Weaver Vale (Mr. Hall) are both at 11.3 per cent. Although the latter is the average, it is still more than most, because some of the worst-off PCTs, such as Bassetlaw, are getting such big increases.</p>
	<p pid="a.284.2/9">The general pattern of how far PCTs are from targets now, and will be by 2011, shows a remarkable achievement. As recently as 2003-04, the most under-target PCT was 22 per cent. below target, and by 2005-06, the furthest was still 16 per cent. below. At the beginning of 2009-11, the most under-target PCT will be 10.6 per cent. below, and by the end of that period it will be 6.2 per cent. below. Some, including hon. Members here today, would like to see a more rapid journey to get the PCTs that are furthest under target closer to their targets. However, to speed up the pace for below-target PCTs would inevitably result in smaller increases in funding for above-target PCTs.</p>
	<p pid="a.284.2/10">My hon. Friend the Member for Wigan acknowledged the importance of having a floor, and a debate is to be had about where that floor should be. However, we have considered the matter very hard and examined the demands on the health service throughout the country, and, in our view, moving faster over the next two years would result in painful cuts to the services provided by a number of PCTS, including those of my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1777" name="Karen Buck">the Member for Regent's Park and Kensington, North (Ms Buck)</phrase>, my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1755" name="Andrew Smith">the Member for Oxford, East (Mr. Smith)</phrase> and the hon. Members for Hemel Hempstead and for Southport (Dr. Pugh). I am sure that neither my hon. Friend the Member for Wigan nor any other hon. Member here wish for such an outcome.</p>
	<p pid="a.284.2/11">My hon. Friend made a point about the impact of local government spending. PCT and local authority grants are decided in different ways and take account of different factors, which should help to avoid PCT allocations and local authority grants being suddenly changed in the same way. The Department for Communities and Local Government is represented on ACRA, and so it is involved from the start. My hon. Friend also asked whether we could have a debate in the main Chamber. I think that we have had a pretty good one this afternoon, although I accept that it was not a debate on the Floor of the House. He raised that point with the Secretary of State, who said that he would think about it, but in the end, of course, that is not a matter for the Government, but for the House. However, the Secretary of State said that he would be happy to consider such a debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.284.2/12">My hon. Friend also asked whether the allocation could be changed in the final year to take into account falling inflation. He acknowledged that NHS spending is heavily dependent on labour costs. However, those costs are fixed, because, thank goodness, we managed to secure a three-year pay deal with the unions, and, given the current climate, I do not envisage them wanting to reopen those negotiations&mdash;the deal might not go in the direction that they want. The wage bill and drugs are by far the biggest proportion of the NHS bill, so we do not actually make huge savings from the fall in inflation.</p>
	<p pid="a.284.2/13">To change the formula after just one year would be contrary to the very thing for which my hon. Friend and others have long been campaigning in this House&mdash;the certainty of three-year settlements, which allow PCTs to plan for the future. He also asked whether I would commit to a greater distance of travel. I have explained that, given the impact on other hon. Members' constituencies, that would not be a good idea over the next two years. However, we can reconsider that matter during the next review period, beginning in 2011, if, as I hope, we still have a Labour Government committed to tackling health inequalities.</p>
	<p pid="a.284.2/14">My right hon. Friend the Member for Oxford, East asked what would happen if a PCT in a generally affluent area, but with pockets of deprivation, received a floor increase, which would be 10.6 per cent. in his case. He should be aware of two substantial points. Under the operating framework&mdash;the instruction to the NHS about its priorities&mdash;a clear obligation is placed on PCTs to tackle inequalities, and they should be held to account if they fail to do so. Secondly, in the world-class commissioning process, the quality of PCT commissioning will be much more closely scrutinised, and, again, they will be obliged to tackle and address health inequalities. They will need to be held account on that as well.</p>
	<p pid="a.284.2/15">My right hon. Friend has said that his PCT did not do very well in the <i>Health Service Journal </i>league table&mdash;</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-03-18a.288.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1482" speakername="Alun Michael" colnum="288"  time="016:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090318/halltext/90318h0009.htm#09031893000532">
	<p pid="a.288.1/1">As Members of Parliament, we occasionally have the opportunity to make a real change for the better. Even more rarely, we have the chance to accelerate change to align parliamentary influence with ministerial aspiration and to exploit technical progress. The switchover to digital television gives us an almost unique opportunity to transform the lives of blind and partially sighted people, and many elderly people in general. I am confident that the Minister will give me a positive response to this short debate, because she knows how important this matter is from experience in her own constituency.</p>
	<p pid="a.288.1/2">Digital switchover will give us all clearer pictures and sound, improved reception and more channels. However, an even greater benefit to people who are blind or who suffer from visual impairment comes from one single fact. People who cannot see miss out on so much that sighted people take for granted. That is vitally important because for many people, television is their main source of information and entertainment. Apart from news, documentary programmes and personal consumption of television programmes, people feel left out if they do not know what is going on on programmes such as &quot;Big Brother&quot;, &quot;Celebrity Love Island&quot; and &quot;Footballers' Wives&quot;. I have to say with some pride that I do not have a clue what is happening in those programmes, but that is because I do not want to; it is my choice.</p>
	<p pid="a.288.1/3">At a recent Royal National Institute of Blind People event in the House of Commons, the Secretary of State explained the difference between choice and being excluded. He told us about his time as Parliamentary Private Secretary to my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1810" name="David Blunkett">the Member for Sheffield, Brightside (Mr. Blunkett)</phrase>. My right hon. Friend is a passionate fan of the Harry Potter novels, but was unable to join in the excitement on publication day, because it would be many months before an audio tape or disc would become available and he would know what everyone was talking about.</p>
	<p pid="a.288.1/4">Most examples of such social exclusion are closely related to television. Around 365,000 people in the UK are registered as blind or partially sighted. Research by the RNIB has suggested that there could be as many as 2 million people in the UK with some degree of significant sight loss. To put it another way, each constituency has between 560 and 3,000 people, depending on which analysis one uses, with some degree of visual impairment.</p>
	<p pid="a.288.1/5">The switchover to digital television gives us the opportunity to help people who have been excluded from experiencing things that the rest of us take for granted. Audio description is like a narrator telling a story. It fills in the gaps by describing the images that appear on the screen. For example, it describes the lingering looks of a man as he stares deeply into a woman's eyes, and the shots of an undiscovered bomb quietly ticking its way down to zero. Although such things mean so much to the storyline, they are often a mystery to blind people, but now they can come to life through audio description.</p>
	<p pid="a.288.1/6">Last year, I attended an RNIB event in which I watched some television. Wearing glasses that simulated the vision of someone with a visual impairment, I watched a clip from a television programme. That experience was confusing and I got very little out of it. I could not work out what was going on. Still wearing the glasses, I was then shown the same clip but with the addition of audio description. It is not too much of an exaggeration to say that I was a convert to audio description from that moment.</p>
	<p pid="a.288.1/7">The campaign run by the RNIB has been both imaginative and effective. Before Christmas, an invitation to a reception in the House of Commons appeared in <i>Advent Times</i>, which is a spoof of the <i>Radio Times. </i>Instead of giving programme information, it told us all about the programmes that blind people could not understand because the vital action was not audio described.</p>
	<p pid="a.288.1/8">At the event itself, a corner of the Members' Dining Room was turned into the living room of Aunt Megan, who was ready to tell every MP about the virtues of audio description. Having experienced audio description with elderly parents or our own Aunt Megan or Uncle Idris, MPs got the point immediately. I want to pay particular tribute to the key person who got the point. The Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport, my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1678" name="Andy Burnham">the Member for Leigh (Andy Burnham)</phrase> agreed to change the core receiver requirements for the Government's help scheme for digital switchover. The digibox that will now be provided to people who qualify for help will include one-button access to audio description.</p>
	<p pid="a.288.1/9">The speed of the Secretary of State's response when we approached him was particularly effective and welcome, because it means that such facilities will be available to people in Cardiff South and Penarth&mdash;and also the rest of Wales. Constituents will receive set-top boxes as part of the help scheme at the time of digital changeover. Even a slight delay in that decision would have resulted in a massive missed opportunity. Such victories of technology would not have been provided automatically to vulnerable people in my constituency or to the rest of Wales, including your constituency as well, Mr. Jones. To add it in later would have been expensive for individuals and impossible for Government or industry to organise. Therefore, the Secretary of State's decision to act quickly last October will lead to actual clear benefit to hundreds of thousands of people.</p>
	<p pid="a.288.1/10">I am particularly pleased that we are having this debate on the day after the Government agreed to the request made by many Back Benchers, led by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1989" name="John Robertson">the Member for Glasgow, North-West (John Robertson)</phrase>, to give blind people the higher rate of disabled living allowance. Such things make a difference.</p>
	<p pid="a.288.1/11">Three years ago, the Government set the percentage of programmes to be audio described at 10 per cent. That requirement was enshrined in the Communications Act 2003. The target was set after consultations with Ofcom. Five years before those consultations, Ofcom was unconvinced that awareness and take-up of audio description warranted a more challenging target. Broadcasters were doubtful, too, and perhaps with some justification. If a company is being required to spend money on a service, it wants to know that that service will be used. However, things have changed.</p>
	<p pid="a.288.1/12">In 2008, the RNIB commissioned a piece of research into awareness of audio description compared with two years previously. The findings were dramatic, and they were drawn to the attention of Ofcom. The public at large and people with visual impairments were all the more aware of audio description. There was an increase of 62 per cent. in the numbers of the general public who were aware of the service. There was an increase of 67 per cent. in the numbers of people with a visual impairment. That figure included a massive 150 per cent. increase in the number of mildly visually impaired people who knew about audio description. That figure struck me as dramatically important.</p>
	<p pid="a.288.1/13">When I was Industry Minister, I worked closely with the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1836" name="James Purnell">the Member for Stalybridge and Hyde (James Purnell)</phrase> on digital switchover. We were deeply concerned about identifying those individuals who might not be registered as blind or visually impaired, or who might not have come to the attention of the social services, and yet were definitely in need of assistance from the Government help scheme. Many elderly people have a degree of visual impairment that they may even hide from friends and relatives, because they do not want to be a burden or a nuisance. How can we be sure that they will receive the help that they need? Those are the people who will benefit significantly from the Government help scheme. Publicising audio description is one way to ensure that we identify and reach as many of those people as possible.</p>
	<p pid="a.288.1/14">Given the massive shift in awareness and the large increase in audience access that follows from the change in the core receiver requirements, I am confident that when Ofcom completes its television access services review, it will recommend that a minimum of 20 per cent. of programming should be audio described. Broadcasters generally deserve credit and praise for doing more than they are required to do by law. Since that research was commissioned, rates of audio description on the main channels have increased exponentially. BBC1 audio describes 14 per cent. of its output and BBC2 describes 12 per cent. ITV manages 13 per cent., Channel 4 describes 10.8 per cent. and Channel 5 describes 13.5 per cent. Even Channel Pedwar Cymru manages to audio describe more than 10.9 per cent. of its output. Some channels do even better. BBC 3 audio describes a whopping 26 per cent. of its output, and GOLD, Sky Movies, UKTV History, Sky Three and BBC 4 are all above the 20 per cent. mark. Broadcasters have reason to be proud of the efforts that they have made.</p>
	<p pid="a.288.1/15">Of course we understand that there will be a cost to increasing the amount of audio-described television. Channel 5's chief executive, Dawn Airey, told me that increasing audio description levels to 20 per cent. from the current 13 per cent. would cost the broadcaster &pound;100,000 per year, and the costs may be more for other broadcasters. However, it is not acceptable for services for disabled people to be the first to go in times of economic difficulty. ITV has already discontinued its provision of signed evening news bulletins in five regions, including ITV Wales.</p>
	<p pid="a.288.1/16">ITV Wales's response to Welsh Labour MPs was disappointingly dismissive. That was something that ITV's representatives did not mention when they came to talk to us about ITV's financial problems. They do not seem to understand the reputational damage and loss of sympathy that follows from that decision. In a short debate on ITV's cuts in Wales last week, Ann Jones, the Assembly Member for Vale of Clwyd, made the following point:</p>
	<p pid="a.288.1/17" class="indent">&quot;With the digital switchover just around the corner, we are already being offered HD 'Emmerdale' and HD 'The Simpsons' on a daily basis. However, among this milieu there's a big gap, leaving deaf people out in the cold.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.288.1/18">I agree. ITV has got its priorities wrong.</p>
	<p pid="a.288.1/19">I want to see a phased increase towards 20 per cent. audio description, which is the RNIB's modest request. It will help to cushion the blow if we ask bigger broadcasters to lead the way, perhaps with 2 per cent. increases yearly for the next few years. A phased approach would reward broadcasters who have already exceeded their targets and enable them to plan ahead and in turn drive down costs. I stress again that all the channels subject to the 10 per cent. audio description target are meeting it. The BBC is well above the basic requirements, and Sky has promised to meet the 20 per cent. target voluntarily. The broadcasters concerned can be proud of what they have accomplished.</p>
	<p pid="a.288.1/20">The difference that audio description can make to people's lives cannot be overstated. That is why I am asking broadcasters not to wait for Ofcom's recommendations, but to make a commitment now to audio describe at least 20 per cent. of their output as soon as possible. The problem is that we have reached a plateau for audio description. We are at a point where the only way to increase awareness of audio description is to have more of it. At the moment, audio description is concentrated on the most popular programmes, soaps and films. Those who do not enjoy soaps or who are not a fan of the films being described are likely to miss out altogether on the benefits of audio description.</p>
	<p pid="a.288.1/21">I thank the RNIB for alerting me to the issue and for running such an imaginative and powerful campaign. In my mother's later years, I saw the impact of failing sight and how lonely a person can get, if they cannot continue to engage with the outside world. Often, television is their last link. Above all, I thank the Secretary of State for getting the point so quickly and acting on the message in respect of the core receiver requirements. That change has created the opportunity for all vulnerable people to receive the service simply and straightforwardly when they gain access through the help scheme.</p>
	<p pid="a.288.1/22">Seizing the opportunity given to us by the digital switchover is essential. It creates the opportunity for a paradigm shift in the availability of audio description by providing the technology of access to all vulnerable people who qualify for the help scheme. That will massively increase the connectivity of the main audience for audio description and allow broadcasters to make their contribution in a way that will be liberating to people who are blind or visually impaired and to elderly people generally. By the way, it will also be good for the reputation of broadcasters.</p>

	<p pid="a.291.0/1">I congratulate my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1482" name="Alun Michael">the Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth (Alun Michael)</phrase> on securing this debate and thank him on behalf of my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport for his kind words about the Department and the Secretary of State.</p>
	<p pid="a.291.0/2">I have known my right hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth for many years, so I know that he is an enthusiastic advocate of the benefits of audio description. As he explained so well, it is a free service, currently available on some television channels, in which a narrator describes the on-screen actions, body language and facial expressions of the actors or participants in a programme in order to help people with visual impairments to follow the programme or story.</p>
	<p pid="a.291.0/3">After a campaign led by Ofcom in July last year, awareness of the existence of audio description doubled, as my right hon. Friend has said, from 37 per cent. to 72 per cent. among the United Kingdom's visually impaired community of 2 million. Given the success of the campaign, Ofcom believes that the time is right to reconsider recommending an increase in the minimum target for programmes with audio description from 10 per cent. over a 10-year period to something higher. I know that my right hon. Friend is aware of Ofcom's thinking on the matter, as he spoke with its officials at the RNIB's recent parliamentary reception, which he hosted, in support of its campaign to raise the minimum audio description target from 10 per cent. to 20 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="a.291.0/4">I commend my right hon. Friend for his work to promote the benefits of audio description by hosting receptions such as the one that I have described, tabling early-day motions and securing debates such as this. I am glad that he, like me, welcomes the opportunity offered by the digital switchover to increase the use of that extremely helpful technology. Digital switchover will help, because digital terrestrial television transmission, unlike analogue, allows people direct access to audio description through their sets, which will be a huge boon to the visually impaired. As a result, after the digital switchover programme is completed in 2012, 98.5 per cent. of the population will have access to digital terrestrial television and, if they want or need it, to audio description.</p>
	<p pid="a.291.0/5">As my right hon. Friend will know, the process of switching from analogue to digital television began in earnest on <phrase class="date" code="2009-11-06">6 November</phrase> last year in the Selkirk and borders region. Over the next four years, the switchover will continue region by region, ending in Ulster in 2012. It is a huge exercise, but, fingers crossed&mdash;new technology always makes me resort to old superstitions&mdash;things seem to be going well. The latest digital Ofcom tracker, which provides useful snapshots of public opinion, bears that analysis out. Awareness of the digital switchover is now at 90 per cent., and understanding of what it actually means is now at 72 per cent. in the UK as a whole.</p>
	<p pid="a.291.0/6">In Wales, where my right hon. Friend comes from&mdash;as do the Chair and my husband&mdash;there is an interesting difference. Some 92 per cent. of the population are aware of this huge change&mdash;that is 2 per cent. more than in the UK&mdash;but only 65 per cent. understand what it involves. After having named that collection of people in my life and in this Chamber, I will not speculate on how the difference arose.</p>
	<p pid="a.291.0/7">The figures are heartening overall, but we must not be complacent. That is why Digital UK's promotional work will continue until switchover and beyond to ensure that everyone understands what is happening and what they need to do in order to benefit. That is more difficult for some than others, which is why the Government and the BBC have set up the digital switchover help scheme, funded from the licence fee. About 7 million households are eligible for help from this scheme, which will be rolled out in each TV region as switchover approaches. All eligible people will be entitled to be provided with equipment that meets their particular needs, as long as that equipment complies with the revised core receiver requirements. After a public consultation, these new requirements were published on <phrase class="date" code="2009-11-11">11 November</phrase> last year.</p>
	<p pid="a.291.0/8">There is one change in those requirements that is relevant to this debate. That is the change that says that any equipment offered as standard must have one-button access to audio description services from remote control handsets. In other words, someone just has to press a button to receive audio description; they do not have to press a button and then scroll through a menu and press other buttons to receive it. So one-button audio description does what it says; it allows the user to access audio description with the press of a single button.</p>
	<p pid="a.291.0/9">The Government will continue to keep the core receiver requirements under review, because technology changes and with technological changes come new needs. In addition, we have established an emerging technologies group to assess new developments as they come on stream, such as the electronic programme guides that are currently being developed by the RNIB. That process will give visually impaired people the chance to prepare and plan their viewing, rather than just accessing a new development as it emerges. Furthermore, we have not forgotten those who do not qualify for the help scheme but who could still benefit from audio description. That is why the digital television group has set up a sub-group of its usability group to examine how audio description can be readily accessed through consumer equipment.</p>
	<p pid="a.291.0/10">In addition to getting the transmission and technology behind audio description right, we must ensure that the number of programmes on which this service is available is also right, which is the nub of my right hon. Friend's argument. In 2003, the Government passed legislation that set a minimum target of 10 per cent. of programmes made by licensees to be audio described within a 10-year period. That legislation also gave Ofcom the responsibility of ensuring that broadcasters meet these requirements. As my right hon. Friend's list of figures showed, broadcasters generally exceed these requirements, although not hugely. Ofcom will be investigating the awareness, take-up and usage of audio description as part of its 2009 access services review.</p>
	<p pid="a.291.0/11">Ofcom will also conduct an analysis of the social and financial implications of any possible increase in audio description targets, before deciding whether or not to recommend an increased target to the Government. Ofcom will launch this review in April, and it plans to meet with stakeholders for briefing sessions before publishing a consultation document in the summer. It hopes to be able to report on its findings before the end of this year.</p>
	<p pid="a.291.0/12">In the meantime, the Government welcome the recent announcement by Sky voluntarily to increase its provision of audio description to 20 per cent. of its programmes. That shows a good understanding of community and it is also good business. With an ageing population and as people's eyesight gets worse as they get older&mdash;my right hon. Friend and I now both wear glasses&mdash;I am sure that many new people will benefit from audio description services.</p>
	<p pid="a.291.0/13">This news indicates the success of the awareness-raising activities of my right hon. Friend and the RNIB in this area. They are doing this country a great service, and I commend them for it.</p>

	<p pid="a.295.1/1">Thank you very much, Mr. Jones, and I am very grateful to the Minister for turning up two minutes early, which means I might be able to go on for 17 minutes, but we will see how it goes.</p>
	<p pid="a.295.1/2">I am delighted to see the Minister in the Chamber. He and I are quite used to swapping reminiscences and points of view with other Members in a packed Westminster Hall, but I appreciate a one-to-one with him. It is absolutely great.</p>
	<p pid="a.295.1/3">As the Minister knows, I am usually trying to help the NHS and not trying to make any party political points at all. As he also knows&mdash;well, he probably does not know&mdash;I qualified as a doctor 50 years ago, so the NHS has been part of my life for a very long time and I am still absolutely dedicated to it.</p>
	<p pid="a.295.1/4">The Order Paper never gives the full title of a debate, but the full title of this debate was, &quot;Suggestions for better use of resources in the NHS&quot;. I am really returning to a recurrent theme of mine. With increasing longevity, the greater scope of possible treatment and the fact that, although the Government have poured lots of extra money into the NHS, we are now coming to the stage of limited resources, we cannot expect the bonanza of money in the NHS to go on increasing, so we have to push for maximum efficiency and the minimisation of waste in the NHS.</p>
	<p pid="a.295.1/5">When addressing his constituents, in 1868, Disraeli said:</p>
	<p pid="a.295.1/6" class="indent">&quot;There can be no economy where there is no efficiency.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.295.1/7">That absolutely stands today, and the first issue that I want to consider is what the Government are doing in that regard already. I hope to get a bit of an update on that from the Minister. Then I shall suggest some things that the Government should consider doing, but I do not expect to get answers on them today, because I have not warned the Minister about any of them.</p>
	<p pid="a.295.1/8">What are the Government doing to eliminate waste and inefficiency? I am sure that you saw huge advertisements in the Sunday papers over the weekend, Mr. Jones, to mark European antibiotic awareness day, which was a tremendous step. One advertisement said:</p>
	<p pid="a.295.1/9" class="indent">&quot;If a cold is making you feel under the weather, antibiotics aren't going to help&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.295.1/10">It is terribly sad that we have to tell people that, but I sympathise with the poor GPs, because time and again it might be easier simply to give out an antibiotic than to spend time explaining that it will not do one a power of good. That advertisement was something, and it was good.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-03-18a.296.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1949" speakername="Richard Taylor" colnum="296"  time="016:28:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090318/halltext/90318h0010.htm#09031893000537">
	<p pid="a.296.0/1">I am grateful for that intervention. Of course, I shall come to that issue, because the prevention of health care acquired infections is terribly important. The Government are doing something about that problem, as opposed to the situation with other preventive measures. One thing that they are doing involves the better care, better value indicators, which originally identified 10 general practitioner and hospital practices through which we could save the country about &pound;2 billion a year if best practices were followed for all of them. I should very much like to know the progress of those indicators. I think that a second wave has been launched, but they have come out so quietly that I do not know about them. I hope that primary care trusts and the people who should know about them do. I should like an update on that.</p>
	<p pid="a.296.0/2">Last week, in the Select Committee on Health's public hearing on the operating framework for the NHS in England, we asked the Secretary of State about efficiency savings. His answer was rather negative. He said that the savings would come from the &quot;back office&quot;, from better procurement and from better use of the NHS estate, but he then went on to list a lot of negatives. He said that savings would not come from patient care&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.296.0/3" class="indent">&quot;not getting rid of staff, not restricting drugs, not expanding waiting times&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.296.0/4">and not including</p>
	<p pid="a.296.0/5" class="indent">&quot;important developments in patient care.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.296.0/6">He left a lot to the imagination about what we could do.</p>
	<p pid="a.296.0/7">The last Government measure that I shall touch on briefly is quality, which is absolutely essential. It saves money, not least by avoiding complaints and litigation. As I have said before, there are four Cs for quality, the first of which is care, which means safety and using evidence-based, up-to-date treatments. The second is compassion, which does not need any explanation. The third is continuity of care, which is threatened by the European working time directive, and the fourth is communication, which includes communication between doctors and patients, doctors and nurses, and doctors and other doctors. Communication is cut down by stress and overwork.</p>
	<p pid="a.296.0/8">The importance and potential cost of quality has been emphasised today by the Healthcare Commission's report on the Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust disasters. The questions that were posed and answered today, following the Secretary of State's statement, showed that there is much more to be found out. To me, the main message was that Monitor, which decides on foundation trust status, must surely take more note of quality of care, as it currently makes decisions based on finance and good governance. The standardised mortality ratio in Stafford was known in 2007, but that trust acquired foundation status in February 2008. There has to be much more evidence about quality.</p>
	<p pid="a.296.0/9">Let me make some suggestions about what we ought to be doing. We should, as my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2038" name="Bob Spink">the Member for Castle Point (Bob Spink)</phrase> has said, spend more on prevention, which is far cheaper than treatment. The first example of where work can be done on prevention is with health care associated infections. To give the Government their due, they have made that a tier 1 priority for the Care Quality Commission's inspections, so that is of paramount importance. The figure put on that saving is &pound;75 million.</p>
	<p pid="a.296.0/10">I am sure that the Minister will know, as I have mentioned it in his presence before, that I am absolutely desperate that the prevention of venous thromboembolism in hospitalised patients is given the same sort of priority as the prevention of health care acquired infections. When the Health Committee inquired into the prevention of venous thromboembolism in 2005, we learned that there were about 25,000 preventable deaths a year&mdash;at least a lot of them were preventable&mdash;and that coping with that problem would save about &pound;640 million a year. That is far more than could be saved by preventing health care associated infections, but it is not a priority. The relevant risk assessment, which is so essential, costs nothing, and the treatment cost is peanuts. This issue was mentioned in the report on what happened in Stafford. I have not read every word of that enormous report yet, but I have found that it blamed some of the deaths on the lack of risk assessment and the occurrence of venous thromboembolism. I hope that that might push the idea that risk assessment has to be mandatory and must be assessed by the CQC.</p>
	<p pid="a.296.0/11">Stillbirths and neo-natal deaths could also be prevented. The Stillbirth and Neonatal Death Society charity has drawn attention to the fact that there are 17 stillbirths or neo-natal deaths a day, which is about 6,500 a year, many of which could be prevented if research were done into the factors required to prevent them. The savings in litigation alone would be enormous.</p>
	<p pid="a.296.0/12">Prevention of HIV is another issue. There are huge treatment costs, and the numbers are increasing. The National AIDS Trust tells us that 7,800 people are newly diagnosed each year in this country, and that there are estimated to be more than 80,000 people with HIV, a quarter of whom do not know that they have it. The trust has made several recommendations as to what the Government should do, including giving support to teachers so that they can talk confidently in sex and relationship education. Other recommendations are training all health care professionals in primary and relevant secondary care specialties on HIV testing, introducing financial incentives for GPs in relation to HIV testing and pilot home sampling for HIV on the NHS.</p>
	<p pid="a.296.0/13">I do not think that the Minister will be surprised if I talk about NHS pathways yet again, because I have mentioned the subject to him many times. The programme is preventive in that, with the correct use of triage, it can prevent people from going to the wrong place. Just last week, I had a letter from a constituent saying that she turned up at one place that was not right, she was sent to another place that was not right and, because it was late at night, she had to be admitted to hospital for the night. That wasted a vast amount of money.</p>
	<p pid="a.296.0/14">If NHS pathways had been in place, I wonder if the problems at Stafford might have been eased. We know that the accident and emergency department there was clogged with minor problems because the report states that instead of concentrating on the severely ill, staff were diverted to deal with some of the minor problems and get them out of the way to meet the targets. NHS pathways would have prevented those minor cases being there at all, because the people concerned would have gone to the appropriate place. After the recent announcement that NHS pathways had been passed for use by ambulance trusts, I met the director of NHS pathways and the director of operations of NHS Direct. I appeal to the Minister to promote co-operation between those two triage systems so that we can work towards the same triage system throughout the country as a whole, which would make a huge difference.</p>
	<p pid="a.296.0/15">There are two other matters that have occurred to me literally in the past couple of days. The paediatric incontinence forum is worried that it will be pressurised into using the cheapest single-use catheters, but that could be a false economy because they are not as good at preventing infections. There is also a risk that financial stringencies mean that nurse specialists, who are the absolute experts in assessing the use of the right appliance, could be cut down. Nurse specialists will not necessarily choose the cheapest appliance, but in the long term, the cheapest is probably not the best.</p>
	<p pid="a.296.0/16">The Health Committee has done a lot of work on the issue of smoking and in the recent &quot;Health Inequalities&quot; report we point out that smuggled cigarettes and hand-rolled tobacco are the smoking materials of quite a high proportion of 16 to 24-year-olds, and a much higher proportion of the least well-off. I learned today that there is an answer to tobacco smuggling that is almost too good to be true because it would put precisely 1p on the cost of a packet and there would be no other costs at all. The proposal is a security solution, about which I will give the Minister details after the debate so that his officials can look into it. SICPA Security Solutions has a track-and-trace system that is already in use in several countries. The system allows smuggled cigarettes to be tracked and traced, which would surely cut down the amount of smuggled cigarettes fairly quickly. Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs focuses on detection, but the idea I have mentioned focuses on prevention, which is far better.</p>
	<p pid="a.296.0/17">I have spoken for a number of minutes without mentioning prioritisation or the dreaded word &quot;rationing&quot;, because there is much to be done before we fall back on to rationing. At last, I have found an excellent definition of rationing in health care settings in a 2007 paper from the primary care trust network and the NHS Confederation. The paper is entitled &quot;Priorities Setting: An Overview&quot; and is by Dr. Daphne Austin, who is a public health consultant and an adviser to the Health Committee. She defines rationing as:</p>
	<p pid="a.296.0/18" class="indent">&quot;a consequence of priority setting. A patient can experience rationing in many ways, including being denied access to a treatment or service, experiencing a delay or poor quality services which impact on the clinical outcome. It is advisable not to use the term 'rationing' as a verb; to do so is to imply that rationing is an optional activity. All positive decisions to fund are inextricably linked with a rationing consequence somewhere in the system.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.296.0/19">I will leave the Minister with that and the fact that in a resource-limited situation, for every decision to fund something extra, something else falls off the bottom of the ladder. We must avoid getting to that stage by making the NHS as efficient and waste free as we possibly can.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-03-18a.298.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1580" speakername="Ben Bradshaw" speakeroffice="The Minister of State, Department of Health"  colnum="298"  time="016:45:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090318/halltext/90318h0010.htm#09031893000538">
	<p pid="a.298.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1949" name="Richard Taylor">the hon. Member for Wyre Forest (Dr. Taylor)</phrase> on securing the debate. Given his long professional background in the field, few hon. Members have a better understanding of the importance of the sensible use of resources when it comes to health care spending.</p>
	<p pid="a.298.0/2">Before responding to one or two of the specific points that the hon. Gentleman made, I thought it might be helpful to put the matter in context. Often when people talk about value for money and productivity in the NHS, they come to it from a sort of widget-factory-based approach to productivity, rather than from the idea of productivity that he and I share and think is important. For example, people could conclude from the latest productivity reports from the Office for National Statistics that the NHS did not spend money efficiently. However, of course, ONS defines productivity as the amount of measurable output for a given input. By that measure, when the Government started their major investment in the NHS, productivity fell. Between 2001 and 2005, it fell by about 2 per cent. a year and by 2006 it had levelled off. So, even according to that measure, the tide was turning as long as three years ago.</p>
	<p pid="a.298.0/3">However, my difficulty with the crude assessment of productivity applied to the NHS is that it not only lags behind investment, but is an inappropriate way of measuring the success, value for money, and efficiency of the organisation. I shall give a couple examples in relation to that. The advances in health care provision and increases in staff numbers mean that many patients can now be treated in their own home and community. That is clearly better for their recovery and patients invariably prefer it. However, that can appear as a fall in measured productivity. Similarly, the hon. Gentleman mentioned the length of GP consultations. The average length of GP consultations has increased from eight to 12 minutes. Indeed, many good GP practices offer consultations that last a lot longer than that. I think we would all agree that that period of time is better for the patient and the GP, and that it can lead to better outcomes for the patient. However, as a crudely measured productivity statistic, that period of time spent with a patient will come across as a fall in NHS productivity.</p>
	<p pid="a.298.0/4">A more helpful and objective way of measuring the productivity and value for money of the NHS is to look at what international studies say about the NHS compared with other health care systems. The prestigious Commonwealth Fund in Washington has recently rated the NHS as one of the highest performing health services for the past three years. It specifically praised the NHS for managing chronic illnesses and access to primary care, and it also highlighted the NHS as one of the most cost-effective health care systems anywhere in the world.</p>
	<p pid="a.298.0/5">With the recent election of Barack Obama, it is instructive and topical to make a simple comparison with the United States. The US spends twice as much on health care as we do, as a proportion of gross domestic product, but has worse health outcomes, and tens of millions of Americans are not covered by their private health insurance system. A number of other recent international comparator studies have shown that the NHS is better at containing costs because we have a single purchaser system and we do not have the wasteful and profit-seeking involvement of insurance companies, private doctors and the pharmaceutical industry calling the shots.</p>
	<p pid="a.298.0/6">I shall now say a bit about what the Government are doing to achieve better value for money from the amount we spend. As the hon. Gentleman has mentioned, we introduced the better care, better value indicators, which were developed by the NHS Institute for Innovation and Improvement. They provide benchmarking data that all local NHS organisations can use to improve their performance. The indicators include such things as the proportion of patients who are seen as out-patients rather than in-patients, agency costs, and the proportion of statin prescriptions that are low-cost, generic drugs, rather than the more expensive, branded ones. By comparing their own results with other similar PCTs and trusts, NHS organisations can identify areas where they may be less productive than others. That, in turn, will help to inform their decisions on how best to target their resources to increase productivity.</p>
	<p pid="a.298.0/7">In the second quarter of 2008-09, eight in 10 indicators showed that, nationally, PCTs were improving. Those improvements led to efficiency savings of around &pound;170 million. In fact, the NHS Institute for Innovation and Improvement has just added three more prescribing indicators, which look at the use of generic medicines for lipid modification, proton pump inhibitors and drugs affecting the renin-angiotensin system. The hon. Gentleman will know much more about them than I do, but I am advised that analysis shows that those are all areas where there are the greatest gains to be made by switching to generics.</p>

	<p pid="a.300.1/1">I am extremely grateful for the hon. Gentleman's help.</p>
	<p pid="a.300.1/2">We constantly work with the NHS Institute to improve and expand those indicators, and to help local NHS organisations improve productivity and the quality of the care that they commission and provide. The hon. Gentleman was absolutely right to focus on the centrality and importance of quality. I am sure that even if he noticed nothing else about our health policy in the past year, he will have noticed the major next stage review by my noble Friend Lord Darzi, &quot;Our NHS, our future&quot;. The overriding principle of the review was that we have to shift the service from one that is about capacity, which was right 12 years ago when we suffered from serious undercapacity in the service, to one that is about quality.</p>
	<p pid="a.300.1/3">In most walks of life, we probably think of quality as something that is a bit pricey, a bit expensive&mdash;one pays a bit more for quality&mdash;but that is not the case in health systems. Quality is cheap, for all the reasons that the hon. Gentleman and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2038" name="Bob Spink">the hon. Member for Castle Point (Bob Spink)</phrase> mentioned. They gave examples such as prevention, doing more to tackle health care associated infections, and so on. We know from the clinical advice that we get that hospitals that are run well and efficiently and that provide high-quality care also tend to have a better handle on their finances. That is no accident.</p>
	<p pid="a.300.1/4">We could talk at length about the experience at the Mid Staffordshire NHS trust, and I will come to the point that the hon. Member for Wyre Forest made about it in a minute, but there is a strong correlation in hospitals between having a good handle on financial management, and high-quality care. The two are not mutually exclusive, as some people have tried to imply in the coverage of the terrible events in Mid Staffordshire&mdash;they usually go together.</p>
	<p pid="a.300.1/5">So, yes to more prevention and yes to more tackling of health care associated infections. As I am sure the hon. Members for Wyre Forest and for Castle Point both know, the NHS will from April have pre-screening for MRSA for all out-patients and all elective surgery in hospitals. We believe that, too, will help to reduce bills and improve the quality of health care.</p>
	<p pid="a.300.1/6">Venous thromboembolism has been raised with me before, and I will write to the hon. Member for Wyre Forest in detail on it. I recollect that there was a discussion with the Healthcare Commission as to whether it should be included as a stand-alone priority in the next&mdash;now the current&mdash;operating framework for the NHS, but it was decided that it would be better to include it in the existing performance standard on mortality than to burden the service, PCTs and trusts with ever more targets and priorities, given the pressure that is constantly on them.</p>
	<p pid="a.300.1/7">However, the Care Quality Commission is consulting on the issue and we are waiting to hear what it thinks we should do to ensure that the important points that the hon. Gentleman made about tackling venous thromboembolism are taken seriously by the service to achieve the efficiencies and savings that he would like.</p>

	<p pid="a.301.0/1">My understanding, which is slightly different, is that the Healthcare Commission and the chief medical officer's working party had actually agreed that venous thromboembolism should be assessed but that the Care Quality Commission did not agree. It told the Health Committee a week or two ago that the Secretary of State, not it, had made the decision, and last week the Health Committee got the Secretary of State to say that he would look into the matter. I hope that the events in Stafford might give an extra push so that the risk assessment, which determines the necessity for treatment, will be done.</p>

	<p pid="a.301.1/1">That is not my strict understanding of events, but I will happily write to the hon. Gentleman with full clarification, including the exchange of letters that I had with Sir Ian Kennedy when the matter was raised earlier. There was slight confusion about who wanted what and when.</p>
	<p pid="a.301.1/2">However, there is no doubt that the issue is important. We are cognisant of the fact that we want to get the balance right between burdening the service with ever more top-down targets, and ensuring that hospitals and PCTs on the ground take issues such as venous thromboembolism seriously. We are aware that the chief medical officer has flagged up the issue, and the Secretary of State and I take it seriously as well.</p>
	<p pid="a.301.1/3">The hon. Gentleman discussed what he described as rationing but I would describe as sensible commissioning. I hope that through the excellent world-class commissioning work that has been going on, he will see more and more that PCTs at local level are really gripping this important issue and are providing value for money for their taxpayers and also high-quality service for patients in their area.</p>
	<p pid="a.301.1/4">There are one or two other drivers of change in respect of value for money in the health service. Under the Gershon programme, we have made annual savings of around 3 per cent. for each of the past four years. In 2007-08, that meant a saving to the NHS of &pound;7.8 billion. The comprehensive spending review requires the NHS to maintain that level of saving until at least 2011.</p>
	<p pid="a.301.1/5">Through the pharmaceutical price regulation scheme, we recently negotiated a significant saving in the annual bill for branded drug treatments. It will lead to a &pound;350 million saving for the whole of the UK in 2009-10, with further annual savings of &pound;550 million in each of the four years after that. Going back to what I said earlier, that of course will not improve our productivity at all. That is another reason why we must take crude productivity measures of the NHS with a pinch of salt.</p>
	<p pid="a.301.1/6">The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right that we are now entering a period, after the current spending review period post-2011, when budgets will increasingly come under pressure. Getting value for money for the taxpayer as well as the most effective clinical outcomes has never been more important. With local control, the right incentives and the information that local providers need to make decisions that are right for their communities, the NHS can continue to provide excellent value for money for the taxpayer and provide patients with a better, more responsive, more personalised service than before. I am grateful for all the contributions that the hon. Gentleman has made towards that end.</p>
