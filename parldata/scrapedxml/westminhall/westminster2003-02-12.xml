	<p>It is a pleasure to initiate this very important debate, which is my first debate in Westminster Hall, having been locked up in the Whips Office for quite a long time.</p>
	<p>For many of us, Christmas is now a distant and, I hope, happy memory of good food, companionship and gifts. We might wince a little as we think of the cost. Perhaps we will joke with friends about the need to cut back on our waistlines, as well as our credit cards, but for many families the cost of Christmas is no laughing matter. Indeed, for many of those whom we represent, the phrase &quot;the cost of living&quot; is no abstract economic theory. Many families are paying for last Christmas, the one before that and the one before that, too, and will go on paying not only until next Christmas, but even far beyond.</p>
	<p>One mother told me, quite calmly, that she fully expected to die in debt. She is not a profligate woman, simply a single mum caring for a severely mentally handicapped son in a household dependent on benefit. She first got into what she called &quot;a little bit of debt&quot; when the washing machine broke down and she could not get social fund loan because she was still repaying a previous loan. So she borrowed money to buy a second-hand washing machine. Then Christmas came along, so she borrowed more money, as she put it, &quot;to give the bairns a good Christmas.&quot;</p>
	<p>She was struggling to keep her head above water when her son was reclassified from a dependant to someone in receipt of benefit in his own right. Inevitably, there were delays in processing the claim and, although the family are now once again receiving all due benefits, they had two weeks without any income at all. In those two weeks, it was necessary to borrow money to feed the family, as well as the electricity and gas meters, and she was unable to pay the catalogue, with the consequence that an already tightly stretched budget simply ripped apart. That case, which is replicated a hundred times over in estates in my constituency, illustrates the problems that face those on low incomes in our country. For too many people, debt is part of their day-to-day financial reality.</p>
	<p>Debt has always been with us, of course. I have a 96-year-old aunt who regales family parties with tales of family members or friends pawning dad's suit on Monday, redeeming it on Friday for the weekend and pawning it again the following Monday. Often, those were laughably called &quot;the good old days&quot;, but poverty in this day and age is no laughing matter. When people are poor, money is very expensive.</p>
	<p>A recent survey by the company Datamonitor estimated that more than one in five adults&mdash;7.8 million people&mdash;are victims of financial exclusion. They are routinely refused credit by banks, building societies and conventional lenders. We stand at the beginning of the second millennium, in a wealthy country, yet hundreds of thousands of people have to borrow money not for foreign holidays, but for food, gas, electricity and rent.</p>
	<p>Although hon. Members look at those figures and try to reconcile them with the raft of initiatives to fight financial exclusion&mdash;I am proud to say that they have come from a Labour Government&mdash;there are others who view the concept of social exclusion as a wonderful business opportunity. The only alternative for most people refused credit from a conventional source is to borrow from loan sharks. Loan sharks come in different guises and different sizes&mdash;some in the guise of reputable businesses&mdash;but they all have one thing in common: extortionate interest rates and charges.</p>
	<p>Some weeks ago, during Deputy Prime Minister's questions, I raised the plight of one of my constituents&mdash;I shall call him Mr. X&mdash;whose &pound;7,500 debt in 1986 had risen to a staggering &pound;43,000. My constituent had multiple debts. I must take this opportunity to correct the record, because I attributed the &pound;43,000 debt, to Provident Financial when I should have placed the blame fairly and squarely where it belonged, on another company, Paragon Finance&mdash;a successor to Universal Credit. Provident Financial was naturally upset about that mistake and felt that it damaged its good name, so I am pleased to put the record straight now.</p>
	<p>Provident Financial is, however, a major player in my constituency and one of the most successful credit providers. It was actually founded by a Wesleyan Methodist preacher, Joshua Waddilove, to provide small loans to the poor. Nowadays, its main business is to offer short-term, unsecured loans of between &pound;100 and &pound;400, with weekly payments collected by company agents. On the face of it, Provident Financial's most popular loan of &pound;100, requiring weekly payments of &pound;3 over 53 weeks, sounds easily manageable to low-income families. The overall cost of borrowing that &pound;100, however, is &pound;59. I am told by the Library that that is equivalent to an annual interest rate of 95 per cent. In this industry, however, interest rates can reach a staggering 160 per cent. and more.</p>
	<p>For many in Tyne Bridge and elsewhere, taking out a loan with the &quot;Provy&quot; is an accepted way of life. The &quot;Provy&quot; deliberately recruits friendly, local members of the community to collect its money. Incidentally, they are paid a commission on what they actually collect, not on what is owed, which also means that they are self- employed, thus saving Provident the tedium of personal injury insurance and other employment expenses. There is no doubt that they know their customers well, and they help their clients to take out new loans for Christmas, birthdays, new school uniforms and so on. Knowing the market is a feature of the enterprising lender.</p>
	<p>Cattles, another big shark in the pond, claims that it knows when to collect because</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;we have to get our money back before they spend it on alcohol, cigarettes, horse racing or whatever&quot;.</p>
	<p>That is a cynical stereotype, of course, but several common threads unite the cases of constituents who come to me for help. All are on low incomes. All bump along financially until an unexpected event&mdash;a cooker breaking down or, as in the case of Mr. X, sudden unemployment. All are at the mercy of high interest rates and charges.</p>
	<p>Unemployment meant that Mr. X could not meet his monthly repayments and he was therefore taken to court. Imagine his relief when the court decided that he should repay the debt by a fixed payment of &pound;40 per month, but froze the loan at its then level of &pound;9,500. At least he could see an end to the debt, albeit many years away. Imagine his horror when, in 2000, the House of Lords, in its wisdom, decided that lenders should be able to continue charging interest on their loans even after courts had set fixed repayments. Within months, Mr. X's loan account resembled a list of telephone numbers as the interest accrued. Perhaps the &pound;60 it costs to borrow a Provident loan fades into insignificance in comparison, but both illustrate the same high cost of borrowing for desperate people.</p>
	<p>I do not think that unscrupulous lending is confined only to loan sharks. Many banks offer payment protection insurance&mdash;PPI&mdash;to people taking out loans. My hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Anniesland (John Robertson) recently outlined a case in which a constituent of his had been advised to take out PPI, adding another &pound;1,000 to the loan that she took out with Lloyds TSB for her daughter's wedding. That was no problem, except that PPI is insurance to ensure repayments in the case of loss of employment. My hon. Friend's constituent was unemployed and therefore ineligible for the benefits of PPI . She was not advised of that; on the contrary, she was advised that the insurance was in her interest. I had a virtually identical case in which a woman had taken out a loan with Lloyds TSB and had also taken out PPI. She, too, was unemployed&mdash;in fact, her income came from maintenance payments from her ex-husband&mdash;so she, too, could not benefit from PPI. Yet the policy had added massively to the cost of loan repayments: more than &pound;1,000 extra on a &pound;3,000 loan. It was virtually worthless to the borrower. To add insult to injury, interest was charged on the full amount including the insurance premium.</p>
	<p>No one would advocate that Provident, Paragon or any other lender should lend without charging any interest. We do not expect them to behave like charities. There should, however, be a maximum level of interest that a lender can charge. Interest rate ceilings operate in several European countries and most US states. In Ireland, for example, lenders are required to register their charges, while Holland has an interest rate ceiling of 40 per cent. Right now, in the UK, the only curb comes from the Consumer Credit Act 1974 and the Office of Fair Trading. The Trading Standards Institute has admitted that the legislation is ineffective and that successful prosecutions are rare.</p>
	<p>The Labour party has a manifesto commitment to crack down on loan sharks, and to consider statutory limits on credit interest rates. The legal definition of extortionate credit therefore needs to be redefined to provide effective protection against creditors who charge extortionate rates or operate oppressive practices or impose oppressive terms. There should also be an obligation on finance companies and banks to advise customers that payment protection insurance is not relevant in all cases.</p>
	<p>Too little attention is given to the regulation of the activities of the alternative credit market, yet that market is growing. We are now subjected to television advertising by debt management companies, unsolicited e-mails from loan companies, and mountains of junk mail offering easy money. The rights of low-income customers to financial services are not sufficiently supported or enforced and too little is done to promote consumer power or confidence.</p>
	<p>We penalise our poor several times over. For instance, it is cheaper to pay for gas, electricity and water by direct debit, but that option is not open to people who do not have a bank account. They pay correspondingly more for their fuel because they use the key system, in which a meter key is charged up to enable access.</p>
	<p>On one estate in the north-east, two thirds of the people who took part in a recent survey had had credit applications to conventional sources refused. That was for a variety of reasons, such as postcode, outstanding debts, the credit history of a previous occupant, or too low an income. Of those surveyed, 46 per cent. were in debt to buy clothes, 37 per cent. to buy food, and 16 per cent. to meet fuel bills. We drive our poor into the arms of loan sharks.</p>
	<p>There is an alternative. Credit unions exist in many communities to offer credit to people who are excluded from the high street banks and building societies. Of course, they charge interest too, but at a much lower rate&mdash;usually about 13 per cent. A person taking out a &pound;100 loan would pay back as little as &pound;106.50, compared with the massive &pound;159 they would pay back to the &quot;Provy&quot;. A credit union is owned and run by its members, who save regularly into a common fund and who share the common bond of where they live or work. Credit unions keep money within a community and increase people's control over their finances. In the areas where credit unions operate, they have an obvious and immediate impact on the amount of extortionate borrowing.</p>
	<p>The Government support credit unions and have done much to promote them. I hope that my hon. Friend the Financial Secretary to the Treasury will be able to tell us today that more will be done to help the development of credit unions and to curb the worst excesses of those who prey on the financial problems of too many low-income families in our constituencies.</p>

	<p>I welcome my hon. Friend the Member for Tyne Bridge (Mr. Clelland) back to the land of the living from the Whips Office. He has done his constituents, the House and the country a service by raising this deeply serious matter, and I hope that this will not be the last time that it is debated in the House. Unjustifiable charging locks the poorest into deep and long-term debt and people are left with no alternatives to get the basics they need to survive.</p>
	<p>In the heady world of economics, we refer to financial shocks. My hon. Friend put it well when he spoke of unexpected events. A new baby will need a pram or a carrycot. If a relationship breaks down, people may need a new home, for which a bed, sofa, cooker and curtains will be needed. To people who are poor, &pound;4.99 a week may seem a manageable offer. However, in practice, a degree in maths is usually needed to work out the compound annual percentage rate noted in the small print.</p>
	<p>I am pleased to see the Financial Secretary to the Treasury here today. She was at the launch of the &quot;end doorstep debt&quot; campaign, which was set up by Church Action on Poverty and others. I know that she takes these matters seriously, so I am pleased that she will be responding to the debate today.</p>
	<p>We must take steps to tackle this injustice. The loan system is generating poverty. All our efforts at regeneration are being undermined by the increase in poverty that is caused by the loan system&mdash;loan sharks and legal lenders who lend at incredibly high rates of interest.</p>
	<p>In my neighbourhood, at the corner of Armley town street and Branch road, in Leeds, West, a Lloyds bank was boarded up for some months but has now been reopened as the Western Union Cash Connector. It sounds like something from the wild west. It is plastered with luminous red and yellow signs advertising financial services, pawn broking, cash loans, cheques cashed, and pay day advances. The signs also say &quot;Goods back later, raise your cash today.&quot; It is not the only such lender in the neighbourhood. Non-standard loan companies offer loans to people who cannot get credit from banks and buildings societies and who do not have enough money to have a bank account or an ordinary credit card. Such companies are proliferating, especially the cheque-cashing companies or what are known euphemistically in my constituency as the wage-stretcher businesses. A company called Clear-a-Cheque has two branches in Wortley and Old Farnley and it offers to cash wage cheques, pension payouts, social security cheques, giros or even a lottery ticket if it can be seen to be a winner.</p>
	<p>Companies, such as Provident Financial, First National and others, put leaflets through doors advertising their rates of interest, but their charges for cashing a third-party cheque include a deduction of between 8 and 15 per cent. They then add on a cheque-handling charge of between &pound;2 and &pound;5. Therefore, in practice, cash advanced against a personal cheque for &pound;100 to be settled 28 days later can run up interest charges of at least 17 per cent.</p>
	<p>The injustice is that a loan of &pound;100 can mean repayments of&mdash;to quote three companies&mdash;&pound;191.76, &pound;202.80 or &pound;220.24 at unbelievable APRs. I have worked out the APR in those cases at 280.5 per cent., 329.9 per cent. and 440.1 per cent. respectively. How out of line those rates are with the current bank rate of 4 per cent.! As my hon. Friend the Member for Tyne Bridge spelled out, a credit union commendably offers a rate of 12.6 per cent. The figures I cited illustrate how the poorest in our neighbourhoods are being deliberately targeted to tie them to long-term unsustainable debt.</p>
	<p>In my neighbourhood, there is a company called Brighthouse, which used to be called Crazy George's, and it put a catalogue through doors with the offer:</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;Discover Affordable Shopping Made Easy&quot;.</p>
	<p>Its brochure says:</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;All our products are available with no deposit and no credit checks.&quot;</p>
	<p>Unlike other discount stores, the goods are expensive and all the goods are quoted at the per week hire purchase price which appears, in bold letters, as &pound;4.99 a week. However, the total cash price is buried in the small print underneath. The cost of a bed is &pound;4.99 for 156 weeks&mdash;that is three years&mdash;and that runs at an APR of 29.9 per cent. In other words, the actual cost of the bed, without a mattress, works out at &pound;432.38. At MFI, the same bed costs &pound;189 with a mattress. People are getting over-priced goods at incredibly high rates of repayment.</p>

	<p>I am glad that my hon. Friend has mentioned Crazy George's as there is a branch of that outfit in my constituency. Does he agree that action should be taken to ban such activities or, at least, ensure that the true costs of lending and the true interest rates are made clear and visible to customers, who should not be misled in the way that he has highlighted?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2003-02-12.258.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/718" speakername="John Battle" colnum="258"  time="09:42:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200203/cmhansrd/vo030212/halltext/30212h01.htm#30212h01_spnew3">
	<p>I completely agree.</p>
	<p>We should be open about the fact that this activity is perfectly legal. It can be licensed. But we need to spell out who is paying the highest price. Brighthouse is funded by a major bank, so we are all locked into an unjust loan system for the poorest. Those involved are fostering deep debt, so I could argue that use of credit cards by the rest of us is at the expense of the poorest, because the cards are being subsidised by those paying the highest rates&mdash;inflated rates&mdash;as in the case of Brighthouse customers.</p>
	<p>We could also make it plainer that there are alternatives. The cost of a second-hand washing machine at &pound;421.51, with a payment of &pound;6.50 a week over three years, will work out at &pound;1,028.04 on an APR of 29.9 per cent. In addition, service and insurance charges can be as much as the price of the machine. Remploy is reconditioning washing machines that can be bought for a quarter of the cost. People need to be aware that there are alternatives.</p>
	<p>I stress that what the companies are doing is not illegal, but what little the poorest have is being taken off them by incredibly exorbitant interest rates. The poorest are being forced to pay the most in our society, not least because they have nowhere else to go. An estimated 7.9 million people in Britain, one in five, unable to obtain money direct from a high street bank or a finance house, have no choice but to borrow at very high rates of interest from those money lenders.</p>
	<p>This sub-prime lending market, as it is sometimes described, is not illegal, but it is highly lucrative. The market analyst, Datamonitor, claims that it is huge, worth at least &pound;16 billion a year. Who is that money coming from? Answer: the poorest.</p>
	<p>Datamonitor published in January a report on sub-prime lending, &quot;UK Non-Standard and Sub-Prime Lending 2003&quot;, which provided five-year forecasts for these markets, examining competitive and regulatory developments. It suggested strategies for new business developments, providing non-standard lending products to the poorest. Chapter 6, on home-collected credit, contained an assessment of the impact on the debt of the doorstep campaign, led by Church Action on Poverty and other charities, commenting:</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;Government initiatives: despite the hype they currently pose little threat&quot;</p>
	<p>If my hon. Friend the Minister wants her Department to buy the Datamonitor report, it will find it quite difficult, because the report costs $3,215, which is beyond the budget of the Library of the House.</p>
	<p>If that organisation is suggesting to sub-prime lenders that the Government will do nothing to interfere with them, but will enable them to expand their market, we should be interfering more to tackle the problem and not leave reports advising the bankers buried in documents that no one can afford. It is big, lucrative business.</p>
	<p>On 26 January <i>The Sunday Times</i> spelled out that some of Britain's banks are behind the sub-prime lenders. They are making millions by charging interest rates of up to 80 per cent. on loans and credit to the poorest. The Associates, owned by Citibank Group, is pushing unsecured personal loans at rates of up to 36 per cent. Next the newspaper referred to First National, then owned by Abbey National, which recently sold it to GE Capital.</p>
	<p>I pause for a moment to reflect on Abbey National and First National. First National was the consumer credit arm of Abbey National. It was sold to GE Capital last week for &pound;848 million. GE Capital pointed out on its website that the &pound;848 million price included &pound;355 million cash or &quot;surplus equity&quot; as well as &pound;630 million underlying net tangible assets. Where has that &pound;355 million surplus come from? Answer: the poorest in our society, locked into paying high interest rates for years.</p>
	<p>Brighthouse is owned by Nomura bank, which is making money out of the poorest and hiding behind the high street banks and finance companies, perhaps hoping that we shall not notice.</p>
	<p>The huge profits that are going to the banks are being sucked out of the poorest areas. A study of residents of the Meadowell estate on Tyneside found that 85 per cent. of households on three streets were paying moneylenders nearly a third of their weekly income in credit. Collectively, they were paying an astonishing &pound;370,000 a year. The average income was &pound;200 a week. What are we playing at when that amount of money is being sucked out of poorer neighbourhoods? Those companies, which charge up to 20 times more than the base rate through their subsidiaries, are targeting low earners in a &pound;16 billion lucrative sub-prime money lending market.</p>
	<p>It is not simply a matter of leakage, as the New Economics Foundation calls it, as money is pulled out of poor areas, but a matter of the banks making a profit from the poorest which they use to run their whole organisations. In practice, the banks are forcing the poor to subsidise the credit cards of the better-off by making them pay the highest rates of all. What sense can we make of social inclusion policies when the poorest are forced to pay the most? It is the inverse of justice. It is not just one circle, in which poor people go to those companies because they do not know any better and cannot add up while the rest of us sit by and say, &quot;If only the poor were not so ignorant and organised their affairs better, the world would be a better place.&quot; We are all locked into the problem. Our lower-cost credit cards come on the backs of the poorest in society, who are locked into deeper debt by extortionate lenders. We are tied into the same system. The credit cards of the better-off are provided at the expense of the poorest who are crippled by debt.</p>
	<p>What should we do about it? I have three suggestions, and I thank the 140 Members who signed early-day motion 257. The first is to have a cap on lending rates, as set out in the Consumer Credit Act 1974. Let us put that cap back so that people are not allowed to lend on APRs of 100 per cent., 200 per cent., 80 per cent. and so on. The second is to ask the Minister to ask her colleagues in the Department for Work and Pensions to revamp the social fund. People who apply to the social fund are told that they cannot get a grant. Instead, they have to get a loan and, as they are not wealthy enough to pay it back, they are locked into the system run by the sub-prime lenders. The social fund should give people an alternative.</p>
	<p>My third suggestion is to back up the plea by my hon. Friend the Member for Tyne Bridge for more support for alternatives, such as credit unions, in our neighbourhoods to give people a practical choice. They need a collective bank and lending organisation that lets them get at the basics. The issue will not go away overnight, but I am convinced that the Government could do more to introduce preventive measures now to ensure that the poorest do not pay the highest price.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2003-02-12.260.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/790" speakername="Colin Challen" colnum="260"  time="09:58:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200203/cmhansrd/vo030212/halltext/30212h01.htm#30212h01_spnew4">
	<p>I, too, congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Tyne Bridge (Mr. Clelland) on securing this important debate. It takes place in the context of a Government who have done more than most to tackle poverty, first and foremost by cutting unemployment, but also by such means as introducing working tax credits, the national minimum wage and the extra and targeted help for pensioners. For some loan sharks, however, the prospect of the poor getting a bit more money is a mouth-watering proposition to be exploited to the full. Judging by the news I read last week, the Low Pay Unit has been disbanded. That is a great shame and I hope that steps will be taken to maintain an organisation that speaks up for the low paid and identifies the causes of poverty, because it is still widespread.</p>
	<p>Poverty is not simply about having a certain level of income, but about how that income is spent. In contrast to the poor, it is often the case that the rich pay less, and sometimes nothing, for their loans. Better interest rates, more understanding from the banks and special deals are always on offer to those who have a decent income. For those who have an indecent income, there is always the lure of offshore tax havens, where they can shelter their no doubt hard-earned cash out of reach of the taxman.</p>
	<p>For many of my constituents, no such opportunities arise. Their financial advisers are of a different, unscrupulous variety&mdash;loan shark is the name that we mostly associate with such people. However, in my constituency it is more common to find respectable companies making a killing from selling expensive loans to people in urgent need of money. Those public limited companies sport well-designed websites, produce glossy leaflets and no doubt have a sales patter to match. Loans are not their only business. Being the caring people that they are, they are into expensive insurance as well.</p>
	<p>A case brought to my attention involves a constituent who was loaned &pound;500&mdash;not much by today's standards. On top of that, he bought health care insurance at &pound;130 and optional payment protection insurance for another &pound;100. In addition, he faced a &pound;65 acceptance fee, making a total of &pound;795. He received the whole sum on credit, and the APR was 90 per cent. Such charges are both extortionate and disproportionate, especially as the loan was only for 12 months. None of that insurance protected my constituent when repayment became difficult for him. Indeed, the authors of his misfortune, Welcome Financial Services Ltd.&mdash;a misnomer if ever there was one&mdash;called at his mother's house threatening court action. To add to the irony of its name, the company has won an Investors in People award. It would say that it is doing nothing illegal and would, no doubt, point to other loan sharks whose behaviour is 10 or 100 times worse. However, that is no defence. Those rip-offs may seem more respectable, but they are still rip-offs. According to a copy of my constituent's repayment record, he had managed to repay about &pound;290 of the original loan&mdash;more than half of the lump sum that he wanted&mdash;before he ran into difficulties.</p>

	<p>One of my constituents borrowed money for a car. He took out a protection loan of almost &pound;700, but he was fooled into taking out extra insurance, most of which was covered by his car insurance anyway.

	<p>I am grateful to my hon. Friend for that example, which shows that insurance mis-selling is rife. Never mind interest rates and so on, we must urge the Minister to address the problem of insurance mis-selling.</p>
	<p>The loan period for my constituent began in May 2002. By 5 November last year, his debt was &pound;902.43, despite the money that he had paid back. I am dealing with a similar case, in which one of my constituents borrowed &pound;7,000 plus an astonishing &pound;1,400 insurance fee in 1990. She now owes more than &pound;11,000. Some of that debtor's problems stem from the fact that shortly after getting the loan, she was diagnosed with breast cancer. The lender, the Consumer Loans Company Ltd., apparently thought that she should have known about that before taking out the loan. A sum of &pound;8,000 has been repaid, but &pound;11,000 is still outstanding. The loan company is a subsidiary of a larger, respectable corporation and is part of Nikko Principal Investments Ltd. We are therefore not talking about little back-street outfits which double up as cowboy wheel clampers. These are companies that pride themselves on their image as big players, but their apparent corporate social responsibility does not bear scrutiny.</p>
	<p>There must be much tougher regulation of consumer loans and, indeed, other types of personal finance. Like, I am sure, every Member here today, I fully support the work of credit unions, and am pleased to have attended an exploratory meeting in Morley, which sought to extend the credit union movement to the town. There must be an attack on two fronts; not only do we need the sound, reliable credit union alternative but we must crack down on loan sharks. I think that some credit card suppliers fall into that category. We must establish limits on what companies can charge in relation to loans. All the insurances that prove to be useless when the time comes to call upon them must bear some relation to the amount that is borrowed, and it must be clear whether they are optional. There should also be a statutory limit on interest rates. We should not permit extortion. I want local registers of licensed loan companies to be publicly available, and door-to-door loan selling should be outlawed.</p>
	<p>Perhaps some of those measures could be described as anti-market. So be it. I remember a loan market that did not operate unscrupulously. My first record player was bought in 27 instalments of &pound;1 a week, funded out of my pocket money, and &pound;27 was the ticket price of the item. I might add that at the age of 13 or 14, I did not have a previous credit record, so by today's standards, I would never have been given the opportunity to borrow in the first place. Now it seems that what people are being sold is not the merchandise so much as the loan and insurance, and that the people at whom the loans are being targeted are generally the low-paid. This is a market in misery and it is time for the Government to stamp it out.</p>

	<p>I, too, congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Tyne Bridge (Mr. Clelland) on securing this debate. Of course, this is not the first debate in this Session on subjects related to debt. The fact that the issue arises time and again in Westminster Hall shows that in constituencies throughout the country, this is a problem of which we as Members of Parliament are all aware and on which the need for continued action grows day by day.</p>
	<p>I should like to highlight a particular aspect of the difficulties faced by people&mdash;especially those on low incomes&mdash;who fall into debt that they cannot repay: the growing business of debt management companies, which is taking an increasingly high profile in many of our constituencies. I am sure that hon. Members will be aware of the activities of debt management companies, which offer an apparently attractive way of dealing with the mountain of debt that presses down on people by bringing all their debts, whether they are from credit cards, store cards or loans, into one easy-to-pay monthly offer. Such companies appear to offer an attractive way of getting out of the financial difficulties caused by multiple debts.</p>
	<p>Many hon. Members will have seen that advertising by such companies is appearing increasingly frequently on television, in the newspapers and elsewhere. Such advertising could persuade the consumer that the companies are altruistic enterprises that offer their services almost out of the goodness of their hearts. What customers often do not realise until they become trapped in debt management companies' tentacles, however, is that they are commercial organisations that are rapacious in the charges and fees that they extract from the people whom they have encouraged to use their services.</p>
	<p>Customers of debt management companies typically pay charges for the service provided that equal about 15 to 25 per cent. of their total debt. They will normally have to pay an initial set-up fee and will be charged an ongoing monthly fee that can be a very high percentage of their total repayments. Guidance is provided by the OFT and there is legislation that seeks to regulate this area of activity, but the evidence shows that the regulation is not effective and needs tightening up. People often need to be freed from the further entrapment in debt that can result from their taking out contracts with debt management companies.</p>
	<p>A recent survey by the Consumers Association published in <i>Which?</i> magazine investigated the behaviour of a total of seven different debt management companies, most of which were big operations functioning throughout the country. For every single company, there was at least one instance of its having breached the OFT guidelines. Indeed, the Consumers Association came across other examples of practices which may not have been in breach of the guidelines but which were certainly unacceptable.</p>
	<p>I would like to highlight some examples of the practices of these debt management companies. One of the most obvious ways in which such companies operate&mdash;one that I find totally unacceptable&mdash;is to use misleading advertising. This issue was drawn to my attention not only by the Consumers Association report but because one of these organisations has recently started advertising in the Edinburgh area. That stimulated my interest in this subject. I have here an advert from a company called EuroDebt, which advertises the fact that the company has opened a new Edinburgh office this month. The advert itself is described as &quot;advertorial&quot;, which is obviously designed to encourage readers to believe that it is not what it seems to be. It tells us that the regional adviser for EuroDebt in Edinburgh is aware that</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;personal debt is a huge and growing social problem . . . EuroDebt's staff are fully aware of the trauma that debt problems can cause an individual or family. The never-ending stream of threatening letters and phone calls causes untold problems and stress.&quot;</p>
	<p>The advert ends by urging its readers:</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;If you want further information, why not call&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p>it gives a number&mdash;</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;for a confidential meeting&mdash;it costs nothing to talk and listen.&quot;</p>
	<p>Nowhere is there any mention of the fact that charges or fees will be involved. The innocent reader could well get the impression that this is some kind of altruistic enterprise by the company. This company is not unique and these practices are not unique to that part of the country.</p>

	<p>I do not know whether my hon. Friend has satellite or digital TV, but I was quite shocked when I discovered that most of the adverts on such TV channels are about debt relief. These adverts often give the impression that if someone signs up to what the adverts propose, all their debts will suddenly disappear or be managed much more easily. What they do not say is that, in offering these services even to people with a bad credit record, the companies will demand ginormous repayments that will leave people with a worse debt than the one they already have.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2003-02-12.264.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1038" speakername="Mark Lazarowicz" colnum="264"  time="10:06:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200203/cmhansrd/vo030212/halltext/30212h01.htm#30212h01_spnew9">
	<p>That is absolutely correct. My hon. Friend has illustrated how the advertising and publicity for this type of company is now very widespread. It appears in all forms of media, but it is typically directed at those who are likely to be either on a low income or suffering from heavy levels of debt, or both. I am glad that my hon. Friend has drawn that issue to hon. Members' attention.</p>
	<p>The fact that people are not aware of the initial set-up fees&mdash;the cost of getting involved in this type of service&mdash;was highlighted by the Consumers Association report, which found that only three of the seven debt management companies that it investigated made it clear that an initial set-up fee was involved. This was just one example of ways in which companies were extracting more money from those who were already in a difficult financial situation.</p>
	<p>I have received a briefing from Citizens Advice Scotland on this issue, which gives a host of examples of ways in which a fee-charging system can operate. There is not time for me to outline them all, but I would like to highlight two examples that illustrate the type of practice that is going on. A citizens advice bureau in east Scotland told of a single female client who received incapacity benefit. She had multiple debts incurred through illness, which required her to leave her full-time job. She contacted a debt management company to deal with debts of approximately &pound;58,000. The company calculated a repayment of &pound;526 a month, of which &pound;95 would be a fee. If the agreement ran its term, the client would be required to make payments to the debt management company for 11 years, during which it would receive more than &pound;12,000 in fees.</p>
	<p>At the opposite end of the financial scale, a CAB in the south of Scotland told of a client with two children who received income support. Her debts amounted to approximately &pound;2,000. She had used a debt management company and was paying &pound;110 a month towards her debt, of which &pound;19 was the fee to the company. In her case, the CAB could offer her a free money advice service. She got the service for nothing from the CAB when she was paying approximately 20 per cent. of her debt repayments to the debt management company.</p>
	<p>EuroDebt, as I said, has begun to advertise in the Edinburgh area. The Consumers Association, in its investigation, was shown a letter from that company which suggested that a client should pay &pound;10 a month to be split between various creditors but EuroDebt would charge &pound;29 a month for its services. It charged more for its services than the sum that it suggested for repaying her debts.</p>
	<p>I have given examples of the way in which debt management companies frequently behave. The Consumers Association and Citizens Advice Scotland have a host of other examples of the way in which such companies rip off the people whom they have encouraged to use their services.</p>

	<p>Does my hon. Friend agree that if our debate conveys any message to low paid people in our constituencies, it is that those who get into financial trouble should contact an accredited credit union or, if none are available, the CAB, which does fantastic work and can guide them along the right path?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2003-02-12.264.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1038" speakername="Mark Lazarowicz" colnum="264"  time="10:06:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200203/cmhansrd/vo030212/halltext/30212h01.htm#30212h01_spnew11">
	<p>Absolutely. We must always advise people not to use to such loan companies and to go to the CAB and bodies such as the Consumer Credit Counselling Service, which offers a free service, as hon. Members know. People should also use the debt helpline, which the Government have set up in various parts of the country.</p>
	<p>As my hon. Friend the Member for Tyne Bridge and others have said, one of the most effective methods of dealing with debt management companies is providing alternative services and ensuring that they are funded and well publicised. No matter how tight the regulations, some companies will try to find ways round them because debt is big business, and big companies and big interests are involved in it.</p>
	<p>EuroDebt claims in its advert that it employs approximately 200 people nationwide. I am sure that that represents the tip of the iceberg. Alternative forms of debt management advice and credit need greater publicity and support. However, the legislation and the guidelines need to be tightened. Such businesses currently operate legally, and conditions and guidelines are meant to be in place. Evidence that I have gleaned from surveys by bodies such as the Consumers Association and Citizens Advice Scotland shows that the guidelines are not being enforced as tightly as they could be.</p>
	<p>Under existing guidelines, we want the Office of Fair Trading and, when appropriate, the Financial Services Authority to police debt management companies and clamp down on their practices, which drive so many of our constituents into ever deeper poverty. That should be a priority. I hope that the Financial Secretary can give a commitment that she will tell the OFT and the FSA that they should clamp down on the practices that I have described more effectively and directly.</p>

	<p>(Mr. Frank Cook): I ask hon. Members to remember that it is normal practice to set aside the final 30 minutes of 90-minute debates for the three winding-up speeches.

We have 41 minutes and I expect the winding-up speeches not to exceed one third of that time.</p>

	<p>I am sure that I shall be able to comply with that request.</p>
	<p>I congratulate the hon. Member for Tyne Bridge (Mr. Clelland) on raising an important issue. It has been debated before, but it is essential that we keep returning to it. It is felt that a lot of talk is going on, but no action has yet been taken to deal with the abuses perpetrated by a range of companies&mdash;not just small loan sharks, but some of the major high street retailers, through store cards, and some of the major credit card companies.</p>
	<p>Much has already been said today about the lower end of the market, the most disreputable end&mdash;loan sharks, for instance. I want to concentrate on the behaviour of the major high street retailers and credit card companies, some of whose practices are also pretty disreputable.</p>
	<p>There is nothing wrong with borrowing; we all indulge in it, myself included. It is when borrowing gets out of control that it causes real problems. Those on the lowest incomes are affected most, and the misery that they suffer is quite unacceptable.</p>
	<p>Back in October, during a debate initiated by the hon. Member for Edinburgh, North and Leith (Mr. Lazarowicz), the Under-Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, the hon. Member for Welwyn Hatfield (Miss Johnson), said</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;Ultimately, individuals have a responsibility to manage their own finances effectively, but the Government's role is to empower them to do so. We need to be able to create the right regulatory framework to facilitate a competitive market environment and ensure appropriate consumer protection.&quot; [<i>Official Report, Westminster Hall</i>, 30 October 2002; Vol. 391, c. 294WH.]</p>
	<p>I agree with all that, but we are not there yet, which is why this debate is so important.</p>
	<p>A recent report by the Select Committee on the Treasury examined the issue of credit cards. The Committee found a serious lack of transparency in the information given to consumers. Everyone thinks about the APR advertised by credit card companies, but the Committee discovered that it was possible to have three credit cards with the same APR, but to pay a different price for the credit in each case. That is because a number of other charges are involved, depending on the length of the interest-free period, on whether there is an interest-free period, and on which debts are paid off first. Changes in the rules are often not made clear to consumers. When taking evidence, the Committee was told that it would take a mathematician to calculate the amount that was actually due.</p>
	<p>That is not acceptable. I would like companies themselves to regulate the situation by agreement, but they are reluctant to get to grips with the problem. They are, as it were, drinking in the last chance saloon. They need to get their act together and demonstrate that they can provide transparency. If they do not, regulation must be considered.</p>
	<p>There has been a good deal of talk about amendment to the banking code, but nothing of any substance has happened yet. I think that all credit card companies should be required to present clear examples based on, say, borrowing of &pound;1,000. They should say how much it would cost, in actual pounds, to repay that amount after a certain number of months. It is no good setting out an APR that, as I said, may mean very different things, depending on all the other charges. Consumers need to know about the actual cost of the credit, rather than the very complicated ways of calculating it. That reform is possible, but still no action has been taken.</p>
	<p>The interest rates charged by some of the major high street retailers on store cards are absolutely scandalous, to the extent that they make credit cards look cheap. Again, it is the poor who suffer most. Those with financial nous and plenty of cash flow can play the system: they can take advantage of introductory offers and pay the card off within the specified interest-free period. However, those without that ability and cash flow end up getting themselves into real trouble.</p>
	<p>Just before Christmas, my researcher and I conducted a small study. He went to Oxford street to find out how much credit he could get in one day by wandering into a number of major high street retailers. He built up, in theory, a total of &pound;6,850&mdash;I should hasten to add that he did not actually spend the money&mdash;in a single stroll down Oxford street. The interest rates charged constitute a scandal. There is a real hall of shame of high street retailers, of which I shall give some examples. It is worth pointing out that most of these companies provide a small discount for those who pay off the debt by direct debit, but for those who do not&mdash;often, people on the lowest incomes find it impossible to pay by direct debit&mdash;the example interest rates are as follows. British Home Stores charges an APR of 29 per cent; Laura Ashley charges 30.7 per cent; River Island charges 29.9 per cent; Top Man charges 29.9 per cent.&mdash;&quot;Top Man&quot;, but a top rate of interest&mdash;Wallis charges 30.9 per cent; and Allders charges 29.8 per cent. So it goes on.</p>
	<p>The House of Commons Library made the following calculation in respect of Allders, which offers up to &pound;2,000 credit on the day that one goes into the shop. If minimum payments are made on that maximum credit limit, the cost for just one year is &pound;451. That is totally unacceptable. Total borrowing on credit and debt cards was estimated to have reached some &pound;20 billion by December last year. The lack of transparency in respect of store cards that is unacceptable. The details are often hidden in the small print, so the consumer simply does not notice them when they take out the card. Here, I should mention the honourable exception of John Lewis, which charges only 13 per cent. That demonstrates how unacceptable the others are, and if John Lewis can do it at 13 per cent., so can they.</p>
	<p>I want to add to the comments of the hon. Member for Edinburgh, North and Leith about the outrageous behaviour of debt management companies. The Consumers Association made a serious contribution to the debate by carrying out the investigation to which he referred. However, such companies prey on the fear and panic of people who are already having real difficulty paying off debt. As we have heard, those companies advertise in all sorts of media, including daytime television. Their aim is to capture people who, in fact, do have the sensible alternative route of their local citizens advice bureau. There are also other means of obtaining free advice&mdash;advice that is often much more effective in determining what best such people should do to address their debt problems. As others have done today, I pay tribute to the work of citizens advice bureaux throughout the country, and to the army of volunteers who do so much to help people in these desperate situations.</p>
	<p>Mention has been made of the Office of Fair Trading standards, but the Consumers Association found that those standards had been breached by all the companies that it surveyed. Some of the breaches have already been referred to, but I want to pick out one or two examples. Companies often fail to carry out a proper assessment. Sometimes, assessments are made merely after a nine-minute telephone conversation. That is an inadequate basis on which to determine the scale of the problem and how best to resolve it.</p>
	<p>There is a complete lack of transparency about the fees charged by debt management companies. Having to pay fees when one is already deep in debt simply makes the debt worse. The same applies to the penalties for terminating contracts early.</p>
	<p>Companies do not deal with the priority debts. They put to one side debts such as council tax payments, rent arrears and court fines, which is extremely irresponsible. If those debts are not given priority, the person could lose their home or go to prison.</p>
	<p>Extraordinary means are used to sell products to people in desperate need. For example, Gregory Pennington Ltd. recommended that the Consumers Association investigator take out an account with the Royal Bank of Scotland, that had a &pound;25 set-up fee and a charge of &pound;8 a month thereafter, when a basic bank account would have been a much more sensible choice. The same company advised taking out payment protection insurance, a point to which the hon. Member for Tyne Bridge referred. The charge for the insurance was &pound;7.50 per &pound;100 of cover. That is completely unacceptable. Pressurised selling techniques were also used by another company, Baines and Ernst. Such companies play on the fact that people are desperate for help.</p>
	<p>People are persuaded to consolidate their debts or to secure debts against their property. A range of debts may pose real problems for an individual, but if they end up with a loan secured on their house that they are unable to repay, they could lose the house. That can only make the situation worse.</p>
	<p>I referred earlier to the Minister's comments in the debate last October. What is being done to ensure that the abuses are addressed? At present, we have an over-indebtedness taskforce; a Department of Trade and Industry working group on marketing techniques; a performance and innovation unit report, &quot;Lending support: Modernising the Government's use of loans&quot;, which recommended a review of Government policy on over-indebtedness, so a further review was set up; a review of the Consumer Credit Act 1974; and the Cruickshank report. There is a lot of talk, but where is the action?We need proper controls in this sector, ideally by agreement and voluntary self-regulation, but if that is not possible, the Government must look into regulation.</p>

	<p>I, too, congratulate the hon. Member for Tyne Bridge (Mr. Clelland), not only on securing the debate but, as he rightly said, on escaping from the Whips Office. This is his first outing since that event.</p>
	<p>The hon. Gentleman brought out the issues at the heart of the debate by highlighting the general question of debt through personal stories. The key point is the link between low income, debt and poverty, which is why the title of the debate is so apt. Money is not the only thing that we should consider when we are trying to break the cycle of low income and poverty. We should also give people opportunities to help themselves and make their own way in the world. We need to bear that wider point in mind.</p>
	<p>As well as providing immediate practical help, whether dealing with loan sharks or with other problems, we should think about the wider issues. We should try to create ladders of opportunity, especially in education, so that we can help people genuinely and permanently to break the cycle of poverty.</p>
	<p>At the heart of the Government's plans to assist people on low incomes are tax credits, which are not the only way of providing real help. In 1971, Keith Joseph introduced family income supplement with the express intention of boosting the incomes of people in low-paid jobs. In 1988, it was replaced by family credit, which by 1997 had provided more than &pound;2 billion of support to families on the lowest incomes. The new Labour Government could have chosen to invest in that scheme but tried to introduce their own system of tax credits. The Public Accounts Committee has identified many of the problems of complexity and administrative cost.</p>
	<p>The first problem that I have identified is low take-up by the very people whom the system is meant to help. The latest figures from the Child Poverty Action Group show that 600,000 low-income families are losing out on anything up to &pound;1.4 billion a year. That represents 30 per cent. of those entitled to help, and, for families, that can mean anything up to &pound;42 a week.</p>
	<p>We should have realised how bad the figures were by the way in which the Government issued them. Late on 23 December&mdash;the eve of Christmas eve&mdash;the figures were quietly posted on the Inland Revenue's website. If it had not been for the prompt action of the CPAG and others, those figures might have been missed. That kind of behaviour, whether intentional or the result of incompetence, undermines public trust. I hope that the Minister will address that point when she replies.</p>
	<p>The second problem with the tax credit system is that it can trap people in low-paid, part-time work when increased income from working longer does not cover the loss in benefits. Since the introduction of working families tax credit, just 9 per cent. of lone parents have been able to work longer. The Minister will say that the new child tax credit will raise the threshold before recipients lose out but does she recognise that such traps are inherent in the system and explain how the Government intend to deal with that?</p>

	<p>The hon. Gentleman must live in a different world. The Government measure that has helped to alleviate poverty more than any other is family tax credits. Many of my constituents have benefited greatly from making work pay for the first time and are far better off. The remit of the debate is how rapacious loan sharks take money from such families. That is where the problem lies, not with the Government giving families extra money, which is what tax credits do.</p>

	<p>The hon. Lady ignores the fact that one third of those entitled to the benefit are not helped and are still stuck in the trap.</p>
	<p>The third problem with tax credits is their effect on the self-employed and their families because the system is inflexible and does not deal with income fluctuations. The average income of the self-employed is only two thirds of that of the rest of the work force. One example is farming, where the average income has dropped 70 per cent. in recent years, to just &pound;10,000 per year. No one would suggest that farmers are not in need of help, but because their income fluctuates throughout the year and between years, farmers and farm workers&mdash;many of whom are also self-employed&mdash;find that the tax credit system does not work for them. Debates on poverty and low incomes often focus on the inner city but I hope that the Minister will take the opportunity to respond on rural poverty. It is not right that people who live in generally affluent areas in the countryside but who are on low incomes should be excluded. I am sure that the Financial Secretary will wish to refer to that point in her reply.</p>
	<p>Many hon. Members have rightly mentioned debt and the link between low incomes and rising indebtedness. The figures on indebtedness make worrying reading. According to the Government's figures, UK consumers owe &pound;151 billion in outstanding unsecured debt. The Bank of England has reported that household debt stands at 110 per cent. of annual disposable income and the Institute for Fiscal Studies has highlighted that a third of those on the lowest incomes are in debt, with the average amount owed being &pound;3,337. Debt is rising in value, and drawing in many thousands more families. It is most acute for those struggling to make ends meet. The stories that the hon. Member for Tyne Bridge mentioned closely underline the problem.</p>
	<p>In my constituency, we have some excellent citizens advice bureaux that provide a caring and professional service in tackling debt problems, and I echo the comments made by hon. Members about their excellent work. Nationally, the citizens advice bureaux reckon that they have seen new cases of problem debt worth more than &pound;1.2 billion in the last 12 months. Of course, as hon. Members have pointed out, most people with debt problems are on below-average incomes.</p>
	<p>One aspect of the problem&mdash;it has not yet been mentioned, but I would be interested to hear the Financial Secretary's view&mdash;is that half of all people on income support are trying to pay off loans not only to loan sharks but to the Government, in the form of the social fund. Indeed, some pressure groups have called for a reform of that fund. Perhaps in her reply, the Financial Secretary could tell us what plans the Government have to respond to those calls.</p>
	<p>There is a clear need to provide improved consumer information and financial education. Can the Financial Secretary tell us what plans she has to improve financial information and advice for those on low incomes? What resources have the Government provided to assist the citizens advice bureaux with their role and does she envisage that that will increase? Will the resources provided by the Government target both urban and rural centres? Given that the Financial Services Authority, for which she is personally responsible, has an important part to play in consumer financial information, what discussions has she had with it to encourage it to form greater links with the citizens advice bureaux, nationally or locally?</p>
	<p>The challenge of helping those who earn the least is one that has vexed Governments of all persuasions. Our shared aim must be to provide a genuine hand-up out of poverty to enable people to be independent and help them to avoid the traps of benefit dependency and prowling loan sharks. The Government's tax credit system is, sadly, too complicated and inhibiting to help many people; as I said, at least a third of the poorest families fail to claim the money to which they are entitled. Equally, the burden of debt is growing and it hurts the poorest most.</p>
	<p>There is an urgent need for a comprehensive approach to helping people to tackle debts, while at the same time deterring millions of others from making the same mistakes. The Government have made great claims about their commitment to tackling those problems and I look forward to the Financial Secretary setting out her vision for the future and the Government's plans for answering the vital questions raised in this debate.</p>

	<p>I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Tyne Bridge (Mr. Clelland) on securing this important debate. He spoke with passion about the plight of his constituents and their experience of debt and poverty. I also pay tribute to my hon. Friend the Member for Leeds, West (Mr. Battle), who has long campaigned on these issues. I know that he was closely involved with Church Action on Poverty and I am pleased to see that his campaigning continues, so that we all remain aware of the issues faced by those who suffer from debt and low income.</p>
	<p>I firmly believe that the approach that we take to low income, debt and poverty defines us as a society. It also says a lot about the Government themselves and the approach that they take. We inherited an extremely difficult situation, but we recognise that the problem needs to be tackled on many fronts.</p>
	<p>First, we believe that high levels of employment are essential to combat poverty, and helping to secure decent family income is an essential part of our strategy. Secondly, we have to deliver excellent public services. Thirdly, we support parents so that they, in turn, can provide better support for their children. Fourthly, we have to harness the power and expertise of the voluntary and community sector so that people are enabled and empowered to help themselves. Finally, as many hon. Members have said today, we have to work to combat the problems of financial exclusion, debt, the associated menace of loan sharks and the threat that borrowing at exorbitant rates of interest presents to our most disadvantaged communities.</p>
	<p>Before examining that issue in greater depth, as it has been raised most in the debate, let me say in response to the hon. Member for Hertford and Stortford (Mr. Prisk), who speaks for the Conservative party, that the key to the Government's strategy for reducing poverty is to ensure decent family incomes. Tax credits have played an enormous role in boosting family incomes, and it is disingenuous to say that, because take-up has not been 100 per cent., the Government have made no real effort to tackle poverty and that tax credits have not been immensely beneficial to those who claim them.</p>

	<p>Is not the fact that 600,000 people are not taking up those tax credits a serious problem?</p>

	<p>If the hon. Gentleman is specifically talking about the data on take-up so far in the public domain, I should point out that the only take-up data that we have relate to the first fiscal year for tax credits and show a take-up of 62 to 65 per cent., but that has risen steadily in the past six months to almost 70 per cent. The amount that is being claimed, rather than the number claiming, is higher still and has risen to up to 83 per cent. in the past six months. In fact, tax credits are having an impact and helping those who need it most.</p>
	<p>In the remaining time allowed to me, I want to concentrate on the points about debt and loan sharks that have been made by many hon. Members today. All hon. Members will sympathise with the problems that have been experienced. Indeed, we have been disturbed by the stories that we have heard. Those problems often result from unforeseen circumstances&mdash;unemployment, a new baby arriving or, perhaps, family break-up&mdash;that cause huge strains on individuals and families in certain neighbourhoods.</p>
	<p>Part of the answer must lie in the work on loan sharks being undertaken by the Under-Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, my hon. Friend the Member for Welwyn Hatfield (Miss Johnson), and I shall convey to her directly the views that have been expressed today. She is determined to ensure that action is taken in a number of areas where vulnerable consumers may be at risk. To that end, on 30 January this year, she published her response to the second report of the taskforce on tackling over-indebtedness, which was set up to examine what measures are necessary to ensure responsible lending across the full range of products and lenders.</p>
	<p>In her response, my hon. Friend identified her concern that the industry should follow the principles of responsible lending that have been set out. She outlined a number of ways in which that could be encouraged, including the importance of carrying out appropriate checks prior to making a loan. She and officials at the Department of Trade and Industry are talking to the industry about those measures.</p>
	<p>In addition, the DTI is undertaking a major review of consumer credit legislation. The review is intended to deliver on the Government's manifesto commitment to improve protection against loan sharks, delivering a consumer credit regime that is relevant to the modern market. There have already been consultations on the Consumer Credit Act's financial limit, and on proposals for new rules on the early settlement of credit agreements, to achieve a fairer balance between lenders and borrowers. The hon. Member for North Norfolk (Norman Lamb) specifically mentioned the difficulty of comparing interest rates being charged on store cards and credit cards. The DTI review will specifically consider how such comparisons can be made much easier to understand, and how more clarity can be introduced.</p>

	<p>Will my hon. Friend assure me that the Government have not ruled out capping interest rates? That has happened in Europe&mdash;in France, Germany and elsewhere&mdash;where the Crazy Georges have been driven out.</p>

	<p>On 30 January, the DTI launched a consultation specifically on strengthening the consumer credit licensing regime, and it will issue a consultation on extortionate credit later in spring. One of the issues that will be considered in that consultation is whether there should be a cap on the interest rate charged. I encourage hon. Members to feed their views directly into the DTI during that consultation period, as, clearly, that will be important in influencing the outcome of the reviews.</p>
	<p>My hon. Friend the Member for Tyne Bridge raised the sale of payment protection insurance and how that is marketed by banks, sometimes in inappropriate circumstances, adding to the financial difficulty that some people have in servicing their loans. That is another issue that the DTI has looked at. I believe that it has already approached the FSA to ask it to consider that issue as part of its consultation on insurance selling and administration. If my hon. Friend wants to contact the FSA directly to make his case again, I suggest that that would be very valuable.</p>
	<p>Part of the answer to all these questions must lie in much better financial education, as well as working directly with the financial services industry to end financial exclusion. Many hon. Members referred to the role that credit unions can play in that regard. As not-for-profit organisations, credit unions are run for the benefit of their members, with their lending interest rates set by statute at no more than 1 per cent. a month. Their ability to offer savings and affordable credit have made them particularly attractive to those on low or variable incomes. In particular, their ethos of thrift and self-reliance, together with their aims of member education and training, means that they are well placed to extend the availability of basic financial services to parts of our society that are often ignored by other financial providers.</p>
	<p>I am pleased that the credit union movement has been growing although it remains much smaller than those in some other countries, such as Ireland. In the five years from 1995 to 2000, the number of credit unions grew by about 30 per cent. The Government are very keen to support the growth of the credit union movement, and we have worked hard to encourage an environment in which it is easier for credit unions to grow. The Financial Services Authority is now the authority that is legally responsible for regulation of credit unions. Moving regulation to the FSA and the new regime have produced clear benefits for credit union members, giving them greater financial independence and access to prescribed complaints arrangements, including, for example, the financial ombudsman service. That should help to build confidence among prospective savers with credit unions.</p>
	<p>The new regulatory regime is one of a number of changes that we have introduced that will benefit the credit union movement. We are also close to implementing further changes to credit union legislation, which we have introduced through a regulatory reform order. The changes should enable credit unions to compete more effectively with other credit institutions for deposits, and facilitate the further growth of the movement. Those and other legislative reforms will improve the value of the services that credit unions can offer their members and will help to protect some of the most vulnerable members of society from the problems of debt, exorbitant interest and financial exclusion.</p>
	<p>We never shut our door to suggestions on how to encourage the growth of credit unions or other alternative sources of financial services. We keep an open mind on how we can encourage diversity in the sector and work to combat financial exclusion more effectively.</p>
	<p>An initiative that has so far been successful has been our work with the banks on the introduction of basic bank accounts. That issue was raised today. I am pleased to say that every high street bank now offers a basic bank account. When the universal bank is launched with the Post Office later in the spring, all benefit recipients will have the opportunity of using a basic bank account. That will offer them the advantage of no longer incurring a penalty, or a higher charge, because they do not pay utility bills, for example, by direct debit. Such accounts are also attractive to people on low incomes because they protect savers from falling into an overdraft. They are attractive to people who have not had access to financial services before.</p>
	<p>The social fund was mentioned. It clearly has a role in helping people to overcome especially difficult financial circumstances. We listen to concerns about the social fund and the way in which it operates. That is why, from April, &pound;90 million will be added to the budget of the discretionary social fund over the three years to 2005&ndash;06. The maximum payment for the fixed element of the funeral grant will rise from &pound;600 to &pound;700. Combined with other administrative improvements, the investment will enhance the fund's ability to help those on low incomes to manage their finances. However, the door to suggestions is not closed. The Government are considering, and will continue to consider, the case for future reform of the social fund, to improve its ability to help those on low incomes.</p>
	<p>Like other hon. Members, I pay tribute to the work of citizens advice bureaux in providing debt advice. The hon. Member for Hertford and Stortford asked what action the Government were taking to build on that work. The Treasury is working closely with the FSA to see whether we can build on the debt advice service in citizens advice bureaux and other voluntary and commercial institutions and offer a broader financial advice service that is especially accessible to those on low and middle incomes. That work continues and I hope that it will be successful.</p>
	<p>The Treasury is also working specifically on financial education and advice, joining up the work that is being done across Government Departments, to ensure that we have appropriately expressed and clearly defined objectives, and that we bring all the work of financial education and literacy together. We must have a joined-up approach to these issues, which are central to our objectives.</p>

	<p>Although many people decry the debates held in this Chamber, I welcome the greater flexibility that its layout offers. It enables me to hold an Adjournment debate by addressing the Minister face to face instead of talking to the back of his neck.</p>
	<p>I make absolutely no apology for returning to a subject&mdash;young people and public transport&mdash;that I have raised before, particularly in the ten-minute Bill that I introduced in the previous Session on travel concessions for young people. Public transport and, in particular, affordable public transport is a key issue for young people. Whenever I speak to young people in my constituency, every discussion always comes back to transport. The issue is top of their list, because it affects every other aspect of their lives.</p>
	<p>In many ways, young people are like pensioners. Both groups are heavily reliant on public transport and have low access to cars. Both are, in general, low-income groups. Unlike pensioners who, regardless of their income, are all eligible for travel concessions on public transport, only specific groups of young people are entitled to travel concessions. Usually, those concessions are for those in full-time education and training, and sometimes only for journeys to and from school or college. The scale of the concessions varies widely across the country, since they are offered at the discretion of local authorities. The transition from half-fare to full fare also occurs at different ages across the country and, sometimes, it takes place for people as young as 14.</p>
	<p>Access to affordable transport is a social exclusion issue. The cost of transport excludes many young people from full access to other facilities and services. However, there is another important transport reason for providing concessions: it is to encourage young people to use public transport. The Government have rightly set a target for increasing bus passenger usage by 10 per cent. by 2010 and they are trying to discourage the use of cars in urban areas.</p>
	<p>As I said, young people are already, relatively speaking, heavy users of public transport. Some 13 per cent. of all journeys by 17 to 20-year-olds are by bus, which is more than twice the proportion of other age groups. However, all too often, their dissatisfaction with public transport means that, as soon as they can, they acquire alternative means of transport. They see public transport as the transport that they use if they have nothing else available and not as the transport that they use out of choice.</p>
	<p>If young people were encouraged to use public transport and found it affordable, reliable and convenient, they would be much more likely to regard it as a reasonable alternative to car use, at least for some journeys. As they got older, they would be more likely to continue using public transport instead of reverting to using private cars. We need to promote familiarity with public transport in young people if we are to have any hope of building greater bus usage by adults.</p>
	<p>The Commission for Integrated Transport considered how Government funding can best be used to promote greater bus usage in its recent report, &quot;Public Subsidy for the Bus Industry&quot;. Its recommendations included the idea that the Government should increase the total public subsidy to buses and that the subsidy should be related to bus passenger usage rather than bus mileage.</p>
	<p>The commission also recommended that, since bus passenger growth in London has already exceeded the 10 per cent. target&mdash;I think it has increased by 30 per cent.&mdash;the Government should set a separate 10 per cent. target for the rest of England, excluding London, to provide an impetus to everywhere else to try to catch up with London's example.</p>
	<p>The commission recommended that travel concessions should be used to reduce social exclusion by being extended to socially disadvantaged groups on means-tested benefits, and that half-fare concession fares should be introduced, where not already provided, for education journeys for those in full-time education. Finally, the commission suggested that half-fare concessions should be introduced, where not already provided, for all under-16s for all journeys, to promote a more positive attitude to bus use.</p>
	<p>My hon. Friend the Minister is well aware that affordable transport is a big issue for young people. In November 2002, the Youth Parliament held a special session at Westminster on public transport. My hon. Friend attended and responded to the concerns expressed by the members of the Youth Parliament, who were gathered from all over the country.</p>
	<p>Last week, the Youth Parliament held a further meeting at Westminster, and again transport issues were raised. Its members identified a number of problems in relation to bus transport: the low frequency of services and, particularly, the fact that there were few services in the evenings and at weekends; the poor quality of many buses, and the often hostile attitude of staff to young people; and poor information about service frequencies and routes. But above all, affordability was still the major issue.</p>
	<p>The Government's social exclusion unit has gathered statistics on young people and transport. They show that nearly half of 16 to 18-year-olds say that they find transport costs hard to meet. In 1999, the average annual transport cost to students in post-16 education was &pound;371. Six per cent of 16 to 24-year-olds had turned down training or further education over the previous 12 months because of transport problems.</p>
	<p>A survey carried out by members of the Youth Parliament in Essex showed that the problems are just as real for younger students. The Essex survey of 732 14 to 18-year-olds showed that 309 identified cost as a reason why they do not use buses more. That is more than two out of five of those young people.</p>
	<p>The same barriers affect people on benefits as well as young people. More than one in six people in low-income areas have turned down a job in the past 12 months because of transport problems, and 38 per cent. of jobseekers say that transport is a key barrier to getting a job. It is a depressing thought, when we are trying to persuade people out of cars and on to public transport, that jobseekers with driving licences are twice as likely to get jobs as those without.</p>
	<p>I turn to the Government's role in addressing this issue. As I said, the Government are committed to increasing bus usage, particularly in urban areas. Young people should be considered an important target group. At present, the Government try to encourage bus usage through a variety of mechanisms. The first is direct public subsidy to bus companies, through the fuel duty rebate, at a total cost at present of &pound;253 million. That is a substantial direct subsidy.</p>
	<p>Secondly, the Government give guidelines to local authorities. For example, the guidelines on various transport schemes indicate that local authorities should include an element that will encourage greater bus usage, through schemes such as quality bus partnerships. The third mechanism is travel concessions.</p>
	<p>In the past, the Government have pointed out that local authorities already have the power to fund travel concessions for young people, and indeed for any other excluded group. That is true, but the Government's own survey of local authorities showed that there was huge variation across the country in whether travel concessions were available for young people and in which groups of young people were eligible. The view expressed last week by many members of the Youth Parliament was that central and local government all too often tried to pass the buck on this issue. When they speak to their local council, they are told, &quot;We would do it, but we need funding from the Government,&quot; while the Government say, &quot;We don't need to do it. Your local authority already has the power to do it if it wants to.&quot;</p>
	<p>The Government have established the precedent for pensioners by granting them an entitlement to a travel concession of at least a half fare across the country. It is open to local authorities to provide a more generous concession, but they are all obliged to provide at least that. There is no reason why the Government should not pursue the same policy by providing such a concession for young people.</p>
	<p>There is another player: the bus companies. They should be much more active in encouraging greater passenger usage among young people. Although young people are an important group of bus users, bus companies seem to be apathetic about encouraging greater usage and tapping into a potentially huge market of young bus users. When the Youth Parliament held its session in November, it was disappointed that more bus companies did not take up its invitation to attend. They were only interested in going if they could sell their wares and did not want to listen or respond to what young people wanted. Even when bus companies provide young people's travelcards entitling users to cheaper fares, publicity is often poor and many young people are unaware of their availability. The member of the Youth Parliament from Hertfordshire said that he had a &pound;5 card that entitled him to a half-fare, but he did not know of any other young people in Hertfordshire who knew of it or had applied for it.</p>
	<p>In recent discussions with my local bus company in Milton Keynes, it suggested that it was necessary to change the way in which Government and local authority subsidies are offered to bus companies. Most bus subsidies support particular services and give the company little or no incentive to attract extra passengers. The services remain essentially dependent on subsidy, locking the local authority or the Government into continued funding. An alternative would be to use subsidies as seedcorn to help the bus company to break into the youth market.</p>
	<p>For example, a subsidy could be given for a set period only, perhaps for three or four years, with the level of subsidy reducing year on year. Specific targets could be set for increased passenger usage, especially by young people, and part or all of the subsidy could be dependent on reaching those targets with perhaps the possibility of a bonus if the bus company exceeded them. Such a subsidy regime would encourage bus companies to grow passenger usage and to retain it as the subsidy diminished because they would keep the extra fare income. I suspect that the Treasury would welcome such an approach, because any public spending commitment would be time-limited and clearly linked to the achievement of Government aims.</p>
	<p>The Government say that they are committed to encouraging people to switch from the private car to public transport, especially in urban areas. Reducing social exclusion is also a Government target. By establishing the children and young persons unit, the Government have demonstrated their commitment to responding to the needs of young people. Buses are an extremely cost-effective, efficient and flexible mode of public transport. The Government should bring all those different aims together and respond to young people's calls for affordable and accessible transport.</p>
	<p>I ask the Minister to give serious consideration to two things. The first is to introduce a national half-fare travel concession for young people that is modelled on recent legislation for pensioners. In my ten-minute Bill, I asked for concessions for all young people aged under 25. Perhaps that was over-ambitious but I would be satisfied if, in the first instance, the Government introduced a national half-fare concession for all under-16s, extending it to all under-18s subsequently. Will the Minister estimate the cost of a national half-fare concession for under-16s and under-18s?</p>
	<p>Secondly, I would like the Minister to investigate using time-limited seedcorn subsidies to bus companies that are specifically linked to those companies that deliver increases in the number of young people who use their buses. That might be a way of kicking the bus companies into exploiting the youth market. I am sure that the Minister will give me a positive response, as he always does. I depend on it, as do all those young people whose horizons are currently limited by the lack of affordable transport</p>

	<p>I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Milton Keynes, South-West (Dr. Starkey) both on securing the debate and on her gritty determination on this and many other issues. She made an excellent point about making young people familiar with public transport to secure their commitment to using it. The bus companies should look at that, and we should look at how it could inform our policies.</p>
	<p>Last November, I very much enjoyed attending the Youth Parliament here in Westminster. It did not surprise me that transport was of substantial interest to young people around the country, as I know from soundings taken in my constituency that such views are common. I take my hon. Friend's point about the sometimes hostile attitude to young people of bus operators or drivers and conductors. However, it must be appreciated that drivers and conductors can find large numbers of young people formidable&mdash;it is a two-way process.</p>
	<p>I also know that young people's high spirits on buses, particularly when travelling to and from school, can spill over into antisocial behaviour. Two groups of people are affected: the drivers and people who operate the buses, and the vast majority of young people who use buses sensibly. Cracking down on such behaviour and getting good responses from bus companies is important to encourage the use of public transport, especially buses.</p>
	<p>My hon. Friend's conclusion was about the importance of getting the views of young people. The Department has been looking carefully at all our policies, not just on buses but on all relevant issues, to see how we can glean young people's views, and evaluate and respond to them. In a healthy democracy, it is extremely important to listen to young people. My experience is that we sometimes get a refreshing view entirely different from that of the conventional groups whom we consult.</p>
	<p>My hon. Friend raised the subject of extending concessionary fares to young people under 25 and referred to the recent report by the Commission for Integrated Transport on public subsidy for the bus industry. The Government are keen that young people should be encouraged to use local buses to get to the places where they need to go at fares that they can afford. We also want young people to continue with education and training beyond the statutory school-leaving age. I was therefore particularly concerned to hear those statistics on the number of people who may have been put off taking certain jobs or training because of lack of access to public transport.</p>
	<p>We all acknowledge that young people are often on lower incomes and have limited means of travel, but they are perhaps not as vociferous in drawing attention to their situation as older people. However, the Youth Parliament is putting that right, and I very much welcome its sensible, measured and consistent approach which, I believe, will bring it success. None the less, concessionary fare schemes are expensive and we cannot overlook the cost implications.</p>
	<p>A number of measures are already in place to help young people who are continuing in education and training with discounted transport costs. For example, under the Transport Act 1985, individual passenger transport authorities and local authorities outside London may extend their concessionary travel schemes to children aged up to 16 or to young people aged up to 18 who are still in full-time education. That power applies to all journeys by young people and not just those to and from school or college. Most bus operators also offer reduced fares for school children and many offer season tickets for young people at school and college, sometimes in partnership with colleges.</p>
	<p>In London, responsibility lies with Transport for London, under guidance from the Mayor. Cheaper bus and tube fares are currently offered to children under 16 and there are also discounts on period tickets for young people aged 16 and 17 and student card holders. The cheaper child fares&mdash;I use the expression for want of a better one&mdash;will be extended to all aged 16 to 17 from 1 April this year.</p>
	<p>The Government are also promoting the Connexions card project for 16 to 19-year-olds. The card, which was developed by the Department for Education and Skills, offers a range of commercial discounts for 16 to 19-year-olds. It is designed to encourage young people to stay in learning or training beyond the compulsory schooling years by rewarding attendance and is capable of carrying existing travel concessions. In addition, we should not forget that the young person's railcard extends to young people between 16 and 25. Train operators are required through the Strategic Rail Authority to offer the card, which offers savings of a third on a wide selection of ticket types.</p>
	<p>Further work by the Department for Education and Skills seeks to evaluate best practice for the provision of transport for students in further education. That work is linked to recent changes to legislation in the Education Act 2002 that clarify the role and responsibilities of local education authorities and their partners in assessing and providing transport for students aged 16 to 19 in further education. In future, LEAs will be required to collaborate with transport providers and other key local organisations in developing and publishing their policy statements for local students.</p>
	<p>The Department for Education and Skills has set up more than 60 local education authority-led transport pathfinders to test and develop innovative approaches to transport support and services. It has also set up a transport website that answers frequently asked questions, and a system to post LEA transport policy statements on the Connexions card website. To provide students with better information, our two Departments also aim to bring closer together the work of education and transport planners in local authorities.</p>
	<p>I turn now to the Commission for Integrated Transport's report. After a major study to examine the best use of subsidy, the commission suggested that patronage growth and better value could be brought about by reducing the existing concessions to elderly and disabled people, where they were more generous, to the statutory half-fare minimum. The commission suggested that that would assist in the provision of half-fare concessions to additionally socially disadvantaged groups and, where they are not already provided, to under-16s and over-16s for education journeys.</p>
	<p>The commission's report makes a useful contribution to the debate on the funding of the bus industry, but I must point out that we have no intention of changing the present statutory half-fare minimum requirement for concessionary travel for elderly and disabled people or of preventing local authorities from offering more generous schemes to those people if they wish to do so. I cannot stress that point too strongly, as it has been the subject of considerable concern among those groups.</p>
	<p>My hon. Friend asked for an estimate of the cost of half-fare concessionary travel for all young people under the age of 19. Our estimates suggest that it would be very expensive&mdash;possibly as much as &pound;500 million a year. There would also be a serious impact on the present arrangements because part of the cost is currently borne by commercial transport operators, so there would be a substantial switch of funds from private to public sector funding. We also estimate that to cover half-fare travel just for 16 to19-year-olds would cost in the region of &pound;180 million a year.</p>
	<p>I accept the argument that young people hear central Government saying that local government has the powers, and local government saying that it does not have the funds. It is quite right for members of the Youth Parliament to ask questions of the Government, but I said to them at the gathering&mdash;I have also said it to them privately&mdash;that these are matters that they should pursue with their local councillors as well. Those young people need a voice here at Westminster to help us to shape our policy, but it is also important that they make their voice heard where the policies are being enacted, in local councils. A lot of them had overlooked the fact that important decisions that affect their lives are taken at local council level. If they approach their local councillors and remind them that they can vote at 18, it might concentrate councillors' minds on putting issues important to young people higher up the agenda of the local authority. I am aware that young people in some areas have been quite successful in drawing these matters to the attention of their local councillors.</p>
	<p>The commission's report is only part of the work informing the wider debate on the value of subsidies to the bus industry and its passengers. In addition, as announced in the Budget last year, we are also holding our own review of bus subsidies to look at the value and effect of the &pound;1 billion a year paid by the Government to support bus services. We intend all this work to be drawn together in our review, which will report soon to Transport and Treasury Ministers. I can say now, however, that we see a role for the type of pump-priming support for new bus services that will deliver patronage growth and become viable over a finite period, as my hon. Friend has described today. We have been looking at the scope for this in the bus subsidy review, and we are now considering, as a first step in this direction, the funding of some pilot projects as part of this year's urban and rural bus challenges.</p>

	<p>I have to say to my hon. Friend that we have not recently been in the business of gathering more targets. She should accept my reassurance, however, that improving and increasing bus patronage across the age groups&mdash;and across the country, geographically&mdash;will certainly be our aim and intention. I shall take into consideration the issues that she has raised about targets, and we will put the matter into the process of the review.</p>
	<p>This has been a useful and interesting debate. My hon. Friend is urging us to get on with our work, and we certainly have a great deal in hand at present. We will evaluate carefully what the Commission for Integrated Transport and the social exclusion unit have to say, and then draw all the strands together in our bus subsidies review. My hon. Friend raised some vital issues on behalf of young people, and I assure her that her views and the other views that have been expressed outside the Chamber will be given the most careful consideration by my Department.</p>

	Emergency Planning
</major-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2003-02-12.283.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/750" speakername="Tom Brake" colnum="283"  time="14:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200203/cmhansrd/vo030212/halltext/30212h03.htm#30212h03_spnew0">
	<p>I welcome the opportunity to introduce this timely debate&mdash;indeed, it is perhaps timelier than I expected. I start by thanking Lord Macdonald, who briefed me recently, and Zyg Kowalczyk of the London resilience team, who briefed me last night. I also thank Nick Rowe&mdash;Kent county council's emergency planning officer&mdash;for keeping me well briefed.</p>
	<p>For more than half a century, emergency planning in the United Kingdom relied heavily on the Civil Defence Act 1948. For many years after the end of the cold war, there was a steady real-terms reduction in expenditure on emergency planning. That continued until the fuel delivery crisis and the major flooding in autumn 2000 finally brought an acknowledgement that all disasters require robust, integrated response arrangements. The events of today notwithstanding, the majority of disasters do not relate to hostile attack.</p>
	<p>The Government's commitment to review the emergency planning process, their establishment of the civil contingencies secretariat and their promotion of the concept of a resilient UK capable of bouncing back from any emergency were encouraging, but, sadly, the momentum appears to have been lost. There have recently been many changes among the secretariat's senior staff, and new guidelines on important issues have been slow to appear. Furthermore, there is still no certainty as to when a civil protection Bill will be introduced, although discussion papers that touch on its possible contents give cause for concern, and I shall provide two examples.</p>
	<p>First, two levels of duty might be imposed, one much more onerous than the other. The effect could be that water and electricity utility companies, which currently, and for very sound reasons, conduct extensive emergency planning and emergency exercises with other agencies, might in future have a statutory excuse merely to provide information and to co-operate. In other words, there would be a lower level of emergency planning.</p>
	<p>Secondly, it is recognised that local services usually handle large disasters such as rail crashes effectively, but things break down at national level. That is due in part to a lack of integration between the emergency arrangements of central Government Departments and agencies, and local services. It is therefore worrying that Departments do not appear to be included among the bodies on which a duty will be imposed. Lord Macdonald highlighted the position of the Benefits Agency when I met him. Clearly, the agency is not a front-line organisation, but it would be required to play a key role in the aftermath of any incident by providing assistance to those who had been displaced. However, it appears to have no emergency plans in place&mdash;at least, it has no relationship with local authorities when it comes to providing assistance. I hope that the issue is being investigated as a result of my discussions with Lord Macdonald, and the Minister may have something to say about it.</p>
	<p>Will the Minister confirm, if he can, the expected publication date for the civil protection Bill? Will he undertake to ensure that it imposes similar duties on central Government Departments and agencies, local government and the emergency services?</p>
	<p>The slow progress that I have described is all the more worrying given increased public concern since 11 September. That concern has been exacerbated by the position regarding Iraq, and by the number of occasions recently, including yesterday and today, when the Prime Minister has stated that we are at risk of terrorist attack.</p>
	<p>Should a terrorist attack occur, it might well involve biological or chemical agents or sources of nuclear radiation. The seriousness with which the Government treat that possibility is evidenced by the many millions of pounds spent since 11 September in training and equipping the emergency services to work in contaminated environments and to stockpile equipment for decontamination and treatment of victims.</p>
	<p>In that case, why have the Government not taken steps to educate the public about what they might do as individuals to help themselves and others? Clearly, it is expected that individuals will help themselves. The Government and other agencies will not be in a position to help every individual. They will be overstretched in dealing with the number of people who are vulnerable.</p>
	<p>Everyone in this country who lives in a possible flood zone receives guidance about flooding. There are regular flood warnings. Every time we climb on board an aeroplane we are given emergency instructions. Before the recent fire brigade strikes an extensive publicity campaign was launched to draw to people's attention the things that they could do to help themselves. Why is that not happening with respect to a chemical, biological, radiological or nuclear incident?</p>
	<p>Other countries are providing relevant advice. I am aware of that in one country, at least. I spoke to someone at the BBC yesterday who had just been e-mailed by a friend in the USA, who said that she had been advised to stockpile water and food, and to buy plastic sheeting and so on, to enable her to secure a safe area in her property. That is happening in other countries.</p>
	<p>I am afraid that available Government guidance will not necessarily be all that helpful. For instance, on Monday 3 February the Government published strategic national guidance on the decontamination of people. However, anyone who has visited the website and worked through the 38-page document will have found little to suggest what assistance could be provided to them if an incident occurred.</p>
	<p>In addition, that document is fundamentally flawed in respect of the procedures that it sets out. It appears to take no account of human behaviour&mdash;particularly crowd dynamics. I doubt whether anyone in the Chamber today seriously believes that, if there were an attack of some sort, we would all wait calmly for the fire brigade to arrive and set up their spraying equipment outside, after which we would take off our clothes and be washed down with the conveniently located buckets and sponges that appendix B of the guidance specifies, and then proceed to the welcoming arms of the ambulance service.</p>
	<p>Clearly, that would not happen. If an incident took place, some people would be seriously affected and seriously ill. We need much more honesty.</p>

	<p>The hon. Gentleman seems to be suggesting that America is better prepared for such attacks. He itemised a couple of issues that the Americans have pursued. Will he go into some detail about what practical help he thinks could be offered? His argument so far seems to be a philosophical one. Has he any concrete suggestions about how such advice could be applied in the UK?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2003-02-12.285.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/750" speakername="Tom Brake" colnum="285"  time="14:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200203/cmhansrd/vo030212/halltext/30212h03.htm#30212h03_spnew2">
	<p>I shall indeed come on to that point. I did not necessarily mean that the USA is better prepared in all respects, but it is clearly making more information available to its citizens and considering a wider range of possible threats. A state senator told me that thought is being given to the placing of one-way valves in the water supply system to ensure that no one can install a pump in a flat or house and pump some sort of toxic chemical back into the water system. Clearly, if we go into that sort of area, a huge amount of effort and funding will be necessary, so I am not suggesting that we should follow that route. However, we may have struck the wrong balance on making public information available.</p>
	<p>Why has no official guidance been provided so far? I appreciate the risk associated with taking the &quot;Protect and Survive&quot; approach, because people may belittle the information provided or think it of no value, but we need to go further than we have. Will the Minister tell us his thoughts about what form the information should take? Will it take the form of leaflets distributed by local authorities or television advertisements or a website?</p>
	<p>In the case of a possible biological attack, it is probable that a disease, such as smallpox, would be introduced covertly and that we would find out about it days or weeks after it was introduced into the population, perhaps picking it up in hospitals. However, central Government have issued no policy guidance and no local discussions have taken place between health authorities, police forces and local government about how an attack should be managed, including what emergency powers might be needed. I would welcome the Minister's comments on that.</p>
	<p>Clearly, the Government fear the potential of such an event and the casualties that might result. I understand that the Home Office has commissioned a retired coroner to survey existing arrangements to deal with mass fatalities, but I do not think that the initiative will bear much fruit. I understand that most local authorities and other agencies have made no arrangements to deal with mass fatalities because no policy exists. Therefore, although it was clear how large volumes of animal carcases should be dealt with, the legal, political and social issues of doing anything with a human body that departs from current normal procedures are so huge that no local agency will want to stick its head above the parapet and dream up plans to deal with the problem. I hope that the Minister will be able to tell us when the Government will issue policies on the management of pandemics of contagious diseases and when they will issue policies on the management of mass fatalities.</p>
	<p>I do not want to overemphasise resources. I know that the Government have made funding available for the emergency services, but issues remain regarding local authority grants. The size of event with which local authorities may have to contend goes way beyond the sort of event that we have had to get used to, such as a car bomb attack, so a step change is needed in emergency planning, and that carries a price tag. The necessary plans, equipment and arrangements will place additional demands on finances. The Government have not recognised that yet. I hope that as part of their preparations for the Civil Contingencies Bill, as they identify what roles and responsibilities local authorities and other agencies will play, the Government will see the extent of what is involved and address grants as part of that process.</p>
	<p>We need a clear statement from the Government that contingency funds will be made available in the case of an exceptional incident, because that has not clearly been stated. It would be extremely remiss if, following a major incident, there were delays in the system because some organisations had concerns about whether they were going to be reimbursed for the extra costs incurred, so I would welcome a comment from the Minister on that.</p>
	<p>Central London and the Palace of Westminster are presumably prime targets for terrorists, who aim to strike at the heart of the nation. The London resilience team has been preparing plans and arrangements in order to respond to a major disaster in London, and the civil contingencies secretariat refers to its work. However, we have heard rumours about the London resilience team's proposals, rather than receiving any formal information or advice, which again raises the issue of what the public should be informed about. People who live in London and most of those who work there have not been provided with any formal information or advice. However, I understand that discussions are ongoing with larger businesses, so some work is being done. Little work has been done on sharing information or the content of those proposals with the emergency services and local authorities in the home counties, which would obviously both have a role in mass evacuation. Again, however, that work is in the pipeline.</p>
	<p>The London resilience team published a report called &quot;London Resilience&quot; in March 2002. It contains more than 100 recommendations about how to improve emergency planning in London, and I received a welcome briefing on it last night. However, I have been denied a copy of the report, and I am seeking to obtain one under the code of conduct of access to Government information. Without having sight of the report, which contains recommendations and time scales that detail the times by which things must be done, it is impossible for me to judge whether London can handle a large-scale attack, or whether the actions that local authorities and others are required to take, which must be reported quarterly, are being taken with appropriate swiftness. I understand the need to keep some of the content of the report concealed from people, including Members of Parliament. Equally, however, I hope that the Minister will understand that Opposition Members, who want to be able to guarantee that the necessary action is being taken and who want to see that improvements are being made and that plans are being put in place, will not be satisfied only with reassurances that that is happening.</p>

	<p>I am somewhat confused. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will address the practical issues to do with what he suggests. Does he agree that publication of the document that he seeks might put the lives of Londoners at risk, but that partial publication would raise more questions than it answered?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2003-02-12.287.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/750" speakername="Tom Brake" colnum="287"  time="14:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200203/cmhansrd/vo030212/halltext/30212h03.htm#30212h03_spnew4">
	<p>I am not advocating publication of the report in the <i>Evening Standard</i> or <i>The Sunday Times</i>. I am suggesting that there might be an agreement by which a copy can be made available to hon. Members under certain conditions. That has happened in relation to other reports, albeit reports that were commercially confidential as opposed to confidential for reasons of security. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will agree that if he were an Opposition Member, he would not be satisfied with listening to Ministers' or the London resilience team's assurances that everything was in hand and under control. He would want to see the detail of what had been proposed and would want evidence that it was happening. I am sure that the Minister is honest and candid, but I would hardly expect him to provide a list of matters on which there are significant weaknesses, on which appropriate action has not yet been taken, or on which there has been slippage. It is up to hon. Members and others to put pressure on the Government to ensure that things are delivered.</p>
	<p>I appreciate what the hon. Gentleman said about the risks of publishing or partially publishing the report, which might lead to scare stories or the distortion of available information. However, there is an equal risk that rumours will circulate, and that inaccurate reports will be published about the number of recommendations and what is planned on containment of people. Indeed, that is already happening, regardless of whether the report in its entirety, part of the report, or none of the report is published. For instance, there are reports about what would be required from the train operating companies and about the role that they would have to play in helping to move people out of London.</p>
	<p>I should like the Minister to consider whether there are circumstances in which the report can be made available, to ensure that Members have an opportunity to review progress regularly against the key action points. That would reassure Members that appropriate action is being taken.</p>
	<p>Will the Minister deal specifically with the vetting of security staff? That issue is associated with emergency planning and with what is happening at Heathrow today. I understand that that is not in the Minister's brief. He may need to refer to colleagues or perhaps respond in writing. However, he may be aware that in a debate on 23 October 2001, I raised with the Minister for Transport the question of staff who work airside in airports. They can work with a temporary pass before they receive appropriate security vetting, provided that they are supervised by a full passholder. It is unlikely that the full passholder will look over his shoulder every moment of the day. He will hardly be able to accompany the person to the toilet or watch them wherever they are. The full passholder would need eyes in the back of his head to do that.</p>
	<p>I raised that point during that debate, as did other hon. Members. My hon. Friend the Member for Bath (Mr. Foster) asked:</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;Is the Minister totally satisfied that existing arrangements for supervising those without full security passes are 100 per cent. adequate?&quot;&mdash;[<i>Official Report, Westminster Hall</i>, 23 October 2001; Vol. 373, c. 37WH.]</p>
	<p>The Minister, perhaps not surprisingly, could not give any such undertaking. However, he did say subsequently that the issues were important and he undertook to look at them. I contacted BAA yesterday to ask whether that particular loophole had been closed. I consider it to be a loophole, and the Minister of State accepted that that was something that must be looked at. BAA's response was that the loophole had not been closed, and that it was still possible for someone to work airside&mdash;in the secure part of the airport&mdash;without having had full security vetting.</p>
	<p>We are 18 months on from that debate and more than 18 months on from 11 September. It is extremely remiss that that loophole has not been closed. This may not be a subject with which the Minister is familiar, but I hope that he and his colleagues will investigate it. BAA assured me that it would be happy to close the loophole if asked, but the Government have not asked. BAA said that some transitional arrangements would be required. There must be a question mark over whether we have time for transitional arrangements, but BAA would like them in order to ensure that the loophole is not closed overnight. That matter must be looked at; it has not been dealt with in the past 18 months, and that is a major failure with which the Government must deal.</p>
	<p>With the heightened state of security that prevails in the UK, the Government must show that their commitment to protecting our citizens is flawless. They must show that there is no chink in our protective amour, and that there are no loopholes in our security apparatus. I regret that that is not the case, and our security is the weaker for it. Warm words of reassurance will not do; we need action from the Government.</p>

	<p>I am primarily concerned about the advice that has been given to schools and teachers in central London. I declare an interest: I have a daughter at a school in central London. Her mother constantly asks me what advice the school has been given and I must answer that I am not at all sure what advice has been given, or if it goes far enough.</p>
	<p>After the disastrous events of 11 September, my hon. Friend the Member for Altrincham and Sale, West (Mr. Brady) asked the Minister what plans there were to update civil defence guidance to parents of schoolchildren. The Minister replied with a holding answer on 15 October 2001 that his Department would shortly issue further guidance for local education authorities to disseminate to schools and others on a range of issues resulting from the terrorist attack in the USA and subsequent events.</p>
	<p>As we all know, and as the chairman of the parliamentary Labour party said today, London has never been in more danger, and I am not at all sure that schools have been given the advice that they should have had. Our problem is to reassure the public without heightening anxiety. In dealing with impressionable schoolchildren, we must be extremely careful that what we do and say does nothing to fuel well-grounded fears. There are long-term and short-term matters to consider. The hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington (Tom Brake) made some interesting points, and he referred to the American senator with whom he had spoken about one-way flow valves the water system. As well as the horrendous financial implications, that would take years, not months, to implement.</p>
	<p>We must do all we can to face what could be an immediate threat. It will not disappear if we go to war with Iraq; it will continue long afterwards. How can we judge? Even a successful war that topples the evil regime of Saddam Hussein may create many more international terrorists linked to al-Qaeda who wish to wreak revenge on this country. We cannot deal with this as a one-off event; we must deal with the long-term implications, some of which might require an alteration in how we live and go about our everyday business.</p>
	<p>The Minister is a man of great intelligence, but I note that he has not been taking many notes. I hope, however, that he will deal with the points of hon. Members on both sides rather than reading a prepared statement, as these are matters of public interest. I would be grateful if he would spend a little time reassuring me about the training and advice that schoolteachers in London have been given in how to evacuate schoolchildren and how to deal with them in schools.</p>
	<p>There was much debate earlier on the comparative preparedness of the United Kingdom and the United States of America to meet a terrorist attack. Members may have seen the report in <i>The Times </i>this morning on the &quot;All-American survival pack: What everyone needs&quot;. It gives the advice of the Federal Emergency Management Agency and goes into great detail on how to store water, how long food should be stored, and the contents of a first-aid kit&mdash;including moistened towelettes, whatever they are, and tongue blades, which are, perhaps, not an item usually found in hon. Members' wash bags. It lists the necessary tools and supplies, clothing and bedding for babies and adults, and important family documents. A guide entitled &quot;Are you Ready?&quot; from the &quot;Guide to Citizen Preparedness&quot; says:</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;You should have duct tape, plastic sheeting and scissors. Have an adult turn off air-conditioners, vents and fans . . . Find an interior room, hopefully a room that does not have windows. Seal around doors and windows with duct tape and plastic sheeting. Take your battery-powered radio with you, so you know when it's all clear.&quot;</p>
	<p>That sounds a terrifying note. Unlike the Liberal Democrats, I, as a member of Her Majesty's loyal Opposition, would not dream of asking the Minister to compromise our preparedness by saying what might be going on. Particularly, I would not ask him to go into detail on the 100 recommendations made by the London resilience team.</p>

	<p>I was just coming to that. If the hon. Gentleman will allow me, I shall continue. Although I would not ask for details of those recommendations, I would greatly reassured to know how many of them the Minister thought had been met and how many he would hope to meet in the next two or three months.</p>
	<p>We parliamentarians would be in a difficult position if there was a disaster and we were found not to have paid enough attention to help prevent it. I am convinced that the reactive services and emergency services are well prepared, are being trained and are properly funded to cope with the aftermath of an emergency. I am concentrating on our preparedness&mdash;the bit that comes before the disaster. If we spend the money now, we may avert a disaster on a much larger scale.</p>
	<p>I ask the Minister to answer my various questions in order to reassure those who have young children at school in central London, which, as we have heard, is high on the list of targets.</p>

	<p>I had not intended to speak in this debate, but I am interested in the subject and I am glad to be here. I was looking forward to hearing the hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington (Tom Brake) itemise some of the things that he believes the Government should be doing, but we did not get much substance. We heard that we need more information and that we need to do more, but he made no concrete suggestions about what the Government should be doing to deal with this serious situation.</p>
	<p>I would not like anyone to go away from this debate believing that we are unprepared. My local authority in St. Helens pools its resources with the other four Merseyside authorities in order to deal with the sort of circumstances that we have been discussing today. The police, the fire services and the other authorities plan for such occasions, should they be called on to take action. I have some chemical factories in my constituency; in order to deal with explosions there my local authority has had to put its plans into effect, and they turned out to be effective. I wish to place on the record the high regard that we all have for the emergency services and for local authority planning teams.</p>
	<p>Some of the things that I have heard said about America remind me very much of the debates that used to take place about the possibility of a nuclear attack&mdash;about, for instance, the advice that we should put sandbags behind the doors, stock up with tins of baked beans and ensure that we had enough bottled water. Frankly, that would not have been effective, and I was interested to discover whether the hon. Gentleman would make concrete proposals about what could help in such an emergency. I was disappointed.</p>
	<p>It is important that the Minister addresses the issues raised about what the Government are doing, but there are limits on what they can do for civil defence. Those limitations are fairly obvious. We would have great difficulty in defending ourselves against the sort of terrorism that we have seen recently. However, we have had plenty of experience over the past 25 years in dealing with IRA attacks, which puts us in a better position than many other countries.</p>
	<p>Finally, if some of the events occurred about which we have been speculating today, it seems that the Army would probably take control. Emergency powers would be introduced. The armed forces have regularly shown themselves to be equal to the most difficult tasks and able to deal with them in a most professional way. I have no doubt that they will continue to do so.</p>

	<p>I am aware that I did not respond to the hon. Gentleman's specific point about what public information should be available. The hon. Member for East Devon (Mr. Swire) referred to the situation in the United States. We need to move in that direction. The level of information released there is not necessarily right for us, but we need to provide something along those lines&mdash;for instance, to advise the public about what information might be given to them in the event of an incident.</p>

	<p>I do not disagree. However, I should have preferred it if the hon. Gentleman had spelled out what sort of information he was seeking. He looks to the Minister, but a lot of the information that could be put out has been put out. It is important that Members of Parliament do not scaremonger. There are already enough worried people in the community, and we should accept the fact that there are limits to what we can do. Nevertheless, there are procedures, both locally and nationally, to deal with civil emergencies.</p>

	<p>The hon. Member for St. Helens, North (Mr. Watts) put his finger on one or two weak spots in the argument of the hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington (Tom Brake). Nevertheless, I congratulate the latter on securing a debate that is so topical and so timely. He asked why more had not been done to educate the public at individual, community or family level with regard to the preparations that they might take in order to mitigate the effects of attack by terrorists using radiological, biological or chemical weapons, and hinted at the answer when he referred fleetingly to &quot;Protect and Survive&quot;. May I remind hon. Members what that involved?</p>
	<p>In 1980, the booklet &quot;Protect and Survive&quot; was finally published. It was the guidance that was meant to be issued to individual households in the run-up to an anticipated nuclear strike. The issuing of that guidance turned out to be a public relations and a political disaster. It led the essayist E. P. Thompson to produce a counterblast, a radical manifesto called &quot;Protest and Survive&quot;. The nub of the case made by Thompson, who later founded European Nuclear Disarmament, was that by suggesting that any effective measures could be taken to protect the community against the effects of a nuclear war, one was trying to anaesthetise the community, or to lull it into a false sense of security that a nuclear war would be survivable.</p>
	<p>I am sure that if we could look into the minutes that have been flying around various Government Departments about the advice that should be issued to households, families and communities, we would see repeated references to the disastrous decision to make public copies of &quot;Protect and Survive&quot; more than 20 years ago. However, the parallel does not really hold; a nuclear war launched by a nuclear superpower, or any major nuclear power, would have been likely to overwhelm the majority of civil defences, whereas we are considering attacks that, although they might use weapons supplied by a state producer, will involve small quantities of weapons &mdash;I shall say more about that later. Admittedly, weapons of mass destruction, even when applied in small quantities, can still have large and horrifying results. However, we are working in a strategic and military environment in which the possibility of palliative action is much greater than it was in 1980. Therefore, it would be a mistake to hold back from issuing such practical guidance as can be issued, to the public in good time, despite the sensitivities arising from the lesson of more than two decades ago.</p>
	<p>I was a little surprised by the naivety of the hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington when he said that we must ensure that there are no chinks in our armour against such attack. We can no more ensure that than we could ensure that there were no chinks in our armour against terrorist attacks by the IRA from 1969 onwards. The fact is that small numbers of people are all that are required to ensure that considerable numbers of people die or are seriously injured in such an attack.</p>
	<p>I am not in a position to know the answers to the questions that need to be asked about the preparations that the Government should be taking, but I know some of the questions that should be asked.</p>

	<p>Does the hon. Gentleman agree that little advice can be given to individuals about how to protect themselves? I am talking about what the institutions can do. If the hon. Gentleman does not agree with that premise, can he say what actions can be taken by individuals? When we had an emergency in my area, it was up to the authorities to inform residents about what was happening and arrange back-up support for the community. Individuals were not able to take any action; the organisations had to do so.</p>

	<p>The hon. Gentleman has made several contributions to the debate, but I do not agree with him about his latest one. After an attack, two courses of action can be taken. A radiological, chemical and biological weapons flying squad full of specialist techniques and equipment can descend rapidly on the area to help people. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman is approaching the problem with that attitude. I should be interested to hear from the Minister whether the Government are approaching the matter with the same attitude and if they are building a network of flying squads to help the afflicted parts of the community as soon as an attack is reported. Perhaps the main emphasis will have to be placed in that direction.</p>

	<p>However, thinking particularly about chemical and biological, not radiological, weapons, there are probably some emergency measures that individuals who suspect that they have been showered with potentially lethal material could take in the first few minutes to lesson significantly the likelihood of fatal effects. I have no scientific expertise in the matter, which I am sure is blindingly obvious to other hon. Members. However, given that the Royal Navy, which for years has had pre-wetting systems on its ships to douse the superstructures and slough off radiation, chemicals or other material that is deposited on them, I am sure that some fairly basic advice could be given to individuals for them to follow if they knew that they had been attacked.</p>
	<p>I admit&mdash;talking about biological weapons and germs&mdash;that people might not know that they had been attacked. Either my hon. Friend the Member for East Devon (Mr. Swire) or the hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington said that there might be a time lapse, but in the case of a chemical attack there is a reasonable chance that people might know whether they had been contaminated. I draw attention especially to a biological organism, such as anthrax, or persistent chemical weapons that contaminate and work over time. They could be reduced in their lethality by the taking of immediate steps to wash them off, change clothing or take other simple but practical measures.</p>

	<p>Does the hon. Gentleman agree that providing advice might be one way of preventing large numbers of people who suspect that they have been affected by a chemical attack from turning up at hospital? The advice might be that they need not refer themselves to a hospital.</p>

	<p>In those circumstances, I think that emergency broadcasts would be made continually to inform the community whether it had been subjected to an attack. However, I accept the hon. Gentleman's basic point that some practical advice should be issued from the bottom up, even if the main focus of the Government's approach is for specialist organisations&mdash;which I hope we shall hear they are putting together&mdash;to descend from the top down and rescue the people who have been attacked.</p>
	<p>I will not take up much more time, but I wish to make a couple of remarks on the history of some of these weapons to see whether we can learn any lessons from it.</p>
	<p>Mustard gas was used to great effect in world war one, but it was not used in world war two because the Churchill Government made it absolutely clear that if the Nazis used it we would retaliate and our retaliation would be effective because we had huge stocks of it. Churchill even made that promise on behalf of our Russian allies: they did not have retaliatory stocks and Churchill said that if the Russians were attacked we would use that gas on their behalf. In that instance, deterrence worked.</p>
	<p>At the end of the war, the allies occupying Germany were horrified to discover huge stocks of tabun&mdash;the first of the nerve gases&mdash;and small stocks of sarin and soman, which the Nazis were developing. They were also not used because of deterrence. Although the allies did not have those weapons and did not know that they could be made, the German leadership had been advised by its scientists that it was inconceivable that the allies would not have them too. Therefore, Hitler was deterred from using nerve gases by the mistaken belief that the allies had them.</p>
	<p>In our current situation, the trouble with that sort of approach is that one does not know whether anything would deter an organisation such as Bin Laden's because the people who would launch the attacks do not care whether they die&mdash;and even welcome the prospect of death. In that context, deterrence does not work as effectively as it used to, which means that there is the prospect that some such attacks will succeed. As that is the case, people should receive at least some practical advice about what they can do, even if the main help will have to come from the Government. That was the most important point made by the hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington.</p>
	<p>The best way to negate such attacks is to prevent them. To achieve that, Governments who are producing these weapons with the possible intention at some point in the future of putting them into the hands of the fanatics who will not hesitate to use them&mdash;such as the Iraqi Government&mdash;must be taken out of the equation.</p>

	<p>I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Carshalton and Wallington (Tom Brake) on securing the debate. He has taken a lot of interest in the issue, especially as he represents a London constituency. The current security threats tend to focus on the London area, so it is appropriate that hon. Members whose constituencies are in and around that city are so engaged in the debate.</p>
	<p>My hon. Friend was right to broaden the question of emergency planning by considering such situations as floods and fuel protests. There are other comparable situations, such as explosions in chemical plants, which have occurred, as people in Humberside know, although, fortunately, such an incident has not occurred recently.</p>
	<p>Emergency planning will be far more effective if it covers all such situations: it should not be confined to terrorist attacks. It is better that we think of all the situations as having to be dealt with in similar ways, not least because civil incidents occur fairly regularly. We can, in a sense, try out procedures that might be needed in a far more serious military situation when dealing with civil problems such as floods, which occur quite frequently.</p>
	<p>The hon. Member for East Devon (Mr. Swire) talked of young and impressionable schoolchildren being assailed or damaged by the atmosphere of fear. That does not apply only to young and impressionable schoolchildren; this slightly older person is absolutely petrified every morning as the news comes on. It takes me back to my childhood. I was 14 in 1980, when &quot;Protect and Survive&quot; was published. I remember it well. We had a slightly different version that gave all the instructions about getting under the table and putting the wet blanket on top, but ended with the injunction that we should put our heads between our legs and kiss our appendages goodbye. That version came out from some of the mickey-taking&mdash;<i>[Interruption.] </i>I am told that that must have been the Kama Sutra; perhaps it was a merger of the two.</p>
	<p>There is a serious point to be made, however. Psychological damage is caused by an overdose of fear, although I hesitate to say so. We should remember that in our civil defence planning. We do not want to cause unnecessary alarm. We want people to be properly prepared, and unnecessary alarm is damaging. My hon. Friend the Member for Carshalton and Wallington was right to talk about the human factors associated with civil defence planning. It is not just about getting inoculations to those who need them, but about dealing with issues such as crowd control, fear and panic, which can cause major problems.</p>
	<p>We need to be clear when issuing advice. My hon. Friend was suggesting that we tell people not only what they should be worried about, but what they should not. We need to tell people when things are okay. We have had experience of that with diseases such as meningitis. That disease is a killer and causes problems, but we have been careful to issue advice that tells parents not only when they should take their children to hospital, but when it would be unnecessary to do so. That kind of advice is important.</p>
	<p>Fear can itself cause damage. There was evidence of that in Sheffield a couple of years ago. An incredible rumour spread around the city that the IRA was planning to attack Meadowhall, our local shopping centre. Everyone in the city knew about it. The evidence cited was the fact that body bags were being taken to the shopping centre in preparation for when people were killed by the supposed IRA attack. The whole city believed the rumour, and people did not go to Meadowhall in case the IRA attack occurred. It turned out that what had been seen was Marks &amp; Spencer taking in a load of suit carriers; perhaps hon. Members know what they look like. The delivery had gone in through the back door, but because of the heightened state of awareness, that information had circulated around the city.</p>
	<p>There is a serious point to be made. It is important to get accurate information to people, so that we do not cause fear or, indeed, unnecessary economic damage, which is the other major factor that the Government are trying to balance. In the present circumstances, if, as the papers report, there is a threat to aviation, one of the options would be to close Heathrow. That would cause huge economic damage. We always need to balance the damage&mdash;generally economic&mdash;caused by closing facilities because of an acknowledged risk, and the risk of the attack materialising. Striking a balance is a tough challenge for anyone in a position of authority.</p>

	<p>Does my hon. Friend agree that we should not dwell too much on &quot;Protect and Survive&quot;, as I am sure the Minister will issue some guidance soon, but instead consider providing guidance on where people can get their information from?

	<p>My hon. Friend is entirely correct. We are talking about accurate information and where it can be obtained. I am about to make some concrete suggestions about our information technology infrastructure, which will not surprise the Minister, as that is my main area of interest. It is an increasingly important subject in the context of civil planning.</p>
	<p>My hon. Friend reminds me about the need to ensure that there is accurate information. One of the downsides of the great spread of the internet, for example, is that it is the perfect vehicle for circulating misinformation as well as good information. It would be helpful if people were told what kind of broadcasts they could expect and what channels they were on. They could take that information on board and&mdash;this could increase awareness&mdash;set it against some of the misinformation about increased suspicion that may circulate at times, either through word of mouth or through other less appropriate forms of the media, whether official or unofficial. Some of the more lurid stories that have been printed in the press have not helped people.</p>
	<p>I turn to the information technology infrastructure. Some important questions must be answered. Computer networks and telephone networks have increasingly merged, so that it is hard to say what is one and what is the other. After 11 September, we saw how essential communications networks were in responding to civil defence situations, and we became especially aware of the fact that communications networks can be vulnerable. Whether or not information networks are deliberately targeted, if they are taken out, their loss can cause major problems for those who are trying to deal with the aftermath of a disaster.</p>
	<p>At the time of the great millennium bug, the Government engaged in civil defence planning for the information infrastructure; I think that it was the last time that they seriously engaged in it. A good exercise was set up, in which the industry was brought together, Ministers took part, Government systems were rated for their vulnerability to the bug and all kinds of measures were put in place. That was an important exercise in the discipline of information assurance, which secures the quality and continuity of our information systems.</p>
	<p>The Government said at the time that they did not want all that work to be wasted. They said that, although the millennium bug did not bite us seriously in the end, they wanted to take forward the work that had already been done. Because they had got people together and thinking about the resilience of information systems, they wanted to ensure that that work was not stopped at the beginning of 2000. I hope that the Minister will tell us that there has been some continuity and that the people who came together for the millennium bug are considering the resilience of our information systems in the context of other potential threats.</p>
	<p>If any of our major infrastructure&mdash;one thinks, for example, of the banking system&mdash;went down and was unavailable for a time, the consequences in terms of potential civil chaos would be severe. We must think about what would happen if a major data centre were lost, whether through a deliberate terrorist incident or, referring back to my earlier comment on wider questions, through a major national disaster. The resilience of key infrastructure systems such as the banking system is essential. I hope that the Government will work with bodies such as the Information Assurance Advisory Council, which is a good industry body that is trying to deal with the issue, and with the major industry representatives to ensure that our infrastructure is as resilient as possible.</p>
	<p>The public agencies also need to look at their systems. My hon. Friend the Member for Carshalton and Wallington mentioned that the Benefits Agency may be important after some civil or other disaster. That agency is utterly dependent on its IT system. The question of whether that works will become critical at a time of potential civil disorder. Other systems are obviously important. For example, the air traffic control system will be essential to maintain transport. A direct or indirect attack on such a system due to some kind of chaos would be very serious.</p>
	<p>Information systems could be put in place to improve matters. We recently saw chaos on London Transport caused by snow&mdash;a major civil disaster from an inch of snow. However, that situation was made worse by the lack of available information. There was a domino effect. People turned up at one tube station, were told that it had closed and went to the next station, which had to be closed because of overcrowding. Everyone then moved to the next station and so on.</p>
	<p>If one is involved in such a situation, as I was a couple of weeks ago when I tried to use the transport system, the only means of information is apparently someone shouting up from the station and telling others whether platforms are overcrowded. If we are thinking about any major civil disorder or emergency, with millions of people in the centre of London trying to get out, we must have better information systems that tell people what they should do, whether they should stay put and what the best ways in and out of the city are. At the moment, the system seems to be far too dependent on turning up at places. By the time people have reached that place, they are already part of the problem, because they are adding to the crowd that one is trying to disperse.</p>
	<p>The other area that I think the Government should look at is the law relating to attacks on information infrastructure. The hon. Member for New Forest, East (Dr. Lewis) referred to the issue of prevention. We may have some difference of political view over the context in which he mentioned it, but prevention of attacks on computer systems is an area in which the Government could strengthen the law. The current law&mdash;the Computer Misuse Act 1990&mdash;is old and outdated, given the nature of some recent attacks, including distributed denial of service, a well-known phenomenon whereby people try to block access to websites. At a normal time, such a problem may be annoying, but at a time of civil disaster, the blocking of access to websites that the Government have created to inform citizens about what is going on becomes a much more serious issue. The law may be too weak to deal with that occurrence at present.</p>
	<p>The law could be strengthened to deal with attacks that are ancillary to the main function of the computer system, which try not to break the computer system but to cause mischief, and attacks that deliberately target computer systems. The smart terrorists of the future may carry out such attacks to cause disorder.</p>
	<p>It is important to ensure that the public have information about who is responsible for what&mdash;it has been referred to a few times already. One may have the local authority, the health care trust and the strategic health authority involved. In my area of south Yorkshire, residuary bodies are responsible for civil defence; we used to have a county council. All sorts of bodies are involved.</p>
	<p>We can have political debates at this level about whether we should have a homeland security tsar and about similar questions, but that does not matter to people on the ground. When something happens in their area, they need to know who to talk to&mdash;is it the chief executive of the local council or someone else? I hope that the Government can ensure that on the ground in local authority areas local contact points are clearly available to people. That would contribute to a sense of security.</p>

	<p>I congratulate the hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington (Tom Brake) on securing the debate and on his perception, given that it is now more timely than when he applied for it. I agreed with several of the points he made, especially about security airside. There have been too many scares, not only at Heathrow, but at most airports. As he rightly said, it is outrageous that Britain continues to run such a risk.</p>
	<p>My hon. Friend the Member for East Devon (Mr. Swire) referred to schools and to the fact that these issues need to be handled sensitively because of the risk of upsetting young children. I was a bit surprised to hear the hon. Member for Sheffield, Hallam (Mr. Allan) say that he woke up frightened every morning&mdash;even I thought that the Liberals were bigger men than that, but we live to be corrected.</p>
	<p>My hon. Friend the Member for New Forest, East (Dr. Lewis) spoke about deterrence. He is right to differentiate between the cold war scenario, when deterrence was a major factor, and the risks and threats we face today. The Civil Defence Act 1948&mdash;the original Act dealing with emergency powers&mdash;enshrined the words</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;attack by a foreign power&quot;,</p>
	<p>but, realistically, Britain is not under threat from a foreign power and, at least for the foreseeable future, it is unlikely to be. However, that does not mean that there is not a serious and significant threat.</p>
	<p>As other hon. Members have pointed out, that threat has been present since 11 September nearly 18 months ago. Not only that, but we are daily reminded of the threat by arrests of suspected terrorists, ricin discoveries, the Prime Minister telling the nation that an attack is imminent, and yesterday's deployment of troops at Heathrow. The closer we come to war with Iraq, the greater that threat must be.</p>
	<p>After 18 months and two Queen's Speeches, we still have not seen any Government legislation, or even a draft White Paper, on how we can better co-ordinate and prepare our emergency services and civilians for an attack. In the words of David Veness, the Assistant Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis responsible for anti-terrorism:</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;the United States has spent $500 billion on anti-terrorism measures. In Britain we have set up 73 committees.&quot;</p>
	<p>The Government have acknowledged, fairly, that existing legislative provisions for dealing with any type of threat to civil protection need updating. The Government have said that they are committed to introducing legislation to deal with such issues when parliamentary time allows&mdash;an age-old phrase. In the 18 months since the attack in New York, international terrorism has reared its ugly head in many other places in the world. Terrorism has shown its capabilities, yet the Government have found no time in the parliamentary agenda to introduce legislation to set up a more modern and sophisticated emergency planning system.</p>
	<p>The Bill team gave their proposals to the Government only in December 2002. I have the discussion paper for a Bill team meeting dated 5 December 2002. The document is produced by civil servants, not politicians. It clearly states:</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;Recent wide area emergencies have exposed weaknesses in UK resilience.&quot;</p>
	<p>The emergencies to which the document refers are flooding, foot and mouth and the fuel crisis&mdash;goodness knows what it would have said in the event of a chemical or biological attack. It continues:</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;The current framework is not working to a satisfactory standard for a number of reasons . . . There is also inconsistency in the basic approach to civil emergency planning which has never been properly defined and which needs to be broadened to develop a standard integrated and comprehensive framework of activities, from assessment to recovery, in accordance with the national goal of resilience.&quot;</p>
	<p>It is agreed that we face a huge challenge to reform our emergency planning procedures, yet the Government have done nothing to speed up that process of reform, and the Opposition have not been asked for their co-operation. Only this morning, the Minister without Portfolio described the emergency situation that we face. Frankly, the excuse of having to find parliamentary time is an insult. The importance of legislation to provide a co-ordinating mechanism cannot be stressed enough; neither can the need for a dedicated person to lead and co-ordinate Government efforts. Liberal Democrat Members seem to forget that this is their policy, but they dismiss our call&mdash;which I now repeat&mdash;for a Cabinet Minister to take responsibility for homeland security.</p>
	<p>That is still necessary. The Prime Minister and the Home Secretary clearly do not have time to give the matter the 100 per cent. devotion that it justly deserves. Having shifted responsibility for the subject from the Home Office to the Cabinet Office, it is odd that the Prime Minister appointed the Home Secretary as chairman of the co-ordinating committee. However, an individual Cabinet Minister needs to take overall responsibility. The National Audit Office has reported that one in four of our hospitals and one in three ambulance services</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;are not well prepared to deal with an attack involving chemical, biological, and radioactive weapons&quot;</p>
	<p>and that an incident involving 500 or more casualties would seriously challenge the national health service. What is being done to change that situation? Who is in charge of changing it? Should an unfortunate incident occur, would the Government be able to deal with the eventualities arising from it?</p>
	<p>Hon. Members have referred to the different tiers of local government. I remind the Minister that district councils currently receive no funding and have no statutory obligation in this respect, yet, as the hon. Member for St. Helens, North (Mr. Watts) said, they are in the front line of dealing locally with any situation that may arise.</p>
	<p>Other questions need to be asked. Have the Government made any provision to ensure that there are sufficient supplies of vaccines in the event of a smallpox attack on a large city? What measures have been taken regarding the issue of chemical and biological protection suits? Have any stockpiles of such suits been made and how would they be made available? Are there any measures to deal with mass radiation if we are hit by a dirty bomb of some sort?</p>
	<p>Hon. Members have referred to the &quot;Protect and Survive&quot; document. When I attended a course at the Civil Defence College in the early 80s, I learned the advice perceived to be the best at the time. The hon. Member for St. Helens, North has referred to this. In hindsight we can look back and say that it was stupid and pathetic: clearly, hiding under a kitchen table is not going to help. Nevertheless, making people aware that there were measures that they could take&mdash;measures that seemed sensible at that time&mdash;reassured them. There is something that individuals can do.</p>
	<p>Yesterday, America published advice to all its citizens on the self-protection measures they can take. When will the UK Government do likewise? I do not suggest that they should offer similar advice, because inevitably the advice for this country would have to be different, but they should offer advice on what individuals could do if certain events occurred. As hon. Members have said, the Government should also give advice on where people should look for information in the event that something happens.</p>
	<p>Given that there is a legion of new radio and television channels coming on air almost daily, people need guidance on what mechanism will be used to disperse information&mdash;whether the Government will always use BBC 1, for example. The time has come for the Government to stop sending out cryptic messages to the public warning them to be vigilant. Those warnings have been in tube trains and railway stations for years, reflecting different threats of the time. What exactly do the Government mean by &quot;being vigilant&quot;?</p>
	<p>It is too late to be accused of scaremongering: there is a scare. It is not right to argue that to take action would be to give in to terrorists. Why else do we have troops at Heathrow? The threat is already disrupting our lives and we have to face up to it. It is far better to take steps to ensure that the threat's long-term impact on our lives is minimised than to take short-term measures. The Government must admit to the people of Britain that there are huge threats facing the country, and they must assist the people to prepare themselves for an attack. That should be done in a calm and reassuring manner; but as with any threat, precautions must be taken. We should tell the people and trust the people.</p>
	<p>Only a few weeks ago protesters entered the Sizewell B power station&mdash;an event that the Government dismissed as being of no importance. I was chairman of the local authority at the time of the Sizewell B enquiry, and I challenged the experts on what would happen if an aircraft intentionally impacted on the power station. I was laughed out of court&mdash;but I was also told that they could not guarantee the integrity of the structure in that event. Now, 17 or 18 years later, none of us would dismiss the possibility or the likelihood of such a thing happening.</p>
	<p>The hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington referred to the London underground and the need to ensure that passengers understand what they should do in the event of an emergency. I would like to mention another matter, light-hearted but important none the less. Ten days ago, I was one of the many hundreds of people trapped on the M11 motorway. Some of my constituents spent 12, 14 or 16 hours trapped there. The emergency services did not co-ordinate to resolve the situation. Some will dismiss this as a trite and irrelevant observation, but countless people who were trapped in that traffic jam have since asked me, &quot;If that is what it was like with a couple of inches of snow, how on earth will we cope if there is a chemical, biological or radiological attack?&quot;</p>
	<p>That is an important lesson for us to learn. If neither local nor central Government could deal with a spell of bad weather that we knew was coming at least 48 hours before it arrived, how can we be reassured that the Government could deal with what I pray will never happen&mdash;a terrorist attack?</p>

	<p>I have listened to the debate with great interest and pay tribute to the hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington (Tom Brake) for securing time to debate these issues, which are significant for every resident of this country. I know from his discussions with my noble Friend Lord Macdonald of Tradeston how interested he is in these matters, as was evident from his remarks today. I also pay tribute to his colleague, the hon. Member for Sheffield, Hallam (Mr. Allan), for his measured questions.</p>
	<p>I shall endeavour to respond, in the time available, to the points that have been made, beginning with one or two of the questions asked by the hon. Member for East Devon (Mr. Swire). He upbraided me for not responding immediately to every point that was raised and for looking at the material that was passed to me. I make no apology for speaking on these issues with great deliberation, and choosing my words carefully. I hope that all hon. Members would do the same.</p>

	<p>If the Minister checks <i>Hansard</i> tomorrow, he will see that I did not in any way condemn him for not making notes. I just hoped that he would deal with my points, which he evidently is about to do.</p>

	<p>I am grateful for that clarification. With the hon. Gentleman's indulgence, I shall do exactly that.</p>
	<p>The hon. Gentleman asked for guidance on the important issue of schoolchildren in the Greater London area. All schools and local authorities in England have been made aware that they can obtain guidance on dealing with terrorism from the UK Resilience website. Many local authorities have also issued guidance to schools in their areas to assist with emergency planning.</p>
	<p>The Department for Education and Skills will again draw attention to the general guidance available in its routine mailing to local education authorities and to schools. However, in the event of a threat of an incident, the local police will of course work with schools to ensure that they are protected and will implement the relevant emergency plans. This is another clear instance of our responsibility to make people alert but, particularly when the constituency that we are dealing with is young children, not to cause unnecessary alarm.</p>
	<p>As to the key points made by the hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington, I hope that all hon. Members appreciate that the widespread circulation of a document such as the London resilience report could be prejudicial to security. I reiterate to hon. Members that the London resilience team provided him with detailed briefings on the contents of the report. Indeed, I can think of few circumstances in which a Minister's officials, the night before a debate in this Chamber, would willingly participate in briefing an Opposition Member on a matter of this kind. I am glad that in this instance they were forthcoming.</p>
	<p>I was particularly perplexed by the hon. Gentleman's line of questioning about the London resilience report, given that I am led to believe by my officials that my right hon. Friend the Minister for Local Government and the Regions, who is responsible for London resilience, has said that he is happy to discuss any specific concerns that the hon. Gentleman may have. I hope that he will consider that invitation.</p>

	<p>Does the Minister agree that detailed briefings on the report are not the same as having that report, which is a lengthy one, in one's hand and being able to identify which organisations are not making swift enough progress with their emergency planning? Opposition Members with that information could put pressure on those organisations.</p>
</speech>

	<p>Perhaps this is a matter on which there is a divide not only between the Government and the Opposition but between Opposition parties. It is perfectly appropriate for Ministers to remain accountable for actions for which they are responsible.</p>
	<p>The reasoned question from the hon. Member for New Forest, East (Dr. Lewis) was an update on the stage that we have reached in implementing the London resilience report. All the recommendations have been progressed, although circumstances have changed in some cases. None the less, many of the recommendations have been or are being implemented. Implementation is being monitored by the London resilience forum, which is chaired by my right hon. Friend the Minister for Local Government and the Regions. The Mayor of London, Ken Livingstone, acts as deputy. A detailed, one-year-on report to the London resilience Cabinet Committee and the Home Secretary will follow in due course.</p>
	<p>The hon. Gentleman was kind enough to acknowledge that the vetting of security staff lies outwith my direct responsibility, but I will ensure that his points are passed on and made clear to the Department for Transport.</p>
	<p>The hon. Gentleman asked about the Government's approach to warning and informing the public in the circumstances of a chemical, biological, radiological or nuclear attack. The response to a CBRN incident will vary according to several factors, including the strength, volume, nature and method of release of the contaminant. In some scenarios&mdash;this is an important point, given the concern expressed by hon. Members&mdash;people would be advised to evacuate; in others, they would be advised to stay put. Advice would therefore have to be carefully considered, given the possibility that it might turn out to be unhelpful. Of course, work continues on the matter, but it is already clear that the public should follow the instructions given to them by the emergency services.</p>
	<p>That leads directly to the hon. Gentleman's next point. He questioned the emergency services' capability effectively to direct people during an incident. However, the emergency services have vast experience of communicating with crowds following major incidents, using loudspeakers and a range of other methods. All the evidence shows that the public do indeed respond positively to instructions given by the emergency services following major incidents. Top-level strategic guidance will be given to all agencies, and protocols for handling crowds at CBRN incidents will flow from it. They will address the specific responses needed to deal with distressed people at major incidents, and I should make it clear that the emergency services are used to working closely together to handle such people. Regrettably, we can draw on experience when ensuring that preparations are in place.</p>

	<p>The Minister is right in what he says about communication and the emergency services. I do not want to be accused again of scaremongering, but does he not accept that we could be talking about a scenario that has never been seen before in this country? What he describes as major incidents&mdash;perhaps a train crash, involving a few hundred people&mdash;may be tragic, but they could be absolutely minuscule compared with the worst-case situation.</p>

	<p>I hope that all hon. Members will understand if I do not speculate about particular instances. However, I think that there will be agreement across the Chamber that we are not talking about a direct analogy to the situation in 1980, which was dealt with under the &quot;Protect and Survive&quot; approach. The nature of that threat was specific, and the responses could reflect that. Now, however, there is at least the possibility of a range of different methods being used to precipitate an incident. That is why a different approach must be adopted, and that is reflected in the work that the Government are undertaking.</p>

	<p>Will the Minister address the specific point? If the type of attack is to be more limited than the all-out attack envisaged in the early 1980s, will there be specialised teams that can quickly descend on affected areas to help people?</p>

	<p>The hon. Gentleman raises an important point, to which I was hoping to come. Local responders&mdash;this is an important caveat to what I am about to say&mdash;remain the building blocks of emergency response in the United Kingdom. However, specialist central support would be available to supplement those local responders, who will be on the front line in such incidents. In that sense, he is accurate in thinking that one must ensure that the emergency services in the location are supported by the appropriate skills and knowledge from the centre. That gives a sense of the work that the Government are undertaking on these matters.</p>

	<p>Although the Minister may be about to come on to these points, am I right in thinking that he would rely entirely on advice from the emergency services to be distributed to individuals in case of a CBRN incident, and that the Government have no intention of providing any information through either leaflets or contact points where people can get information about CBRN?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2003-02-12.303.5" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/693" speakername="Douglas Alexander" colnum="303"  time="15:15:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200203/cmhansrd/vo030212/halltext/30212h03.htm#30212h03_spnew31">
	<p>No. The UK Resilience website is available. I have some sympathy for some of the points that were made about the fact that one of our key challenges is to ensure that the appropriate level of information is shared with the appropriate organisations in advance. However, there is of course ongoing work in the Government to ensure that in a major incident there are means such as the media, for example, through which direct communication can be achieved beyond the operational control exercise on the ground by the emergency services.</p>
	<p>I am conscious of time and fear that I might not be able to cover all the points that hon. Members made. However, on the range of organisations that are being considered under the Civil Contingencies Bill, I shall endeavour to be specific. The Government have not yet reached a final conclusion on the list of organisations to be covered by the proposed statutory duties. However, we think it unlikely that the Bill will result in organisations doing less than they do now. Therefore I do not envisage the situation that it was suggested might arise in which a utility company would have a lesser responsibility than it has at present, whereby there is a range of regulatory and statutory duties to emergency plan.</p>
	<p>On the separate, but related issue of the role of central Government and agencies, the roles and responsibilities of Departments are clearly set out on the UK Resilience website, but we are currently finalising a set of auditable standards for contingency planning for Departments. That bears on the question of whether there should be a statutory duty imposed on particular Departments. Those auditable standards will set out the requirements in even greater detail than there has been in the past. We simply do not accept that there is a total lack of preparation on the part of the Benefits Agency, which is among the agencies currently considering such issues. The hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington raised those matters directly with my noble Friend Lord Macdonald, who undertook to respond.</p>
	<p>On the general point of the public information campaign, I merely reiterate the point that the hon. Member for New Forest, East made, that we must be considered and measured in the advice that we give, and ensure that we strike the right balance, keeping the public informed and not provoking an overreaction. To be alert but not alarmed is the right attitude for the Government to strike in an evolving situation that is under constant review. The right response to an emergency, in terms of communications and the operational response, will vary according to the exact nature of that emergency. We are therefore concentrating on being able to get the right information to members of the public who might be affected as quickly as possible in any particular emergency.</p>
	<p>As much as time allows, I shall address the points that the hon. Member for South-East Cambridgeshire (Mr. Paice) made about how the UK at national level is preparing to deal with emergencies and disruptive challenges, and shall demonstrate how matters are being organised. I hope that I can assure hon. Members that we are making reasonable efforts to ensure that we are sufficiently prepared to handle any of the variety of incidents that could affect the United Kingdom.</p>
	<p>The Home Secretary has overall responsibility for the safety and security of the citizens of the United Kingdom. He is in charge of security and also supervises all current counter-terrorist and resilience work by Departments, in his capacity as chairman of all the relevant Cabinet Committees. He is the person best placed to do his job, as he has direct responsibility for the main elements of the work to counter the current threat from terrorism: the intelligence work of the security service; counter-terrorist policy; and building resilience against the terrorist threat. He chairs the three Cabinet Sub-Committees, bringing together the work of the Departments. The first of those Committees oversees the work to strengthen the UK's defences against terrorism, which the hon. Member for South-East Cambridgeshire mentioned. The second works to build the UK's resilience and ability to manage the consequences of major emergencies. The third meets to oversee the lead Departments' management of major emergencies and manage their wider effects. That Committee, the Civil Contingencies Committee, is also attended by representatives of the relevant emergency services and other agencies.</p>
	<p>Supporting the Home Secretary in that work is Sir David Omand, who was appointed the Government's security and intelligence co-ordinator and permanent secretary to the Cabinet Office last summer. That new post was created to enhance the capacity at the centre of Government to co-ordinate security, intelligence and consequence management matters and to deal with risks and major emergencies, should they arise. Working in support of the Home Secretary and Sir David Omand is the civil contingencies secretariat in the Cabinet Office. It has the task of co-ordinating the UK's resilience to the threats and disruptive challenges that face us today. If&mdash;</p>

	<p>I should like to raise the issue of provision for people who leave custody and who have a history of drug problems. My raising it is prompted by the tragic case of a 20-year-old young man, Sean Wildman, who sadly and almost certainly unnecessarily died on the streets of Bristol shortly before Christmas 2002. It is worth putting my remarks into a national context because, although Sean's case is tragic, I do not believe that it is isolated, and there is clearly a national problem, that needs to be addressed. I was talking to a representative of the Prison Service in my area yesterday, who told me that more than four in five of the new inmates who entered Horfield prison in Bristol in December 2002 had some sort of drug addiction problem. There is clearly a widespread problem of people entering prisons, especially young offenders, with some drug problem.</p>
	<p>What happens in prisons can be very good, but what happens when people leave prison often lets them down. In last Sunday's edition of <i>The Observer</i>, an officer standing in the gym at Pentonville prison is quoted as saying:</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;These guys look pretty well, don't they? They come in here like skeletons&mdash;the crack diet, we call it. Here we give them exercise and decent food. It's like a health farm. The problem starts again at the prison gate. I hate to say it, but most of them will be back a few months later, looking like skeletons again.&quot;</p>
	<p>In other words, there is provision inside prisons. I shall come to Sean's case in a moment. What went badly wrong in his case seems to concern the link between what happened inside prison and what happened when he left. I do not doubt that there are often good intentions and that things are meant to work well. I have a board of visitors handbook in my hand, which says:</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;Preparation for release should begin in the early stages of any prison sentence.&quot;</p>
	<p>In other words, and especially in the case of someone who receives a short sentence, one needs to be thinking right at the beginning about what will happen when they are released. That is obviously good practice. I also have a document produced by the Prison Service called &quot;Male Prisoners and Young Offenders&quot; which says to a young offender:</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;Your personal officer (if you have one) will be able to help you to prepare for release through your sentence plan.&quot;</p>
	<p>So, the good intentions are clear, but the reality is often very different. To give one example, the chief inspector of prisons recently published a report on Ashfield young offenders institution in my constituency and, under the heading of reintegration planning, she said:</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;Re-integration planning was poor and there was little in place to prepare children and young people for release. Training plan conferences had become merely a form filling process.&quot;</p>
	<p>I am sure that the intentions are good. There is no desire to let people down, yet what happens when people are released often seems to do so.</p>
	<p>Earlier this week, the Home Office announced new initiatives that might begin to address some of the concerns that I am raising. I am grateful for the fact that the Minister took the time to brief me and other hon. Members about those welcome pilot schemes, which I wish well. My only observation is that they are pilots, due to start in 2004, and will be evaluated over a three-year period. Although I fully accept that a pilot must be properly evaluated, which cannot be done overnight, the process will not be concluded before 2007. Today, I want to ask not only what happened to Sean Wildman, and how we can avoid that happening again, but more generally how we can be sure before the pilots are evaluated that there will not be more cases such as his in the immediate future. It might be helpful if I tell Sean's story. I advised the Minister that I intended to do so.</p>
	<p>Sean's family home was in Charlfield, in my constituency, where his father, Peter, still lives&mdash;I spoke to him this morning. I have also met Sally, his mother, who now lives in Taunton, and have spoken to her about their son's death. Sean was 20 years old when he went into Exeter prison in September 2002 with a relatively short sentence, having been convicted on burglary and other charges. I am not convinced that the prison is being very forthcoming about what happened, as even family members have had problems in obtaining documents and finding out what happened to their son, but so far as can be told, he acknowledged his drug problem on entering the prison, and a programme of treatment was arranged. I see the Minister nodding to that.</p>
	<p>Sean's history of drug problems had put a great strain on his relationship with his parents at various times. He appears to have received help at Exeter prison from what is known as the CARAT&mdash;counselling, assessment, referral advice and through-care&mdash;team. I am told by my local drugs action team that, originally, funding for CARAT teams was made available with the intention of providing services for people not only while they were in prison, but for eight weeks after their release. Will the Minister clarify whether that was the original intention, whether it is still the intention and why that appears not to be happening?</p>
	<p>Sean left prison on 19 November and, tragically, by 4 December he was dead. He died homeless, on the streets of Bristol, of a heroin overdose. Almost double the lethal dose was in his body. The question that we should all ask ourselves is how that could happen. Many institutions and public authorities are involved. I should like to examine the role of each.</p>
	<p>My strong impression is that the authorities at Exeter prison failed effectively to liaise with the agencies that were to be responsible for taking on Sean's care after his release. First, they failed to put him in touch with the right bodies; they gave him details of a reintegration service&mdash;which is a good thing&mdash;but it was in Gloucestershire. Sean's family home is not in the county of Gloucestershire; it is in the South Gloucestershire unitary authority, which is nothing to do with Gloucestershire and has no contact with it. Apparently, he said that he would be living at an address in Bristol, so why did Exeter tell the Gloucestershire reintegration service about him? Even if it had been the right service, why was the fax sent only a few days before his release? Gloucestershire reintegration service, which I am sure provides a good service, prefers a month's notice so as to get to know the person in order to support him. Why was only a few days' notice given? Similarly, why did Exeter prison give Sean the details of a project called the Emmaeus project in Bristol, which is not even open yet? Why did the prison not know what was going on?</p>
	<p><i>The Big Issue South West</i>, which supported Sean by helping him to keep body and soul together after his release, has suggested that prisons such as Exeter might have online access to up-to-date information about which services are available for which client groups in which parts of the region. Although some information is available, the people in Exeter did not put Sean in touch with the right agencies.</p>
	<p>At one stage, Sean lived in Stoke Gifford in South Gloucestershire. The drugs action team for the area is based in Stoke Gifford and runs just the sorts of services that could have helped him, but it did not know that he existed. It found out about him only after his death. Why did Exeter prison not put him in touch with the right authorities instead of giving him duff information?</p>
	<p>When Sean was released on licence, why did the prison governor at Exeter not refer in the licence to the drug problems? The probation service has told me that it was not aware of Sean's drug problem&mdash;nor did it know about his homelessness until he turned up and said, &quot;I have nowhere to live.&quot; I understand that Sean did not want it to know about his drug problem. The question that I ask about the system, therefore, is why are people not told when inmates consent or volunteer to begin a drug-treatment process in prison? Why is it not a condition that support services will be notified post-release&mdash;in other words, that ex-prisoners will be required to consent to ongoing support after release? Had that happened, the probation service would have known that Sean had a drug problem. Someone in the South Gloucestershire drugs action team should have known. The probation service told me this morning that it did not know that he had a drug problem.</p>
	<p>I shall deal with the role of the probation service in a moment, but between his leaving prison and his death, Sean saw a probation officer three times in less than three weeks. It did not become apparent to the probation service until too late that he had a drug problem, but it could not do anything about it because nothing in the terms of his licence required him to have any drug treatment. I query why the prison sent Sean to the wrong places; I query why the licence did not refer to his drug problem; and I query how much care the prison showed him.</p>
	<p>I have with me a letter to Sean's mother from Devon prison partnership, dated 21 January 2003, which says:</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;In answer to your query, I can confirm your son was released . . . on 3rd December&quot;.</p>
	<p>Sean was released well over two weeks before that, so either Exeter prison had the wrong person or that was just another cock-up. I appreciate that prisons have to deal with huge numbers of young people and that there is a huge turnover&mdash;that is the subject of another debate&mdash;but it would help if the Minister would clarify whether the medical information that the prison gave to Mrs. Wildman was about Sean and not about someone else. The family deserve an apology for the fact that the prison could not get correct even basic information about Sean.</p>
	<p>The other thing that the prison failed to act on was the fact that Sean had been homeless before he went into prison. It appears to have done little to check his address. He gave an address in the middle of Bristol, but none of the family or anyone else seem to know where it was, and he seems not to have intended to live there. He had not lived there before, and he had a record of being homeless before going to prison. Nevertheless, with negligible support, Exeter prison pushed him out of the door&mdash;a crude way of putting it&mdash;to an address about which it knew nothing. Despite such a lack of evidence and his record of homelessness, the prison did not tell the probation service that homelessness might be a problem. I query the prison's role, and I hope that the Minister will ensure that it cannot wash its hands of Sean Wildman by saying that he was not the prison's problem. There should be a thorough investigation of what went wrong.</p>
	<p>The probation service saw Sean three times in three weeks. It did not know that he was homeless until he turned up and told them. It then referred him to Bristol council, but single, homeless, ex-offenders with drug records do not do very well in the housing stakes. The probation service tells me that it has a limited number of hostels, that&mdash;guess what&mdash;it needs to be told that someone is coming, and that no one told it about Sean. The probation service was not told about Sean's drug problem at his request, but I think that it should be a condition of entering the prison drug programme that offenders should consent to follow-up services after release.</p>
	<p>Sean turned to <i>The Big Issue South West</i>. I pay tribute to that organisation and those who work there for what they did to support Sean. He was determined to make a success of his life. A support worker said:</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;When Sean first came in he was really confident. He had lots of plans because he was going to have lots of money because he was not using. When I found out he had died I was really angry. It shouldn't have happened.&quot;</p>
	<p>With the best will in the world, it should not fall to charities to pick up such people. I stress that Sean wanted to stand on his own two feet. He was in a relatively good condition when he left the prison.</p>
	<p>After seeing Sean's body, his father said:</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;What really haunted me was when I saw his body lying there and thought: 'This is the Sean that I remember two or three years ago, not the Sean I'd seen ten months earlier . . . he looked something like his old self and why do you die when you are like that?'&quot;</p>
	<p>Sean did not want access to drug support services; perhaps he wanted to stand on his own two feet, but tragically he could not. My question is whether the authorities did enough to make sure that someone who may not have wanted to co-operate fully with official programmes none the less received the support that he needed.</p>
	<p>Is Exeter prison looking into what happened to Sean Wildman, and learning from it? Is the probation service looking into what happened, and learning from it? Can we ensure that there is more of a follow-through when people come out of prison and enter a community? Can we ensure that the public authorities involved&mdash;the prisons, the police, the probation service, the health and local authorities, and the support services are talking to one another and taking responsibility? Despite all the good people working in those agencies, I have been unable to find anybody who will take responsibility. I hope that the Minister will assure me that steps are being taken to learn the lessons of Sean Wildman's death, and that notwithstanding the very good pilot schemes, which I fully support, steps will be taken immediately to ensure that fewer people meet Sean Wildman's tragic fate.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2003-02-12.310.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/727" speakername="Hilary Benn" speakeroffice="The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department"  colnum="310"  time="15:45:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200203/cmhansrd/vo030212/halltext/30212h04.htm#30212h04_spmin0">
	<p>I am genuinely grateful to the hon. Member for Northavon (Mr. Webb) for raising the issue and I wish to respond to some of the points that he raised. First, I wish to express my sorrow to Mr. and Mrs. Wildman on the loss of their son; it must be extremely difficult for them. Those of us who have not been through that experience find it almost impossible to imagine what it must be like. I know that the family will be particularly anxious to find out exactly what happened to Sean and the lessons that we can all learn from what happened.</p>
	<p>If the hon. Gentleman feels that it may be helpful, I offer to meet him and Mr. and Mrs. Wildman. The most useful thing that we could do to get answers to some of his questions would be to speak to those who were responsible for the care of Sean and who tried to assist him. That would be the most effective way of dealing with the points that were raised.</p>
	<p>As the hon. Gentleman acknowledged, the probation service did not have information about Sean's drug problem because Sean himself did not want it passed on, and that is very important. The hon. Gentleman raised the matter of whether we should change the system; that perhaps such considerations should not apply and that when someone goes to prison, information on the treatment and support that they receive should be passed on automatically. I realise that that poses difficult questions about confidentiality, and I see my hon. Friend the Member for Bassetlaw (John Mann) shaking his head. We are where we are because we respect people's right to decide what information about them, their circumstances, and their treatment should be passed on and to whom. However, I recognise that one could take a different approach.</p>
	<p>Sean was given a short sentence, so he would normally have received no supervision from the probation service. However, because of his age he was subject to a section 65 supervision notice, as a result of which he saw a probation officer three times. In such difficult situations, the individual, the family, society, the prison and outside services are responsible for providing support. It is a uniquely challenging task because of the life led by some of those who find themselves in the grip of drug addiction. They are not always amenable to doing what is suggested to them; they do not, for example, always keep appointments. That is a difficult process. I say that, by way of preface, to acknowledge the scale of the challenge. It is not as simple as saying, &quot;If only all of those bits had been in place, the outcome may have been very different.&quot;</p>
	<p>I am anxious, as is the hon. Gentleman, to learn lessons from all individual cases so that we can do better in future. I acknowledge completely that we, as a society, must do better. The case of Sean Wildman raises a big issue for society, because now we know much more than we used to about the extent of drug addiction and drug-related offending. However, as I said a moment ago, it is hard for us to understand fully the effect that addiction has on individuals. Individuals are imprisoned&mdash;literally&mdash;by their drug habit. It impacts on their lives and those of their families, yet we see more clearly the impact that addiction has on society because of the effect of drug-related offending.</p>
	<p>Therefore it is important for us to put time, effort, resources, understanding and learning into trying to tackle the problem. The Government recognise that more must be done, especially to provide post-release support for ex-offenders with drug problems. I learned that early on in my ministerial post when I visited Leeds prison and was told how one day there was a knock on the prison gate, and when it was opened the man standing there said, &quot;Can I come back in?&quot; When he was asked why, the man replied, &quot;I need help, and I know that I can get help quickly in prison. I have been told that I would have to wait for some time on the outside.&quot; That is not the usual conversation that one would expect to have at a prison gate.</p>
	<p>That story highlights the nature of the challenge that we face. I hope that in the meeting that I have granted the hon. Gentleman, he will come to understand the work that Exeter prison did with Sean Wildman, because, if I may say so, some of the hon. Gentleman's criticisms were unfair, and such a meeting would be a more appropriate way to get to the bottom of the matter than the forum of this debate.</p>
	<p>I say that because there has been a transformation in the work that prisons do with offenders with a drug problem. &quot;Transformation&quot; is not a word that I use casually, but if one takes a historical view and goes back 20 years, there has been a transformation. Twenty years ago nothing was done, so it is important that we acknowledge the work that is done today. We are all anxious to make further progress, but at the same time, we must recognise the progress that has been made.</p>
	<p>Real progress has been made in prisons, simply because prison officers were the first people to recognise that there was a problem that needed to be dealt with. We do not often pay enough tribute to what I describe as the pioneers within the Prison Service. They saw the problem that confronted them. They saw offenders with drug problems arrive in prison at a time when very little or no support was available. The pioneer programmes developed from there, and, together with Government funding, much better services and support are now available in prisons, including detoxification. From memory, around 32,000 or 33,000 prisoners went through that in the most recent year for which statistics are available&mdash;I do not recall whether that was 2002 or 2001. That is a very large figure.</p>
	<p>The CARAT system, which did not exist 20 years ago, is now available in all prisons. It is intended to meet the non-clinical needs of the great majority of prisoners and forms the foundation of the prison drug treatment framework. As the hon. Gentleman has told us, Sean received support from the CARAT team at Exeter prison. There are 60 rehabilitation treatment programmes available in the Prison Service, yet because of their duration they are available only to prisoners who are serving longer sentences. The quality of those treatment programmes is at least equal to anything that is provided in the community.</p>

	<p>The Minister touches on a point that Mrs. Wildman raised with me. She said that people who receive long sentences because they have done something seriously wrong can get treatment whereas people such as Sean who have done something fairly minor often cannot. Does the Minister think that that is fair? Can anything be done about it?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2003-02-12.312.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/727" speakername="Hilary Benn" colnum="312"  time="15:45:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200203/cmhansrd/vo030212/halltext/30212h04.htm#30212h04_spnew2">
	<p>That is a fair question to ask. That is the case because such prison programmes need to run for a certain length of time. With regard to short-sentence prisoners who stay for a very brief period, it is difficult to start something that they might not finish. However, that makes the need for more effective through-care all the greater: I accept that argument without question.</p>
	<p>One aspect of CARAT's work is to help to prepare offenders for when they leave prison. An important part of that is to prevent death by overdose. The Prison Service is acutely aware of the risk of such deaths for those who have been off drugs for a long time.</p>

	<p>Will the Minister look at detoxification, and especially at the medical evidence that certain forms of detoxification have a higher propensity than others to lead to death by overdose after they have been undertaken? Will he also examine whether the Prison Service is aware&mdash;nationally and in Exeter&mdash;of the various research evidence on different forms of detoxification?</p>

	<p>I will be happy to look into that, and to reply to my hon. Friend and the hon. Member for Northavon, if that would be helpful. The support that is currently available includes one-to-one counselling on the dangers, a video that highlights the risks, and guidance material. That is made available before release because the Prison Service is very conscious of that risk, but we recognise that improvements must be made in linking ex-offenders with community providers.</p>
	<p>The CARAT service is able to provide long-stop support for those who have left prison, but it would be the first to acknowledge that it cannot provide the form of through-care that others must pick up, although CARAT will do its best in the circumstances&mdash;for example, by making appointments. The Prison Service is conscious of the need to continue to improve communications with external agencies so that information is passed on more effectively.</p>
	<p>The hon. Gentleman referred to the Prospects programme, and Bristol is one of the areas where it will be piloted. A number of schemes are already in existence across the country: voluntary organisations have been heavily involved in that work, and there is an issue for local authorities as housing providers.</p>
	<p>As the hon. Gentleman knows because he attended my briefing earlier this week, the prospects scheme is specifically aimed at those who have come off drugs in prison. As a result of the mandatory drug testing system that now operates in prisons, the percentage of positive drug tests has halved in the past five or six years. When somebody who has come off drugs in prison&mdash;prison having given them the space, opportunity and support to enable that to happen&mdash;the prospects programme directly addresses the issue that has been raised in general by this case, which is the need to provide continuity of support and accommodation.</p>
	<p>The prospects project will be based in a number of hostels that we will seek to establish in the pilot areas. We aim to have two hostels in Bristol&mdash;one for men and the other for women. A crucial factor in determining whether the programme succeeds will be the support of communities because, to be frank, one of the key issues will be obtaining planning permission and community consent for the establishment of hostels.</p>
	<p>Another reason why the debate is so important is because it helps to raise awareness of the importance of this issue. Ultimately, the problem comes from society. We pass it on to the Prison Service, the courts, the probation service and the health service to sort it out for us, but we have a role to play too. We all have to take responsibility for being part of the solution to help those who want to change and live their lives differently in the future. The prospects model is genuinely interesting and exciting because, by providing that support and continuity of drug testing to make sure that people continue to keep away from drugs, it will help us to know what will work successfully in providing support to individuals.</p>
	<p>I shall finish where I began. We are anxious to learn from experience, especially from such a tragic case. We have made much progress, but we need to do more in the future.</p>

	<p>I shall condense my speech as best I can. I hope that there is not another Division, because it may scupper the proceedings.</p>
	<p>I am delighted to have secured the debate. My early-day motion 115 on the subject has attracted 100 names. I have also asked questions about it at Prime Minister's questions, business questions and to the Deputy Prime Minister. I have been trying for some time to debate hoax calls. My wife was a manager at a 999 centre, so I have some knowledge of the subject and various pieces of information have been fed to me about it.</p>
	<p>Hoax calls can be the result of young children playing with the telephone who hit 999 by mistake, or genuine calls that have been made in error. Someone may have a mobile telephone in his pocket and the number nine button may have been pressed accidentally. That is common. Silent calls are also attributed to mobiles when the buttons are pressed accidentally. Accidental calls account for 20 per cent. of 999 calls.</p>
	<p>I turn now to inappropriate calls. They can be described as calls made to the emergency services that are made with unreasonable, although not malicious, intentions. For example, people have asked to top up their mobile phone, to have their freezer fixed or for the football results. A man phoned up to report a fight between two squirrels in his garden. He was obviously nuts. A couple rang up to settle a custody dispute over a pet hamster. A drunken man asked the police for a lift home as he had spent all his money in the pub.</p>
	<p>Although such calls concern me and are important and numerous, they are not the kind that I wish to address. I want to talk about malicious hoax calls to the emergency services with totally fabricated stories. In the first six hours of the first firefighters' strike in November, 55 people in London dialled 999 to report non-existent fires. In the first 12 hours of the strike in Northern Ireland there were 319 calls to the fire brigade, 43 per cent of which were hoaxes. In the first two hours of the dispute in my area of Strathclyde the police received 259 calls reporting fires, and a mere 20&mdash;less than 8 per cent.&mdash;were found to be genuine.</p>
	<p>There is no doubt that certain events, such as the firefighters' dispute, drew attention to people who either wanted to score some kind of political point or who used it as an excuse to make malicious calls, but the truth is far from the impression given by the media that this is something that cropped up due to the firefighters' strike: it has been going on for years. Figures confirm the ongoing problem of hoax calls: hoax calls or false alarms are estimated to comprise between one third and a half of the 22 million emergency calls made every year.</p>
	<p>Most shocking to me are the figures published by Strathclyde emergency services in May, which showed that between April 2001 and March 2002 a third of 398,000 calls received were silent. Another third were non-emergency calls; a fifth were timewasters; and nearly 4 per cent. were abusive. Overall, only 11.5 per cent. of the calls were considered to be appropriate. In 2001, more than 31 million calls were made to 999 throughout the UK, of which 40 per cent. were found to be false. Most hoax calls attempted to report non-existent fires and asked to be put through to the fire brigade. Such callers are statistically more likely to be intercepted by the operator and not put through, according to British Telecom. It says that of the malicious calls that do get through, 60 per cent. are to the police and 33 per cent. to the ambulance service. Only 7 per cent get through to the fire brigade, although such calls form the majority of hoax calls made overall.</p>
	<p>British Telecom estimates that &pound;32 million of taxpayers' money is spent on these hoax calls.</p>

	<p>Thank you, Mr. O'Brien. I shall slow down somewhat, although it will probably please everyone that I still have plenty to say. The human cost of hoax calls is most worrying. Diverting resources poses a clear risk to others in genuine need.

	<p>A hoax call diverts resources away from those in genuine need and from situations where there may be loss of life. Crews responding to hoax calls are unavailable to answer genuine ones. Any delay in attending an emergency incident could simply mean the difference between life and death. Furthermore, the lives of those who are called out to deal with hoax calls are also threatened. I invite hon. Members to imagine a hoax call being made to the coastguard and a lifeboat being sent out. The lives of every crewman are in peril, as they always are when lifeboats are called out. If the call is a hoax, their lives are put in danger simply for someone's amusement.</p>
	<p>Who on earth would make a hoax call? The perpetrators may be children who are still too naive to know the full potential consequences of their actions, but who still know the difference between right and wrong. It could be an adolescent who uses the call to impress his or her friends or to alleviate boredom, or an adult who is fully aware of what they are doing, but who makes the call with the intention of causing confusion, disorder or chaos.</p>
	<p>I outlined the groups most likely to make hoax calls, but the main problem is that there is not just one type of person who makes them. The reasons for making hoax calls vary from the mundane to the downright evil. The most likely perpetrators are a group of youths who hang around phone boxes trying to impress their friends and who, more worryingly, often show an early fascination with fire that often leads to arson. The operator centres that field 999 calls to the emergency services now hire extra staff during the school holidays as a matter of course. Next week during recess, when the schools are on holiday, more people than usual will be working in the centres fielding 999 calls.</p>
	<p>Greater Manchester police have shown initiative. They have a schools liaison programme that explains what pupils should do in an emergency and that discourages them from misusing the emergency service by emphasising the danger of making hoax calls. It is important that children are not deterred from making emergency calls should there be a good reason for them to do so. However, they need to be aware that making a hoax call can and will get them into a lot of trouble. Education programmes make the young think about their actions. Most hoax calls are made by 10 and 11-year-olds. By that age, a pattern of offending may already have begun to develop, so we need to consider more ways of working with children of primary school age to deter them from making their first hoax call. I advocate slightly tougher action for teenagers who have developed a tendency to make hoax calls. In some community-based projects in inner-city areas, young arsonists have been taken to burns units in local hospitals to see the results of a fire.</p>
	<p>I shall deal in more detail with adult offenders. Hoax calls can be made in three different ways: from a public phone box, as I described earlier; from a mobile phone; or by using a registered land line. Even if the caller attempts to withhold their number by dialling 141, it is easy for the number and location of the caller to be traced. The technology is in place virtually to eliminate hoax calls from mobile phones. A false 999 call can result in a text message that warns the caller that the false call has been traced from their phone. That is usually enough to scare off most hoax callers; some 90 per cent. do not call again.</p>
	<p>Disconnection is used as the next step for those who continue to offend. As part of a local initiative in South Yorkshire, the fire and rescue service has teamed up with local police, the ambulance service and mobile phone service providers to cut off hoaxers at source. Ultimately, making a hoax call to the emergency services is improper use of a public telecommunications system and an offence under section 43 of the Telecommunications Act 1984. The penalty for hoax call offences is up to six months in prison or a fine of up to &pound;5,000. However, although the Act was introduced nearly 20 years ago, it is only recently that anyone has been prosecuted under its provisions. Under the 1984 Act, if an individual is identified as a persistent 999 hoax caller, the usual practice is for the police to pass the details of the calls to the service providers, who then deal with the case individually.</p>
	<p>The fact that the 1984 Act is not being used more extensively gives me cause for concern. I will give an example of the discrepancies in punishment given to hoax callers. In one case, an 18-year-old who was arrested for sending more than 2,000 hoax 999 calls in 26 hours using a radio handset that he had stolen from an ambulance service was sentenced to 240 hours community service. In another case, a 17-year-old was given a custodial sentence of one year after making a hoax bomb threat. The 17-year-old was prosecuted under the anti-terrorism legislation because of the category of his offence, whereas the 18-year-old, who I would suggest had committed the greater misdeed, was prosecuted under the telecommunications legislation, which tends towards more lenient sentences.</p>
	<p>I welcome the pilot scheme adopted by four police forces in August, which gave powers to issue spot fines of &pound;40 to &pound;80 for those found hoax-calling. I hope that that will shock offenders into ceasing to make further hoax calls, but I am not sure that those powers go far enough.</p>
	<p>There are several areas that I would like the Government to address as immediate priorities. A more holistic approach is needed to discourage people from making hoax calls. Will the Minister tell me whether any initiatives are planned to collate and share examples of best practice, as happens in other areas of Government? Ambulance and fire services and police authorities around the UK could be invited to submit evidence to show the progress and effectiveness of particular education liaison programmes. If there are no plans for such an initiative, perhaps that could be considered.</p>
	<p>We need a nationally co-ordinated education programme aimed at young children, based on examples of good practice from around the country. I would also like to see a tougher approach taken towards adolescents, whose first hoax call may be the start of the slippery slope into the world of progressively more dangerous crime. We could even consider the imposition of on-the-spot fines for parents in such cases.</p>
	<p>There should be greater use of the existing legislation that was designed to combat hoax calls. Could the Minister explain why the 1984 Act is not being applied in more cases of hoax calls to the emergency services?</p>
	<p>We need a tougher approach to repeat adult offenders. Prompt disconnection should occur when the call is made from their own telephone line or mobile phone, and custodial sentences and hefty fines should be imposed if hoaxing is repeated. Perhaps we need a specific charge or crime of committing a hoax call, with tougher sentencing attached than under the 1984 Act.</p>
	<p>At present, making a hoax call to the fire brigade is a criminal offence, whereas making such a call to the ambulance service, the police or the coastguard is not. Surely a hoax call to the ambulance service is most likely to result in loss of life, because time is of the essence to reach someone in need. We need a new criminal offence of making hoax calls to any of the emergency services. We need to communicate much more successfully the message that hoax calls cost lives, and that those who show such a wanton disregard for life will be much more severely punished. I welcome some of the new initiatives that the Government have pioneered, but I believe that we have a long way to go before we see the necessary reduction in hoax calls. I look forward to the Minister's reply.</p>

	<p>I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Anniesland (John Robertson) on securing this debate after trying for some time, and on the way in which he presented the case. In particular, the information from his own sources brought to life the nature of the problem about which he is concerned. His speech was informative and measured.</p>
	<p>The debate today is timely. The heightened terrorist threat means that all of us are anxious to ensure that the emergency services can devote their time and energy to dealing with real emergencies without being hindered by malicious or other hoax calls. I agree completely with the central thrust of my hon. Friend's argument, which is that the hoax calls can be very dangerous, because whenever a fire engine or ambulance is taking the time to answer a call that is not genuine, it is not able to respond to a genuine call. In other words, a hoax call is not a harmless joke: it threatens public safety and distracts the 999 call handlers from their work.</p>
	<p>My hon. Friend talked about the need to take tougher action against hoax callers, and I understand his concerns. The Government's view is clear: when someone is proven to have made a hoax call, they should be prosecuted. On the penalties, the Telecommunications Act 1984, to which my hon. Friend referred, provides for criminal sanctions. It states that a person who uses the public telephone system to cause annoyance or needless anxiety to another, or who passes on a message that they know to be false, can, on conviction, face a fine of up to &pound;5,000 or up to six months' imprisonment. I am aware of at least one case in which someone was prosecuted under the 1984 Act and received a custodial sentence.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2003-02-12.318.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1191" speakername="John Robertson" colnum="318"  time="16:33:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200203/cmhansrd/vo030212/halltext/30212h05.htm#30212h05_spnew4">
	<p>But does my hon. Friend accept that that was due to the increased publicity provided by the media? The case that he is talking about involved malicious calls, which, believe it or not, are different from hoax calls. A malicious call is when someone telephones a person and harasses them. That, primarily, is what malicious calls are about.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2003-02-12.318.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/727" speakername="Hilary Benn" colnum="318"  time="16:33:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200203/cmhansrd/vo030212/halltext/30212h05.htm#30212h05_spnew5">
	<p>I appreciate the point that my hon. Friend makes. I was simply trying to make it clear that the necessary criminal sanctions for dealing with hoax calls are in place under the 1984 Act and&mdash;for reasons of history that I think he would accept&mdash;the Fire Services Act 1947. As he will be aware, the 1947 Act provides the lesser penalties of up to a fine of &pound;1,000 or three months' imprisonment. The Telecommunications Act 1984 has a wider range of penalties, which are not insignificant, and are available for use.</p>
	<p>As my hon. Friend recognised, punishment under criminal law is not the only measure that we should take to reduce the dangerous menace of hoax calls. Public education is vital. I was interested in the point that he made about pooling examples of good practice, and I undertake to think about it and discuss it with officials. I shall give an example from personal experience. A few months ago, I visited a youth offending team in north Westminster. One of the approaches that it took with young people who had been making such calls was to get them to visit the fire brigade, and perhaps the ambulance service, too. That is similar to the example that my hon. Friend gave of the visit to the burns unit.</p>
	<p>The visits allowed those who engaged in the activity, and particularly those in the younger age groups, to understand the impact of such calls, how they affect those trying to do a professional and extremely important job, and how those calls get in the way of those very important public servants coming to our aid when we need them most.</p>
	<p>Clearly, the issue has achieved greater public attention and salience in recent times because of the fire service dispute. Normally, the percentage of hoax calls across the emergency services runs between 5 and 8 per cent.&mdash;a high figure. The percentage of hoax calls during the recent fire service dispute makes interesting reading. I know that hoax calls during a fire dispute are particularly malicious, because the level of fire cover may not be as high as it is normally, but during the eight-day strike from 22 to 28 November 2002, the percentage of hoax calls was about 7 per cent. During the 24-hour strike from 21 to 22 January, the figure was 5.8 per cent., and during the 48-hour strike from 28 to 30 January, it was 3.6 per cent. The rate was decreasing, but during the latest strike from 1 to 3 February, the figure went up marginally to 4.2 per cent.</p>
	<p>Clearly, there were regional variations within the overall figures, but they show a gradual and welcome decline from the 7 per cent. figure recorded in the first dispute. That did not happen by accident.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2003-02-12.319.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1191" speakername="John Robertson" colnum="319"  time="16:33:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200203/cmhansrd/vo030212/halltext/30212h05.htm#30212h05_spnew6">
	<p>I have heard those figures before. How many calls were filtered out before they got through? Traditionally, calls to fire services are filtered out by operator services. If he remembers, I said that only 7 per cent. of hoax calls get through to the fire services, whereas 60 per cent. get through to the police and 33 per cent. get through to the ambulance services. The publicity about the problem was amazing.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2003-02-12.319.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/727" speakername="Hilary Benn" colnum="319"  time="16:33:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200203/cmhansrd/vo030212/halltext/30212h05.htm#30212h05_spnew7">
	<p>I do not know whether that information is available, but if it is I shall write to my hon. Friend. The point that he made at the end of his intervention is right: the fire service dispute raised awareness of the problem. It has been of particular concern to Ministers, which is why my fellow Under-Secretary of State, my hon. Friend the Member for Coventry, North-East (Mr. Ainsworth), issued a press release at the time of the first dispute making clear the risks of being brought to account for making a hoax call, such as being disconnected. That important sanction was referred to by my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Anniesland and backed by the Association of Chief Police Officers, the Ambulance Service Association and the Chief and Assistant Chief Fire Officers Association.</p>
	<p>At the time, Ministers also asked the police and the Crown Prosecution Service to disseminate to their colleagues the importance of identifying quickly and prosecuting those who make malicious calls. As a result, many hoax callers have been caught, and as we have seen, many have been processed through the court system. We have also worked with the telecommunications companies through the 999 liaison committee which brings together all interested parties to devise a code of practice to ensure that people who use their mobile phones to make hoax calls will be cut off. With the increased reliance of many of us on mobile phones, that can be quite a sanction, especially for young people, whose mobile phones may be an important part of their life.</p>
	<p>Although in Scotland the issue is the responsibility of the Scottish Executive, I know that my colleagues in the Executive thought that, in general, the public responded well, which resulted in a reduced number of 999 fire-related calls during the industrial action. During the first of the eight-day strikes, steps were taken to try to minimise the number of hoax calls through an information campaign. The raised awareness of the damage and danger caused by hoax calls has been a positive consequence of the fire service dispute. Hoax calls have declined, although I understand the point that my hon. Friend makes about the context within which the figures were compiled.</p>
	<p>I pay tribute to my hon. Friend's persistence in drawing this important problem to the public's attention and having secured today's debate so that it can be highlighted again. We must now ensure that we continue to drive the message home using machinery such as our links with the telecommunications industry in the 999 liaison committee. In the end, the issue is one of public safety and enabling the emergency services to do the job that they are employed to do on our behalf. Those who seek to divert them from that activity by making such calls bear a heavy responsibility. As a society, we must make clear the danger of hoax calls: they prevent the emergency services from doing the job for which we need them.</p>
