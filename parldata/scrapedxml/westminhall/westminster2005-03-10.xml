	<p pid=".520.1/1">My hon. Friend makes an important point. As we develop new provisions, we need to&mdash;as we did with the flexible working provisions&mdash;work alongside employers to make sure that, while we make change, we do so in a way in that respects the burdens that may be placed on them.</p>
	<p pid=".520.1/2">My hon. Friend referred to the EOC's inquiry into pregnancy discrimination. However, we can do more to make sure not only that mothers understand their rights during pregnancy, but that employers understand their responsibilities. As we suggested in the working families consultation document to which I shall refer later, we could open up better routes for employers to communicate with mothers even during their maternity leave and perhaps gain more certainty about when people will return from maternity leave. That would be an important way in which to help employers to cope with what undoubtedly will be some disruption in their businesses. Employees must clearly understand, too, that, unless we can maintain decent working conditions and give women the opportunity to return to work after having children, that will disbenefit both mothers and businesses. There is a variety of ways in which we can make sure that the worries rightly raised by my hon. Friend are dealt with.</p>
	<p pid=".520.1/3">I have emphasised that the way in which we have introduced flexible working legislation is not only about helping families to find solutions that fit their individual needs, but giving parents and employers the tools with which to work together to find solutions that will benefit all concerned. By all accounts, such a development was long overdue. In the first year of the legislation, nearly 1 million parents have changed their working hours in agreement with their employers to suit their family needs. That legislation has driven even further cultural change and change in practice, with seven out of 10 employers being willing to consider requests from employees for flexible working arrangements.</p>

	<p pid=".525.1/1">I am aware of that research and I am pleased that the Equal Opportunities Commission has focused some of its attention on pregnancy discrimination. Two undesirable elements are at work here. First, in some cases there is outright discrimination against pregnant women&mdash;that is clearly discrimination under sex discrimination legislation. Secondly, there is sometimes a lack of understanding both by women of their rights during pregnancy and by employers of their responsibilities; that links in with the point made by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1121" name="Julie Morgan">the Member for Cardiff, North (Julie Morgan)</phrase>. We welcome the EOC's interim report, and we have responded to some of the recommendations. I look forward to the publication of the final report, and especially to its recommendations on what more we can do to address these issues, and the unacceptable discrimination against pregnant women that has been identified by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1146" name="Sandra Osborne">the Member for Ayr (Sandra Osborne)</phrase>. We will carefully look at recommendations on those issues.</p>

	<p pid=".526.1/1">I am delighted to have an opportunity to participate in this important debate, which is in the same week as international women's day.</p>
	<p pid=".526.1/2">I welcome the Government's goal of providing 12 months' paid maternity leave by the end of the next Parliament, and in particular the proposals for a law to enable mothers to transfer part of their maternity leave and pay to fathers. That will help to give children the best start in life by providing parents with a choice about who wants or needs to be the main person looking after their new baby. It will also allow mothers to return to work earlier if that is required or what they wish to do. It also responds to the call by many fathers for them to be assisted to stay at home and care for their children in a way that is not generally possible.</p>
	<p pid=".526.1/3">This is a modern law that meets altered family patterns and gives greater equality to parents in the extremely important first months of their new child's life. More and more fathers want to play a greater role in those early years than their fathers were able to play. That can be enormously beneficial to the child. My right hon. Friend the Minister referred to the Department of Trade and Industry consultation document. It stated that when</p>
	<p pid=".526.1/4" class="indent">&quot;fathers play a greater role in bringing up children, this can lead to strong, positive educational effects later on in the child's life&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".526.1/5">Last summer, I visited Denmark on holiday and was delighted to meet up with an old work colleague. He had married a Danish woman some years ago. They settled in Copenhagen and had three children. As everyone knows, the level of support for families in Denmark is higher than in this country and has been for many years&mdash;as are its tax levels, which he was less encouraging about. However, he particularly prized the ability that he and his wife had to spread the available maternity leave between them. They could choose the arrangement that made sense to them in their circumstances. He was just about to go on four months' leave following the birth of their latest child.</p>
	<p pid=".526.1/6">The introduction in December 1999 of the entitlement to 13 weeks' parental leave per child&mdash;albeit unpaid&mdash;was an important move towards giving fathers the opportunity to spend time with their children while they are young. That was further strengthened in 2003, when the Government introduced two weeks' paid paternity leave. However, family patterns are changing and in no area of life could it be more important to give parents a real choice about how they manage all the family's needs: the need to physically care for a child; the need to earn a living; and, importantly, the need for both parents to form an emotional bond with their child and to take an active part in their child's life, particularly in those important early years.</p>
	<p pid=".526.1/7">The Union of Shop, Distributive and Allied Workers recently launched a campaign on supporting parents and carers. It is concerned that many new mums are being driven back to work too early because they cannot afford to take their full statutory maternity leave. It undertook a national survey and found that 78 per cent. of new mothers would have liked more time off with their new babies, but they went back to work an average six weeks before their statutory maternity pay ran out.</p>

	<p pid=".528.0/1">This important debate takes place in the week of international women's day and very soon after mother's day. In Wales, we also have St. David's day on <phrase class="date" code="2005-03-01">1 March</phrase>, so in my mind the three are mixed up together and symbolised by a daffodil. I do not know why, but that is how I see it. This is a week in which we traditionally consider issues relating to women and all aspects of their lives, and this debate concentrates on the important subject of working, caring and how we cope with doing everything while juggling different tasks, as women have to do every day of their lives.</p>
	<p pid=".528.0/2">Before I cover that in depth, I want briefly to say how much the Government's policies since 1997 have improved the situation for women, not only in terms of work and the work-life balance, but in the many areas that affect women's lives. I want to mention in particular the huge steps that we have made on domestic violence, which has a big impact on all women's lives. On <phrase class="date" code="2005-03-08">8 March</phrase>&mdash;international women's day&mdash;I was pleased to take part in an international video conference with other women MPs. We spoke to African women MPs about their experience of domestic violence, and it was a thrilling occasion. We found that we had so much in common. The issues were the same, and the same is true of balancing our lives, work and caring duties. Those are international issues, and it is good to consider what happens in other countries, particularly the Scandinavian countries, as my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1128" name="Meg Munn">the Member for Sheffield, Heeley (Ms Munn)</phrase> said. Those themes are being addressed all over the world.</p>
	<p pid=".528.0/3">When I was a councillor, I used to work closely with women and children and tried to expand child care in my ward. I tried to do all that I could to help with the balance of care for mothers and children in particular. I always thought of a carer as a mother of small children, as I think my right hon. Friend the Minister mentioned. The Government have done an enormous amount to help mothers of small children. Many of the benefits have been mentioned, such as increased maternity pay and leave, and the right to choose flexible working. That is not enough, as I think we would all acknowledge, but we have taken tremendous steps. My own two daughters, who both have small children, returned to work after benefiting from the extra maternity pay and leave, but they also felt that it was too soon to go back.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-03-10.532.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1146" speakername="Sandra Osborne" colnum="532"  time="015:23:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/cm050310/halltext/50310h01.htm#50310h01_spnew23">
	<p pid=".532.0/1">I am delighted to take part in this celebration of international women's day, which we have had now for the past few years. I have celebrated the day for many years through my former involvement with Women's Aid, where I worked for 16 years. We used to have a party every year; the House of Commons has not got to that stage yet, but perhaps that will happen one of these days.</p>
	<p pid=".532.0/2">My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1121" name="Julie Morgan">the Member for Cardiff, North (Julie Morgan)</phrase> referred to the progress made in the field of domestic violence. I applaud the Government, and also the Scottish Executive for the progress that they have made in Scotland. There is absolutely no doubt that that progress would never have been made without the work over the years of organisations such as Women's Aid, and I try to pay tribute to that work whenever possible.</p>
	<p pid=".532.0/3">I am pleased to take part in today's debate because it allows us to recognise the tremendous progress made in supporting parents and children and in accepting that women have the right to play their part in the public as well as the private sphere, where they still bear the overwhelming responsibility for caring. I acknowledge the very important part that women now play in the work force.</p>
	<p pid=".532.0/4">I want to concentrate particularly on child care, which is central to the mechanism for making a more realistic work-life balance. My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/762" name="Karen Buck">the Member for Regent's Park and Kensington, North (Ms Buck)</phrase> referred to a report in today's paper that suggested young women were even more fearful than our generation were. All I can say is that if I had had the facilities available to my daughter today, I would have thought that I had died and gone to heaven. The situation is completely different from what it was when I brought up my first child 30 years ago, and even from what it was when I brought up my second child 21 years ago. I pay tribute to the Government for that. That is due not just to Government policy, but to social attitudes, which have changed a great deal&mdash;thank goodness&mdash;since those days.</p>
	<p pid=".532.0/5">In 1990, the Equal Opportunities Commission report, &quot;The Key to Real Choice: an Action Plan for Childcare&quot;, stated:</p>
	<p pid=".532.0/6" class="indent">&quot;Women cannot enjoy genuine equality of opportunity unless they have access to day care facilities for their children. The complete inadequacy of current provision for both the under fives and dependent school age children is now probably one of the most important factors restricting many women's 'opportunities.'&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".532.0/7">Good child care, as we know, benefits children and brings with it many advantages for them.</p>
	<p pid=".532.0/8">For most of my adult life, I have been involved in campaigning for affordable child care in relation to equal rights for women. I make no apologies for that, and I am very proud of what has been achieved. As I said, the situation is very different from what we had in the past. From the 1980s and 1990s to the present day, child care has been quite a political issue, partly due to the need for increasing numbers of women in the work force and, of course, partly owing to changing family patterns. As has been said, the UK lagged for many years behind other European countries in the provision of child care and in parental rights legislation.</p>
	<p pid=".532.0/9">In 1992, the European Commission made recommendations on child care in four main areas: services for children; leave arrangements for parents; making the environment, structure and organisation of work responsive to the needs of workers with children; and promoting the sharing of responsibilities for children between men and women. Very little progress was made on all that until relatively recently, although we have a long way to go in all those areas.</p>
	<p pid=".532.0/10">Those recommendations reflected a desire for equal treatment for men and women, but also wider economic concern about the need for women in the work force. Hon. Members may or may not be surprised to learn that, in the west of Scotland, females will hold up to 53 per cent. of all employee jobs by 2010. We will be not only the majority of the population, but the majority of the working population. If that is increasingly to happen, and it would appear that the trend is unlikely to go into reverse, we must ensure that women's place in the work force is fair and equal, and not on a basis of exploitation of women, as has been the case in the past, when they were totally undervalued, in both the public and private spheres. Progress can be sustained only by efforts to reconcile work and family life, and I very much welcome the measures that the Government are taking in that regard.</p>
	<p pid=".532.0/11">For far too long, women who have chosen to fulfil a different or additional role, or who, more realistically, have had to work as an economic necessity, have had to find ways to juggle all their responsibilities, including having to make some kind of child care arrangement in the absence of Government support. We need to consider the concerns associated with the inadequate child care provision that we have had for many years, as they affect individual parents and children.</p>
	<p pid=".532.0/12">I carried out some research into child care provision while I worked with Women's Aid. Like my hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, North, I feel that we can learn a lot from the experiences of individual women and carers. I would therefore like to quote from my research into the case of a woman who came to the refuge that I worked at in Kilmarnock.</p>
	<p pid=".532.0/13" class="indent">&quot;Isabelle is 35 and has two children aged 9 and aged 5. She left her husband three and a half years ago due to physical, sexual and mental abuse, which had started on the second day of marriage and had escalated through the years. The attacks were also were also being witnessed by the children and they themselves were being abused. She had no family support in any real sense. When Isabelle left she went to Women's Aid who gave her refuge, space and support. She received income support, which seemed wonderful, as she had no idea whether or not she would receive anything and she frequently was given no money at all by her husband.</p>
	<p pid=".532.0/14" class="indent">During the time in the refuge she had a job as a barmaid to earn money to save up for furniture for her new home. She did swaps with the other women in the refuge for child care. When she moved to her new home she advertised for a babysitter close to her flat. After a time she arranged a swap again with a neighbour who worked in a school. She watched the neighbour's four children and made their meal two evenings a week and the neighbour watched her two children in return. This arrangement was very stressful for her and the children. She also did another swap with a neighbour who she gave driving lessons to in return for babysitting. This fell through when she found the neighbour was inviting eight adults into her house while she was out, including people who had been charged with grievous bodily harm.</p>
	<p pid=".532.0/15" class="indent">She then resolved to find a reliable babysitter and managed to do this, but the cost involved was prohibitive, and she could not afford it with the jobs she was doing: bar work, cleaning for an elderly woman and survey work for a magazine. She was forced to give up the jobs and this led to depression. She took in ironing to supplement her income support. She studied at home with the Open university and gave her place up at Glasgow university due to lack of child care. Isabelle wanted to work because she did not feel in control on income support, given changes at that time in Government legislation. She was also depressed at the idea of living on benefit long-term: 'If you try to earn extra money you are in fear of someone phoning the DSS.' She also feels that work 'keeps me sane'. Although she is sometimes not much better off financially she feels better about herself and her family, especially since she has taken her children from an earning income. Her husband was an architect and earned a lot of money.</p>
	<p pid=".532.0/16" class="indent">When she first started work she was paying up to half her wages to child care. This was reduced when her youngest child started school, but is still a hefty bill. Isabelle states that she could not afford to work if she did not earn her current salary and did not have her current working conditions. Isabelle believes that her current child care arrangements will fill a caring role for her children when she is not with them. They have a mother figure who was carefully chosen because of her qualities and chosen for what she could offer in place of Isabelle&mdash;secure, home-based caring.</p>
	<p pid=".532.0/17" class="indent">When she took full-time work she considered the whole position including the plus and minus effect on the children. The children have responded well to the child care arrangements. They are used to their mother working, mix with other children in the same position as themselves and regard it as normal. She anticipates future problems when the children are older and child minding is not appropriate but feels she will have to work that out as it comes along.</p>
	<p pid=".532.0/18" class="indent">Isabelle has strong views about the lack of affordable child-care facilities and described it as a huge obstacle for creating change in her own life or her family's. Lone parents require help in practical ways in Isabelle's view and also support, as society criticises whatever lone parents do. 'If they go out to work they are neglecting their children and this is the cause of all violence etc. in society and if they don't they are too lazy to get out there and earn a living.'&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".532.0/19">I have concentrated on Isabelle's story because it is illustrative of many of the situations people in which people have found themselves. The prohibitive cost of child care, the reliance on informal&mdash;often far from ideal&mdash;arrangements, the role of child care in alleviating poverty and creating opportunities for women to work and study, the importance of state funding to child care, the stress caused by a lack of suitable child care arrangements and the persistence of gender divisions that place an unfair burden on women all point to the central importance of child care provision on working, caring and life balance that we are debating today.</p>
	<p pid=".532.0/20">That research was undertaken in 1992. We have come a long way. Isabelle's story would be far different today from what it was then. It is incredible to think that it is only in recent years that anything even approaching a coherent national child care strategy has been developed. For many years, child care in the United Kingdom, unlike in many of our European partners, remained significant by its absence. In 1992, Germany, France, Italy, Belgium, Greece and Spain had at least 70 per cent. publicly funded child care services for children from three years of age to compulsory school age. It has taken the return of a Labour Government to make nursery places available at last, first for four-year-olds and now for three-year-olds.</p>
	<p pid=".532.0/21">For many parents, especially lone parents, the main obstacle to returning to the labour market has been the poverty trap. Despite propaganda to the contrary, and as I have illustrated by Isabelle's story, the overwhelming majority of lone parents want to reverse the trend of living on benefits and want to take part in the new deal. Lack of affordable child care is a major obstacle to doing that. Lone parents and unemployed parents, in general, are not in the position to take advantage of any growth in private sector child care and child minding services unless they receive financial support. Their absence from the labour market reduces their skills, confidence and earning potential. The benefits system in the past has not assisted such groups to return to work, and the real problems that are associated with the poverty trap were not addressed.</p>
	<p pid=".532.0/22">The tax credit system has changed the position and has been a tremendous boost in making work pay, along with the national minimum wage and increased child care and parental rights. A report by the Institute for Public Policy Research, as far back as 1991, showed that up to half all under-fives could be taken out of poverty if the provision of child care enabled their mothers to work and to improve their earnings. Many more could be taken out of poverty if those provisions were combined with reform of the tax and benefits system. Unfortunately, the Government at the time were not listening, but we can be proud of the progress that has been made under the present Government.</p>
	<p pid=".532.0/23">It is also relevant to note that changes in the benefit system to allow unemployed parents to seek a return to work without the burden of crippling child care costs save the Exchequer money through increased public revenue from income tax and national insurance contributions, as well as savings in benefits payments. It is a win-win situation all round, as long as women are fairly represented in the work force and rights are available to allow them the balance in their lives that we all deserve and to which we all have a right.</p>

	<p pid=".537.0/1">Absolutely, and I am glad that the hon. Lady noticed the hon. Member for Stroud, too.</p>
	<p pid=".537.0/2">It is difficult for women to juggle home, work, children, elderly parents and the rest of it, but that subject has, to some extent, been done to death. There are different pressures on men. The pressure to perform in the workplace and the culture of many workplaces often means that men are forced to spend time at work when they would like to spend more time with their families. We should not forget that, or forget that the image is often that carers are female. However, many carers are male.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-03-10.544.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1030" speakername="Eleanor Laing" colnum="544"  time="016:01:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/cm050310/halltext/50310h01.htm#50310h01_spnew45">
	<p pid=".544.1/1">I agree entirely with the hon. Lady. What she said was totally correct. From now on, I shall try to be more adversarial so that we can prove that a debate in Westminster Hall entirely populated by women has the cut and thrust of serious political debate. Our debate should have such cut and thrust, and I shall find a reason to disagree with Members here from opposing parties in just a moment.</p>
	<p pid=".544.1/2">There is a lot of consensus between us because we all recognise the difficulties and we want to solve them. This political issue is not about which side says, &quot;This does not matter&quot; and the other that says, &quot;It does&quot;. We all recognise that this issue is important, and there are two reasons for that. First, we want the right thing to be done: women should have equal opportunities to men&mdash;we agree with that altruistically nowadays. However, we also need to achieve the right work-life balance, because society and the economy require it.</p>
	<p pid=".544.1/3">If we say that women should either work or look after children, we will lose an enormous percentage of the work force whom we, as an economy, cannot afford to lose. On the other hand, if we say that if women work, they should not have children&mdash;something that we now think a ridiculous proposition, although that was not the case not so long ago&mdash;we will not produce the future generations that our society and economy require. It is essential to achieve the balance that we have all been talking about. We do that by accepting that flexibility in the workplace is not a luxury, but a necessity. It is an economic necessity that the work that women do should receive decent financial reward.</p>
	<p pid=".544.1/4">I emphasise, as did <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1121" name="Julie Morgan">the hon. Member for Cardiff, North (Julie Morgan)</phrase>, that we are not talking only about mothers with young children. I have noticed a bit of a backlash in some academic studies and articles in the past couple of years. Women who do not have young children are saying, &quot;Just a minute. If there are three women in my office, the two with young children get all the flexibility, privileges and help&mdash;maternity leave, flexible working and so on. I do not&quot;. Just because a person has chosen not to have children, or cannot have them, that does not mean that they should not be treated with respect in the workplace.</p>
	<p pid=".544.1/5">We have to be careful about that and recognise that anyone with a family responsibility of any kind&mdash;for young children, teenage children or a sick or elderly relative&mdash;whether temporary or long-term, requires understanding in the workplace. All employers should be encouraged to do what the best employers have always done. The CBI agrees that employers get the best out of their employees if they have good working conditions, and that includes an understanding of the time needed for family responsibilities.</p>
	<p pid=".544.1/6">Such issues are not peripheral, but absolutely basic to the future of our economy and society. We now spend taxpayers' money and the nation's resources on educating young women and men equally, and on giving girls and boys the same education at school and the same opportunities in higher education. I completely welcome that. All Governments in the past 30 years have been striving for that goal and have achieved it. However, it is ridiculous that we now do all those things, yet when a woman with the same educational and training qualifications as a man becomes pregnant and has a baby, suddenly her talents and abilities are not worth the same as a man's because the employer does not put her in the same category any more; he sees her as a bit of a problem because she has children. That is nonsense. We are beginning to get over it, and what has, to an extent, been a consensus in this debate might possibly help in the future.</p>
	<p pid=".544.1/7">As to child care, fathers should of course be encouraged and enabled to care for their children, and employers must recognise that, too. The position of new fathers alongside that of new mothers is important. However, I heard an argument recently, which has been mentioned in the debate, that we will not improve the position of women as regards child care for young children until men become fully involved in that child care. I am sorry, but I am not very optimistic about that. We cannot legislate to make a man look after his children, or to make a man know what to do with a small baby. Somehow, miraculously, a woman who has just become a mother knows what to do with a baby, or learns very quickly, because there is no choice; she has just got to. A man does not. I do not believe that a man even with the very best of intentions looks after a tiny baby in the same way as the baby's mother or, indeed, its grandmother.</p>
	<p pid=".544.1/8">I do not suggest for a moment that men should not be encouraged to be very much involved in the early years of their children's lives; of course they should. However, we will not improve the position of women by depending on men changing their attitudes and behaviour in a domestic setting. Indeed, I think <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1146" name="Sandra Osborne">the hon. Member for Ayr (Sandra Osborne)</phrase> said that men undertake the same percentage of household duties now as they did 30 years ago. That progress has not been made, but it might be. We will keep trying to make progress, but we cannot depend upon it. We therefore need to ensure that there are proper support systems for mothers who also work. That means having good child care facilities.</p>

	<p pid=".547.4/1">When Labour came to power, only extremely patchy child care provision existed. Child minders were almost non-existent in some of the poorest communities, so the ability of people to choose was very limited. A comprehensive range of child care has now been developed, and there is free access for all three and four-year-olds. That is enormously important, and we must not underestimate the impact of such measures. I echo the comments of my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1146" name="Sandra Osborne">the Member for Ayr (Sandra Osborne)</phrase>; if child care is so important, why was provision so terrible under the previous Tory Government?</p>

	<p pid=".548.5/1">My hon. Friend the Member for Worthing, West had just made an excellent point about grandparents playing a role in caring for their grandchildren when we broke for the Divisions. I believe that we should find some way of changing the way in which child minders are regulated to allow grandparents to benefit from officially being child minders when they look after their grandchildren. I do not suggest for a moment that a grandmother should have to pass lots of tests in order to look after her grandchildren, but there are ways in which we could reform the present system so that grandparents could in some circumstances officially be child minders and therefore benefit financially from looking after their grandchildren. I believe that that idea has the support of the National Childminding Association.</p>
	<p pid=".548.5/2">My hon. Friend highlighted an important point there, as a great many grandparents&mdash;grandfathers as well as grandmothers&mdash;play an important part in caring for and bringing up their children's children. To bring more flexibility and choice, and to increase the supply side of child care&mdash;in other words having more child care workers qualified and in place, which is desperately needed&mdash;it is essential to make the tax credit system simpler to understand and administer. Many thousands of families in this country right now could benefit more from the tax credit system if only they knew how to do so. It does not make sense to have a system that normal people cannot properly access.</p>

	<p pid=".550.1/1">No. I will definitely not take that chance again, and most certainly not if the election is in eight weeks' time. I can make that promise to my constituents and my family.</p>
	<p pid=".550.1/2">It is a serious matter that employers can find a way around the current laws. I do not suggest that we need much of a change in the law in that area. We need a change in attitudes in the workplace, because some types of employer twist the law and manage to get rid of a woman because she is about to have a child. Such attitudes ignore the fact that we need women in the work force; as I said earlier, that is not a luxury.</p>
	<p pid=".550.1/3">The hon. Member for Cardiff, North mentioned the international aspect of international women's day. On the day&mdash;last Tuesday&mdash;I also spent some time on those sorts of issues. I visited the Terence Higgins Trust, which I think is in the constituency of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/762" name="Karen Buck">the hon. Member for Regent's Park and Kensington, North (Ms Buck)</phrase>. I apologise if I did not tell the hon. Lady in advance that I was going to be there. I was accompanying the Leader of the Opposition. It was a pleasure to visit the hon. Lady's constituency and to see the work of the trust, of which I am sure that she is well aware, as will most hon. Members.</p>
	<p pid=".550.1/4">The issues being dealt with at the trust make one realise the enormous gap between the struggle that we women in the western world face compared with women in Africa, Asia and the far east, who still struggle with the absolute basics. For example, many cannot choose when or whether they are going to have children or more children. The issues that we looked at on Tuesday concerned the fact that thousands of women cannot protect themselves, and therefore their future children, from HIV/AIDS. I mention that point because it is one on which I believe that there will again be consensus. While thinking about the struggles that we have, it is important to think how the work-life balance does not matter to women in those countries, because they are struggling with basic oppression. Having a work-life balance to think about would be a luxury to them; they are literally dealing with matters of life and death.</p>
	<p pid=".550.1/5">I was pleased to hear the Minister say that the commission is examining occupational segregation and the pay gap. As many hon. Members will have seen, the Fawcett Society produced a most interesting and well researched report earlier this week, which showed that, shockingly, the pay gap between men and women is about 20 per cent. for people in full-time employment. Women in part-time employment are being paid 40 per cent. less than their male counterparts. It is scandalous and appalling that employers in Britain today think that that is acceptable. It shows that we, as a society, do not properly value the work of women who are doing two or three jobs, one of which is bringing up children. The reason why most women have part-time employment is because they are juggling other responsibilities with their employment. Indeed, as in the example used by the hon. Member for Ayr, they may have more than one part-time job, simply to try to make ends meet. When people have a part-time job they are undervalued, and a 40 per cent. pay gap is simply not acceptable.</p>
	<p pid=".550.1/6">I am not particularly saying that the Minister must do something about that now. To combat it we need a complete change in attitudes, whereby women are valued for being mothers, carers and responsible family members as well as valuable employees in the work force.</p>
	<p pid=".550.1/7">When we talk about employees, however, we must also bear in mind the position of employers. The worst thing that legislation can do is put so many burdens upon employers in order to protect women in the work force that employers find it necessary to try to find a way of not employing women at all. The pendulum could swing too far. A large organisation that has an efficient human resources department can do much to help and protect women in the work force that small employers cannot do. In all that we say and do, we must remember that most people in Britain are employed by small and medium-sized enterprises, not by large employers. Therefore, it is vital that any regulations made to try to achieve equality and support for women do not go so far that employers do not employ women at all. That would not be what we set out to achieve. We must be careful to achieve the right balance.</p>
	<p pid=".550.1/8">We need women in the work force, and we need a future generation to be born and nurtured. Therefore, we must take seriously the need to achieve a proper balance between work life, home life and family responsibilities. We have had a constructive debate on all those issues and I am sure that the Minister has taken note of some of the good ideas that have come from hon. Members.</p>
	<p pid=".550.1/9">Jacqui Smith: I wholeheartedly agree with what <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1030" name="Eleanor Laing">the hon. Member for Epping Forest (Mrs. Laing)</phrase> said about the quality of our debate. I set a few questions and challenges at the beginning, and hon. Members have risen to them in terms of the quality of the argument and some of the practical proposals that were made. I very much commend that.</p>
	<p pid=".550.1/10">My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1128" name="Meg Munn">the Member for Sheffield, Heeley (Ms Munn)</phrase> drew on her understanding of children's development and needs&mdash;as she often does, as I know from experience. She strongly made the case, as did others, that we need to develop opportunities for both fathers and mothers to play their role in caring. The fact that we are taking forward proposals for sharing extended maternity leave between mothers and fathers is an important step, not only in practical terms, in that it allows fathers to have time off in the first year of their child's life, but also in terms of addressing the cultural issues that hon. Members raised. It is important that we say that our society believes that fathers have a role in caring for their children and that we provide the legislative basis and support for that.</p>
	<p pid=".550.1/11">My hon. Friend also rightly identified the excellent work carried out by USDAW in its &quot;Supporting Parents and Carers&quot; campaign. She mentioned its analysis, which is that the problem of finance is often what brings women back to work more quickly than they want or when their children would not benefit from them going back to work so soon. That is why the increase in maternity pay and the extension of maternity leave will be so important, not only for mothers, but also for children. USDAW, as a good example of a modern trade union, is now including in its negotiations the consideration of work-life balance issues and flexibility in conditions of employment. I commend it on its campaign and on its activities and negotiations with employers.</p>
	<p pid=".550.1/12">My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1121" name="Julie Morgan">the Member for Cardiff, North (Julie Morgan)</phrase> made an important contribution, using her personal experience, and I want to address the issues raised about carers. I hope that she had a suitable celebration for St. David's day, international women's day and mothers day. Either she or my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1146" name="Sandra Osborne">the Member for Ayr (Sandra Osborne)</phrase> proposed a party for international women's day. That received great approbation broadly, and not just from hon. Members, although I know that we are not supposed to mention others. Perhaps the House authorities should give some thought to that suggestion.</p>
	<p pid=".550.1/13">My hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, North talked about the progress that we as a Government have made on tackling domestic violence. She also picked up on the point made by the hon. Member for Epping Forest, who mentioned the international nature of international women's day, which sets our debate in the context of the international challenges that women face. Last week, I was fortunate enough to attend the Commission on the Status of Women at the United Nations, 10 years on from the Beijing &quot;Platform for Action&quot;. I was struck by those parts of the Beijing platform that are important for women across the world, including access to the labour market, economic empowerment and tackling violence against women. We certainly have some issues of commonality, but the hon. Member for Epping Forest is right to outline the particular challenges that women in developing countries face, which we all have a responsibility to help them to address.</p>
	<p pid=".550.1/14">My hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, North focused her contribution on her experience of caring, and talked movingly about caring for her mother. She gave us a clear understanding of the massive contribution that carers make, not only in terms of replacing services that otherwise would need to be publicly funded. She also identified the emotional commitment, time, planning and organisation that goes into the sort of caring that she and millions of other people in this country carry out. We should place a suitable value on that. As a Government, we should take action to support carers, and we have.</p>
	<p pid=".550.1/15">I was struck by my hon. Friend's point about the need to be able to phone home to check up on what is happening. Many carers have said that when combining their caring with work, relatively small changes and provisions made by employers can sometimes make all the difference. Access to a phone to check home and a little flexibility about leaving in an emergency can keep carers in work.</p>
	<p pid=".550.1/16"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/912" name="Sandra Gidley">The hon. Member for Romsey (Sandra Gidley)</phrase> emphasised the significance of the fact that when a carer falls out of the job market, it is often more difficult for them to get back in again. The Carers (Equal Opportunities) Act 2004, which was supported by the Government and to which my hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, North referred, does a number of important things. First, it ensures that carers know that they are entitled to an assessment. Secondly, it makes explicit that other aspects of carers' lives, such as their need or wish to work, have to be borne in mind in the assessment and the support with which they are provided.</p>
	<p pid=".550.1/17">This year, &pound;60 million has been devoted in 2005&ndash;06 to the carer's grant, providing services to carers, but also, importantly, providing the breaks referred to by the hon. Member for Romsey. We have introduced direct payments to give carers more flexibility about how and where they access those breaks and support. To ensure that local authorities also focus on carer support, the Under-Secretary of State for Health, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1029" name="Stephen Ladyman">the Member for South Thanet (Dr. Ladyman)</phrase>, introduced a new performance indicator on carer support for local authorities, identifying the significance of ensuring that that support is in place.</p>
	<p pid=".550.1/18">Carers also often suffer detriment in their pension provisions, particularly if they have to leave work. Having introduced a second state pension to boost the pension rights of many of those under-looked in the previous system, such as carers, we have so far benefited 1.9 million female carers, who can build up additional state pensions for the first time.</p>
	<p pid=".550.1/19">We need to do more to value and recognise the tough lives of carers. Some important progress has been made. My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/762" name="Karen Buck">the Member for Regent's Park and Kensington, North (Ms Buck)</phrase> made a good point about the need to recognise that, although the first year of a child's life is very important, some of the challenges of the early teens and teenage years can be equally difficult, as all of us whose children are now slightly older know. We need to ensure that flexibility is available, which is why considering how we might extend flexible working to such people is important.</p>
	<p pid=".550.1/20">There has been some discussion of out-of-school child care places, but, especially when children are between 11 and 14, wraparound care and the ability to have a bit of extra time after school so that the children do not have to come home to an empty house&mdash;not, as was suggested, to put a child into child care at 8 in the morning and pick them up at 6 in the evening&mdash;will be important for parents. That is exactly what our proposals should deliver.</p>
	<p pid=".550.1/21">My hon. Friend the Member for Ayr spoke with great understanding and knowledge from her experience with Women's Aid. She not only spoke about domestic violence, but identified the importance of child care to all women, in particular to women with specific needs, such as those who are victims of domestic violence or who are lone parents. If ever the benefits that come from investment in child care places were needed, they are needed by such women.</p>
	<p pid=".550.1/22">My hon. Friend also identified the need to ensure that we make work pay. The introduction of tax credits and the way in which they are paid to the main carer, and the improvements in the levels of child care tax allowance, have been important to enable women not only to get into work, but to ensure that they have the income that they need to support their families.</p>
	<p pid=".550.1/23">The hon. Member for Romsey touched on some slightly worrying things in a wide-ranging speech, and prompted a discussion about the role of men, possibly at the invitation of my hon. Friend the Member for Regent's Park and Kensington, North. Although I agree that there are some cultural challenges with respect to men and their attitude to housework and caring, that does not mean that we should give up on the push to develop a more equal approach, to both caring and housework. I cite the excellent and commendable example of my husband, who was willing to give up his main career to play a major role in bringing up our children. There are some beacons out there and we need to ensure that they shine on men throughout the country.</p>
	<p pid=".550.1/24">The hon. Member for Romsey also made an important point about the impact of flexible working and maternity provision on small and medium-sized companies, as did the hon. Member for Epping Forest. There is a particular challenge, as I suggested earlier, in allowing small companies to plan for the implications of somebody taking maternity leave. That is more straightforward for a large company with many workers.</p>
	<p pid=".550.1/25">Several hon. Members argued that small businesses are increasingly recognising the benefits for their business of helping women to return to work after maternity leave. Given that it takes an average of &pound;4,000 simply to recruit somebody, and given the training provided for women workers, losing them automatically when they have children is not good for them or the businesses. Nevertheless, we have recognised some of those challenges and will consult on two issues in the &quot;Work and Families: Choice and Flexibility&quot; consultation document.</p>
	<p pid=".550.1/26">First, we will see how we can improve communication between employers and women who are on maternity leave. Secondly, we will find out whether there is scope in extending the notice period that women give before they return to work. In both cases, it is about helping small and medium-sized companies communicate and plan. We are concerned to hear from employers about how we can implement that measure in a way that will benefit their women workers and themselves.</p>
	<p pid=".550.1/27">The hon. Member for Epping Forest suggested that working hours had increased, but they have reduced on average since 1997, when we signed the social chapter and implemented the working time legislation, which was, to introduce a tinge of political controversy, wrongly opposed by her party. We should be honest about identifying the trend for shorter working hours and saying that this Government, with their commitment to better working conditions for people, are enabling that to happen.</p>
	<p pid=".550.1/28">I agree with hon. Members who said that there is a cultural, as well as a legal, issue about long hours. We have to change the attitude that says that longer is always better, because in this case quality is more important than length. With those words, I will not venture to comment on what the hon. Member for Romsey said about Kinsey.</p>
	<p pid=".550.1/29">The hon. Lady asked whether it is too easy for firms to reject a request for flexible working. We have designed the law to help discussions between employers and employees on solutions that suit them both. The introduction of the flexible working legislation has massively reduced the proportion of flexible working requests refused. The trend appears to be continuing: the most recent data indicate that just 8 per cent. are declined.</p>
	<p pid=".550.1/30">I am sure that we could all agree with the hon. Member for Epping Forest on a number of things, although I do not agree that the concept of choice is the sole possession of the Conservative party. For a choice to be meaningful, it must be supported. Where women want to go to work, for instance, choice must be supported by the ability to work flexibly or to access child care. Had the Government not taken the decisions that we have and made progress, those things would not be available. We not only support choice, but take action to ensure that that choice is available for a broader range of women.</p>
	<p pid=".550.1/31">The hon. Lady and others referred to the New Woman survey. The conclusion that we should draw from that part of the debate is that families will want to live in many different ways and that women will have different aspirations. Some will want to stay at home, or be able to afford to do so, some will want to work part time and some will want to work full time. What women should avoid is allowing anybody, anywhere, to play us off against each other because of the decisions that we choose to make. That does not happen with men. We should be clear that we want the ability to make the decisions that suit our families and to be supported in those.</p>
	<p pid=".550.1/32">The hon. Lady was right to make the economic and social case for work-life balance. Encouraging all employers to do what the best do is an important way forward. She, like other hon. Members, touched on the Equal Opportunities Commission's investigation into pregnancy discrimination. As I said, the EOC has published its interim report. As part of our consultation on work and families, we have included the EOC's top two interim recommendations. Those were, first, consulting on whether there should be a written statement of rights and responsibilities for employees and employers during pregnancy, and, secondly, giving employers the right to request information from an employee about her planned return date. We are keen to hear views from parents, carers and employers about those recommendations.</p>
	<p pid=".550.1/33">Finally, on equal pay, since 1997 the pay gap has been closing. It is now approximately 14 per cent. in median terms.</p>

	<p pid=".555.3/1">Some people might argue that, but the Office for National Statistics argued that we should use the median pay gap. As I suggested earlier, it is important that we understand the trend over time and use either method. There has been a reduction in the pay gap.</p>
	<p pid=".555.3/2">Incidentally, I am not saying that that is adequate. The hon. Lady's point about the impact of occupational segregation on the pay gap is very important. That is precisely why the women and work commission will focus on occupational segregation and why it will examine how we value women's work, and caring work in particular. It will propose recommendations, which I look forward to seeing.</p>
	<p pid=".555.3/3">We have had a very good debate. The values that inspired international women's day&mdash;respect for the dignity of all women and international solidarity&mdash;are as relevant to us today as they were to those pioneering women who used as their slogan, and fought for, bread and roses when marching 100 years ago.</p>
	<p pid=".555.3/4">For a long time, women have been struggling to achieve a balance between work, other necessities and the other things in our lives. We also recognise, however, that we need to find new solutions to the issues that women face today. That is not an easy task in a global and complex 24/7 culture, but our vision of a modern Britain is one that uses the skills and talents of all citizens irrespective of their gender, race, age and sexuality and of whether they are disabled or able-bodied. Our vision supports everyone, but women in particular, in being able to take the decisions that they believe to be right for themselves and their families. That is how we can ensure the well-being and prosperity of our nation for years to come.</p>
