	<p pid="a.168.1/1">I am happy to join in that praise for the Government's action on what I call traditional, real apprenticeships. I cannot thank the Government enough. Apprenticeships are part of what we need for the future, but are no good if we allow the companies to disappear. We must ensure that the companies are there so that we can provide the long-term jobs that apprentices and the country require.</p>
	<p pid="a.168.1/2">The TUC estimates that at a cost of about &pound;1.2 billion, we could save 600,000 workers each year through a short-time working subsidy. We have found billions to bail out the bankers, so we can do the same for hard-working people in manufacturing. The banks are now paying that money back, and we should reinvest it in manufacturing so that we benefit even more in the longer term. A short-time working subsidy would be a quick and effective way of targeting support at the struggling employers providing financial support to employees across the UK. Europe has already recognised the benefits of such schemes, which have been introduced in Germany, France, Spain, the Netherlands and Italy. Closer to home, the Welsh Assembly has introduced a wage subsidy called ProAct, which took only two months to become operational at the beginning of the year and is now benefiting many businesses and workers across Wales&mdash;we can learn something from a small country such as Wales.</p>
	<p pid="a.168.1/3">The proposal to introduce a short-time working subsidy is supported by business leaders such as the Federation of Small Businesses, and organisations such as Corus, JCB and many others. The trade unions also fully support it. As I have said, it is better to pay to keep people in work than to pay them to attend a jobcentre. What are we otherwise going to do with them? Will we train them to do the jobs for which they already have the skills? That is what we seem to do. It makes sense to provide that support, because it helps people to keep their dignity and their ability to pay the mortgage and it stops family break-ups. That alone would bring a major benefit to the Government. It must be a priority to keep viable businesses open and to protect jobs if we are to come out of the recession in a stronger position. If we fail to do so, there is a danger that we could lose many much-needed skills.</p>
	<p pid="a.168.1/4">I want to discuss workers' rights. The Government have rightly made progress on introducing family-friendly policies, but those policies benefit people only if they have jobs, so we need to make those things work together. We have not been so bold in other areas, and the UK has a poor record, in comparison with other European countries, on protecting workers who face redundancy. It is worrying that General Motors Europe has admitted that it is easier to sack British workers because of the flexible labour market. Increasingly, when multinationals consider downsizing and shedding jobs, they see British workers as the easy option. We need to reconsider these matters, as it is scandalous that UK workers are among the cheapest to sack. We need a level playing field, and I urge the Government to act to give British workers the same protection as their European counterparts. This is not about favours; it is about fairness.</p>
	<p pid="a.168.1/5">Linked to all that, we need further incentives to support companies that invest in our manufacturing sector. We could do that by giving better tax incentives or by demanding the repayment of grants, so that we would help them on one hand, but they would have to pay back with penalties. We would have to include penalties because some people want to come in, make a quick buck and disappear. Companies must decide which is the best option for them: is it to repay the advantage they have had in order to move quickly somewhere offshore?</p>
	<p pid="a.168.1/6">We need to send the message that Britain is the best place to invest, and we can do that. We have the best skills and the best work force, and we make the best products in the world. We are world leaders in areas such as pharmaceuticals and aerospace, and we have a great skills base in the north-west, particularly in Lancashire. There are no better skills than those we have in aerospace in Lancashire. When we look at BAE Systems and at what flies out of there, we see that those skills and the research and development that go into that manufacturing base are second to none. The Americans look at us with envy, and rightly so, as we are building the best aircraft in the world.</p>
	<p pid="a.168.1/7">I would like all that skill, knowledge and know-how to be linked with technology transfer, as that is where we miss out. We invest in military aircraft that are the best in the world, but we need a spin-off from that investment to create jobs in the civil sector. People always ask, what good is the military? It is good when it protects us, but I want to be able to say that it goes much further than that. I want to say, &quot;Look at what we've created by transfer to the automotive industry and other industries such as shipbuilding, with submarines.&quot; There must be skills that we can transfer across to our other UK manufacturing bases. We have put in the research, development and investment, but we do not hear about technology transfer. When a space shuttle is put into space, we hear about the spin-offs and other jobs being created through that investment. We need to do the same and to recognise what we could gain from such major investment. I repeat that we are still the world leader in pharmaceuticals. We need to go forward with that kind of blue chip company, and we need to send the message that Britain is the best place to invest and do business.</p>
	<p pid="a.168.1/8">Warm words from the Government in support of manufacturing are commendable, but they need to be matched by direct action. The Government have rightly embarked on record investment in our schools, hospitals and transport infrastructure, but that investment must be matched by a policy that prioritises British manufacturing, thus protecting British jobs. We invest in our railways, but we have trains that are built in Japan and other rolling stock that is built in Spain. Why is that continuing? Does the Minister think that Japan or Spain would let us export trains to them? The answer is no, they would not. When we are making all that investment with taxpayers' money, we must consider how to use it to help British jobs. We have missed a trick which we must not miss in the future. The Government spend more than &pound;120 billion a year on buying manufactured goods, so the introduction of such measures would make a real difference to our manufacturing sector. For a start, why should not all the vehicles used by the Government and the public sector be made in Britain? What about Building Schools for the Future and Sure Start children's centres? Why should the desks and chairs that our children use in the classroom not be made in Britain? I could go on and on about how much more we could do. As I have said, British uniforms could be made in Chorley. Public infrastructure projects such as Crossrail and the 2012 Olympics should always prioritise in favour of British companies and British jobs, and should make sure that the steelwork, materials and everything else are from the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.168.1/9">We also need to invest more in skills and training if we are reinvigorate the manufacturing sector. The Leitch report highlighted the importance of investing in skills and workers. The planned investment initiatives will go only so far, and we need to go further if we wish to remain at the cutting edge of manufacturing. We need to address this issue urgently, as it cannot be right that companies such as Rolls Royce have to recruit from abroad to fill the skills gap. We ought to recognise that problem immediately and put it right. I welcome the increasing number of apprenticeships and I commend the work of companies such as BAE Systems, which has invested significant resources in such apprenticeship schemes and in the company's future. One has only to look at its graduate and apprenticeship scheme in Barrow, which has benefited more than 600 people. About 13 per cent. of its Submarine Solutions work force has come through that scheme, proving that investment quickly brings rewards.</p>
	<p pid="a.168.1/10">Train to Gain is also making a difference, but we must go further. We need to be bold and radical in offering training and development opportunities for those who are already in work to upskill and give them the diversity to meet the change in demand for skills. However, the Government cannot do that alone. Employers need to work together on that, but there should be greater incentives, particularly for small and medium-sized companies to invest in their work forces.</p>
	<p pid="a.168.1/11">We will face challenges in future, but we must not shy away from them. Our manufacturing is something that I can be proud of, that Britain should be proud of, and that the rest of the world is very envious of. We are one of the leading exporters of high-technology products, and our productivity has risen by half since 1997, thereby outpacing Germany and France. The key test is whether we make the necessary investment to build on those achievements or whether we stand by and let our manufacturing industry deteriorate further. We cannot afford to do that. We have been through the painful measures and difficulties of the 1980s, and I know the impact that they had in Lancashire at that time and the problems that we faced. We have come through all that, and we must never return to it by doing nothing. This is not a political point: doing nothing would have taken us from recession into a depression, and that is why we were right to invest. We must not shy away from investment, although there will be critics. Fruit is now beginning to appear on the tree and it will not be long before we can pick it, so it benefits the Government. We must acknowledge when they get things right, and we should not be ashamed of what we have done. I repeat that doing nothing is not the way forward, and that we would have been in a depression if we had done nothing.</p>
	<p pid="a.168.1/12">The weakness of the economy is dependent on the financial sector, as I said earlier. With a strong manufacturing base, we can secure continued economic growth and stability and help to support workers and return our economy to a position of even greater strength. I hope that we can expand on the measures that we have taken, and that they can grow. However, it is not all doom and gloom&mdash;there is good news. I have a company called Porter Lancastrian in my area. People might ask who they are: they produce bar products, but the brewing industry is suffering and pub closures are coming. However, Porter Lancastrian diversified, and now produces waterproof television screens for the fanciest hotels around the world, so that when people sit in the bath or have a shower, they can watch television. Waterproof televisions are going a bomb and they came out of Chorley. That is fantastic news&mdash;I do not think that MPs have claimed them on their expenses yet.</p>
	<p pid="a.168.1/13">It is important to have initiatives to deal with these issues. Such initiatives should be about diversifying and creating new jobs. That is what we are good at in the UK. Providing a bit of help and support and bringing people together can make a real difference. I am pleased that we have been allowed to have today's debate. It will help to inform policy development and implementation, and the vision set out in the &quot;New Industry, New Jobs&quot; document. That document is important and manufacturing is important. Thank you, Mr. Fraser, for your patience. I also thank other hon. Members for turning up.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-06-09a.175.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1705" speakername="Tony Lloyd" colnum="175"  time="010:22:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090609/halltext/90609h0003.htm#09060973000522">
	<p pid="a.175.2/1">We all agree with that. We want the rules to be used judiciously and carefully to the advantage of our employment and manufacturing base.</p>
	<p pid="a.175.2/2">The Government must look at the role of Government procurement. I do not say that unkindly, but procurement over the years by all Governments has perhaps not shown Britain at its best. The civil service has not always known best how to work in partnership with manufacturing. That might seem like a plea for manufacturers. It is sometimes said that we have feather-bedded manufacturers in the past. We have allowed poor management to get away with an approach that allows them to become lazy and not as cutting edge as they ought to be. The Government ought to be using their purchasing power to promote the dynamic cutting edge. They should ensure that those who provide goods and services to them are at the forefront of global manufacturing.</p>
	<p pid="a.175.2/3">I give the example&mdash;it is an important one&mdash;of BAE Systems. There is no doubt that in the past it got away with ridiculous prices, ridiculously slow delivery times and so on. The overly cosy relationship with previous Governments was not in the interests of BAE Systems or our employment and manufacturing base. Such things are now changing. There is a much tougher view in the Ministry of Defence and the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform about the procurement process, but we need to refine it to ensure that there is value for money and that the Government play a part in driving an industrial policy that leads to success.</p>
	<p pid="a.175.2/4">I support my hon. Friends the Members for Chorley and for Stroud (Mr. Drew) in their plea for a proper look at a judicious use of employment subsidies in parts of industry. The Government rightly recognised that the importance of the banking system was not in whether individual banks succeeded or otherwise but in the fact that if the system had collapsed, knock-on effects would have spread throughout the whole of the UK's services and manufacturing economy. What the Government did was high risk but absolutely right, which is now being proven.</p>
	<p pid="a.175.2/5">The argument for support for LDV, for example, is similar. The issue concerns not only LDV, but the supply chain that it is involved in and the importance of maintaining that whole infrastructure within our industry. We need to take a strategic view in respect of critical manufacturing firms and ensure that we offer support at this particularly difficult time. Conditions are likely to be difficult for manufacturing for some time to come, so I support the plea made by those who have already spoken.</p>
	<p pid="a.175.2/6">The future will not be with the large manufacturers of the past but with small and medium-sized enterprises&mdash;those little firms that are highly innovative but often feel that they are not supported. I wish to make several points about them. First, while I agree with the arguments about traditional apprenticeships, we have to understand the position of the traditional apprentice in the modern world. A small firm on its own cannot devise a proper apprenticeship structure. There has to be a well-defined structure and access to further education. As I have said to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1631" name="Mark Prisk">the hon. Member for Hertford and Stortford (Mr. Prisk)</phrase>, further education is fundamental, and any attack on it would be massively damaging to our manufacturing base. There has to be proper partnership between our education institutions, if we are to offer upskilling to the people who work in our economy.</p>
	<p pid="a.175.2/7">We should bear in mind that this is not just about apprenticeships but about the reskilling of those who are in work and who already have good skills. My hon. Friend the Member for Stroud discussed labour subsidy. The reality is that people with skills who drift out of jobs usually do not come back, and we could lose that skills base in the future.</p>
	<p pid="a.175.2/8">My final point is about the banking system. Historically, our banking system has seen itself as a great success, but it has always failed this country in the particular area of early innovators&mdash;those who do high-technology, quality research and who want to move into production. We are spectacularly bad in dealing with that gap, and many highly qualified, highly competent people leave these shores, often for America and the rest of Europe, to produce their products, because our banking system fails to take a risk at that risky stage of investment, which, nevertheless, is fundamental if we are to see a transition from idea to manufacture.</p>
	<p pid="a.175.2/9">A firm in my constituency, Liberalto Engines, is currently suffering from that gap. Everyone says that its idea is great and that it will have all the backing that it needs, if it can get its idea into production. The idea is good, and the company knows that the product will work, but moving into prototype and demonstrating production capacity is, of course, risky. The company may fail, but the whole point of the banking system is to take risks and get a price for those risks. At the moment, however, the banking system is not doing that. That is one thing that the Government could do to ensure that we have a future in respect of the small, highly innovative, advanced technologies that we need.</p>
	<p pid="a.175.2/10">We have some world-beating industries in this country. I visited a firm in my constituency last week called SSR. It is a training company that works with the media industries, which have produced bands such as the Happy Mondays, New Order and all the other great Manchester bands of the past. It trains people and gives them the skills of the future. There is a blurring of the distinction between services and manufacturing in that area, but those are the industries of the future. Those industries are massively hi-tech and massively important for our future, and they are there now. They are successful and they will weather this economic storm and provide us with high-quality employment for the future. The future is good, but it needs a little bit of assistance from the Government now.</p>

	<p pid="a.177.0/2">I shall pick up on a couple of points made by the hon. Member for Manchester, Central. First, he made a good point about Government procurement, which is important. Of course, the Office of Government Commerce exists precisely to have an overview of procurement within Government. At the moment, the OGC is largely focused on short-term economic gain in the procurement process, but it is wholly right and reasonable that it should also have a duty to consider its impact in the wider British economy and, as far as it is reasonable, to be helpful to our regions in the way in which it goes about its business.</p>
	<p pid="a.177.0/3">The hon. Gentleman also mentioned further education and, in doing so, put his finger on something important, namely the way in which further education supplies potential skills to industry, particularly SMEs. Coming, as I do, from a background in the hotel and catering industry, one of the biggest difficulties faced by employers over many years has been finding short courses that are relevant for their staff, rather than those designed by the lecturers, with all good intent, that do not deliver the skills that are wanted in the industry. It is important for people to get skills from further education establishments that are fit for purpose in SMEs.</p>
	<p pid="a.177.0/4">The hon. Member for Chorley underlined the importance of manufacturing. Although I will mention some of the bad things, I want to start by underlining, as he did, its importance to the economy and the success that it has enjoyed. The hon. Gentleman talked about the banks, which I will mention, too, because they are an important part of the mix, and about the success of the aerospace industry. I am sure that one of the firms at the back of his mind is Rolls-Royce. It is fascinating that Rolls-Royce, in my part of the world, is actively looking at marine renewable technology in Pentland firth. We have a real prospect, within a short time, of a number of companies using Rolls-Royce-manufactured kit to produce gigawatts of electricity consistently out of a great national resource. We need that kind of technology transfer, and we need more innovation and research and development in that area.</p>
	<p pid="a.177.0/5">Manufacturing has been in a fairly steady state of decline for a great number of years. I agree with the hon. Gentleman that Governments of both parties have not given it the attention that it deserves. It has dropped from 23.3 per cent. of gross value added within the economy in 1997 to 12.6 per cent. in 2007. This is partly due to the rapid growth of other parts of the economy, particularly the service sector. In real terms, manufacturing over that same decade has grown from &pound;150.2 billion to &pound;157.7 billion. The recession has clearly hit manufacturing output severely: in quarter 1 of 2009, it was down by some 13.1 per cent. over the year. That has obviously had a devastating impact on employment. The trend in jobs in manufacturing has clearly been declining. In 1998, the figure was more than 4 million, but last year it was around 2.6 million, so obviously it has reduced. But that masks part of the good news, which is that industry has been increasing productivity. The productivity of UK industry has been one part of the success story.</p>
	<p pid="a.177.0/6">Manufacturing industry is having a torrid time at the moment. I want to look briefly at the current causes of that, which are pretty obvious. At the back of it all is the credit crunch, which has caused the recession. On the banks&mdash;bank lending and regulation&mdash;it is clear that our banking system was insufficiently regulated, particularly with regard to the separation between retail and investment banking. The result of that was a risk in the system that was simply unpriced. The banking crisis has thrown up a deeper-seated problem. With the few friends that I have left in the City, I have to be careful exactly what I say about this, but it seems that we have a structural and cultural problem, which is that the City has been seen as the place to go to make money. The way that the City has operated, with ever more complex financial products chasing each other round and being traded almost for the sake of being traded, means that our financial services industry has been inefficient in its primary task of providing capital for industry.</p>
	<p pid="a.177.0/7">There is an opportunity in this current crisis to reshape the way in which our financial services industry serves industry generally. Rather than its making complex trades in complex products that turn out to be understood by nobody and of value to very few, we need to get back to the simple task of providing capital for industry to invest for the future. The City needs to go back to being the servant of commerce and stop trying to be the master of speculation. The other effect is that that industry has taken our best brains. Many of our best human resources have gone into financial services, rather than into industry. That culture carries across into the spirit of creating entrepreneurs. Indeed, when I said that I was going into the hotel industry, I saw a brief flash of pained expression in my mother's face because I had not chosen to go to university or take up a profession&mdash;although she rapidly reversed her view after I was successful. There is a view in Britain that it is better to go to university or a profession rather than into engineering or manufacturing, or to be an entrepreneur. We really need to tackle that as well.</p>
	<p pid="a.177.0/8">We need to develop skills, but, as I have said, skills must to be appropriate and further and higher education must reflect the needs of industry. We also need management skills. I recently chaired a symposium of the banks in my part of the world to try to connect small companies with their bankers and deal with some of the problems. The interesting thing that the bankers said was, &quot;For goodness' sake, please can we have real-time, proper management information?&quot; The number of SMEs that cannot produce such information is extraordinary.</p>
	<p pid="a.177.0/9">We need to focus on research and development and investment and we must get across those good ideas that we have produced. We need a method by which we can invest in entrepreneurs. In my part of the world, small bits of money are invested directly in small companies&mdash;not granted&mdash;by the North Highland Regeneration Fund, which is helping to take small entrepreneurs to the next step. The hon. Member for Manchester, Central put his finger on a point that we need to address.</p>
	<p pid="a.177.0/10">Looking to the future, I believe that there is a real opportunity. The recession has been devastating, and of that there is no doubt. Unemployment is up, and many companies are barely holding on. I shall not refer to green shoots, but I hope that we are seeing the bottom. Our job must be to create out of that adversity the opportunity to structure the economy for the future.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-06-09a.179.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1631" speakername="Mark Prisk" colnum="179"  time="010:40:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090609/halltext/90609h0003.htm#09060973000524">
	<p pid="a.179.0/1">I welcome you to the Chair, Mr. Fraser. This is the first occasion on which you have chaired a debate in which I have participated, and it is good to see you in your place.</p>
	<p pid="a.179.0/2">I welcome the Minister to his place on this first occasion in his new role. He is the seventh or eighth Minister whom I have shadowed in the past few years. It is good to see him in his place, and I hope that he will last a little longer than some of his predecessors.</p>
	<p pid="a.179.0/3"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1501" name="Lindsay Hoyle">The hon. Member for Chorley (Mr. Hoyle)</phrase> has a long and distinguished track record in raising important issues concerning manufacturing. He speaks with great passion and verve, and rightly so. He raised a matter that other hon. Members also raised&mdash;the role of procurement. The debate has been useful and timely, and I commend all hon. Members who have contributed to it, including <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1850" name="David Drew">the hon. Member for Stroud (Mr. Drew)</phrase>, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1940" name="Peter Luff">the Member for Mid-Worcestershire (Peter Luff)</phrase> and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1705" name="Tony Lloyd">the hon. Member for Manchester, Central (Tony Lloyd)</phrase>, who was right to consider the way in which procurement can be used without going down the path of protectionism. I share that sentiment.</p>
	<p pid="a.179.0/4">As all the contributors to the debate said, manufacturing matters. It represents 13 per cent. of our gross domestic product, and generates more than half of our exports. It helps us to pay our way around the world. As my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Worcestershire said, last year we were still the sixth-largest manufacturer in the world. We can and should take pride in the quality and strengths of the businesses and the work force in this country. We should not be unduly negative, cautious, careful and aware of the threats and problems, and we should not write manufacturing off.</p>
	<p pid="a.179.0/5">Clearly, the sector has had problems. One million jobs have been lost during the past dozen years or so, even before the current recession. Since 1997, 10 per cent. of manufacturing businesses have closed. I hear from business and industry about a continuing and rising sense of frustration at the Government's policies as key investments go elsewhere. For example, last year Rolls-Royce chose to locate a new testing facility in Germany, not in Derby. It told me that that was largely because of its frustration at the Government's lack of support. One of its directors said:</p>
	<p pid="a.179.0/6" class="indent">&quot;The Germans value manufacturing. There is better productivity and they have a better education system. Government&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.179.0/7">here</p>
	<p pid="a.179.0/8" class="indent">&quot;has chosen not to be competitive. Britain has caused this industry to export its capabilities&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.179.0/9">Despite talk from Ministers, it is clear that industry is unimpressed by the Government's inaction.</p>
	<p pid="a.179.0/10">It has been clear since the fall of Lehman Brothers last September and the collapse of world markets last autumn that urgent action has been needed, particularly in introducing working capital into businesses, so last November my party&mdash;the Conservatives&mdash;set out a plan for a single, national loan guarantee scheme worth &pound;50 billion for all viable businesses, whatever their size and sector. It was easy to access, clear, and simple to understand, and it would underpin conventional bank lending. That is also why we are committed to cutting the main corporation tax rate from 28p to 25p by simplifying the tax system. We want to reverse the Chancellor's policy of raising the small company corporation tax rate from 20p to 22p. In that way, we can directly help manufacturers, large and small, to invest with confidence for the future. As several hon. Members said, we also need to consider skills in the sector. We are committed to cutting payroll costs for the smallest employers for at least six months. That is the sort of practical action that industry wants, and it is what my party intends to provide.</p>
	<p pid="a.179.0/11">All of us in politics must be clear about how manufacturing is changing, as the hon. Member for Manchester, Central pointed out. First, we must recognise how globalisation has led to international fragmentation of production. The production of component and parts is spread increasingly not throughout countries, but throughout continents. That creates opportunities and threats. On one hand, global sourcing gives our manufacturers the chance to cut costs and to be competitive. On the other, British firms have no choice but to be globally competitive in their specialisation simply to survive.</p>
	<p pid="a.179.0/12">The Government can help small manufacturers in the challenge of accessing global value chains&mdash;we debated that earlier&mdash;especially in emerging high-growth markets. To be fair, they recognise that need, particularly in areas such as India and China, but it is not clear whether their policies are working. Perhaps the Minister will tell us what progress is being made to help small manufacturers in emerging markets.</p>
	<p pid="a.179.0/13">The second challenge for public policy is the increasing importance of intangible assets, such as design, branding and software, and it is important to consider carefully how they can be encouraged. It may seem counter-intuitive that such intangibles should matter to manufacturers, but the difference between a key manufacturer and its competitor often lies in its know-how and creativity. Fortunately, we have great strengths in design, whether in computer games or luxury car brands. We should have confidence in our belief that we can build on those strengths. A crucial issue&mdash;it would be helpful if the Minister responded to this&mdash;is the Government's progress in protecting our intellectual property. Leading manufacturers cite intellectual property's critical role and their ability to maintain their position. Perhaps the Minister will tell us what the Government have done about that during the past six months.</p>
	<p pid="a.179.0/14">Perhaps a more pressing question that many manufacturers raise with me is the growing gap between schemes that the Government have announced and the money that businesses have received. There seems to be a gulf between Ministers' rhetoric and the reality in the business world. Instead of our plan for a single loan guarantee scheme, Ministers have launched a plethora of schemes, but have failed to make them work. We have the working capital scheme, the enterprise finance guarantee scheme, the capital for enterprise fund, the transition loan fund, the European Investment Bank's supported loan scheme for growing firms, the EIB-backed automotive industry loan scheme, and the &pound;1 billion non-EIB-backed automotive loan scheme. All have different rules and criteria. They have different forms and require different business data. The result is confusion for businesses, and failure to deliver in Whitehall.</p>
	<p pid="a.179.0/15">The capital for enterprise fund, for example, is worth &pound;75 million for expanding firms. It was launched in November, and we were told that it would invest from January, but in June reports from the Government suggested that nothing had been invested. Perhaps the Minister will confirm whether any business has received money and, if not, why not.</p>
	<p pid="a.179.0/16">The automotive assistance programme comprises two elements: a &pound;1.3 billion loan guarantee from the European Investment Bank, and a &pound;1 billion additional loan guarantee to help the car industry to develop low-carbon technologies. The programme was announced in January, when the French and German Governments had already delivered money to their car makers. Since then, Ministers have dithered and delayed in working out schemes and negotiating with companies. In February, <i>The Birmingham Post</i>, frustrated by the lack of progress, wrote an open and critical letter to the noble Lord Mandelson asking when Ministers would act. February went, and March came and went, but in April Ministers proudly announced a loan of &pound;340 million for Jaguar Land Rover and a &pound;370 million loan for Nissan. That was good news, but on <phrase class="date" code="2009-05-06">6 May</phrase> it became clear that the talks with Tata were slipping and struggling, and in danger of collapse. So here we are, five months on, and it is still unclear exactly what has happened to the money. Will the Minister tell us whether a British company has received funds under that programme? The German Government have delivered, and the French and Italian Governments have delivered. Why under our Government are British manufacturers the last to receive the help that they have been promised?</p>
	<p pid="a.179.0/17">The Prime Minister likes to talk about providing real help, and I suspect that he needs it at the moment, but he and his ministerial colleagues need to realise that talk is cheap. At the moment, their record is one of press releases, not practical action. It is a tale of dither and delay, of bold promises and then timid deeds. I have no doubt that Ministers wish to help, but my fear is that the gap between their rhetoric and the reality for businesses is one through which hundreds of manufacturers and thousands of workers could yet be lost.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-06-09a.186.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1718" speakername="Paul Beresford" colnum="186"  time="011:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090609/halltext/90609h0004.htm#09060973000534">
	<p pid="a.186.3/1">I thank my hon. Friend. He is right. In 1997, Surrey police received &pound;96 per head of population in Government grant. Twelve years later, in 2009, Surrey residents received &pound;93 per person in police grant. That is a real-terms reduction of 39&mdash;not quite 40&mdash;per cent.</p>
	<p pid="a.186.3/2">Surrey police force and the Surrey policy authority have reached their tipping point, and operational policing in Surrey can no longer be protected from the cumulative effects of more than a decade of underfunding, let alone any capping or re-billing. Last month, the former Home Secretary gave a commitment to maintain increased funding for the police grant, which she said would enable the Government at least to maintain police numbers. That may be true across the whole nation, but it is certainly not true in Surrey, and it will be even less true with capping, re-billing and the progressive annual tightening of the budget.</p>
	<p pid="a.186.3/3">Of course, there is an argument over the figures. Last year, the Secretary of State set out a net budget requirement increase of 4.82 per cent., but the actual increase in the net budget requirement was 3.82 per cent. This year, the increase in the precept levied by Surrey police was 4.89 per cent., but to my surprise, I discovered that the Department for Communities and Local Government claimed that the precept had risen by 7.07 per cent. The Department based that on a notional precept, and the idea of a notional precept is key.</p>
	<p pid="a.186.3/4">There is also an argument over reserves. Surrey police have reserves of &pound;9.4 million, much of which is clearly not available, because, technically, only general reserves are available for expenditure. Those reserves stand at &pound;5.6 million, or 2.6 per cent. of the budget, but HMIC and the Audit Commission insist that that be lifted to 3 per cent. That, too, will have an impact, on top of the capping and the re-billing expenditure.</p>
	<p pid="a.186.3/5">As someone who has, in the past, been involved in programmed expenditure cuts, I am abundantly aware of the fact that one of the worst effects of capping is that it is applied at the beginning of, or during, the financial year in question. That means that cuts in expenditure at a late stage in the financial year must compensate for the failure to achieve a full-year effect from the beginning of the financial year&mdash;in simple terms, the percentage cut must be higher to achieve the full-year effect.</p>
	<p pid="a.186.3/6">With the prospect of capping in mind, the authority began setting this year's budget in July 2008. The budget was carefully calculated and took account of the principles set out by the Secretary of State. The idea of a notional precept was raised, and Surrey police finance officials shared their concerns with lawyers from the Department for Communities and Local Government. The lawyers confirmed in writing that</p>
	<p pid="a.186.3/7" class="indent">&quot;there is no requirement on the Surrey police authority to calculate the notional level of Council Tax (based on the notional budget requirement) 2008/09 and Surrey police authority will set their budget requirement and their precept for 2009/10...in the normal way&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.186.3/8">To avoid capping and its effects, the authority carefully calculated the budget. Three days before setting the budget, the Department announced a notional 2008-09 budget and a notional band D council tax. That left the police authority with the threat of capping. Given that the cuts arising from capping were late and unplanned, they had an extra detrimental effect on the force.</p>
	<p pid="a.186.3/9">In the past financial year, the Surrey police work force was 4,229-strong. The continuing prospect of capping means that the authority must produce a progressive extrapolation of financial constraints, which produces a series of cuts as the Surrey police authority calculates its manpower for the years 2009-10 to 20012-13. That commences with the loss of 159 personnel this year, with a total loss of 373 personnel by the end of the process, and that is before designation and re-billing.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-06-09a.190.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1578" speakername="Ian Taylor" colnum="190"  time="011:19:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090609/halltext/90609h0005.htm#09060973000543">
	<p pid="a.190.2/1">It is an honour to serve under your chairmanship, Mr. Fraser, and a pleasure to follow my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1718" name="Paul Beresford">the Member for Mole Valley (Sir Paul Beresford)</phrase>. He initiated the debate but, as has already been pointed out, all Surrey MPs are very much alongside him. It takes quite a lot to pull all the Surrey MPs together on one issue, but today we are debating that issue, which is county-wide. The Government's attitude to Surrey police beggars belief. One of the best forces is being undermined, year by year, by the Government's funding formula.</p>
	<p pid="a.190.2/2">The force is being treated as a rural force but it is on the outskirts of London. As my hon. Friend said, its area is criss-crossed by major roads. Several times, it has had to respond to terrorist outbreaks at the airports on either side, at Heathrow and Gatwick. The county also suffers from trans-border crime, which crosses into it from London&mdash;and particularly into my constituency, which borders it. It suffers from a disparity of treatment between the Metropolitan police and the Surrey police force.</p>
	<p pid="a.190.2/3">Surrey Members with borders that are contiguous with London know that at the beginning of this decade some of their constituencies were covered by the Metropolitan police. That changed when the then Home Secretary agreed that Surrey would be properly respected. Its ordinary policemen and women are under a lot of pressure; they are trained in Surrey but are often attracted by higher wages and salaries to the capital. London, of course, is much better funded. I was one of those who supported Surrey having its own police force.</p>
	<p pid="a.190.2/4">I ask the Government to think carefully about a matter of equity. Given that council tax payers in Surrey contribute almost 50 per cent. of the cost of the Surrey police, it is incumbent on the Government to reconsider the formula. Given that the Surrey taxpayer contributes considerable sums to the country's overall tax revenues, and that we are helping to fund other parts of the country, it would be appropriate for us to be given slightly better treatment when it comes to the funding of the Surrey force. To make matters worse, we are being capped. As my hon. Friend so eloquently pointed out, capping yields little except disadvantage to people who live in Surrey. The effect is alarming. The cost of the refunding equates to 24 officers&mdash;at least two per borough in Surrey might need to be taken out.</p>
	<p pid="a.190.2/5">All Surrey Members could argue about the importance of their local police. For instance, two of my police stations are manned by volunteers. They provide an excellent service for the community, and they receive a lot of support from the officers; they, too, do a tremendous job. However, we may be losing the volunteers, in Cobham and elsewhere, despite the fact that they have provided an identifiable service to the public, reassuring the public that they are being protected.</p>
	<p pid="a.190.2/6">The other issue that Surrey police have to face, apart from the question of community and neighbourhood policing, is that occasional big events require them to keep financial reserves. The Government cannot decide that reserves should be raided to suit their political policies. They are necessary; incidents, including terrorist incidents, need a response, as do major crimes. For instance, some years ago Milly Dowler was murdered outside Walton station. The police investigation continues; in theory, it is still ongoing, but the inquiry continued for several years at virtually full strength, until the allegation was made that someone who is now behind bars for other reasons may have committed the crime.</p>
	<p pid="a.190.2/7">Surrey police need to respond to other issues, but that often requires them to make exceptional calls on reserves in order to meet the additional costs. In the past, when I and my colleagues have taken up cases, we have lobbied the Government for better treatment in order to balance the county's financial position. For instance, it sometimes has to respond to events at Heathrow&mdash;and not only terrorism: occasionally, misguided environmental protests require a lot of police attention, and security is a concern.</p>
	<p pid="a.190.2/8">We are looking for a sensible balance. First, we should avoid rebilling. That is the principal reason for today's debate. Secondly, we should reconsider how the funding formula works. In equity, it must be wrong to undermine progressively a force that has already made substantial cuts, year on year, and that will need to do so again. Thirdly, the Government should persuade the people of Surrey that they, the Government, understand that undermining a police force is not the way to improve people's sense of security.</p>
	<p pid="a.190.2/9">The Government have made a monumental misjudgment. It is a miscalculation, based on a theoretical precept, and it should be abandoned. Whether it should be abandoned after judicial review I shall not say, but it should certainly be withdrawn gracefully. The Surrey police force should be allowed to rebuild, to help the people of Surrey feel secure; they live on the edge of London and are already paying half the cost of the force.</p>

	<p pid="a.191.0/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1718" name="Paul Beresford">the Member for Mole Valley (Sir Paul Beresford)</phrase> on securing this debate. As we have heard, it is hard to herd Surrey MPs. The fact that we are all here shows our strength of feeling, and I hope that the Minister will take note of that.</p>
	<p pid="a.191.0/2">As time is short, I shall not say more on matters that were so eloquently mentioned by my hon. Friend. However, some key factors must be re-emphasised. Surrey police force is a county force with urban challenges; it borders two airports and some of the busiest motorways in London. Half of the crime there is committed by people from outside Surrey. Indeed, Lord West acknowledged criminals as</p>
	<p pid="a.191.0/3" class="indent">&quot;people doing 'away days' from London in order to redistribute wealth.&quot;&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="lords/2009-01-12.1012"><i>Official Report, House of Lords,</i> 12 January 2009; Vol. 706, c. 1012</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="a.191.0/4">The Audit Commission assessment states that there is no doubt that Surrey police have managed their affairs and finances excellently and that they give value for money of the highest grade, being one of only six forces that achieved that status in 2007-08. It has the lowest expenditure per band D property.</p>
	<p pid="a.191.0/5">Much of what Surrey police do is excellent, but with tight resources it is not always perfect. To a large extent, resourcing has been a continuing problem for the force, and it acknowledges that it cannot always give the service that it would like. Rightly, it is cutting 144 back-office jobs and replacing them with technology improvements to hold on to its front-line force, but it faces losing another 50 front-line jobs if the Government have their way.</p>
	<p pid="a.191.0/6">Policing in Guildford is not easy. We have a busy night-time economy, persistent crime in the large rural areas, and some serious antisocial behaviour, much of which involves criminal damage. Indeed, antisocial behaviour is often a euphemism for crime. There is terrible criminal damage; someone stole a saw and cut down trees on an estate; elderly residents are being terrorised and are afraid to go out in the evenings; and a local business woman could not cope with the police response to the number of racist and violent attacks on her staff and now employs her own private security. It is not good enough.</p>
	<p pid="a.191.0/7">Given the tight police budgets, with the best will in the world the police cannot respond as they want; they are angry and the public are frustrated. Too many kids are getting away with completely unacceptable behaviour. I cannot speak too highly of the community wardens, the police and community support officers and the neighbourhood specialist officers in Guildford. However, poor resources leave many areas badly wanting. The public are not getting the service that they deserve; it falls well short.</p>
	<p pid="a.191.0/8">I now give a quick plug to the Street Angels project in Guildford. Those not familiar with Street Angels should come to Guildford in the evening and watch. Set up by the churches in Guildford, they support the town police. Surrey police have been excellent in working with them, and we have seen a real drop in crime. None the less, it is difficult.</p>
	<p pid="a.191.0/9">I get very tired of having to listen to Ministers telling us what they are giving us. The truth is that in 1997 we were receiving &pound;96 per head; in 2009 we are getting &pound;93 per head. As a result, 50 per cent. of the funding comes from the council tax payer; elsewhere in the country, it is approximately 25 per cent. We in Surrey raise a lot of money for the Treasury, and we are not getting a good deal in return.</p>
	<p pid="a.191.0/10">This year, the situation is ridiculous. The Government rejected attempts by Surrey police to meet officials and Ministers. The Department for Communities and Local Government created the notional precept, and I know that the Surrey police force is considering taking legal action on that. Police officials raised the concept of a notional precept with the DCLG, but were reassured that they should set their budget as normal. Three days before the Surrey police authority set its budget, the Government wrote to say that they had not yet determined any capping principles. With officials refusing to talk to it, Surrey police authority had to set a budget in the dark.</p>
	<p pid="a.191.0/11">I hope that the Minister will respond to many of the arguments raised today. Everyone in Surrey, and Guildford in particular, wants their council tax bills to fall, but they also want to be safe. The police struggle, and the public are cross, fearful and not getting the service that they deserve. The Minister has it within his power to reconsider this matter before he lays the draft order. I hope that he does not come out with the usual platitudes. We have heard that the Prime Minister is very keen to listen to people, and I sincerely hope that the Minister will take this opportunity to listen to the people of Surrey.</p>

	<p pid="a.195.1/1">I have been a customer of my hon. Friend's service station&mdash;I hope that I did not add to the crime while I was there&mdash;which gives me the opportunity to mention my concern about motorway issues. In places, the constituency boundary goes down the middle of the carriageway. My constituency includes the busiest part of the M25, which is the busiest motorway in the United Kingdom. There has been no recognition of that or the fact that the Staines junction, junction 13, has the highest accident record of any junction on the whole of the M25&mdash;that was true the last time that I checked. The formula does not take into account the special case that arises there. The county force is expected to deliver the quality of service that everyone has a right to expect, when those involved in accidents on the M25 are not often residents of Surrey. It is very rare for a Surrey resident to be involved in such an accident, so our constituents have to pay the cost of other people's accidents, which is unreasonable.</p>
	<p pid="a.195.1/2">Let me pick up the point about cross-border crime. My hon. Friends have mentioned London. My constituency is caught in a pincer movement. I can tell when places such as Hounslow and Hammersmith and Fulham are having a purge on crime, because the M4 gets busy and crime rates go up in my constituency. People rush out of London, down the M4 and turn into my constituency and cause trouble. When we have dealt with that, the next thing we find is that Thames Valley police is having a purge in Slough, so the people of Slough get on the M4 and come rushing down to my constituency and cause mayhem from the other direction. Yet a rural county force is expected to deal with that without any special recognition, which is wrong.</p>
	<p pid="a.195.1/3">Plenty of people, including the Audit Commission, the inspectorate and my residents, say that Surrey has an excellent police force. Our constituents probably pay the greatest amount of tax of any county in England into the central Exchequer. We do not mind doing that, because it is only fair that wealthier areas should make a greater contribution. We understand that, but is it unreasonable to say that we should get a fair return from Government grant for our needs rather than just being used to provide money that is sent somewhere else?</p>

	<p pid="a.196.0/1">I was not intending to speak in this debate, but, as my hon. Friends have been admirably succinct, we have a little time left, so I should like to take the opportunity to make a short contribution. Unfortunately, I have to leave at 12 o'clock, and I apologise in advance for any discourtesy.</p>
	<p pid="a.196.0/2">My hon. Friends have set out very clearly the underlying pressures facing Surrey police. Surrey is a target-rich environment; there are many temptations for criminals and we have a proximity to a pool of crime, which is both organised and opportunistic, in the London conurbation. Surrey police have a small level of reserves, and I hope that the Minister will not suggest that the reserves should be raided to meet some of the pressures that the force is facing. We need those reserves to deal with unexpected events. My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1578" name="Ian Taylor">the Member for Esher and Walton (Mr. Taylor)</phrase> referred to the Milly Dowler case, which involved an extraordinary police operation costing millions of pounds. In my own constituency a few years earlier, we were unwilling hosts to an unwilling guest&mdash;the former President of the Chilean Republic, General Pinochet. That operation cost Surrey police well in excess of &pound;1 million. At the time, we were promised categorically that there would be no net cost to Surrey taxpayers, but the reimbursement from central Government never came close to meeting the full cost of that policing operation. It is for such reasons that forces have to maintain appropriate reserves.</p>
	<p pid="a.196.0/3">Let me dwell for a moment on process. While the points about the underlying funding and underfunding of Surrey police force have been well made, my concern about this particular issue relates to process. Having read the facts, I have to say that Franz Kafka would have been impressed by the way in which the Government convey&mdash;or, rather, do not convey&mdash;detailed information to precepting authorities to enable them to set a precept that will not fall foul of rules that have not been made at the time the precept is set. I should also like to address the question of the proportionality of the response. I hope that the Minister has some good news for us today. There will not be anyone in this country in the current environment who thinks that spending &pound;1.2 million of public money to return &pound;1.6 million to Surrey council tax payers is a sensible way to proceed. I suggest to the Minister that he is in danger of appearing to be pursuing an agenda of petty political vindictiveness rather than an agenda of common sense.</p>

	<p pid="a.196.2/1">I agree with my hon. Friend. I hope that it is not petty political vindictiveness. Let us explore whether it is a kind of institutional vindictiveness. By that I mean a sort of situation in which the centre cannot bear to be ignored or defied, even inadvertently, and has to slap back in a disproportionate response. I hope that the Minister&mdash;whether or not he is prepared to say so today&mdash;will privately reflect on a situation in which such a disproportionate response is mandated by the system.</p>

	<p pid="a.197.1/1">My hon. Friend is absolutely right that such a review would pile insult on to injury. Instead of &pound;1.2 million to deal with a &pound;1.6 million over-billing, we may be talking about a situation in which the total bill has climbed beyond &pound;1.6 million. Although I do not think that anyone on the Conservative Benches would argue that there does not need to be a solution to the over-billing that has taken place, there is an objection to a cap and re-bill proposal that will cost at least &pound;1.2 million.</p>
	<p pid="a.197.1/2">I suggest to the Minister that he should use two tests when deciding whether to proceed down this route. First, will it satisfy those who are supposed to be the beneficiaries&mdash;those who are supposed to be protected by it, and band E council tax payers who will receive a &pound;3 reduction in their annual council tax bill and will have to use up a significant proportion of it setting up a new direct debit or standing order? I suggest to him that it will not.</p>
	<p pid="a.197.1/3">Secondly, will it satisfy what has famously been described as the court of public opinion on the common-sense test? Will the taxpayers of this country at large think that this was a sensible and proportionate intervention by the Government? Clearly they will not. I suggest to the Minister that he will greatly enhance his own reputation if he can intervene in this matter. He should act with common sense in the present case and discuss with his colleagues a way forward for the future&mdash;if there is a future for them&mdash;in which clear guidance is set out in a timely fashion. That would help to ensure that no other authority, police, local or otherwise, ever finds itself in a situation of over-billing as a consequence of not clearly understanding the baseline against which it should be working and the capping guidelines that the Government of the day wish to impose. In that way, we would have clear information and a pragmatic response when something goes wrong.</p>
	<p pid="a.197.1/4">I hope that despite the Conservatives' concerns, the Minister will engage in the debate in a spirit of common sense to find a solution that satisfies the needs to spend public money carefully and wisely and to protect the taxpayers of Surrey, and also protects the services that Surrey police wish to continue delivering to their citizens and our constituents. Those people certainly hope that the services continue to be provided for them.</p>

	<p pid="a.198.1/1">I am sure that it was a very important minute and I sincerely apologise.</p>
	<p pid="a.198.1/2">The problems with capping have been characterised perfectly clearly in the debate. The hon. Gentleman spoke about the cost of police jobs and the impact on the local area, the potential impacts on the budget for many years to come, and the nonsense of the Government expecting a police authority to eat into its own reserves. A number of hon. Members explained that that is like using a hammer to crack a nut. It is a ridiculous situation: budgets are set on a notional basis and it is if local authorities are working out what they are supposed to be doing entirely in shadow. We have notional budgets, caps and council tax levels, and nobody knows what they are supposed to be doing until well after they have set the budget.</p>
	<p pid="a.198.1/3">It is telling that so many of Surrey's MPs are here to speak in favour of their police authority. My understanding is that local Liberal Democrats have been supporting the police authority in this action, so the Labour party is rather on its own.</p>
	<p pid="a.198.1/4">The problem is that capping comes right at the end of the process&mdash;police and local authorities have already gone through the process of setting their budgets when a cap is imposed. They will have gone through the process of different departments deciding their spending priorities, and anyone who is on a fixed-term contract knows that they have a contract. Then, right at the end of the process, the Government threaten to slap a cap on the authority and expect it to somehow remove a large sum from its budget, which undermines the whole planning process.</p>
	<p pid="a.198.1/5">It is as if we go through a macho charade once a year. The Government refuse to tell local authorities what the cap is and what they are expected to do, and the authorities are supposed somehow to work it out by some process of osmosis or telepathy. When they get it wrong, the Government take draconian action that inevitably results in council tax payers picking up the cost of re-billing, either in future budget cuts or directly. The long-term result is that the relationship between central and local government is utterly undermined.</p>

	<p pid="a.200.4/1">It is certainly vindictive, but I am not sure that I give the Government credit for that much thought. I suspect that the process is much more random than that. I think that they merely pick a couple of random councils to make public scapegoats of so that they can claim to have some authority over local authorities.</p>
	<p pid="a.200.4/2">The fundamental problem, as the Minister well knows, is that council tax is a deeply unpopular tax. That is why the Government need to wave their big sticks around when it comes to Budget-setting time&mdash;in order to demonstrate that they are doing something about council tax. We all know that council tax rises are above inflation every single year. The tax is felt keenly, particularly by the low-paid, because they know that it is unfair. It is not based on their ability to pay or even on the price of their house. It bears no relationship to whether they own their property and is based on a notional value that is decades out of date. Until the Government are prepared to grasp the whole of local government finance, introduce a system of local taxation based on people's income and ability to pay and devolve power and finance-raising down to local authorities in a serious way, I am afraid that we will go through the same charade every year. It is deeply depressing.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-06-09a.209.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1704" speakername="Graham Stringer" colnum="209"  time="012:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090609/halltext/90609h0008.htm#09060973000616">
	<p pid="a.209.1/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2008-04-23">23 April 2008</phrase>, the Select Committee on Innovation, Universities, Science and Skills published its report on science budget allocations. During the course of the Committee's inquiry, we received a number of representations from different scientific bodies about the decision of the Science and Technology Facilities Council to reduce the budget allocation for ground-based solar terrestrial physics to zero. We received evidence from UK Solar Physics research and from the British Academy, but the clearest evidence that we received was from the British Antarctic Survey.</p>
	<p pid="a.209.1/2">I shall quote two parts of the British Antarctic Survey's evidence, in which it makes a case for not cutting the budget in relation to solar terrestrial physics:</p>
	<p pid="a.209.1/3" class="indent">&quot;Sun-climate links: researchers are becoming increasingly aware of links between solar variability and the earth's climate. It is critical that we establish the relative importance of solar-induced effects on climate change so we can predict more accurately the man-made influences on climate. The InterGovernmental Panel on Climate Change reported that the current level of understanding is very low and Sir Keith O'Nions in recent evidence to the Public Accounts committee about the Halley research station in Antarctica asserted that the 'physics of the upper atmosphere there will be a very key part of climate change'.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.209.1/4">It is therefore an odd decision to cut the budget.</p>
	<p pid="a.209.1/5">More importantly for the case I want to make, the British Antarctic Survey stated:</p>
	<p pid="a.209.1/6" class="indent">&quot;Space weather: solar variability has a very strong influence on the near-earth space environment, including large transient increases in the amount of radiation there. Such space weather events are frequent but intermittent and of varying severity, the prediction of which is an ultimate goal of STP research. They can lead to temporary loss of service from satellites, or even the complete loss of satellites worth about $300 million each. More than half of all space insurance is done through London and is worth $500 million per year.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.209.1/7">The Committee went on to make a case for fewer cuts to the budget. The work had not been done, so we could not have known that a month later&mdash;on May 22-23&mdash;a meeting was held under the auspices of the Space Studies Board about the societal and economic impacts of severe space weather events. Such work comes under the national academies in the United States, which had been called together to discuss the impact of severe space weather. I have heard that National Aeronautics and Space Administration funded the project because it was concerned about the matter. NASA was particularly concerned about what became known as the Halloween storms, which took place in autumn 2003, when there was a large space storm and transformer problems in Sweden. Commercial airline flights were moved away from the Arctic region and the level at which commercial airlines were flying had to be lowered. The advanced earth observing satellite II has not been heard of since; it was damaged beyond repair after that space storm.</p>
	<p pid="a.209.1/8">At this point, it is worth discussing the definition of space storms, what the likely future impacts might be and how that should be reflected in the Government's response. Space storms are associated with sun spots&mdash;a cooling of the sun's surface&mdash;which are caused by bursts of magnetic knots from the interior of the sun. Associated with space storms are coronal mass ejections, which are essentially billions of tonnes of plasma composed of protons and electrons that hurl very quickly towards the earth. Coronal mass ejections travel at varying speeds depending on how big and concentrated they are, but they can travel up to 1,500 miles a second. They can travel at a considerable speed and they seem to happen every 11, 12 or 13 years.</p>
	<p pid="a.209.1/9">The largest such event was known as the Carrington event, which took place just under 150 years ago. The size of that event has since been studied and it turned out to be four times larger than any of the recently measured solar weather events. Richard Carrington was a British scientist and astronomer who first worked out the relationship between sun spot activity and the magnetic phenomena in the earth's atmosphere, such as the aurora borealis, the aurora australis and St. Elmo's fire, which sailors have known about for years. Richard Carrington worked out that such atmospheric magnetic events were related to what was happening on the sun.</p>
	<p pid="a.209.1/10">The 2003 event&mdash;and to a lesser extent the 1989 event, in which 9 million people in Quebec lost power&mdash;meant that the body that works with the national academies in the States sat down and discussed what was happening. I know that anyone who talks about space, cataclysmic events and potential disasters is not likely to be taken too seriously, but I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister will take the matter seriously. If there were a large solar storm of the strength of Carrington&mdash;there is no reason to believe that the event of 150 years ago was as large as space storms can get&mdash;there would not only be serious consequences for western society, but all societies that are dependent on current technologies.</p>
	<p pid="a.209.1/11">There are particular concerns that the magnetic impact of these storms would cause induced currents in step-up and step-down transformers. Direct current would be induced in systems that are meant to deal with alternating currents, which would saturate the magnets at the core of the transformers and melt the copper wire. Such a proposition is not theoretical; it is what happened in Quebec in 1989. The current systems are more vulnerable because, for greater efficiency, modern grids operate at ever higher voltages&mdash;for example, the Chinese have recently put in voltage systems that operate at 1,000 V.</p>
	<p pid="a.209.1/12">When the relevant bodies looked at the situation, they worked out what the impact would be in north America and China. They also said that the inter-dependability of the grids in Europe meant that we could have a serious catastrophe in Europe. For north America, they estimated that within 90 seconds of one of these events, 300 key transformers could go down, affecting 130 million people. The impacts are obvious to anyone who thinks about it: water that needs to be pumped up multi-storey buildings would stop; trains would stop; the underground would stop; and, because we live in a just-in-time society, a lot of industry would stop. It would be very difficult after a few days to get petrol to petrol stations, the back-up generators for hospitals could fail, and we would be in a serious situation.</p>
	<p pid="a.209.1/13">There have been attempts to estimate the number of back-up transformers, but there are very few. In any case, there are not many crews available to put in new transformers. Nuclear power stations would shut down if the grid went down. The Committee estimated that a Carrington-type event would have 10 times the impact on the United States of the Katrina hurricane a few years ago and would cost that country $2 trillion. That is a large figure, and consequences could be dire.</p>
	<p pid="a.209.1/14">When I tabled a parliamentary question, I was told that the Government were aware of the matter and that contingency plans were in place. I would be interested to know the answer to a question about timing. Again, this is covered in the National Academies report. Much of the information about the timing and prediction of such events comes from the ACE satellite&mdash;the advanced composition explorer&mdash;which can get information to us in about 15 to 30 minutes. However, if the plasma were travelling as fast as it is estimated that it travelled 150 years ago, it would get here in 12 minutes, so the advanced warning would not arrive in time. The other satellite that can provide such information&mdash;it was damaged in the last solar storm in 2003&mdash;is SOHO, or the solar and heliospheric observatory. It, too, would have difficulty getting the information to us in time.</p>
	<p pid="a.209.1/15">There have to be particular circumstances for a Carrington event to happen. Solar winds and ejections of plasma happen from time to time, but the most difficult events involve plasma directed straight at the earth. In 2003, the largest ejection just missed the earth. The plasma has to be travelling very quickly, it has to be dense and intense, and finally&mdash;this is quite important&mdash;its polarity has to be the opposite of the earth's polarity. If it is the same, it just slips past the earth. It is like the difference between a knife going through water and an explosion in water. If plasma with an opposite polarity were to hit the earth's atmosphere, it would cause many problems.</p>
	<p pid="a.209.1/16">Given that there is no evidence that the current events are as large as they could get, and given the estimates that a large event could have serious consequences, I have two or three questions to ask the Minister. First, was it wise to cut the money going to ground-based solar-terrestrial physics, when one of the objectives is to understand the signs better and to predict events? Secondly, does the Minister agree with the National Academies estimates that the fastest of such storms are not predictable, and, therefore, that it would not be possible to take generators out of the system to protect them, and that we are vulnerable? The consequent question is, if something like that were to happen, are contingency plans in place for transformers and emergency services that go beyond the normal emergency plans that we have in place in this country? I look forward with interest to my hon. Friend's reply.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-06-09a.212.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1681" speakername="Joan Ruddock" colnum="212"  time="012:44:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090609/halltext/90609h0009.htm#09060973000619">
	<p pid="a.212.1/1">I will certainly look at that and make the specific connection that my hon. Friend just made.</p>
	<p pid="a.212.1/2">The procedures that National Grid and other utilities have in place for reacting to a major solar flare include steps to increase the generation reserves that can improve voltage levels across the network, and possibly switching out certain transformers at the edge of the network if sufficient information is available to give confidence in the route that the electrical currents caused by the solar storm will take.</p>
	<p pid="a.212.1/3">My hon. Friend asked whether I agree that the fastest storms would not predictable. It is a fact that, if something occurs at a speed that we are not able to pick up in the networks that already exist&mdash;in the satellite messaging systems that we depend on&mdash;we would be taken by surprise. Generally, however, through satellites, we are certainly getting information within a reasonable time frame. All transformers connected to the national grid transmission network since 1999 have been designed to eliminate the risk of damage presented by solar storms. That answers my hon. Friend's question about more modern facilities with higher voltages. Protection has been built in and there is an acceptance that, as voltages have increased, there is a need to introduce appropriate safeguards.</p>
	<p pid="a.212.1/4">Of course, a wide range of incidents and emergencies might have an impact on all or significant parts of the UK. The national risk register, published in March 2008, sets out the Government's assessment of the likelihood and impact of a range of different risks that may directly affect the UK over the next five years, including accidents such as major fires or technical failures, natural events, including severe weather and flooding, and particularly the threat of international terrorism. Comprehensive plans are in place for handling both a complete national outage of electricity supplies, which, of course, has never occurred, I am glad to say, and regional outages. Although solar storms are not included specifically in the national risk register, the resilience measures in place to deal with the risks I have mentioned would be equally applicable to the effects of solar storms.</p>
	<p pid="a.212.1/5">As my hon. Friend said, solar storms approximately follow an 11-year cycle and are thought to be related to changes in the sun's magnetic field. We are in a quiet phase at present and the latest information from NASA is that the next peak is likely during mid 2013. My hon. Friend hoped that I would take this matter seriously. Indeed, the Government do take it seriously. Solar storms are known to be capable of damaging electricity transmission networks on earth and this has happened, as he said, in both Canada and Sweden. The most significant event occurred on <phrase class="date" code="1989-03-13">13 March 1989</phrase>, when a severe storm caused the collapse of the Canadian Hydro-Qu&eacute;bec power grid in a matter of seconds. As he said, millions of people were left without power for nine hours, with significant economic loss. In the UK, there have been at least four peak cycles of solar storms during the existence of modern high-voltage transmission networks. Generally, these have caused no problems, although in 1989 two transformers suffered damage: one in East Anglia and one in the west country. However, in both cases, the impact was limited to the locality.</p>
	<p pid="a.212.1/6">I am glad to say that the UK is not at a particularly high risk of disruption from solar storms, as we are a good way south of the magnetic north pole. The history of extreme solar weather events and the science indicate that the risk of a major impact in the UK is very low. Although the UK may not be completely immune from the impact of solar storms, it is extremely unlikely that we would suffer widespread damage. The damage that could occur is therefore small and well within the scope of the resilience and contingency planning that we have in place to deal with terrestrial weather events and other risks that could impact on the electricity networks.</p>
	<p pid="a.212.1/7">The main risk to electricity supplies during a severe solar storm is that one or more transformers at the edge of the network could be damaged, which would cause a localised loss of supply if the capacity of remaining transformers could not deliver all the demand for electricity in that area. Generally, a damaged transformer can be replaced within about two weeks and it is often possible to take other measures to restore supplies much quicker than that, including an early return to service of equipment being maintained or the re-routing of supplies from a different location.</p>
	<p pid="a.212.1/8">The highest risk areas of the UK are the west country and parts of Scotland, due to the granite rock formation of the ground in those parts. That type of ground is particularly susceptible to electrical currents, so the geomagnetically induced currents caused by the solar storm are therefore more likely to find a path through the electricity networks. That is more likely to happen because of the terrain in those areas.</p>
	<p pid="a.212.1/9">A severe solar storm can also depress the overall voltage of the transmission network by a few per cent. However, that is unlikely to cause damage or disruption and defence measures can be taken to reduce the risk even further. For example, National Grid may be able to increase the number of electricity generators on the network to help support the voltage.</p>
	<p pid="a.212.1/10">These impacts are comparable to the risks faced by the transmission networks in day-to-day operation, for example, by the breakdown of generation or transmission equipment or through the terrestrial weather events that I mentioned earlier. The ability to cope with such events and minimise their impact is built into the design of the networks, operating procedures and the resilience measures available to the grid operators. Emergency planning arrangements are also in place to cover significant and unexpected events.</p>
	<p pid="a.212.1/11">I am grateful to my hon. Friend for raising this important issue. The Department of Energy and Climate Change maintains its capacity to lead the response to energy emergencies and incidents. That means planning, training and exercising alongside those likely to have a stake in a potential crisis. That includes the energy sector, together with local, regional and devolved Administrations, as well as other Departments and agencies whose interests may be affected and whose assistance would be needed.</p>
	<p pid="a.212.1/12">Although there are clearly uncertainties about the impact of a major solar storm, experience to date indicates that the UK is not unduly exposed to such events and, in the worst case, it could be expected that any interruption to electricity supplies would be localised and of relatively short duration. However, as my hon. Friend implied, there is no absolute certainty in this regard. There is clearly a need for continuing scientific research. We cannot be certain: although we have seen events of a certain nature and events for which we could make reasonable predictions, and although we have in place a significant range of measures that are capable of coping with and, to some degree, mitigating the potential effects on our electricity networks, none the less we need to keep such matters under review. The Department needs to be constantly appraised of, and must follow, developments in science.</p>
	<p pid="a.212.1/13">The resilience and defensive measures that network owners take to protect against terrestrial weather events are equally applicable in dealing with solar storms. Where specific measures are appropriate, such as the development of reliable early warning systems, work is in hand to improve our understanding. I am confident that we can, as a country, cope within the range of what we know has happened in other parts of world and in this country, and which may happen here in future.</p>
	<p pid="a.212.1/14">Some hon. Members may be concerned about the Olympics&mdash;a major event in this country&mdash;which could conceivably be affected if such a storm were to happen, but I say to my hon. Friend, although he did not raise this issue, that we have considered that and we expect that all the measures that I have described to be in place and to be appropriate. We have contingency arrangements for that major national event. However, we are not complacent on these issues. Once again, I thank my hon. Friend for raising an important matter in this debate.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-06-09a.225.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1807" speakername="John Grogan" colnum="225"  time="013:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090609/halltext/90609h0010.htm#09060973000629">
	<p pid="a.225.1/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend the Minister on his appointment, which is richly deserved. I was rather surprised myself this morning when my office told me that the man from No. 10 had been on the phone. In fact it was the man from No. 10 in a particular road in my constituency, who wanted to talk to me about his long-standing drainage problems.</p>
	<p pid="a.225.1/2">The idea for this debate originated in parliamentary discussions I chaired earlier this year, under the banner of the Inter-Parliamentary Union, with a visiting delegation from the United Arab Emirates. I am delighted that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1699" name="Nicholas Winterton">the hon. Member for Macclesfield (Sir Nicholas Winterton)</phrase> is present today, because he took a big part in the discussions, which lasted two or three hours and were very fruitful. Subsequently I received an invitation from the Speaker of the Federal National Council to visit the United Arab Emirates and have further discussions. My accommodation was paid for during that visit by the Mashreq bank and I have made the necessary declarations in the Register of Members' Interests.</p>
	<p pid="a.225.1/3">During those parliamentary discussions, we ranged over a large number of different topics. The historical links between our two nations are of course very close. Today 120,000 British nationals live and work in the United Arab Emirates. I am told that there are about 1 million British visitors a year. There are very many business links. Obviously, Barclays bank is much in the news at the moment. Those business interests have expanded from the oil and energy sectors to the finance sector in recent years. There are many sporting and cultural links. For example, the main English language newspaper in the Gulf is edited by a former editor of <i>The Daily Telegraph</i> and citizens of Abu Dhabi have a particular interest in the Manchester City's results. Equally, our defence interests are strong. Our defence co-operation agreement represents the UK's largest defence commitment outside NATO. The UAE is our largest export market in the middle east for non-military goods.</p>
	<p pid="a.225.1/4">I could have concentrated my remarks on any of those aspects of our relations, but I decided to focus the debate on the issue of the islands of Abu Musa and the Greater and Lesser Tunbs. The delegation from the Federal National Council was keen to impress on the UK Parliament the importance of the islands and the part that they play in political debate in both the United Arab Emirates and the wider Gulf. I checked up, and the last time the issue was raised in the House was when Edward Heath was Prime Minister in 1971. It was in that debate of December 1971 that figures such as Sir Alec Douglas-Home, the Foreign Secretary at that stage, Jeremy Thorpe and Roy Hattersley all gave the House the benefit of their opinions. Having researched some of the history, I decided that it was about time that the subject got another little airing; so this is the story.</p>
	<p pid="a.225.1/5">Abu Musa, the Greater Tunb and the Lesser Tunb are three small but strategic islands located along the narrow route through the Gulf into the straits of Hormuz and out into the gulf of Oman. Much of the Gulf's oil exports and its non-oil imports pass along that route, as do naval vessels entering and exiting the Gulf. Indeed, a fifth of the world's oil supplies pass through the straits of Hormuz. About 15 million barrels per day, equivalent to Europe's daily consumption, pass through the mouth of the Gulf in tankers that must slow down to navigate a hairpin turn in waters 35 miles wide at the straits' narrowest point. In addition, a number of the Gulf's offshore oil and gas fields are located in the vicinity.</p>
	<p pid="a.225.1/6">In the early to mid-18th century, the three islands were used on a seasonal basis by Arab tribes dependent on, and loyal to, the Qawasin, a clan based in Ras al-Khaimah. The islands were a source of fresh water and refuge from bad weather and political trouble&mdash;a sort of Chequers in the Gulf, really. The Abu Musa island is only 12 sq km. Abu Musa is the name of both a town and an island. It has a population of around 500, and is notable for its golden sandy beaches. The nearby Greater and Lesser Tunbs derive their title from the word &quot;Tunb&quot;, which is an Arab word meaning a long rope used to erect a tent. The Greater Tunb has a surface area of 10 sq km and is known for its red soil. The Lesser Tunb has a surface area of 2 sq km and is uninhabitable.</p>
	<p pid="a.225.1/7">There is, inevitably, a complex story to be told in the region, but in essence it appears that successive UK Governments unequivocally endorsed the claims of Sharjah and Ras al-Khaimah to Abu Musa and the two Tunbs respectively while those kingdoms were under British protection in terms of the 1892 treaties with the Trucial States. Iran did not accept those claims. However, following the decision in 1968 to withdraw British forces from the Gulf, while formally upholding the &quot;Arab claims&quot;, successive UK Governments in practice focused on trying to achieve a peaceful, compromise resolution of the territorial disputes as part of Britain's legacy.</p>
	<p pid="a.225.1/8">Once Iran knew that Britain was departing it made a variety of claims, all the more forcefully, for a variety of territories in the Gulf. For example, the Government of Iran put forward a claim for the whole of the island of Bahrain. In the wake of a referendum on Bahrain under United Nations supervision, Iran was obliged to abandon its claim. It promptly revived its dormant claim to Abu Musa and the Greater and Lesser Tunbs. Ultimately, the then Conservative Government were unable to secure a deal for all three islands in 1971. That proved achievable only with regard to Abu Musa. Iran and Sharjah agreed to a joint administration of Abu Musa, without prejudice to their competing territorial claims. The late Sheikh Khalid Mohammed, who was the ruler of Sharjah at that time, said:</p>
	<p pid="a.225.1/9" class="indent">&quot;I had spent about two years collecting documents proving that the island is Arab territory, and that it belongs to Sharjah. I had asked a team of jurists to prepare legal documents and papers. These were presented to the Iranian Government. However, the logic of force and threat allowed no room for reason and legitimate proofs...Several factors contributed to the delicacy of the situation, combining to form significant pressure...Thus, after consultations with brothers, I deemed it appropriate to seek a formula that would freeze the problem politically, while dealing with it economically. Hence came the said agreement.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.225.1/10">Iran then seized Greater and Lesser Tunbs by an amphibious assault using hovercraft in the very last hours of the British protectorate and just before the coming into existence of the United Arab Emirates. One Arab policeman and three Iranians were killed. Richard Mobley, in an interesting article in <i>Naval War College Review </i>in autumn 2003, said of the period leading to the creation of the United Arab Emirates that</p>
	<p pid="a.225.1/11" class="indent">&quot;the United Kingdom, on behalf of the emirates of Sharjah and Ras Al Khaimah, asserted that all three islands were Arab territory. London explicitly backed Sharjah's claim to Abu Musa and Ras Al Khaimah's claim to the Tunbs. With its security obligations scheduled to lapse by the end of 1971, however, Great Britain attempted to resolve the islands dispute while fostering the creation of the new United Arab Emirates.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.225.1/12">I now want to make a brief reference to the exchanges in the House that I have referred to already, which followed the invasion of the Tunbs in December 1971. Sir Alec Douglas-Home stated on 6<sup>( )</sup>December:</p>
	<p pid="a.225.1/13" class="indent">&quot;Once the decision to withdraw our forces from the Gulf and to end our special treaty relationships with the Gulf States was taken, it was inevitable that these long dormant disputes would come into the open. Our aim has therefore been to settle these issues where possible, so that they would not drag on, generating suspicion and hostility in the future.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.225.1/14">Jeremy Thorpe then asked a question. He said that</p>
	<p pid="a.225.1/15" class="indent">&quot;when the Tunbs were invaded we were still under treaty obligations to Sharjah. As a result of that, is it our intention to use our good offices between the Sheikh of Sharjah and the Shah of Iran to bring about some amicable settlement? Does he accept that we have continuing political obligation in that connection?&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.225.1/16">Roy Hattersley then spoke:</p>
	<p pid="a.225.1/17" class="indent">&quot;The right hon. Gentleman&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.225.1/18">the then Secretary of State&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.225.1/19" class="indent">&quot;said that so far as the sovereignty of the Tunbs and Abu Musa is concerned the issue remains open. Is that the view of the Government of Iran or is it the Foreign Secretary's view?&quot;&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="debates/1971-12-06.944"><i>Official Report</i>, 6 December 1971; Vol. 827, cc. 944</phrase> to 949.]</p>
	<p pid="a.225.1/20">What happened next? Diplomatic relations were established between Iran and the United Arab Emirates in October 1972. On <phrase class="date" code="1972-10-05">5 October 1972</phrase>, a statement was read to the 27th session of the General Assembly of the United Nations in which the UAE reaffirmed its sovereignty over the islands. A similar statement was read out before the Security Council on <phrase class="date" code="1974-02-20">20 February 1974</phrase>; and a third statement was read to the UN Special Political Committee on <phrase class="date" code="1974-11-19">19 November 1974</phrase>. In 1980, the UAE joined five other nations to form the GCC&mdash;the Gulf Co-operation Council.</p>
	<p pid="a.225.1/21">Throughout the 1980s, the dispute over the islands was overshadowed by the Iran-Iraq War. The Iranians began encroaching beyond the assigned area for their presence in Abu Musa by constructing roads and an airport, and other civilian and military installations. In 1987, they moved troops to the southern side of Abu Musa. In late 1991, Iran imposed restrictions on third-party citizens wishing to enter the UAE zone of Abu Musa by requiring entry permits. The UAE rejected that measure, so in April 1992, Iran ordered all foreigners off the island. Those foreigners ran the UAE-sponsored school, medical clinic and power-generating station. Iran took full control of the island.</p>
	<p pid="a.225.1/22">After the UAE had taken the matter to the GCC in September 1992, Iran declared full sovereignty over the islands. However, the dispute was temporarily resolved when Iran and Sharjah agreed to abide by the 1971 agreement. When Iraq made threatening moves towards Kuwait in October 1994, Iran increased its military presence on Abu Musa. When the crisis subsided, Iranian troops remained on the island and surface-to-air missiles and anti-ship missiles were deployed. American Secretary of State for Defence Perry noted that Iran had deployed chemical weapons in the Gulf, particularly on Abu Musa.</p>

	<p pid="a.228.0/1">I congratulate the hon. Gentleman on securing this debate, which is critical and on a matter of great principle. He referred to the distinguished UAE delegation that visited the United Kingdom earlier this year, and to our discussions about the three disputed islands. Does he believe that the islands belong to the Arabs, and that the United Kingdom Government should make it extremely clear to the Governments of the UAE that we will support them in every possible way in seeking about to bring a peaceful conclusion?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-06-09a.228.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1807" speakername="John Grogan" colnum="228"  time="013:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090609/halltext/90609h0011.htm#09060973000631">
	<p pid="a.228.1/1">As always, the hon. Gentleman cuts to the quick. Having studied their history, I agree that the UAE has a strong case for claiming the islands. If the hon. Gentleman bears with me, I shall suggest a way forward in my closing remarks.</p>
	<p pid="a.228.1/2">Tensions between Iran and its Arab neighbours have a long history. Despite that, however, there are many modern-day ties between the UAE and Iran. For example, the UAE is Iran's main trade partner. The director general of the trade planning office of Iran's trade development organisation has said that Iran's exports to the UAE have been on the rise, with an average growth rate of 27.8 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="a.228.1/3">Earlier this month, the Prime Minister of the United Arab Emirates hailed the advancing trade ties between Iran and the UAE, saying that said the two sides enjoyed &quot;deep-rooted and amicable relations&quot;. He reiterated that the UAE will never interfere in the internal affairs of other countries, particularly Iran, and said that he always stresses the importance of improving ties with all countries. He expressed hope that the middle east would be free from weapons of mass destruction but supported Iran's peaceful use of nuclear power for energy.</p>
	<p pid="a.228.1/4">Sheikh Mohammed said that disputes</p>
	<p pid="a.228.1/5" class="indent">&quot;over national borders have never prevented trade and human exchange&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.228.1/6">He also said:</p>
	<p pid="a.228.1/7" class="indent">&quot;Trade relations between any two nations always lead to better relations and facilitate the resolution of conflicts.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.228.1/8">The commentator Hassan al-Alkin put it another way. He noted that the UAE</p>
	<p pid="a.228.1/9" class="indent">&quot;has pursued a policy of peace co-existence with Iran, hoping that the development of good relations would inevitably lead to the settlement of contentious problems.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.228.1/10">On <phrase class="date" code="2009-05-23">23 May 2009</phrase>, the Minister of State for Foreign Affairs, Anwar Mohammed Gargash, gave more detail on the approach of the UAE to the three disputed islands. He said that his country wants to resolve the issue through direct talks or international arbitration. At a side-meeting of the Organisation of the Islamic Conference in Damascus, Gargash said:</p>
	<p pid="a.228.1/11" class="indent">&quot;The Emirates want to resolve the occupied islands problem with neighbouring Iran&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.228.1/12">He continued:</p>
	<p pid="a.228.1/13" class="indent">&quot;Unfortunately despite the passage of more than three decades I cannot remember there having been any positive issues in that respect&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.228.1/14">In recent times, there have been a number of statements of support from the international community in favour of referring the issue to the International Court of Justice at The Hague, in accordance with article 33 of the charter of the United Nations and article 36 of the statute of the International Court of Justice. Not surprisingly, the Gulf Co-operation Council countries&mdash;including Kuwait, Oman, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and Qatar&mdash;have repeatedly backed the UAE, which is an approach that I endorse. However, there has been wider support.</p>
	<p pid="a.228.1/15">In April 2009, the EU and GCC reiterated their support in a joint communiqu&eacute; for a peaceful settlement of the dispute in accordance with international law through direct negotiations between the parties or by referring the matter to International Court of Justice. In January 2009, the Speakers of the Italian and Turkish Parliaments spoke on the matter. The Speaker of the Italian Parliament said that Abu Musa and the Greater and Lesser Tunbs belong to the UAE and that diplomacy is the way to restore them. The Speaker of the Turkish Parliament said that he would speak to the Speaker of the Iranian Parliament, urging the country to speed up the resolution of the dispute. Last year, the US deputy assistant Defence Secretary for middle eastern affairs, Christopher Straub, supported the UAE's claim over the islands, accusing Iran of exercising hegemonic behaviour in the region.</p>
	<p pid="a.228.1/16">In recent years, the UAE has painstakingly set out its legal and historical case for sovereignty over the three islands. It points to a clear British recognition of that claim during the protection of the Trucial states. It notes the protestation to Britain by the then rulers of the two Emirates against Iranian violations of its sovereignty. The two Emirates exercised all aspects of sovereignty over the islands before the Iranian invasion, including levying and collecting taxes and duties from pearl fishers and shepherds using the island, installing governors on the island, running public services and so on.</p>
	<p pid="a.228.1/17">The best way ahead is surely for the International Court of Justice to consider the matter in detail and to reach a conclusion. As I have said, I believe that the UAE has a strong case. Of course, there are many others area of contention in the Gulf and the middle east, but the islands of Abu Musa and the Greater and Lesser Tunbs should not be forgotten by the House. We have a long and historic association with the UAE and a responsibility to comment on the matter. Indeed, given the strategic location of the islands, the security and stability of the Gulf region will remain fragile in the absence of an effective resolution.</p>
