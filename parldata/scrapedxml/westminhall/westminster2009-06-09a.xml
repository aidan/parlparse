	<p pid="a.161.1/1" class="italic">Motion made, and Question proposed, That the sitting be now adjourned.&mdash;(Mr. Thomas McAvoy.)</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-06-09a.161.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1501" speakername="Lindsay Hoyle" colnum="161"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090609/halltext/90609h0001.htm#09060973000498">
	<p pid="a.161.2/1">It is good to see that you are the Chairman of the day, Mr. Fraser, and may I add that I am disappointed that you will be retiring?</p>
	<p pid="a.161.2/2">We are pleased to be having this important debate. Manufacturing is important to our economy and to the UK, and Governments past and present have not given it their true support in the way that I would have liked. There is support, but we must recognise the importance of manufacturing. I should like to talk about what is being done in the automotive sector. We can see the importance of the subject by the fact that so many Members from all sides of the House have taken the trouble to turn up at 9.30 am&mdash;I say that for the benefit of those outside who perhaps do not realise that politicians start that little bit earlier than they see on television.</p>
	<p pid="a.161.2/3">The debate is about what is happening and some of the big issues. Only yesterday, we had the devastating news of LDV vans when only a fortnight ago we thought that there was great hope for the company. There was talk of a Malaysian company and the Government giving &pound;5 million to tide it over, and we thought that everything was in place to ensure that LDV manufacturing in the UK could continue. Unfortunately, what we thought was in place fell apart because of the banks, which did not put the money in.</p>
	<p pid="a.161.2/4">We have potentially lost 850 jobs in LDV, and probably 4,000 from the supply chain for LDV. The situation has an impact not only on Birmingham, but on other parts of the country in that supply chain. All the parts for LDV vans go through Multipart, which is a huge logistics supply chain company based in Chorley. It is an excellent company and it has the contract for LDV vans. There is a knock-on effect for each constituency. Team Leyland International is also based in Chorley. It is the original exporter and continues to export LDV vans&mdash;the company gets LDV vans into places such as Nepal for the British Army. The effect is much greater than people see in the headlines of a newspaper or regional programme. We must consider the depth of the impact that the LDV vans situation will have on the economy and on people's livelihoods and jobs.</p>
	<p pid="a.161.2/5">I would have thought that it is now time for the Government to step in and rescue LDV vans. It seems pretty obscene to me that we can see the Mercedes-Benz badge on police van after police van parked outside in the square. That is a shame and a tragedy. Do we think that we will see a British-built van in Germany? Not on your nelly! We will also not see them in Italy, France or Spain. Why do we see that here? What playing field do those countries play on that we do not? We should be ensuring that the police want to buy British to support British taxpayers and British jobs. The same goes for the ambulance service, which uses Renault or Mercedes vehicles, and the Highways Agency, which uses Mitsubishi vehicles, which are not even built in Europe.</p>
	<p pid="a.161.2/6">There is something seriously wrong, is there not? Our procurement is a nonsense. On the one hand, we spend millions saying how good British industry is and, &quot;Come and buy from us,&quot; yet at the same time, our Government do not back our jobs. What is going wrong? Why spend millions promoting British manufacturing and then not buy the products? The best advert for British products is to be seen using them. What car will the Minister ride home in tonight? Is it British built? Has it got a British component? I have not checked, but I suspect that it is a Prius or a Honda.</p>

	<p pid="a.162.0/1">I know that it is unusual to intervene at this point, but I can tell my hon. Friend that it is a Vauxhall Vectra.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-06-09a.162.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1501" speakername="Lindsay Hoyle" colnum="162"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090609/halltext/90609h0001.htm#09060973000500">
	<p pid="a.162.1/1">May I say congratulations and well done? The Minister needs a preservation order on him! He must be listed! He is fairly unique in the House. At least there is a conscience at work.</p>
	<p pid="a.162.1/2">The fact is that most of the Minister's colleagues&mdash;I hope that he will spread the word&mdash;use the Toyota Prius. There is nothing wrong with the Prius, except that it does not involve British jobs or components, and it is shipped all the way here, so it has a bigger carbon footprint than the Minister's car, which comes from down the road.</p>
	<p pid="a.162.1/3">I am not anti-Toyota, which has a plant in the UK&mdash;far from it&mdash;but I say this to Ministers: they should ride round in a British-built Aventis. Otherwise, let us have the big conversation and ask Toyota, &quot;Why aren't you building hybrid cars in the UK?&quot; Manufacturing in the UK is very important to us. Australia, with 16 million people, can say, &quot;Build here and we'll buy your vehicles; don't build here and we won't.&quot; We should be following that example. There are 60 million people in this country and we are one of the biggest car-owning countries in the world. We should lean on Toyota&mdash;and Honda&mdash;and say, &quot;Do the right thing and build those cars here.&quot;</p>

	<p pid="a.162.2/1">The hon. Gentleman is a very distinguished member of the Select Committee on Business and Enterprise, which I have the privilege to chair. The theme that he is pursuing is familiar&mdash;he has pursued it with Ministers on many occasions and may he continue to do so.</p>
	<p pid="a.162.2/2">May I encourage the hon. Gentleman to go a bit deeper? Is he aware that the French and German Governments have acted much more decisively than the British Government to support the component supply industry in those markets? It is not just the Toyota and Nissan badges that matter; the stuff that goes into those cars also matters. Our component industry is generally strong, but at present it is threatened, and more decisive action is being taken elsewhere to support component industries.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-06-09a.162.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1501" speakername="Lindsay Hoyle" colnum="162"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090609/halltext/90609h0001.htm#09060973000502">
	<p pid="a.162.3/1">How could I disagree with the Chairman of our Committee? He is a great man, and I accept the knowledge that he displays. Supporting and creating jobs in the supply chain is an important factor. However, we do not want to end up with a kit factory. We have to go deeper. We should be drilling down to find out where we can create jobs.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-06-09a.163.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2038" speakername="Bob Spink" colnum="163"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090609/halltext/90609h0001.htm#09060973000503">
	<p pid="a.163.0/1">I am delighted that the hon. Gentleman has brought this subject to the House. He has the vast majority of British people on his side, but they, like us, know that European competition rules are the problem. In procurement, the British Government must follow European rules, which they seem to do to the letter. Other countries in Europe do not do so to quite the same extent. That is one of the problems.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-06-09a.163.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1501" speakername="Lindsay Hoyle" colnum="163"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090609/halltext/90609h0001.htm#09060973000504">
	<p pid="a.163.1/1">I cannot disagree. This country is unique in its gold-plating&mdash;it is absolutely gold-plated all the way through. As I said, we are on a different playing field from the rest of Europe. Toyota vehicles are produced in Japan, where European competition rules do not apply. Ministers ought to question their own judgment and have the guts to stand up for British industry&mdash;the Minister is rightly standing up for British industry and Ellesmere Port by using a Vauxhall. We want to see more backbone and Ministers saying, &quot;I don't want a car that's been shipped round the world with a bigger carbon footprint. I want one that's built in the UK. What's good for France is good for the UK.&quot; That is the kind of motivation that we want.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-06-09a.163.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1677" speakername="David Taylor" colnum="163"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090609/halltext/90609h0001.htm#09060973000505">
	<p pid="a.163.2/1">I would be cautious about focusing entirely on Toyota. It has a plant in south Derbyshire that employs many people in my constituency, and it has a good reputation as an employer. Surprisingly, the highest proportion of manufacturing jobs as a proportion of the economy is not in the great west midlands or the north-west, but in the east midlands, where 15 per cent. of our GDP is linked to manufacturing&mdash;Toyota is a part of that.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-06-09a.163.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1501" speakername="Lindsay Hoyle" colnum="163"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090609/halltext/90609h0001.htm#09060973000506">
	<p pid="a.163.3/1">I do not disagree. My hon. Friend listens carefully, so he will have heard that I am asking Toyota to consider building in the UK as it did for Australia. I was also saying that Ministers should be buying the Toyota Aventis, which is built in the east midlands. It is an excellent car&mdash;it is good on economy and good for the environment. Buying cars that are built in the UK is surely better for the jobs that my hon. Friend wants to create and support in his constituency and the east midlands region. We should buy the cars that are built here rather than the cars that are built in Japan with no British parts and involving no British jobs, which are shipped around the world and which are not good for the environment. That is what I am saying.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-06-09a.163.4" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1677" speakername="David Taylor" colnum="163"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090609/halltext/90609h0001.htm#09060973000507">
	<p pid="a.163.4/1">The car components industry, which feeds Toyota and others, is a significant employer in North-West Leicestershire. About 20 per cent. of 18 to 24-year-olds were employed in manufacturing in 1997. That figure has more than halved over the past 10 years, and a generation of young people who feel frozen out of the job market are now showing an interest in the politics of the far right. That is one of the lessons that we learned last Thursday.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-06-09a.164.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1501" speakername="Lindsay Hoyle" colnum="164"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090609/halltext/90609h0001.htm#09060973000508">
	<p pid="a.164.0/1">I cannot disagree. There is a big question for all parties when people are driven to the fringes in voting. I will not go into that political issue, but I agree that it involves jobs. We must tune in to people and ensure that they have opportunities. They must not be frozen out, or frustration will result. I agree totally.</p>
	<p pid="a.164.0/2">We have touched on the importance of LDV vans. It is not too late. Yes, people are being made redundant as we speak, but there is a mothballed factory for which there is still hope and opportunity, because it has invested heavily in electric vehicles. Some LDV vans are being trialled by a leading supermarket. LDV is a world leader. If it were in France or Germany, would those countries allow it to close? No. They would put in investment to drive it forward, because the future is in electric vehicles. We should be investing to save the company. That is where we should start.</p>
	<p pid="a.164.0/3">It is bad news. Household names such as Jaguar and Vauxhall, which I thank the Minister for mentioning, as well as other, smaller manufacturing companies are facing an uncertain future. There is good news out there&mdash;the market is experiencing a bit of an upturn&mdash;but the credit crunch is beginning to ripple far beyond the financial sector, where it started, and is having a devastating effect on manufacturing. It has exposed our overdependence on financial services and highlighted the need to restructure our economy for the future. We need a vibrant manufacturing base. It is essential for the prosperity of the UK economy. We must not make the same mistakes that were made in the past.</p>
	<p pid="a.164.0/4">Manufacturing matters, not only to the 3 million people that it employs directly but to the further 2.4 million employed indirectly in supply chains and related services, as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1940" name="Peter Luff">the hon. Member for Mid-Worcestershire (Peter Luff)</phrase> rightly said. We must look after the components sector and protect it better. Manufacturing helps the wider economy. Many of our towns, cities and communities rely on it as their main economic driver, and 50 per cent. of our exports come from the manufacturing sector.</p>
	<p pid="a.164.0/5">These are difficult times for manufacturing. The pressure of operating in an ever-increasing global economy has been compounded by the global recession. Most notably, the automotive sector has been severely affected since 1997. More than 1 million manufacturing jobs have disappeared, and that trend is due to continue to the end of the year.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-06-09a.164.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2038" speakername="Bob Spink" colnum="164"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090609/halltext/90609h0001.htm#09060973000509">
	<p pid="a.164.1/1">I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will agree that small and medium-sized enterprises are a most important sector within manufacturing. They generate sustainable jobs and new enterprises. The problem for SMEs is that regulations affect them disproportionately, because they do not have the resources that big companies have to deal with them. I welcome the Government's procurement plan&mdash;they are leading us out of recession&mdash;but it is not available in small bites that SMEs can access. The Government need to target their procurement at SMEs as well as big companies.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-06-09a.164.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1501" speakername="Lindsay Hoyle" colnum="164"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090609/halltext/90609h0001.htm#09060973000510">
	<p pid="a.164.2/1">The hon. Gentleman is absolutely correct. Procurement contracts could be broken down into smaller pieces, which would allow SMEs to bid for them. That is why we should have a procurement Minister, not just in defence but across all Departments, to ensure that everybody is aware of procurement contracts and that people are helped to win them rather than being omitted because they are too small or do not have the capability. It is about encouragement, help and support. The appointment of a procurement Minister could make a difference for UK jobs.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-06-09a.165.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1940" speakername="Peter Luff" colnum="165"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090609/halltext/90609h0001.htm#09060973000511">
	<p pid="a.165.0/1">The hon. Gentleman is being generous in giving way. I am sure that he would not want to leave the House with the impression that manufacturing in this country is anything other than thriving in many respects. We have world-class technology in many sectors, including aerospace, automobiles, pharmaceuticals and so on. We are the sixth-largest manufacturing nation in the world. Yes, the sector faces problems at present, and it is wonderful that he is highlighting them, but equally, this is a fantastic opportunity for what remains a successful manufacturing base in this country.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-06-09a.165.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1501" speakername="Lindsay Hoyle" colnum="165"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090609/halltext/90609h0001.htm#09060973000512">
	<p pid="a.165.1/1">I do not disagree. As I go on, I will mention some of the benefits. The hon. Gentleman is anticipating what I am going to say. I am talking about the downside, but I also want to talk about the pluses. We should build on what we do best.</p>
	<p pid="a.165.1/2">Recently, the Engineering Employers Federation raised its job loss forecast for 2009 to 188,000. If those jobs are lost, skills will be gone for ever as workers struggle to re-enter the labour market. We must face up to that problem as well.</p>
	<p pid="a.165.1/3">When we talk about the automotive industry, people often think exclusively of cars. However, I am keen to highlight the needs of all vehicle manufacturers, particularly Leyland Trucks, which employs many of my constituents. It is a world leader and the last major truck manufacturer in the UK. It meets the environmental targets that we expect of major truck manufacturing. It makes the trucks that we want on our roads. It needs support. The company has invested heavily in meeting environmental needs and reducing emissions from its trucks, but it is struggling. It is still building trucks, but it has had to reduce its work force significantly, and staff are working on reduced hours. Now is the time for the Government to step in. The Government can do a lot, perhaps through a short-time working subsidy to ensure that Leyland Trucks retains its skilled labour and can compete when the market improves. We do not want the company to wither on the vine.</p>
	<p pid="a.165.1/4">It comes back around. Who has been given the contract for our new Army trucks? Has it been given to Leyland Trucks? No, it has gone to MAN, in Germany. A lot of promises were made. MAN said, &quot;We own ERF in Cheshire now, so we'll bid for the Army contract.&quot; What has MAN done? It has closed ERF. I understand that ERF now has a little garage based in Stafford. That is its footprint. The vehicles will be built in Germany and shipped over. It is that sort of nonsense that we must overcome. It is no different from Army uniforms being made in China and shipped back here. That is not about European competition; it is about bad judgment.</p>
	<p pid="a.165.1/5">Leyland Trucks is important, and we could do much more for it. We have given tax advantages to the car industry&mdash;I will mention more about that&mdash;but we need to do something for manufacturers of vans and larger vehicles to help them through the recession. Why are we not giving tax breaks up front and incentives to sell trucks? Fleet buyers will always be there. Royal Mail will be there for ever and a day. No one will ever make money on Royal Mail, but they can make money on small buyers&mdash;the people who drive one, two, three or four wagons. Those are the people who matter. Helping the manufacturers would help them, because new vehicles would give them better efficiency, but it would also keep jobs and skills in place. That is what we need to support. Will my hon. Friend the Minister consider it? We have done a good job on the car scrappage scheme, but we need to do something for trucks that will bring benefit. I hope that he will take that on board. Leyland Trucks is important.</p>
	<p pid="a.165.1/6">During the economic downturn, we have witnessed a 60 per cent. fall in production, which highlights the huge impact of the financial crisis on our vehicle manufacturing sector. We accept that we cannot compete on price and stoop to allowing lower-skilled jobs to move to low-paid economies, but it is worrying that highly skilled and well-paid jobs are now going abroad at a similar rate. We need urgently to reassess our policy if we want manufacturing to survive. We need to end our passive manufacturing policy and the notion that factory closures do not matter. They matter, particularly to those who lose out and are forced to enter low-paid work as a result of closures.</p>
	<p pid="a.165.1/7">We cannot afford to let manufacturing wither away. Now more than ever, the Government must prioritise support and invest in our manufacturing base to meet today's challenges and ensure that we are best placed to grasp the opportunities of tomorrow. The Government document, &quot;Building Britain's future: new industry, new jobs&quot;, offers a platform for doing so. It points to an encouraging shift in industrial policy.</p>
	<p pid="a.165.1/8">Coupled with that, Government initiatives such as the car scrappage scheme are having an impact and helping to kick-start demand in the automotive sector. That is welcome, but it is aimed mainly at small cars. We need encouragement to buy family cars. Families need bigger cars. People cannot tow a caravan with a Nissan Micra, or fit three kids, two adults and a dog inside. We build good family cars, such as the Toyota Aventis. The powertrain of the Mondeo, including the engine and the gearbox, comes from the UK. Incentives to sell more of those vehicles would be a big bonus, because Ford employs thousands of people in the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.165.1/9">The car scrappage scheme could be extended. We do not want to fall off a cliff at the end of the 12 months. We must manage the end of the scheme and give other incentives. We must be imaginative in coming up with ideas. I welcome the scrappage scheme, which is working well and making things better. However, my challenge to the Minister is that we can do more.</p>

	<p pid="a.166.0/1">Does my hon. Friend share the caution of many environmental and economic campaigners over the scrappage scheme? Six of every seven cars brought in this country are imported, which will restrict the impact of the scheme on the UK economy. Could the scheme be given a new direction at the end of the period that the Chancellor has put in place?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-06-09a.166.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1501" speakername="Lindsay Hoyle" colnum="166"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090609/halltext/90609h0001.htm#09060973000514">
	<p pid="a.166.1/1">That is a worry. However, other jobs are created on the back of the scheme, for example in the dealer network and the supply chain for spares. The problem is that the Mondeo is classed as an imported vehicle, even though the powertrain, and therefore most of the car, is produced through UK manufacturing. It is easy to state a figure for vehicles that come from abroad, but, as I have said, there is a difference between a Mondeo and a Prius. The Mondeo's powertrain comes from the UK, whereas the Prius contains nothing from the UK. We must get that balance right. If there is a way to support British car manufacturing, I am happy to look at it. However, we come back to the point about European rules. We can do more, but we should not forget that many cars from abroad have content from the UK, and many do not.</p>
	<p pid="a.166.1/2">The absence of a comprehensive cross-governmental manufacturing strategy puts at risk our ability to meet today's demands and to enable future growth. We need a jobs summit that brings together the Government and all social partners to set out a strategy. A clear direction for UK manufacturing that centres on investment, infrastructure and the work force must be agreed. There should be regional job summits where the Secretary of State brings regional manufacturers together and listens to what they say. Those manufacturers must work together to ensure that they have a future. They must state their needs and what they want to see from Government, rather than be told what is good for them, which we are very good at. The challenge is to listen to them and to work together. It is important that there is a clear direction centred on investment.</p>
	<p pid="a.166.1/3">The Government, business and trade unions must work together if manufacturing is to survive. The unions must play a role in the growth of this country, as they are the best lobbyers for procurement contracts. They led the lobbying on behalf of BAE Systems on the Typhoon, the joint strike fighter and submarines. They do a great job of ensuring that UK jobs survive. We want to see a new practice of working together and do not want to return to the problems of the '70s. New social partnerships are being built in which the unions work hand in hand with companies for the betterment of UK manufacturing.</p>
	<p pid="a.166.1/4">Who would have thought that Lord Digby Jones would be seen hand in hand with Unite leaders, marching for jobs? Who would have thought it? The bastion of self-enterprise&mdash;<i>[</i><i>Interruption.</i><i>]</i> I did say &quot;bastion&quot;&mdash;the last bastion. Many may wish to think differently of Digby, but I know that his parents were married. He has become a champion of British jobs and of working with the trade unions. Nobody would have dreamt of seeing a march for jobs in Birmingham with Digby and Unite trade union leaders at the front. I welcome that and look forward to his application card coming through. That demonstrates the change we have seen and suggests what will happen in future.</p>
	<p pid="a.166.1/5">A new approach to manufacturing is needed. We must not abandon the view that the market has the answers. It does not have all of them, but it has some. Although we do not like to use the word, we have seen intervention in the banking and car industries. It does not have to be a dirty word that we turn our noses up at. Intervention is important and the market matters&mdash;we must bring the two things together. If we do not, within 20 years, countries like China and India will make everything we use. Our European counterparts recognise that they cannot have a successful economy without a robust manufacturing base and have acted quickly to defend it. The UK, too, must adopt a more active industrial policy and should not be afraid to intervene to support and protect jobs, and to incentivise investment where appropriate. The state should step in to provide the necessary support for manufacturing companies. It is not acceptable to stand by and watch skilled jobs and companies such as LDV go to the wall.</p>
	<p pid="a.166.1/6">We must look at new ways of working that are used in Europe and the United States. Many problems in the automotive industry are shared. In the global market, we must explore and work together where possible, for example to invest in the production of more environmentally friendly vehicles, to which the Government are committed. It is right to have long-term policies on investing in greener vehicles, but we must not miss out on the short-term policies that are needed.</p>
	<p pid="a.166.1/7">I congratulate the Government on working with Jaguar Land Rover. It is important that such major companies continue and there can be no excuses if they do not. The Government were right to intervene to tackle the financial crisis and should not hesitate in acting to support other jobs. Such action benefits business, workers, the economy and the taxpayer.</p>
	<p pid="a.166.1/8">The Government could adopt a number of measures to help manufacturing contend better with the downturn. More direct support is needed to protect jobs. One option is a time-limited wage subsidy targeted at keeping viable businesses open. Short-time working and temporary lay-offs are now a reality. In some cases, they are a stepping-stone to redundancy. For example, workers at Leyland Trucks are being forced to accept short-time working because of the downturn in the orders for vehicles. Each week, more businesses are forced to do the same. Such companies and their workers deserve our support.</p>
	<p pid="a.166.1/9">A time-limited wage subsidy scheme should be introduced with sufficient safeguards to ensure that only firms directly affected by the recession qualify and to avoid dead weight. It could bring significant benefits such as employers avoiding immediate redundancies and retaining essential staff and skills. If linked to training, it could be a long-term work force investment. Surely it makes more sense to invest in people in the work force, rather than in the jobcentre. Rather than subsidising people to be unemployed, we should subsidise them to keep their jobs.</p>

	<p pid="a.168.0/1">Does the hon. Gentleman agree that to build for the future of the manufacturing sector, there must be more genuine, traditional, workplace apprenticeships? Will he congratulate the Government on developing more apprenticeships and press them to develop more traditional, work-based, manufacturing apprenticeships? That is the future.</p>

	<p pid="a.168.1/1">I am happy to join in that praise for the Government's action on what I call traditional, real apprenticeships. I cannot thank the Government enough. Apprenticeships are part of what we need for the future, but are no good if we allow the companies to disappear. We must ensure that the companies are there so that we can provide the long-term jobs that apprentices and the country require.</p>
	<p pid="a.168.1/2">The TUC estimates that at a cost of about &pound;1.2 billion, we could save 600,000 workers each year through a short-time working subsidy. We have found billions to bail out the bankers, so we can do the same for hard-working people in manufacturing. The banks are now paying that money back, and we should reinvest it in manufacturing so that we benefit even more in the longer term. A short-time working subsidy would be a quick and effective way of targeting support at the struggling employers providing financial support to employees across the UK. Europe has already recognised the benefits of such schemes, which have been introduced in Germany, France, Spain, the Netherlands and Italy. Closer to home, the Welsh Assembly has introduced a wage subsidy called ProAct, which took only two months to become operational at the beginning of the year and is now benefiting many businesses and workers across Wales&mdash;we can learn something from a small country such as Wales.</p>
	<p pid="a.168.1/3">The proposal to introduce a short-time working subsidy is supported by business leaders such as the Federation of Small Businesses, and organisations such as Corus, JCB and many others. The trade unions also fully support it. As I have said, it is better to pay to keep people in work than to pay them to attend a jobcentre. What are we otherwise going to do with them? Will we train them to do the jobs for which they already have the skills? That is what we seem to do. It makes sense to provide that support, because it helps people to keep their dignity and their ability to pay the mortgage and it stops family break-ups. That alone would bring a major benefit to the Government. It must be a priority to keep viable businesses open and to protect jobs if we are to come out of the recession in a stronger position. If we fail to do so, there is a danger that we could lose many much-needed skills.</p>
	<p pid="a.168.1/4">I want to discuss workers' rights. The Government have rightly made progress on introducing family-friendly policies, but those policies benefit people only if they have jobs, so we need to make those things work together. We have not been so bold in other areas, and the UK has a poor record, in comparison with other European countries, on protecting workers who face redundancy. It is worrying that General Motors Europe has admitted that it is easier to sack British workers because of the flexible labour market. Increasingly, when multinationals consider downsizing and shedding jobs, they see British workers as the easy option. We need to reconsider these matters, as it is scandalous that UK workers are among the cheapest to sack. We need a level playing field, and I urge the Government to act to give British workers the same protection as their European counterparts. This is not about favours; it is about fairness.</p>
	<p pid="a.168.1/5">Linked to all that, we need further incentives to support companies that invest in our manufacturing sector. We could do that by giving better tax incentives or by demanding the repayment of grants, so that we would help them on one hand, but they would have to pay back with penalties. We would have to include penalties because some people want to come in, make a quick buck and disappear. Companies must decide which is the best option for them: is it to repay the advantage they have had in order to move quickly somewhere offshore?</p>
	<p pid="a.168.1/6">We need to send the message that Britain is the best place to invest, and we can do that. We have the best skills and the best work force, and we make the best products in the world. We are world leaders in areas such as pharmaceuticals and aerospace, and we have a great skills base in the north-west, particularly in Lancashire. There are no better skills than those we have in aerospace in Lancashire. When we look at BAE Systems and at what flies out of there, we see that those skills and the research and development that go into that manufacturing base are second to none. The Americans look at us with envy, and rightly so, as we are building the best aircraft in the world.</p>
	<p pid="a.168.1/7">I would like all that skill, knowledge and know-how to be linked with technology transfer, as that is where we miss out. We invest in military aircraft that are the best in the world, but we need a spin-off from that investment to create jobs in the civil sector. People always ask, what good is the military? It is good when it protects us, but I want to be able to say that it goes much further than that. I want to say, &quot;Look at what we've created by transfer to the automotive industry and other industries such as shipbuilding, with submarines.&quot; There must be skills that we can transfer across to our other UK manufacturing bases. We have put in the research, development and investment, but we do not hear about technology transfer. When a space shuttle is put into space, we hear about the spin-offs and other jobs being created through that investment. We need to do the same and to recognise what we could gain from such major investment. I repeat that we are still the world leader in pharmaceuticals. We need to go forward with that kind of blue chip company, and we need to send the message that Britain is the best place to invest and do business.</p>
	<p pid="a.168.1/8">Warm words from the Government in support of manufacturing are commendable, but they need to be matched by direct action. The Government have rightly embarked on record investment in our schools, hospitals and transport infrastructure, but that investment must be matched by a policy that prioritises British manufacturing, thus protecting British jobs. We invest in our railways, but we have trains that are built in Japan and other rolling stock that is built in Spain. Why is that continuing? Does the Minister think that Japan or Spain would let us export trains to them? The answer is no, they would not. When we are making all that investment with taxpayers' money, we must consider how to use it to help British jobs. We have missed a trick which we must not miss in the future. The Government spend more than &pound;120 billion a year on buying manufactured goods, so the introduction of such measures would make a real difference to our manufacturing sector. For a start, why should not all the vehicles used by the Government and the public sector be made in Britain? What about Building Schools for the Future and Sure Start children's centres? Why should the desks and chairs that our children use in the classroom not be made in Britain? I could go on and on about how much more we could do. As I have said, British uniforms could be made in Chorley. Public infrastructure projects such as Crossrail and the 2012 Olympics should always prioritise in favour of British companies and British jobs, and should make sure that the steelwork, materials and everything else are from the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.168.1/9">We also need to invest more in skills and training if we are reinvigorate the manufacturing sector. The Leitch report highlighted the importance of investing in skills and workers. The planned investment initiatives will go only so far, and we need to go further if we wish to remain at the cutting edge of manufacturing. We need to address this issue urgently, as it cannot be right that companies such as Rolls Royce have to recruit from abroad to fill the skills gap. We ought to recognise that problem immediately and put it right. I welcome the increasing number of apprenticeships and I commend the work of companies such as BAE Systems, which has invested significant resources in such apprenticeship schemes and in the company's future. One has only to look at its graduate and apprenticeship scheme in Barrow, which has benefited more than 600 people. About 13 per cent. of its Submarine Solutions work force has come through that scheme, proving that investment quickly brings rewards.</p>
	<p pid="a.168.1/10">Train to Gain is also making a difference, but we must go further. We need to be bold and radical in offering training and development opportunities for those who are already in work to upskill and give them the diversity to meet the change in demand for skills. However, the Government cannot do that alone. Employers need to work together on that, but there should be greater incentives, particularly for small and medium-sized companies to invest in their work forces.</p>
	<p pid="a.168.1/11">We will face challenges in future, but we must not shy away from them. Our manufacturing is something that I can be proud of, that Britain should be proud of, and that the rest of the world is very envious of. We are one of the leading exporters of high-technology products, and our productivity has risen by half since 1997, thereby outpacing Germany and France. The key test is whether we make the necessary investment to build on those achievements or whether we stand by and let our manufacturing industry deteriorate further. We cannot afford to do that. We have been through the painful measures and difficulties of the 1980s, and I know the impact that they had in Lancashire at that time and the problems that we faced. We have come through all that, and we must never return to it by doing nothing. This is not a political point: doing nothing would have taken us from recession into a depression, and that is why we were right to invest. We must not shy away from investment, although there will be critics. Fruit is now beginning to appear on the tree and it will not be long before we can pick it, so it benefits the Government. We must acknowledge when they get things right, and we should not be ashamed of what we have done. I repeat that doing nothing is not the way forward, and that we would have been in a depression if we had done nothing.</p>
	<p pid="a.168.1/12">The weakness of the economy is dependent on the financial sector, as I said earlier. With a strong manufacturing base, we can secure continued economic growth and stability and help to support workers and return our economy to a position of even greater strength. I hope that we can expand on the measures that we have taken, and that they can grow. However, it is not all doom and gloom&mdash;there is good news. I have a company called Porter Lancastrian in my area. People might ask who they are: they produce bar products, but the brewing industry is suffering and pub closures are coming. However, Porter Lancastrian diversified, and now produces waterproof television screens for the fanciest hotels around the world, so that when people sit in the bath or have a shower, they can watch television. Waterproof televisions are going a bomb and they came out of Chorley. That is fantastic news&mdash;I do not think that MPs have claimed them on their expenses yet.</p>
	<p pid="a.168.1/13">It is important to have initiatives to deal with these issues. Such initiatives should be about diversifying and creating new jobs. That is what we are good at in the UK. Providing a bit of help and support and bringing people together can make a real difference. I am pleased that we have been allowed to have today's debate. It will help to inform policy development and implementation, and the vision set out in the &quot;New Industry, New Jobs&quot; document. That document is important and manufacturing is important. Thank you, Mr. Fraser, for your patience. I also thank other hon. Members for turning up.</p>

	<p pid="a.172.2/1">I note the desire of my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1705" name="Tony Lloyd">the Member for Manchester, Central (Tony Lloyd)</phrase> to speak and congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1501" name="Lindsay Hoyle">the Member for Chorley (Mr. Hoyle)</phrase>, who put the case admirably. I am delighted to speak under your chairmanship, Mr. Fraser.</p>
	<p pid="a.172.2/2">I shall concentrate on the key issue of the wage contribution, subsidy or whatever we want to call it. It might surprise people to know that Stroud is a manufacturing centre. Many people think that it is an area of agriculture, green hills and tourism. In fact, a disproportionate number of people&mdash;more than the national average and certainly the highest number in Gloucestershire&mdash;work in manufacturing, particularly engineering.</p>
	<p pid="a.172.2/3">Our firms are mainly automotive or in the automotive chain&mdash;although some are aerospace&mdash;and they are experiencing some difficulties at the moment. The aerospace sector has, of course, lagged behind other sectors in terms of the recession, but, nevertheless, it faces some difficulties. I have been to all my major firms&mdash;Renishaws, Delphi, SKF, Lister-Petters and a smaller company called Deutz. In addition, I am in Cologne next week to try to fight to retain 30 jobs, which I think we can do if the parent company allows its subsidiary in Dursley to go it alone and work with Lister-Petters, which was the original company. That would provide an answer, and it is my duty to work towards such a solution. It is not all bad news: an ABB plant in my constituency is doing very well, because it is based in the water and power industries. The way in which ABB locks into those industries means that it is doing relatively well.</p>
	<p pid="a.172.2/4">On wage subsidy and wage contribution, I must compliment the Government. Two of the firms that I have mentioned&mdash;Delphi and Renishaws&mdash;have laid off a large number of people. For Renishaws, that is unheralded. That company is a state-of-the-art probe manufacturer under the chairmanship of Sir David McMurtry, who is one of the stars of Britain and British industry. However, between December and January, Renishaws hit a wall because of what happened to demand for machine tools, of which probes are a key element. As well as the lay-offs, people have &quot;volunteered&quot; to go on short-time working to keep their jobs. However, accordingly, they will take the pain of the loss of money and the sacrifice that comes with that.</p>
	<p pid="a.172.2/5">I went to see both Dephi and Renishaws early in the new year when they hit these problems. We agreed collectively that when people are on short-time working, their time can be used meaningfully to boost their skill level and that we should ensure that people can do the training that they would love to do but that they are normally too busy to contemplate. I pay due regard to a number of Government agencies that have been key to those discussions, such as the South West of England Development Agency, the Learning and Skills Council, Jobcentre Plus, Gloucestershire First&mdash;our local development agency&mdash;and Gloucestershire Training Group Limited, which will undertake the training provision. As my hon. Friend the Member for Chorley has said, the trade union, Unite, has also been crucial in encouraging its members to go along with the training.</p>
	<p pid="a.172.2/6">Using Train to Gain, we have put training packages in place so that slack time can be taken up and that people can be usefully employed. There are two reasons why we have done that. First, as I have said, it is important for people to build up their skill level. Secondly, when we get out of recession, we have to be absolutely tooled-up, skilled-up and personed-up, because otherwise our competitors in Europe will take the work. The two firms that I am talking about are Renishaws and Delphi. Delphi has a huge order book going forward, but, of course, no one is taking up those orders at the moment. Renishaws is much more of a just-in-time business, but, again, it will be back because it is the world's leading manufacturer of highly skilled probes. We have a future; those firms have a future; however, we have got to get to that future.</p>
	<p pid="a.172.2/7">As my hon. Friend the Member for Chorley has said, I commend the paper produced jointly by the Federation of Small Businesses and the TUC. I shall not discuss that document in detail, because I know that my hon. Friend the Member for Manchester, Central wants to speak. However, it is a very pertinent paper, which also has the benefit of being short, and it makes the point that such training schemes mean that firms are keeping people on their books. Of course, firms have the means to do so, because employment schemes involve a levy on companies, so that money is available to allow companies to keep people on the books while the state pays them in times of downturn. I am not suggesting that we go along all the way with that, because it is rather quaint to pay people to lie on the beach for three months at a time. I would much rather people were working and being trained when they are not working, so that they are appropriately skilled for when they come back.</p>
	<p pid="a.172.2/8">As my hon. Friend the Member for Chorley has said, if we consider Wales, such schemes are not unique in our country. The Minister might have an interesting point of view on this because, under the ProAct strategy, such schemes are taking place in Wales, where people are being paid wage contributions to undertake training. Wales has led the way on that and the rest of the United Kingdom must follow.</p>
	<p pid="a.172.2/9">Of course, smaller companies can already pay a training subsidy under Train to Gain. Again, that is nothing new. During the 1970s, to which people sometimes hark back, there was a temporary employment subsidy. Such schemes are nothing new; we have done it before and we must do it again. Why? Well, the alternative is to lay people off, which will cost. I know that there is a cost associated with such training schemes&mdash;the figure of &pound;1.2 billion has been bandied around, which is the figure in the FSB and TUC paper&mdash;but it is not an absolute cost because people would go on to jobseeker's allowance and draw down all sorts of other benefits. Therefore, I would like the Government to cost such schemes. I know that I am arguing with my hon. Friend on this, but I would, at least initially, limit such schemes to the automotive industry, and then see how long the recession lasts. This is a short-term measure. We are not talking about it being indefinite because, of course, we hope that the recession will not be indefinite. It is a short-term measure, but, nevertheless, we need to take it.</p>
	<p pid="a.172.2/10">I have some specific questions for my hon. Friend the Minister. I am eternally grateful for the Delphi-Renishaws package being put together, but the ghost in the room&mdash;if I can put it that way&mdash;that has not been dealt with is the need for a wage contribution. The Delphi-Renishaws scheme is taking place on a per person basis, and one issue is the upfront costs of the awarding body. Those costs should be removed or at least scaled down, because there will potentially be&mdash;we would like to see this&mdash;at least 300, 400 or perhaps even more workers undertaking the upskilling to get national vocational qualification levels that they have not previously managed to achieve.</p>
	<p pid="a.172.2/11">Secondly, there is the question of what happens when someone drops out of the scheme. At present, the full cost is borne by the company. As that is something that companies in difficulty always worry about, we hope that there will be some flexibility so that the company does not have to bear the full cost of people leaving, for whatever reason, whether it is another job, family illness or so on.</p>
	<p pid="a.172.2/12">Thirdly, apprentices are key to the scheme. Both companies have committed themselves to taking apprentices this year and next year, because they feel that that is the future. At present, the use of European social funding for those under 18 is not allowed, so we wish to have flexibility to include under-18s.</p>
	<p pid="a.172.2/13">Finally, setting up such schemes is expensive; it requires a big budget. We want some clarity that they can continue in the future, because, whatever we do to begin with, we will want to roll it out. I would like other firms to join in and follow that model, which is exciting, innovative and absolutely right. Those are my specific questions.</p>
	<p pid="a.172.2/14">In conclusion, I think that what we are trying to do in my constituency is absolutely right, but we do not want to be hung up on or hamstrung by the question of whether a wage contribution will be paid. There is a matter of justice: if the state is asking people to use their time and money to undertake such a scheme, the least it can do is make a contribution as they do so. We will get a benefit, as our firms will be even more competitive when they come out of the recession.</p>
	<p pid="a.172.2/15">I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister hears my earnest pleas. I am grateful to the Government for putting enormous resources into supporting employment. I know that the scheme is a pioneer project, a pilot&mdash;it is pushing forward the boundaries&mdash;but, as I have said, the problem is not new. If we can crack this, other parts of the country and other companies can learn from us, but we need clarity about whether a wage contribution for the automotive industry is a possibility, albeit for a short period of time, because it would help everybody. We will push on with our plans regardless, but we really need that back-up.</p>

	<p pid="a.175.0/1">In the little time that is available, I wish to make several brief points. I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1501" name="Lindsay Hoyle">the Member for Chorley (Mr. Hoyle)</phrase>, who, as ever, has picked up issues that really matter to our constituents.</p>
	<p pid="a.175.0/2">My hon. Friend probably agrees that we need to draw a careful distinction between saying that the Government ought to be active in their policy on employment and encouraging the industrial and manufacturing base, which can involve the proper use of Government procurement to ensure that British firms are advantaged, and saying that we ought to move to some kind of economic protectionism. I am not a natural free-marketer, but, nevertheless, we are a trading economy. My hon. Friend gave examples of British companies that successfully manufacture all over the world&mdash;those companies do not necessarily assemble cars in the end, but they manufacture the parts that go into them. We cannot take part in a process that involves cutting off our nose to spite our face, which would happen if we got the balance wrong. There is nothing inconsistent about adopting the kind of policies that are adopted by some of our European neighbours to support home industries. We do not have to cross the boundary into the wrong kind of protectionism.</p>

	<p pid="a.175.1/1">I totally agree. This is about using the same rules as our European counterparts. In the case of Japan, does my hon. Friend think that a Japanese Minister would ride around in a British-built car? The answer is no, because the Japanese Government have a policy that ensures that that does not happen. The rules should be the same for all of us.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-06-09a.175.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1705" speakername="Tony Lloyd" colnum="175"  time="010:22:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090609/halltext/90609h0003.htm#09060973000522">
	<p pid="a.175.2/1">We all agree with that. We want the rules to be used judiciously and carefully to the advantage of our employment and manufacturing base.</p>
	<p pid="a.175.2/2">The Government must look at the role of Government procurement. I do not say that unkindly, but procurement over the years by all Governments has perhaps not shown Britain at its best. The civil service has not always known best how to work in partnership with manufacturing. That might seem like a plea for manufacturers. It is sometimes said that we have feather-bedded manufacturers in the past. We have allowed poor management to get away with an approach that allows them to become lazy and not as cutting edge as they ought to be. The Government ought to be using their purchasing power to promote the dynamic cutting edge. They should ensure that those who provide goods and services to them are at the forefront of global manufacturing.</p>
	<p pid="a.175.2/3">I give the example&mdash;it is an important one&mdash;of BAE Systems. There is no doubt that in the past it got away with ridiculous prices, ridiculously slow delivery times and so on. The overly cosy relationship with previous Governments was not in the interests of BAE Systems or our employment and manufacturing base. Such things are now changing. There is a much tougher view in the Ministry of Defence and the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform about the procurement process, but we need to refine it to ensure that there is value for money and that the Government play a part in driving an industrial policy that leads to success.</p>
	<p pid="a.175.2/4">I support my hon. Friends the Members for Chorley and for Stroud (Mr. Drew) in their plea for a proper look at a judicious use of employment subsidies in parts of industry. The Government rightly recognised that the importance of the banking system was not in whether individual banks succeeded or otherwise but in the fact that if the system had collapsed, knock-on effects would have spread throughout the whole of the UK's services and manufacturing economy. What the Government did was high risk but absolutely right, which is now being proven.</p>
	<p pid="a.175.2/5">The argument for support for LDV, for example, is similar. The issue concerns not only LDV, but the supply chain that it is involved in and the importance of maintaining that whole infrastructure within our industry. We need to take a strategic view in respect of critical manufacturing firms and ensure that we offer support at this particularly difficult time. Conditions are likely to be difficult for manufacturing for some time to come, so I support the plea made by those who have already spoken.</p>
	<p pid="a.175.2/6">The future will not be with the large manufacturers of the past but with small and medium-sized enterprises&mdash;those little firms that are highly innovative but often feel that they are not supported. I wish to make several points about them. First, while I agree with the arguments about traditional apprenticeships, we have to understand the position of the traditional apprentice in the modern world. A small firm on its own cannot devise a proper apprenticeship structure. There has to be a well-defined structure and access to further education. As I have said to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1631" name="Mark Prisk">the hon. Member for Hertford and Stortford (Mr. Prisk)</phrase>, further education is fundamental, and any attack on it would be massively damaging to our manufacturing base. There has to be proper partnership between our education institutions, if we are to offer upskilling to the people who work in our economy.</p>
	<p pid="a.175.2/7">We should bear in mind that this is not just about apprenticeships but about the reskilling of those who are in work and who already have good skills. My hon. Friend the Member for Stroud discussed labour subsidy. The reality is that people with skills who drift out of jobs usually do not come back, and we could lose that skills base in the future.</p>
	<p pid="a.175.2/8">My final point is about the banking system. Historically, our banking system has seen itself as a great success, but it has always failed this country in the particular area of early innovators&mdash;those who do high-technology, quality research and who want to move into production. We are spectacularly bad in dealing with that gap, and many highly qualified, highly competent people leave these shores, often for America and the rest of Europe, to produce their products, because our banking system fails to take a risk at that risky stage of investment, which, nevertheless, is fundamental if we are to see a transition from idea to manufacture.</p>
	<p pid="a.175.2/9">A firm in my constituency, Liberalto Engines, is currently suffering from that gap. Everyone says that its idea is great and that it will have all the backing that it needs, if it can get its idea into production. The idea is good, and the company knows that the product will work, but moving into prototype and demonstrating production capacity is, of course, risky. The company may fail, but the whole point of the banking system is to take risks and get a price for those risks. At the moment, however, the banking system is not doing that. That is one thing that the Government could do to ensure that we have a future in respect of the small, highly innovative, advanced technologies that we need.</p>
	<p pid="a.175.2/10">We have some world-beating industries in this country. I visited a firm in my constituency last week called SSR. It is a training company that works with the media industries, which have produced bands such as the Happy Mondays, New Order and all the other great Manchester bands of the past. It trains people and gives them the skills of the future. There is a blurring of the distinction between services and manufacturing in that area, but those are the industries of the future. Those industries are massively hi-tech and massively important for our future, and they are there now. They are successful and they will weather this economic storm and provide us with high-quality employment for the future. The future is good, but it needs a little bit of assistance from the Government now.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-06-09a.177.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1966" speakername="John Thurso" colnum="177"  time="010:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090609/halltext/90609h0003.htm#09060973000523">
	<p pid="a.177.0/1">May I say what a pleasure it is to serve under your chairmanship, Mr. Fraser? May I also congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1501" name="Lindsay Hoyle">the hon. Member for Chorley (Mr. Hoyle)</phrase> on securing this debate and on the excellent way in which he set out the issues, which I will come to in a moment? I also congratulate the hon. Members for Stroud (Mr. Drew) and for Manchester, Central (Tony Lloyd) on their contributions.</p>
	<p pid="a.177.0/2">I shall pick up on a couple of points made by the hon. Member for Manchester, Central. First, he made a good point about Government procurement, which is important. Of course, the Office of Government Commerce exists precisely to have an overview of procurement within Government. At the moment, the OGC is largely focused on short-term economic gain in the procurement process, but it is wholly right and reasonable that it should also have a duty to consider its impact in the wider British economy and, as far as it is reasonable, to be helpful to our regions in the way in which it goes about its business.</p>
	<p pid="a.177.0/3">The hon. Gentleman also mentioned further education and, in doing so, put his finger on something important, namely the way in which further education supplies potential skills to industry, particularly SMEs. Coming, as I do, from a background in the hotel and catering industry, one of the biggest difficulties faced by employers over many years has been finding short courses that are relevant for their staff, rather than those designed by the lecturers, with all good intent, that do not deliver the skills that are wanted in the industry. It is important for people to get skills from further education establishments that are fit for purpose in SMEs.</p>
	<p pid="a.177.0/4">The hon. Member for Chorley underlined the importance of manufacturing. Although I will mention some of the bad things, I want to start by underlining, as he did, its importance to the economy and the success that it has enjoyed. The hon. Gentleman talked about the banks, which I will mention, too, because they are an important part of the mix, and about the success of the aerospace industry. I am sure that one of the firms at the back of his mind is Rolls-Royce. It is fascinating that Rolls-Royce, in my part of the world, is actively looking at marine renewable technology in Pentland firth. We have a real prospect, within a short time, of a number of companies using Rolls-Royce-manufactured kit to produce gigawatts of electricity consistently out of a great national resource. We need that kind of technology transfer, and we need more innovation and research and development in that area.</p>
	<p pid="a.177.0/5">Manufacturing has been in a fairly steady state of decline for a great number of years. I agree with the hon. Gentleman that Governments of both parties have not given it the attention that it deserves. It has dropped from 23.3 per cent. of gross value added within the economy in 1997 to 12.6 per cent. in 2007. This is partly due to the rapid growth of other parts of the economy, particularly the service sector. In real terms, manufacturing over that same decade has grown from &pound;150.2 billion to &pound;157.7 billion. The recession has clearly hit manufacturing output severely: in quarter 1 of 2009, it was down by some 13.1 per cent. over the year. That has obviously had a devastating impact on employment. The trend in jobs in manufacturing has clearly been declining. In 1998, the figure was more than 4 million, but last year it was around 2.6 million, so obviously it has reduced. But that masks part of the good news, which is that industry has been increasing productivity. The productivity of UK industry has been one part of the success story.</p>
	<p pid="a.177.0/6">Manufacturing industry is having a torrid time at the moment. I want to look briefly at the current causes of that, which are pretty obvious. At the back of it all is the credit crunch, which has caused the recession. On the banks&mdash;bank lending and regulation&mdash;it is clear that our banking system was insufficiently regulated, particularly with regard to the separation between retail and investment banking. The result of that was a risk in the system that was simply unpriced. The banking crisis has thrown up a deeper-seated problem. With the few friends that I have left in the City, I have to be careful exactly what I say about this, but it seems that we have a structural and cultural problem, which is that the City has been seen as the place to go to make money. The way that the City has operated, with ever more complex financial products chasing each other round and being traded almost for the sake of being traded, means that our financial services industry has been inefficient in its primary task of providing capital for industry.</p>
	<p pid="a.177.0/7">There is an opportunity in this current crisis to reshape the way in which our financial services industry serves industry generally. Rather than its making complex trades in complex products that turn out to be understood by nobody and of value to very few, we need to get back to the simple task of providing capital for industry to invest for the future. The City needs to go back to being the servant of commerce and stop trying to be the master of speculation. The other effect is that that industry has taken our best brains. Many of our best human resources have gone into financial services, rather than into industry. That culture carries across into the spirit of creating entrepreneurs. Indeed, when I said that I was going into the hotel industry, I saw a brief flash of pained expression in my mother's face because I had not chosen to go to university or take up a profession&mdash;although she rapidly reversed her view after I was successful. There is a view in Britain that it is better to go to university or a profession rather than into engineering or manufacturing, or to be an entrepreneur. We really need to tackle that as well.</p>
	<p pid="a.177.0/8">We need to develop skills, but, as I have said, skills must to be appropriate and further and higher education must reflect the needs of industry. We also need management skills. I recently chaired a symposium of the banks in my part of the world to try to connect small companies with their bankers and deal with some of the problems. The interesting thing that the bankers said was, &quot;For goodness' sake, please can we have real-time, proper management information?&quot; The number of SMEs that cannot produce such information is extraordinary.</p>
	<p pid="a.177.0/9">We need to focus on research and development and investment and we must get across those good ideas that we have produced. We need a method by which we can invest in entrepreneurs. In my part of the world, small bits of money are invested directly in small companies&mdash;not granted&mdash;by the North Highland Regeneration Fund, which is helping to take small entrepreneurs to the next step. The hon. Member for Manchester, Central put his finger on a point that we need to address.</p>
	<p pid="a.177.0/10">Looking to the future, I believe that there is a real opportunity. The recession has been devastating, and of that there is no doubt. Unemployment is up, and many companies are barely holding on. I shall not refer to green shoots, but I hope that we are seeing the bottom. Our job must be to create out of that adversity the opportunity to structure the economy for the future.</p>

	<p pid="a.179.0/1">I welcome you to the Chair, Mr. Fraser. This is the first occasion on which you have chaired a debate in which I have participated, and it is good to see you in your place.</p>
	<p pid="a.179.0/2">I welcome the Minister to his place on this first occasion in his new role. He is the seventh or eighth Minister whom I have shadowed in the past few years. It is good to see him in his place, and I hope that he will last a little longer than some of his predecessors.</p>
	<p pid="a.179.0/3"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1501" name="Lindsay Hoyle">The hon. Member for Chorley (Mr. Hoyle)</phrase> has a long and distinguished track record in raising important issues concerning manufacturing. He speaks with great passion and verve, and rightly so. He raised a matter that other hon. Members also raised&mdash;the role of procurement. The debate has been useful and timely, and I commend all hon. Members who have contributed to it, including <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1850" name="David Drew">the hon. Member for Stroud (Mr. Drew)</phrase>, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1940" name="Peter Luff">the Member for Mid-Worcestershire (Peter Luff)</phrase> and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1705" name="Tony Lloyd">the hon. Member for Manchester, Central (Tony Lloyd)</phrase>, who was right to consider the way in which procurement can be used without going down the path of protectionism. I share that sentiment.</p>
	<p pid="a.179.0/4">As all the contributors to the debate said, manufacturing matters. It represents 13 per cent. of our gross domestic product, and generates more than half of our exports. It helps us to pay our way around the world. As my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Worcestershire said, last year we were still the sixth-largest manufacturer in the world. We can and should take pride in the quality and strengths of the businesses and the work force in this country. We should not be unduly negative, cautious, careful and aware of the threats and problems, and we should not write manufacturing off.</p>
	<p pid="a.179.0/5">Clearly, the sector has had problems. One million jobs have been lost during the past dozen years or so, even before the current recession. Since 1997, 10 per cent. of manufacturing businesses have closed. I hear from business and industry about a continuing and rising sense of frustration at the Government's policies as key investments go elsewhere. For example, last year Rolls-Royce chose to locate a new testing facility in Germany, not in Derby. It told me that that was largely because of its frustration at the Government's lack of support. One of its directors said:</p>
	<p pid="a.179.0/6" class="indent">&quot;The Germans value manufacturing. There is better productivity and they have a better education system. Government&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.179.0/7">here</p>
	<p pid="a.179.0/8" class="indent">&quot;has chosen not to be competitive. Britain has caused this industry to export its capabilities&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.179.0/9">Despite talk from Ministers, it is clear that industry is unimpressed by the Government's inaction.</p>
	<p pid="a.179.0/10">It has been clear since the fall of Lehman Brothers last September and the collapse of world markets last autumn that urgent action has been needed, particularly in introducing working capital into businesses, so last November my party&mdash;the Conservatives&mdash;set out a plan for a single, national loan guarantee scheme worth &pound;50 billion for all viable businesses, whatever their size and sector. It was easy to access, clear, and simple to understand, and it would underpin conventional bank lending. That is also why we are committed to cutting the main corporation tax rate from 28p to 25p by simplifying the tax system. We want to reverse the Chancellor's policy of raising the small company corporation tax rate from 20p to 22p. In that way, we can directly help manufacturers, large and small, to invest with confidence for the future. As several hon. Members said, we also need to consider skills in the sector. We are committed to cutting payroll costs for the smallest employers for at least six months. That is the sort of practical action that industry wants, and it is what my party intends to provide.</p>
	<p pid="a.179.0/11">All of us in politics must be clear about how manufacturing is changing, as the hon. Member for Manchester, Central pointed out. First, we must recognise how globalisation has led to international fragmentation of production. The production of component and parts is spread increasingly not throughout countries, but throughout continents. That creates opportunities and threats. On one hand, global sourcing gives our manufacturers the chance to cut costs and to be competitive. On the other, British firms have no choice but to be globally competitive in their specialisation simply to survive.</p>
	<p pid="a.179.0/12">The Government can help small manufacturers in the challenge of accessing global value chains&mdash;we debated that earlier&mdash;especially in emerging high-growth markets. To be fair, they recognise that need, particularly in areas such as India and China, but it is not clear whether their policies are working. Perhaps the Minister will tell us what progress is being made to help small manufacturers in emerging markets.</p>
	<p pid="a.179.0/13">The second challenge for public policy is the increasing importance of intangible assets, such as design, branding and software, and it is important to consider carefully how they can be encouraged. It may seem counter-intuitive that such intangibles should matter to manufacturers, but the difference between a key manufacturer and its competitor often lies in its know-how and creativity. Fortunately, we have great strengths in design, whether in computer games or luxury car brands. We should have confidence in our belief that we can build on those strengths. A crucial issue&mdash;it would be helpful if the Minister responded to this&mdash;is the Government's progress in protecting our intellectual property. Leading manufacturers cite intellectual property's critical role and their ability to maintain their position. Perhaps the Minister will tell us what the Government have done about that during the past six months.</p>
	<p pid="a.179.0/14">Perhaps a more pressing question that many manufacturers raise with me is the growing gap between schemes that the Government have announced and the money that businesses have received. There seems to be a gulf between Ministers' rhetoric and the reality in the business world. Instead of our plan for a single loan guarantee scheme, Ministers have launched a plethora of schemes, but have failed to make them work. We have the working capital scheme, the enterprise finance guarantee scheme, the capital for enterprise fund, the transition loan fund, the European Investment Bank's supported loan scheme for growing firms, the EIB-backed automotive industry loan scheme, and the &pound;1 billion non-EIB-backed automotive loan scheme. All have different rules and criteria. They have different forms and require different business data. The result is confusion for businesses, and failure to deliver in Whitehall.</p>
	<p pid="a.179.0/15">The capital for enterprise fund, for example, is worth &pound;75 million for expanding firms. It was launched in November, and we were told that it would invest from January, but in June reports from the Government suggested that nothing had been invested. Perhaps the Minister will confirm whether any business has received money and, if not, why not.</p>
	<p pid="a.179.0/16">The automotive assistance programme comprises two elements: a &pound;1.3 billion loan guarantee from the European Investment Bank, and a &pound;1 billion additional loan guarantee to help the car industry to develop low-carbon technologies. The programme was announced in January, when the French and German Governments had already delivered money to their car makers. Since then, Ministers have dithered and delayed in working out schemes and negotiating with companies. In February, <i>The Birmingham Post</i>, frustrated by the lack of progress, wrote an open and critical letter to the noble Lord Mandelson asking when Ministers would act. February went, and March came and went, but in April Ministers proudly announced a loan of &pound;340 million for Jaguar Land Rover and a &pound;370 million loan for Nissan. That was good news, but on <phrase class="date" code="2009-05-06">6 May</phrase> it became clear that the talks with Tata were slipping and struggling, and in danger of collapse. So here we are, five months on, and it is still unclear exactly what has happened to the money. Will the Minister tell us whether a British company has received funds under that programme? The German Government have delivered, and the French and Italian Governments have delivered. Why under our Government are British manufacturers the last to receive the help that they have been promised?</p>
	<p pid="a.179.0/17">The Prime Minister likes to talk about providing real help, and I suspect that he needs it at the moment, but he and his ministerial colleagues need to realise that talk is cheap. At the moment, their record is one of press releases, not practical action. It is a tale of dither and delay, of bold promises and then timid deeds. I have no doubt that Ministers wish to help, but my fear is that the gap between their rhetoric and the reality for businesses is one through which hundreds of manufacturers and thousands of workers could yet be lost.</p>

	<p pid="a.182.0/1">It is a pleasure to serve for the first time under your chairmanship, Mr. Fraser; I welcome you to that role. I thank <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1631" name="Mark Prisk">the hon. Member for Hertford and Stortford (Mr. Prisk)</phrase> for his generosity in wishing me a long period in post. I am not sure that that is officially his party's policy, but I thank him in any case.</p>
	<p pid="a.182.0/2">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1501" name="Lindsay Hoyle">the Member for Chorley (Mr. Hoyle)</phrase> on securing this timely and important debate on manufacturing and employment. In the very short time that I have been in post, I have already learned that he is very active in this field. He raised a number of issues, which I shall come to in my remarks, including wage subsidies and whether it is too easy to get rid of workers in the United Kingdom.</p>
	<p pid="a.182.0/3">I also congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1850" name="David Drew">the Member for Stroud (Mr. Drew)</phrase> on his contribution. He gave examples of successful manufacturers in his constituency, including Renishaw and Delphi, and talked, importantly, about the help that Train to Gain has been able to offer those companies during the current economic downturn. He asked a series of specific questions. I shall have to write to him about those; I have put that on the record to ensure that it happens.</p>
	<p pid="a.182.0/4">I also congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1705" name="Tony Lloyd">the Member for Manchester, Central (Tony Lloyd)</phrase>, who made the important points that his city would not exist as we know it if it had not been for free trade, and that in supporting British manufacturing we need to ensure that we note the importance of international trade. He made very good points about procurement and about further education and apprenticeships.</p>
	<p pid="a.182.0/5">This has been an important and interesting debate. The Government are deeply conscious of the importance of the manufacturing sector to all our constituencies and to the country as a whole. After all, it is what catapulted this country on to the world stage in the first place. Long before globalisation was a term in common usage, Britain was regarded as the workshop of the world, exporting more than half its iron, coal and cotton cloth. The constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Chorley played a vital role in the cotton industry as part of that.</p>
	<p pid="a.182.0/6">Of course, times have changed and manufacturing is changing with the times, shifting its base towards more and more high-tech manufacturing. Companies are developing in exciting new areas such as fuel cells, plastic electronics and Bluetooth technology. Traditional sectors have reinvented themselves through information and communications technology, software and new technologies such as robotics and materials. Nevertheless, our capability in advanced engineering remains world class.</p>
	<p pid="a.182.0/7">Despite the changes in manufacturing industry, it remains in some ways the unsung hero of the British economy. The statistics only partially indicate the significance of the manufacturing industry to our economy. However, as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1966" name="John Thurso">the hon. Member for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross (John Thurso)</phrase> said, we remain a major manufacturer in world terms. We are the sixth-largest manufacturer in terms of value. At the end of 2008, the manufacturing industries in this country employed close to 3 million people and accounted for 12.6 per cent. or &pound;157.7 billion of our national output. In addition, as my hon. Friend the Member for Chorley said, manufacturing is responsible for 75 per cent. of our business research and development. Even taking account of the global economic downturn, productivity in manufacturing has been growing at a rapid rate in the UK; it has grown by more than 50 per cent. since 1997. As the hon. Member for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross pointed out, that is growth in real terms, albeit at a time when other sectors of the economy have been growing more rapidly because of the changes that we have seen in the structure of our economy.</p>
	<p pid="a.182.0/8">However, we are here today because of the points that my hon. Friend the Member for Chorley made about the way in which manufacturing, along with other sectors, is suffering in the global recession. The latest data show that manufacturing output has fallen for 13 months in a row. That is also happening in other countries, but as he pointed out, that is no consolation to the hard-working men and women in our communities who have jobs in manufacturing and who are affected by those changes. Nor is it any consolation to those who have had to switch to short-time working or who have had to lose their jobs as a result of the economic downturn.</p>
	<p pid="a.182.0/9">In many of the communities affected, memories are still fresh of the 1980s and '90s. Then, when there was a downturn and manufacturing was suffering, there was a very different response&mdash;some would say no response&mdash;from the Government. It was an approach not of trying to be fair to those communities, but of simply being laissez-faire in their attitude towards the economic downturn and towards manufacturing at that time. That has changed.</p>

	<p pid="a.184.0/1">I am grateful to my hon. Friend for his intervention, which was, as ever, very helpful, fair and reasonable. In the short time left, I shall try to address the point that I think he wanted to get to in the debate, which is his debate, after all. I am referring to wage subsidies. That is something that the Government have carefully and extensively examined. There are two reasons why currently the Government have not decided to proceed with the idea. First, there is the question whether such schemes can be effective and would be value for money. Secondly, there is the experience of that idea in the past. My hon. Friend the Member for Stroud mentioned the 1970s, when wage subsidies were in place. The question is whether what happened represented value for money or whether firms took the subsidy and did what they would have done anyway.</p>
	<p pid="a.184.0/2">That said, the Government do understand the anxiety and difficulty faced by people who find themselves out of pocket on shorter working weeks, so we are ensuring that there is support for them. We have expanded the Train to Gain scheme. Hon. Members acknowledged that during the debate. That is the Government's flagship skills service that supports employers of all sizes and in all sectors to improve their employees' skills. From January of this year, struggling small and medium-sized enterprises have been able to access increased training provision to help them to emerge stronger in the upturn. That includes bite-size qualifications in business-critical areas and more funding for second qualifications. In the meantime, individuals and families on tax credits will see an automatic increase in the money that they receive, to compensate for the loss of income. In March, for example, 355,000 families were receiving on average &pound;35 a week more support through tax credits.</p>
	<p pid="a.184.0/3">Where there are significant redundancies in the manufacturing sector, the rapid response service is working to move people quickly into new jobs, preventing them from becoming detached from the labour market. We have doubled the funding for the service already and will double it again. As we are particularly concerned to help the long-term unemployed, we are also making available 75,000 further education training places for Jobcentre Plus referrals after six months' unemployment, taking on board the important points that hon. Members made about further education.</p>
	<p pid="a.184.0/4">I would like to go on and outline how we are preparing for the upturn, which we hope is coming&mdash;many hon. Members referred to that&mdash;but I fear that time will not allow me to do so. Our challenge now is to ensure that our manufacturing sector is ready to lead the industrial revolution of tomorrow, just as this country led the industrial revolution of the past.</p>

	Council Tax Capping (Surrey)
</minor-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-06-09a.185.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1718" speakername="Paul Beresford" colnum="185"  time="011:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090609/halltext/90609h0004.htm#09060973000530">
	<p pid="a.185.1/1">I am delighted that you are our Chairman, Mr. Fraser. I am also delighted to have so many of my colleagues here&mdash;they look a little like a Maori Haka troupe, and I hope that the Minister will take note of that. We have a mascot as well&mdash;<i>[</i><i>Interruption.</i><i>]</i> Perhaps I should wait until the Minister is seated and listening.</p>
	<p pid="a.185.1/2">I am grateful for the opportunity to raise this subject for debate. I think that I am correct in saying that every Surrey MP, whether they are here or not, backs what I have to say. We have deep concerns about the effects of capping and the re-billing of the capped council tax, which the Government have, as anticipated, demanded. We all realise that the order that is required to introduce capping has yet to be introduced, and the Minister may feel even more limited in what he can say, but I have called the debate to persuade him that if he continues with capping by introducing the order, he should do so in such a way as not to require re-billing. He also needs to recognise that all of us in Surrey believe in value for money and in protecting the council tax payer.</p>
	<p pid="a.185.1/3">In looking at the effects of capping on Surrey police and of the pending requirement to re-bill all Surrey for its council tax, I need to do a certain amount of scene setting. Surrey police are a county force, but with metropolitan challenges. They describe the county as a target-rich environment, with a disproportionate number of high-risk potential targets. Her Majesty's inspectorate of constabulary says that Surrey police are in the top half of our country's forces in terms of the threat from organised crime. With the county being criss-crossed by some of the busiest motorways in Europe, and with Heathrow on one side and Gatwick on the other, the threats are obvious.</p>
	<p pid="a.185.1/4">Surrey's close proximity to London explains why approximately half the criminal activity in the county is perpetrated by those living outside it. To take one example from last year, Surrey tackled 17 organised crime groups, of which 12 were London based. That cost Surrey at least &pound;40 million. The police grant for Surrey is the lowest per head in the country. As a consequence, council tax payers, unlike those in every other police authority, share the cost of our police at a ratio of 49: 51. Furthermore, there has been a year-on-year real-terms reduction in police grant over the past 12 years.</p>
	<p pid="a.185.1/5">Surrey police have responded, as we would hope, by delivering more in a better way and for less. A recent Audit Commission assessment of the authority's value for money gave Surrey police the highest rating in 2007-08. The commission's report said:</p>
	<p pid="a.185.1/6" class="indent">&quot;When compared to similar forces Surrey Police receives a very low level of grant funding from central government and has the lowest expenditure per Band D property of any force in England and Wales. The high level of performance from a relatively low level of funding demonstrates excellent value for money to the taxpayer&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.185.1/7">During its inspections last year, HMIC also gave the performance of Surrey police a glowing report. More importantly perhaps, ratings from victims who were surveyed and from the general public give Surrey police a satisfaction rate of more than 80 per cent. Surrey police work on the basis of being a modern, innovative police force. They have led the way in developing neighbourhood policing, work force modernisation and common-sense policing.</p>

	<p pid="a.186.0/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend on calling this incredibly important debate on an issue about which people in Surrey feel extremely strongly. He mentioned neighbourhood policing, but does he agree that however frustrated people in Surrey feel about the many failures of Government policy on law and order, neighbourhood policing is perhaps the one area in which they feel that there have been huge improvements in recent years? It would be an enormous tragedy if rate capping and the loss of 50 police posts led to cuts in the one area of policy that seems to have been working.</p>

	<p pid="a.186.1/1">I thank my hon. Friend. He has picked on one of the key points that I and, I assume, many of my hon. Friends will touch on later in this short debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.186.1/2">In setting their 2009-10 budget, Surrey police have been forced to cut another 144 posts by focusing on non-operational areas and investing in new technology. They have also managed to move extra resources to the front line. Without capping, the force is, in essence, delivering unrivalled value for money for the community. The latest reductions were carefully considered and programmed early, without the urgency that will come from capping and re-billing. It is astonishing that the police authority has been singled out for capping when it clearly delivers value for money.</p>

	<p pid="a.186.2/1">I, too, congratulate my hon. Friend on securing the debate. While he is setting the scene, will he explain the scale of the reduction in grant funding that Surrey has had to undergo since 1997? I believe that it is in the region of 40 per cent. in real terms.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-06-09a.186.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1718" speakername="Paul Beresford" colnum="186"  time="011:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090609/halltext/90609h0004.htm#09060973000534">
	<p pid="a.186.3/1">I thank my hon. Friend. He is right. In 1997, Surrey police received &pound;96 per head of population in Government grant. Twelve years later, in 2009, Surrey residents received &pound;93 per person in police grant. That is a real-terms reduction of 39&mdash;not quite 40&mdash;per cent.</p>
	<p pid="a.186.3/2">Surrey police force and the Surrey policy authority have reached their tipping point, and operational policing in Surrey can no longer be protected from the cumulative effects of more than a decade of underfunding, let alone any capping or re-billing. Last month, the former Home Secretary gave a commitment to maintain increased funding for the police grant, which she said would enable the Government at least to maintain police numbers. That may be true across the whole nation, but it is certainly not true in Surrey, and it will be even less true with capping, re-billing and the progressive annual tightening of the budget.</p>
	<p pid="a.186.3/3">Of course, there is an argument over the figures. Last year, the Secretary of State set out a net budget requirement increase of 4.82 per cent., but the actual increase in the net budget requirement was 3.82 per cent. This year, the increase in the precept levied by Surrey police was 4.89 per cent., but to my surprise, I discovered that the Department for Communities and Local Government claimed that the precept had risen by 7.07 per cent. The Department based that on a notional precept, and the idea of a notional precept is key.</p>
	<p pid="a.186.3/4">There is also an argument over reserves. Surrey police have reserves of &pound;9.4 million, much of which is clearly not available, because, technically, only general reserves are available for expenditure. Those reserves stand at &pound;5.6 million, or 2.6 per cent. of the budget, but HMIC and the Audit Commission insist that that be lifted to 3 per cent. That, too, will have an impact, on top of the capping and the re-billing expenditure.</p>
	<p pid="a.186.3/5">As someone who has, in the past, been involved in programmed expenditure cuts, I am abundantly aware of the fact that one of the worst effects of capping is that it is applied at the beginning of, or during, the financial year in question. That means that cuts in expenditure at a late stage in the financial year must compensate for the failure to achieve a full-year effect from the beginning of the financial year&mdash;in simple terms, the percentage cut must be higher to achieve the full-year effect.</p>
	<p pid="a.186.3/6">With the prospect of capping in mind, the authority began setting this year's budget in July 2008. The budget was carefully calculated and took account of the principles set out by the Secretary of State. The idea of a notional precept was raised, and Surrey police finance officials shared their concerns with lawyers from the Department for Communities and Local Government. The lawyers confirmed in writing that</p>
	<p pid="a.186.3/7" class="indent">&quot;there is no requirement on the Surrey police authority to calculate the notional level of Council Tax (based on the notional budget requirement) 2008/09 and Surrey police authority will set their budget requirement and their precept for 2009/10...in the normal way&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.186.3/8">To avoid capping and its effects, the authority carefully calculated the budget. Three days before setting the budget, the Department announced a notional 2008-09 budget and a notional band D council tax. That left the police authority with the threat of capping. Given that the cuts arising from capping were late and unplanned, they had an extra detrimental effect on the force.</p>
	<p pid="a.186.3/9">In the past financial year, the Surrey police work force was 4,229-strong. The continuing prospect of capping means that the authority must produce a progressive extrapolation of financial constraints, which produces a series of cuts as the Surrey police authority calculates its manpower for the years 2009-10 to 20012-13. That commences with the loss of 159 personnel this year, with a total loss of 373 personnel by the end of the process, and that is before designation and re-billing.</p>

	<p pid="a.187.0/1">Does my hon. Friend share my frustration not only that are there significant manpower issues in relation to the capping itself, but that the re-billing exercise will add an additional cost that is wholly unnecessary and will put extra burdens on the district councils required to carry it out and lead to a further cut in manpower, at a time when a county that must deal with the policing of Heathrow, the M25 and Gatwick airport will also, I fear, face increased overspill crime from London, because of a rise in property crime rates resulting from the recession? Does he agree that the capping is the wrong thing to do, at the wrong time?</p>

	<p pid="a.187.1/1">Completely; I think that all Opposition Members would agree with that statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.187.1/2">The cost of designation is a further &pound;1.6 million cut. The cumulative effect, over the same period, is another 55 personnel. Re-billing will cost Surrey police authority &pound;1.2 million, and that translates into a further manpower reduction of 24. Over that time the population increase in Surrey will continue, and so will the threat of crime&mdash;particularly cross-border crime&mdash;and the anticipated threat of terrorism. The broad figures are that if the Government insist on going ahead with the capping order, and on re-billing, it will cost Surrey police authority &pound;1.2 million to reduce the council tax bill by &pound;1.6 million.</p>
	<p pid="a.187.1/3">On Thursday, I received a response to a parliamentary question, from the Minister of State for Local Government that stated:</p>
	<p pid="a.187.1/4" class="indent">&quot;Subject to the approval of an order by the House of Commons, the reduction in Band D council tax in Surrey as a result of capping will be &pound;3.18.&quot;&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2009-06-04.678"><i>Official Report</i>, 4 June 2009; Vol. 493, c. 678W</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="a.187.1/5">According to Mole Valley district council, my main billing authority, the overall cost to it of re-billing is &pound;172,000. That translates to an approximate cost per bill of &pound;4.65. That means that in band D it costs &pound;1.47 more than the reduction. Obviously, the balance is worse for the lower bands. It is not until band F that the negative balance is reversed. I hope that the Minister can visualise the huge sigh of relief in every band D household as the annual bill drops, by the Government's order, by &pound;3.18. I can see thousands of taxpayers rushing to buy a bottle of cheap wine, equivalent to &pound;3.18, to celebrate. However, as most of them pay in 10 instalments, the reduction will be 32p a month over 10 months. Perhaps after saving 32p a month for 10 months it will be a pint of beer, a packet of crisps and a packet of peanuts at the pub.</p>

	<p pid="a.188.0/1">Does my hon. Friend agree that at a time when public spending will be tightly constrained anyway it is incumbent on Governments to ensure that every penny of public money is carefully used, and that the Government have failed abjectly to do that in the case that is being outlined? First, they have failed to set out clearly what was required of Surrey police authority, so that it could take action that would not lead to the present situation; secondly, they have proposed a disproportionate response, which no taxpayer will accept as a sensible way of dealing with a rather small excess, as it will, as my hon. Friend has pointed out, cost nearly the entirety of what will be recovered to undertake re-billing.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-06-09a.188.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1718" speakername="Paul Beresford" colnum="188"  time="011:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090609/halltext/90609h0005.htm#09060973000538">
	<p pid="a.188.1/1">My hon. Friend's timing is perfect. I expect the effect of the re-billing notice on most council tax payers to be confusion or bemusement. If they are aware of the cost of the re-billing to the already strapped police force, they will be furious. Local authorities throughout Surrey will have to reset their direct debits for every council tax payer who pays by that means. Many thousands of people pay by bankers' orders and will have to send off new bankers' order forms, which will probably cost about 20 per cent. of the so-called saving, and there may be additional costs at the banks.</p>
	<p pid="a.188.1/2">That is perhaps the smile side, if there is one, to the re-billing problem, but there is a deeply serious effect. My constituency is a mixture of rural and semi-rural. It has two main towns&mdash;Dorking and Leatherhead&mdash;and approximately 32 villages spread across the countryside, and considerable numbers of relatively isolated houses in between. In the past several years, organised crime and individual thefts of agricultural property on Surrey farms have cost hundreds of thousands of pounds a year. Several years ago, such crime was successfully targeted by a special police team in Surrey, and following its success, Surrey police set up a single liaison officer for farmers, known as the farm liaison officer. That was a full-time job. With last year's cuts it became a half-time job. I am concerned that, as Surrey police authority looks around for further savings because of the re-billing and the designation, that key officer may have to be drawn back in, and the post may go.</p>
	<p pid="a.188.1/3">Antisocial behaviour is a big problem at the moment. It is continually sprouting up in my area, showing its ugly head in forms varying from general abuse through to shop and household window-breaking. It has now moved on to unlawful purchasing and semi-organised theft, by groups, of alcohol. The latest problem is a series of serious arson attacks in different towns and villages. Generally, Surrey police have been successful in stemming the tide of those activities and acting either pre-emptively or preventively. When that is not possible, there has been an organised attack on the problem. However, the greatest value comes, as was mentioned in an intervention by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1859" name="Jeremy Hunt">the Member for South-West Surrey (Mr. Hunt)</phrase>, from neighbourhood specialist officers. Those individuals are present in the neighbouring police force, where they are also very successful. The Metropolitan police have one neighbourhood specialist officer per 100 crimes. At the moment&mdash;before the cuts that will have to be made&mdash;Surrey police have less than half a neighbourhood specialist officer per 100 crimes. I have been talking to a local police inspector in one of my towns, which is having a lot of difficulty from three dozen or so youths, who work either in groups or gangs. The most likely effect of capping is that the inspector may have to reduce the number of front-line neighbourhood officers following the capping and re-billing.</p>

To add to the arguably incorrect injury the unnecessary cost of re-billing each council tax payer for such a minuscule amount is ludicrous. I ask the Minister to accept, if the Government win the anticipated judicial review, that although they will have made their point&mdash;however erroneous&mdash;they should not require the unnecessary re-billing.

	<p pid="a.190.2/1">It is an honour to serve under your chairmanship, Mr. Fraser, and a pleasure to follow my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1718" name="Paul Beresford">the Member for Mole Valley (Sir Paul Beresford)</phrase>. He initiated the debate but, as has already been pointed out, all Surrey MPs are very much alongside him. It takes quite a lot to pull all the Surrey MPs together on one issue, but today we are debating that issue, which is county-wide. The Government's attitude to Surrey police beggars belief. One of the best forces is being undermined, year by year, by the Government's funding formula.</p>
	<p pid="a.190.2/2">The force is being treated as a rural force but it is on the outskirts of London. As my hon. Friend said, its area is criss-crossed by major roads. Several times, it has had to respond to terrorist outbreaks at the airports on either side, at Heathrow and Gatwick. The county also suffers from trans-border crime, which crosses into it from London&mdash;and particularly into my constituency, which borders it. It suffers from a disparity of treatment between the Metropolitan police and the Surrey police force.</p>
	<p pid="a.190.2/3">Surrey Members with borders that are contiguous with London know that at the beginning of this decade some of their constituencies were covered by the Metropolitan police. That changed when the then Home Secretary agreed that Surrey would be properly respected. Its ordinary policemen and women are under a lot of pressure; they are trained in Surrey but are often attracted by higher wages and salaries to the capital. London, of course, is much better funded. I was one of those who supported Surrey having its own police force.</p>
	<p pid="a.190.2/4">I ask the Government to think carefully about a matter of equity. Given that council tax payers in Surrey contribute almost 50 per cent. of the cost of the Surrey police, it is incumbent on the Government to reconsider the formula. Given that the Surrey taxpayer contributes considerable sums to the country's overall tax revenues, and that we are helping to fund other parts of the country, it would be appropriate for us to be given slightly better treatment when it comes to the funding of the Surrey force. To make matters worse, we are being capped. As my hon. Friend so eloquently pointed out, capping yields little except disadvantage to people who live in Surrey. The effect is alarming. The cost of the refunding equates to 24 officers&mdash;at least two per borough in Surrey might need to be taken out.</p>
	<p pid="a.190.2/5">All Surrey Members could argue about the importance of their local police. For instance, two of my police stations are manned by volunteers. They provide an excellent service for the community, and they receive a lot of support from the officers; they, too, do a tremendous job. However, we may be losing the volunteers, in Cobham and elsewhere, despite the fact that they have provided an identifiable service to the public, reassuring the public that they are being protected.</p>
	<p pid="a.190.2/6">The other issue that Surrey police have to face, apart from the question of community and neighbourhood policing, is that occasional big events require them to keep financial reserves. The Government cannot decide that reserves should be raided to suit their political policies. They are necessary; incidents, including terrorist incidents, need a response, as do major crimes. For instance, some years ago Milly Dowler was murdered outside Walton station. The police investigation continues; in theory, it is still ongoing, but the inquiry continued for several years at virtually full strength, until the allegation was made that someone who is now behind bars for other reasons may have committed the crime.</p>
	<p pid="a.190.2/7">Surrey police need to respond to other issues, but that often requires them to make exceptional calls on reserves in order to meet the additional costs. In the past, when I and my colleagues have taken up cases, we have lobbied the Government for better treatment in order to balance the county's financial position. For instance, it sometimes has to respond to events at Heathrow&mdash;and not only terrorism: occasionally, misguided environmental protests require a lot of police attention, and security is a concern.</p>
	<p pid="a.190.2/8">We are looking for a sensible balance. First, we should avoid rebilling. That is the principal reason for today's debate. Secondly, we should reconsider how the funding formula works. In equity, it must be wrong to undermine progressively a force that has already made substantial cuts, year on year, and that will need to do so again. Thirdly, the Government should persuade the people of Surrey that they, the Government, understand that undermining a police force is not the way to improve people's sense of security.</p>
	<p pid="a.190.2/9">The Government have made a monumental misjudgment. It is a miscalculation, based on a theoretical precept, and it should be abandoned. Whether it should be abandoned after judicial review I shall not say, but it should certainly be withdrawn gracefully. The Surrey police force should be allowed to rebuild, to help the people of Surrey feel secure; they live on the edge of London and are already paying half the cost of the force.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-06-09a.191.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1603" speakername="Anne Milton" colnum="191"  time="011:25:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090609/halltext/90609h0005.htm#09060973000544">
	<p pid="a.191.0/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1718" name="Paul Beresford">the Member for Mole Valley (Sir Paul Beresford)</phrase> on securing this debate. As we have heard, it is hard to herd Surrey MPs. The fact that we are all here shows our strength of feeling, and I hope that the Minister will take note of that.</p>
	<p pid="a.191.0/2">As time is short, I shall not say more on matters that were so eloquently mentioned by my hon. Friend. However, some key factors must be re-emphasised. Surrey police force is a county force with urban challenges; it borders two airports and some of the busiest motorways in London. Half of the crime there is committed by people from outside Surrey. Indeed, Lord West acknowledged criminals as</p>
	<p pid="a.191.0/3" class="indent">&quot;people doing 'away days' from London in order to redistribute wealth.&quot;&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="lords/2009-01-12.1012"><i>Official Report, House of Lords,</i> 12 January 2009; Vol. 706, c. 1012</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="a.191.0/4">The Audit Commission assessment states that there is no doubt that Surrey police have managed their affairs and finances excellently and that they give value for money of the highest grade, being one of only six forces that achieved that status in 2007-08. It has the lowest expenditure per band D property.</p>
	<p pid="a.191.0/5">Much of what Surrey police do is excellent, but with tight resources it is not always perfect. To a large extent, resourcing has been a continuing problem for the force, and it acknowledges that it cannot always give the service that it would like. Rightly, it is cutting 144 back-office jobs and replacing them with technology improvements to hold on to its front-line force, but it faces losing another 50 front-line jobs if the Government have their way.</p>
	<p pid="a.191.0/6">Policing in Guildford is not easy. We have a busy night-time economy, persistent crime in the large rural areas, and some serious antisocial behaviour, much of which involves criminal damage. Indeed, antisocial behaviour is often a euphemism for crime. There is terrible criminal damage; someone stole a saw and cut down trees on an estate; elderly residents are being terrorised and are afraid to go out in the evenings; and a local business woman could not cope with the police response to the number of racist and violent attacks on her staff and now employs her own private security. It is not good enough.</p>
	<p pid="a.191.0/7">Given the tight police budgets, with the best will in the world the police cannot respond as they want; they are angry and the public are frustrated. Too many kids are getting away with completely unacceptable behaviour. I cannot speak too highly of the community wardens, the police and community support officers and the neighbourhood specialist officers in Guildford. However, poor resources leave many areas badly wanting. The public are not getting the service that they deserve; it falls well short.</p>
	<p pid="a.191.0/8">I now give a quick plug to the Street Angels project in Guildford. Those not familiar with Street Angels should come to Guildford in the evening and watch. Set up by the churches in Guildford, they support the town police. Surrey police have been excellent in working with them, and we have seen a real drop in crime. None the less, it is difficult.</p>
	<p pid="a.191.0/9">I get very tired of having to listen to Ministers telling us what they are giving us. The truth is that in 1997 we were receiving &pound;96 per head; in 2009 we are getting &pound;93 per head. As a result, 50 per cent. of the funding comes from the council tax payer; elsewhere in the country, it is approximately 25 per cent. We in Surrey raise a lot of money for the Treasury, and we are not getting a good deal in return.</p>
	<p pid="a.191.0/10">This year, the situation is ridiculous. The Government rejected attempts by Surrey police to meet officials and Ministers. The Department for Communities and Local Government created the notional precept, and I know that the Surrey police force is considering taking legal action on that. Police officials raised the concept of a notional precept with the DCLG, but were reassured that they should set their budget as normal. Three days before the Surrey police authority set its budget, the Government wrote to say that they had not yet determined any capping principles. With officials refusing to talk to it, Surrey police authority had to set a budget in the dark.</p>
	<p pid="a.191.0/11">I hope that the Minister will respond to many of the arguments raised today. Everyone in Surrey, and Guildford in particular, wants their council tax bills to fall, but they also want to be safe. The police struggle, and the public are cross, fearful and not getting the service that they deserve. The Minister has it within his power to reconsider this matter before he lays the draft order. I hope that he does not come out with the usual platitudes. We have heard that the Prime Minister is very keen to listen to people, and I sincerely hope that the Minister will take this opportunity to listen to the people of Surrey.</p>

	<p pid="a.193.0/1">It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Mr. Fraser, and I offer my very sincere congratulations to my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1718" name="Paul Beresford">the Member for Mole Valley (Sir Paul Beresford)</phrase> on securing this debate. I thank him and my hon. Friends the Members for Esher and Walton (Mr. Taylor) and for Guildford (Anne Milton) for laying out the arguments. It bears repeating to the Minister that the fact that all available Surrey MPs are here today proves that we all feel very strongly about the matter before us.</p>
	<p pid="a.193.0/2">In this brief speech, I shall not deal with some of the arguments made already&mdash;they were well made and stand up&mdash;but focus only on terrorism as it affects Surrey. It is a real problem for Surrey police and their funding. As has been said, Heathrow and Gatwick, the two principal airports in this country, are on our borders. I am old enough&mdash;I do not suspect that you are, Mr. Fraser&mdash;to remember the days when a separate police force for our airports was in existence. It might have been 30 years ago&mdash;I cannot remember&mdash;but it was a very long time ago when the British Airports Authority police, which was an entirely separate force, looked after policing issues at Gatwick and Heathrow.</p>
	<p pid="a.193.0/3">In those days, many of today's problems did not exist, and it was right that there came a time when the terrorism situation&mdash;an incident at Heathrow perhaps&mdash;resulted in the abolition, in due course, of those police forces specifically covering Gatwick and Heathrow. It meant that the threat of terrorism associated with our airports had been recognised. Surrey police&mdash;I know this because I have spoken to the chief constable and many others&mdash;have had to invest much time and money in protecting the county and its surrounding areas from terrorist threats. This is a very serious issue.</p>
	<p pid="a.193.0/4">A few months ago, I visited the noble Lord West, the security Minister, to discuss terrorism, especially in relation to Surrey, and the question of funding. I and the noble Lord Trefgarne, who was also at the meeting&mdash;he is a Woking resident and takes a great interest in these matters&mdash;made Lord West well aware of the real-term cuts and the awful way in which we think that Surrey police have been treated financially over the years. We also made a very strong statement to him about terrorist and other such threats in our county, and went into confidential matters that I cannot repeat today&mdash;they followed detailed briefings that we had received. We also put to him very clearly the argument about the funding basis.</p>
	<p pid="a.193.0/5">I expect the Minister to tell me that he has met with Lord West to discuss what I and Lord Trefgarne said to him. I expect that the Minister knows the date of the meeting and has been briefed about it and our position. What was the result of our meeting? Were our fears and concerns taken on board? It seems to me and Lord Trefgarne that our concerns, emanating from the very top of Surrey police force, about this huge issue of terrorism, have not been recognised and taken into account.</p>
	<p pid="a.193.0/6">That is the only issue that I want to raise today, because I take a particular interest in it. My constituents agree with the powerful arguments made by my hon. Friends today. Their concerns are felt deeply throughout Surrey, not only by residents themselves&mdash;they, after all, are the most important people&mdash;but by the Members of Parliament who represent them. That is why we are here today laying out our compelling arguments, one of which is about funding in relation to terrorist threats. I hope that the Minister will deal with that specifically when he replies.</p>

	<p pid="a.194.0/1">It is a pleasure to be down here, for a change, rather than where you are, Mr. Fraser, and able to make a speech in Westminster Hall.</p>
	<p pid="a.194.0/2">Until the Government set up the Greater London authority, the whole of my constituency was part of the Metropolitan police district. The Government argued that my constituents would get better policing and feel more comfortable with a county constabulary than by being policed by London. Like my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1933" name="Humfrey Malins">the Member for Woking (Mr. Malins)</phrase>, I believed and supported them. Years later, I find myself having to say that what is being delivered, through no fault of Surrey police, is not what we would have expected had we remained within the Metropolitan police district. Do not get me wrong&mdash;I do not want to return to it&mdash;but we were told that the service would improve, but the reality is as has been depicted today.</p>
	<p pid="a.194.0/3">Like my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1718" name="Paul Beresford">the Member for Mole Valley (Sir Paul Beresford)</phrase>, who introduced this debate, I have long experience of local government and have watched successive Governments introduce formulas, add to them, simplify them, abolish them and reintroduce them, in the fond belief that they can find one that will get everything right, everywhere. But they cannot! There have to be special cases. The worst possible sort of formula is an inflexible one, which is what we are dealing with this morning. My hon. Friend was worried about mentioning common sense. I do not apologise for mentioning it, because I was brought up by a headmaster who would not have more than 12 rules in his school. He insisted that the 12th was that the above 11 were no substitute for common sense. That is the issue today.</p>
	<p pid="a.194.0/4">Surrey faces special problems that the Government refuse to recognise. I shall briefly mention three of them. The first, which has been mentioned already, is Heathrow, parts of which are in my constituency, although the airfield itself is not. Of the 30-odd sites that are checked regularly as possible places from which terrorists could attack the airport, a goodly number are in my constituency. Already, due to the pressures, Surrey police has to get the Met to help it do the job that the Government expect it to do but will not fund it properly to do. The Government are introducing measures to force BAA to pay the full cost to the Met of policing the airfield, but to the best of my knowledge&mdash;perhaps the Minister will correct me&mdash;no attempt has been made to allow the knock-on costs to Surrey to be charged to BAA as well. Our constituents have to pay for that, and if ever there were a special case, that is it. Some concession must be made for the Government's ever-growing demands for security measures at Heathrow. I am sure that my hon. Friends who know more about Gatwick than I do would advance the same case. However, Heathrow is on my doorstep, so I make that case myself.</p>

	<p pid="a.195.0/1">As a Member whose constituency borders Gatwick, I confirm that my hon. Friend is right. May I add another thing that has not been mentioned? One of the biggest crime hotspots in my constituency is Clacket Lane service station on the M25, which is a hotbed of vice of all kinds and a real problem for those policing the eastern part of Surrey. Let us not forget the problems created there as well.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-06-09a.195.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1832" speakername="David Wilshire" colnum="195"  time="011:35:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090609/halltext/90609h0006.htm#09060973000548">
	<p pid="a.195.1/1">I have been a customer of my hon. Friend's service station&mdash;I hope that I did not add to the crime while I was there&mdash;which gives me the opportunity to mention my concern about motorway issues. In places, the constituency boundary goes down the middle of the carriageway. My constituency includes the busiest part of the M25, which is the busiest motorway in the United Kingdom. There has been no recognition of that or the fact that the Staines junction, junction 13, has the highest accident record of any junction on the whole of the M25&mdash;that was true the last time that I checked. The formula does not take into account the special case that arises there. The county force is expected to deliver the quality of service that everyone has a right to expect, when those involved in accidents on the M25 are not often residents of Surrey. It is very rare for a Surrey resident to be involved in such an accident, so our constituents have to pay the cost of other people's accidents, which is unreasonable.</p>
	<p pid="a.195.1/2">Let me pick up the point about cross-border crime. My hon. Friends have mentioned London. My constituency is caught in a pincer movement. I can tell when places such as Hounslow and Hammersmith and Fulham are having a purge on crime, because the M4 gets busy and crime rates go up in my constituency. People rush out of London, down the M4 and turn into my constituency and cause trouble. When we have dealt with that, the next thing we find is that Thames Valley police is having a purge in Slough, so the people of Slough get on the M4 and come rushing down to my constituency and cause mayhem from the other direction. Yet a rural county force is expected to deal with that without any special recognition, which is wrong.</p>
	<p pid="a.195.1/3">Plenty of people, including the Audit Commission, the inspectorate and my residents, say that Surrey has an excellent police force. Our constituents probably pay the greatest amount of tax of any county in England into the central Exchequer. We do not mind doing that, because it is only fair that wealthier areas should make a greater contribution. We understand that, but is it unreasonable to say that we should get a fair return from Government grant for our needs rather than just being used to provide money that is sent somewhere else?</p>

	<p pid="a.196.0/1">I was not intending to speak in this debate, but, as my hon. Friends have been admirably succinct, we have a little time left, so I should like to take the opportunity to make a short contribution. Unfortunately, I have to leave at 12 o'clock, and I apologise in advance for any discourtesy.</p>
	<p pid="a.196.0/2">My hon. Friends have set out very clearly the underlying pressures facing Surrey police. Surrey is a target-rich environment; there are many temptations for criminals and we have a proximity to a pool of crime, which is both organised and opportunistic, in the London conurbation. Surrey police have a small level of reserves, and I hope that the Minister will not suggest that the reserves should be raided to meet some of the pressures that the force is facing. We need those reserves to deal with unexpected events. My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1578" name="Ian Taylor">the Member for Esher and Walton (Mr. Taylor)</phrase> referred to the Milly Dowler case, which involved an extraordinary police operation costing millions of pounds. In my own constituency a few years earlier, we were unwilling hosts to an unwilling guest&mdash;the former President of the Chilean Republic, General Pinochet. That operation cost Surrey police well in excess of &pound;1 million. At the time, we were promised categorically that there would be no net cost to Surrey taxpayers, but the reimbursement from central Government never came close to meeting the full cost of that policing operation. It is for such reasons that forces have to maintain appropriate reserves.</p>
	<p pid="a.196.0/3">Let me dwell for a moment on process. While the points about the underlying funding and underfunding of Surrey police force have been well made, my concern about this particular issue relates to process. Having read the facts, I have to say that Franz Kafka would have been impressed by the way in which the Government convey&mdash;or, rather, do not convey&mdash;detailed information to precepting authorities to enable them to set a precept that will not fall foul of rules that have not been made at the time the precept is set. I should also like to address the question of the proportionality of the response. I hope that the Minister has some good news for us today. There will not be anyone in this country in the current environment who thinks that spending &pound;1.2 million of public money to return &pound;1.6 million to Surrey council tax payers is a sensible way to proceed. I suggest to the Minister that he is in danger of appearing to be pursuing an agenda of petty political vindictiveness rather than an agenda of common sense.</p>

	<p pid="a.196.1/1">Does my hon. Friend agree that it is either incompetence or cock-up? Such a policy is either political vindictiveness or it is Government gone completely mad. It is exactly this sort of thing that is driving the public mad.</p>

	<p pid="a.196.2/1">I agree with my hon. Friend. I hope that it is not petty political vindictiveness. Let us explore whether it is a kind of institutional vindictiveness. By that I mean a sort of situation in which the centre cannot bear to be ignored or defied, even inadvertently, and has to slap back in a disproportionate response. I hope that the Minister&mdash;whether or not he is prepared to say so today&mdash;will privately reflect on a situation in which such a disproportionate response is mandated by the system.</p>

	<p pid="a.197.0/1">It is a ludicrous situation. My hon. Friend sets it out very clearly. I know that he personally keeps a very close eye on public spending and value for money. Does he have any thoughts about the additional cost to the taxpayer of the Government proceeding to fight a judicial review?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-06-09a.197.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1793" speakername="Philip Hammond" colnum="197"  time="011:42:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090609/halltext/90609h0006.htm#09060973000553">
	<p pid="a.197.1/1">My hon. Friend is absolutely right that such a review would pile insult on to injury. Instead of &pound;1.2 million to deal with a &pound;1.6 million over-billing, we may be talking about a situation in which the total bill has climbed beyond &pound;1.6 million. Although I do not think that anyone on the Conservative Benches would argue that there does not need to be a solution to the over-billing that has taken place, there is an objection to a cap and re-bill proposal that will cost at least &pound;1.2 million.</p>
	<p pid="a.197.1/2">I suggest to the Minister that he should use two tests when deciding whether to proceed down this route. First, will it satisfy those who are supposed to be the beneficiaries&mdash;those who are supposed to be protected by it, and band E council tax payers who will receive a &pound;3 reduction in their annual council tax bill and will have to use up a significant proportion of it setting up a new direct debit or standing order? I suggest to him that it will not.</p>
	<p pid="a.197.1/3">Secondly, will it satisfy what has famously been described as the court of public opinion on the common-sense test? Will the taxpayers of this country at large think that this was a sensible and proportionate intervention by the Government? Clearly they will not. I suggest to the Minister that he will greatly enhance his own reputation if he can intervene in this matter. He should act with common sense in the present case and discuss with his colleagues a way forward for the future&mdash;if there is a future for them&mdash;in which clear guidance is set out in a timely fashion. That would help to ensure that no other authority, police, local or otherwise, ever finds itself in a situation of over-billing as a consequence of not clearly understanding the baseline against which it should be working and the capping guidelines that the Government of the day wish to impose. In that way, we would have clear information and a pragmatic response when something goes wrong.</p>
	<p pid="a.197.1/4">I hope that despite the Conservatives' concerns, the Minister will engage in the debate in a spirit of common sense to find a solution that satisfies the needs to spend public money carefully and wisely and to protect the taxpayers of Surrey, and also protects the services that Surrey police wish to continue delivering to their citizens and our constituents. Those people certainly hope that the services continue to be provided for them.</p>

	<p pid="a.198.1/1">I am sure that it was a very important minute and I sincerely apologise.</p>
	<p pid="a.198.1/2">The problems with capping have been characterised perfectly clearly in the debate. The hon. Gentleman spoke about the cost of police jobs and the impact on the local area, the potential impacts on the budget for many years to come, and the nonsense of the Government expecting a police authority to eat into its own reserves. A number of hon. Members explained that that is like using a hammer to crack a nut. It is a ridiculous situation: budgets are set on a notional basis and it is if local authorities are working out what they are supposed to be doing entirely in shadow. We have notional budgets, caps and council tax levels, and nobody knows what they are supposed to be doing until well after they have set the budget.</p>
	<p pid="a.198.1/3">It is telling that so many of Surrey's MPs are here to speak in favour of their police authority. My understanding is that local Liberal Democrats have been supporting the police authority in this action, so the Labour party is rather on its own.</p>
	<p pid="a.198.1/4">The problem is that capping comes right at the end of the process&mdash;police and local authorities have already gone through the process of setting their budgets when a cap is imposed. They will have gone through the process of different departments deciding their spending priorities, and anyone who is on a fixed-term contract knows that they have a contract. Then, right at the end of the process, the Government threaten to slap a cap on the authority and expect it to somehow remove a large sum from its budget, which undermines the whole planning process.</p>
	<p pid="a.198.1/5">It is as if we go through a macho charade once a year. The Government refuse to tell local authorities what the cap is and what they are expected to do, and the authorities are supposed somehow to work it out by some process of osmosis or telepathy. When they get it wrong, the Government take draconian action that inevitably results in council tax payers picking up the cost of re-billing, either in future budget cuts or directly. The long-term result is that the relationship between central and local government is utterly undermined.</p>

Member for Mole Valley (Sir Paul Beresford)</phrase> on introducing the debate. Derbyshire has been capped in exactly the same way as Surrey, except that we are not having to re-bill this year. We simply have to lose &pound;1.6 million next year and 60 front-line officers in a force that already has 300 fewer police officers than most equivalent authorities.</p>
	<p pid="a.198.2/2">Will my hon. Friend elaborate on the principle of rate capping and the devolution of power? We hear a lot from the Government about localism and allowing local authorities the freedom to operate, yet they take 90 per cent. of taxation to London before handing it out, with strings, to local authorities, saying, &quot;Your localism and your freedom is to operate within these constraints.&quot; That would not happen in France, Germany, Scandinavia or the United States. Local authorities in those places have responsibility: they raise the money and run their local police forces and schools.</p>

	<p pid="a.199.1/1">Thank you, Mr. Fraser. My hon. Friend demonstrates that the problem has affected not only Surrey, but other police authorities. The debate allows us to see the direct impact on local people and local views. The problem affects areas other than Surrey.</p>

	<p pid="a.199.3/1">The hon. Gentleman is completely correct. Other authorities have been nominated but have not had to go through the process of re-billing, but as my hon. Friend said, no matter where authorities are on the scale, there is a devastating impact on their ability, and the ability of the police authority concerned, to plan for the future and on job security. Of course, the re-billing aspect about which hon. Members spoke seems particularly silly. To recover &pound;1.6 million for a cost of &pound;1.2 million is surely bonkers. I am amazed that the Government cannot see that. That is why I described it as a purposeless macho charade.</p>
	<p pid="a.199.3/2">My hon. Friend spoke about localism and I spoke about the relationship between central and local government, but almost every hon. Member has spoken about the issue of the police authority in Surrey. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1603" name="Anne Milton">The hon. Member for Guildford (Anne Milton)</phrase> spoke about her town and a number of hon. Members spoke about airports and the problem of the M25 going through Surrey. Normally, when Back Benchers speak about difficulties in their constituency, a Minister stands up and says, &quot;Oh well. It is the duty of Back Benchers to whinge about their constituencies and to make special pleas,&quot; but devolution is supposed to devolve power down to the local area because people there know best.</p>
	<p pid="a.199.3/3">The average local MP, police authority and local authority will know a good deal more about the issues affecting their area than a Government Minister, who may have never been to see what is happening on the ground. That is the nonsense of capping. We are supposed to allow local authorities to set their budgets and priorities because they know best, but central Government come in and slap a cap on them and say, &quot;Actually, you don't know best and we're going to undermine all the priorities that you have set.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.199.3/4">The hon. Member for Guildford said that the police authority asked the DCLG for guidance at the end of its budget-setting process, but the DCLG consistently said that it had no firm plans to set a cap. That is silly. I spoke about that following a ministerial statement a few months ago.</p>
	<p pid="a.199.3/5">I hope that the Conservative spokesperson condemns capping in general. The issue of re-billing in Surrey and the fact that it went right through the system is not the only problem; capping in general is a problem. Central Government use a heavy hand to set priorities that may have little or no impact on the final budget, yet they have a huge impact on the quality of services. I agree with hon. Members who said that if the Government must have some kind of capping system, they need to find a way to avoid re-billing, and that going through a judicial review process, which will cost goodness knows how much more, would utterly undermine any purpose whatever.</p>
	<p pid="a.199.3/6">Part of the problem for police authorities is that they have no elected mandate. They raise and set taxes, but they are not directly accountable to the people from whom the taxes are raised. That probably allows the Government to do their worst in overruling the authorities' ability to set priorities. I would like police authorities to have some form of directly elected mandate and nomination of local authority representatives. That would give them a much stronger hand and the ability to say to central Government, &quot;Don't interfere in what we're doing. We haven't only consulted; we have a direct mandate to be here and to set our own priorities and budget.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.199.3/7">Hon. Members have said that Surrey consulted. From my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1497" name="Paul Holmes">the Member for Chesterfield (Paul Holmes)</phrase>, I know that those in Derbyshire consulted heavily, yet central Government still overruled what the police authority was prepared to do. Some form of elected mandate would help a great deal.</p>

	<p pid="a.200.1/1">Many hon. Members from Surrey have commented on the fact that Government inspectors have recognised that the Surrey police authority is very efficient in handling its finances and policing operations. The same is true in Derbyshire. Government inspectors say that Derbyshire is highly efficient and has made &pound;40 million in efficiency savings. Central Government are therefore saying to highly efficient police authorities, &quot;Even though you're very efficient and everybody across your county agrees with what you're doing in raising a bit more money out of council tax to make up for Government underfunding, we're going to cap you and stop you doing that.&quot; Where is the logic and the local accountability in that?</p>

Member for Runnymede and Weybridge (Mr. Hammond)</phrase>, who is no longer in his place, accused the Government of petty political vindictiveness, but I am not sure that that is actually the cause. I think that it is simply the case that unless the Government are prepared to wave their stick around at some point in the process of council tax setting, they cannot instil any fear into other local authorities. At least one or two local authorities and police authorities need to be picked off, bullied in public and made an example of so that the Government can continue to claim that they have some authority.</p>

	<p pid="a.200.3/1">Would the hon. Lady not describe it as vindictive or suspicious if the Government want to wave that stick about? I agree that they want to make a case of somebody; they are picking on a county where there is not a single Labour MP to complain.</p>

	<p pid="a.200.4/1">It is certainly vindictive, but I am not sure that I give the Government credit for that much thought. I suspect that the process is much more random than that. I think that they merely pick a couple of random councils to make public scapegoats of so that they can claim to have some authority over local authorities.</p>
	<p pid="a.200.4/2">The fundamental problem, as the Minister well knows, is that council tax is a deeply unpopular tax. That is why the Government need to wave their big sticks around when it comes to Budget-setting time&mdash;in order to demonstrate that they are doing something about council tax. We all know that council tax rises are above inflation every single year. The tax is felt keenly, particularly by the low-paid, because they know that it is unfair. It is not based on their ability to pay or even on the price of their house. It bears no relationship to whether they own their property and is based on a notional value that is decades out of date. Until the Government are prepared to grasp the whole of local government finance, introduce a system of local taxation based on people's income and ability to pay and devolve power and finance-raising down to local authorities in a serious way, I am afraid that we will go through the same charade every year. It is deeply depressing.</p>

Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1718" name="Paul Beresford">the Member for Mole Valley (Sir Paul Beresford)</phrase> on securing this important debate. The fact that so many Surrey MPs have turned up and that they have so eloquently represented their constituents' concerns about the capping of the Surrey police precept demonstrates to the Minister, I hope, how important the issue has become. I welcome him to his new role.</p>
	<p pid="a.201.0/2">I shall keep my comments as brief as possible, because a lot of questions have been posed and concerns raised, and we now need the Minister to answer them. It seems to me that today's debate involves irony on painful irony. Council tax has doubled under Labour, yet Ministers have made no complaint about it. Different approaches are taken in different parts of the country. The Met precept, charged by the London Mayor, has quadrupled in the past 10 years&mdash;it has been frozen, thank heavens, now that we have a new and better Mayor. Again, the Government took no action on that. Yet when Surrey police, which clearly faces a range of challenges on the policing front&mdash;perhaps more than most police forces&mdash;put a toe out of line, the Government imposed a disproportionate cap that, as we have heard, will cost practically as much to enforce as it will raise.</p>

	<p pid="a.201.2/1">My hon. Friend is absolutely right. We have heard today that the Surrey police authority has been evaluated by the Audit Commission and rated by residents.

	<p pid="a.201.3/1">That is exactly the point.

	<p pid="a.202.0/1">My hon. Friend is right, of course. Only local people can judge the balance of how much they think it is right to invest in policing and what they want in return.</p>
	<p pid="a.202.0/2">The other irony is how much money is being wasted on regional and local government by Ministers. In the past 10 years, the combined cost of unelected regional assemblies, regional development agencies and Government offices for the regions has risen to &pound;12.8 billion, which is &pound;580 for every household every year. The Government should trim those costs to gain efficiencies before looking to front-line services such as policing.</p>
	<p pid="a.202.0/3"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1445" name="Sarah Teather">The hon. Member for Brent, East (Sarah Teather)</phrase> raised the question of our approach to council tax capping. We would abolish central capping, because we think that residents and local communities should have the ability to cap, if that is what they want and if they decide that what is being proposed is more than they can or are willing to pay. However, that is for local communities to do at a much earlier stage in the process than the last minute. As has been pointed out, we are already in the 2009 financial year, so the savings being forced on Surrey police have been exacerbated. They are not annual savings and will have to be taken over a much shorter period.</p>
	<p pid="a.202.0/4">We need more local decision making, and with that should come more local accountability from the police. We have discussed our plans to have more local democracy in the form of directly elected police commissioners and the ability for local residents to introduce their own referendums on local issues, if enough of them want to do so, and that should include capping.</p>
	<p pid="a.202.0/5">I will leave the Minister with a final thought. The question that he must ultimately answer is simple. Why is it for him to decide to cap Surrey police's precept and not for the residents who have been so clearly represented here today by their Members of Parliament?</p>

	<p pid="a.202.1/2">I should begin by explaining the background of how we got to our present position in relation to Surrey police authority. The Government have made it clear in every year since 2004-05 that we will take capping action against excessive council tax increases. That followed successive years of high increases early in the decade, which happened despite the generous grant increases that authorities received from the Government. That culminated in an average band D increase in England of 12.9 per cent. in 2003-04. Surrey police authority took the opportunity that year to set an increase of 40.1 per cent. I am sure that all hon. Members agree that such increases&mdash;</p>

	<p pid="a.203.2/1">I am sure that all hon. Members agree that such increases are totally unacceptable and that we do not want to see such levels again&mdash;council tax payers certainly do not want to.</p>
	<p pid="a.203.2/2">Successive years of grant increases and the use of our capping powers led to the average band D increase in England coming down to just 3 per cent. in 2009-10. The average increase per household this year is even lower. At 2.6 per cent., it is the lowest average increase per household since council tax was introduced by the Conservatives in 1993.</p>
	<p pid="a.203.2/3">Our involvement with Surrey police authority started just over a year ago. One local authority and several police authorities, including Surrey, set excessive council tax increases in 2008-09. We designated Surrey for capping, but after considering its challenge, decided not to cap it in-year. Instead, we set it a notional budget requirement for that year, which was lower than the budget requirement set by the authority. That meant that the authority was allowed to retain its excessive increases for 2008-09 and did not have to re-bill. Our action in 2008-09 limited Surrey's scope for increases in future financial years. We also gave it an opportunity to avoid setting an excessive increase in 2009-10. Unfortunately, Surrey did not take that opportunity and has set an excessive increase for 2009-10.</p>

	<p pid="a.203.4/2">Of 15 authorities that have been set notional budget requirements, Surrey is the first that has gone on to set an excessive increase in the subsequent year. In 2009-10, the Government reiterated to all authorities that they would not hesitate to take capping action against excessive increases. We said explicitly that we would require authorities to re-bill if necessary. In December 2008, the then Minister for Local Government, my right hon.

	<p pid="a.204.1/2">If the authority is now crying foul because it is faced with re-billing costs, it has only itself to blame. The authority is threatening a judicial review to argue that the Secretary of State does not have the power to set a capping principle by reference to a notional amount of council tax. I will therefore not comment further on that matter. However, it is not the case that the authority was first informed about its 2008-09 notional council tax in January 2009, as has been suggested.</p>

	<p pid="a.206.7/2">Out of 421 authorities, including 37 police authorities, Surrey is the only one that has ever set an excessive increase for two years in succession. The hon. Member for Mole Valley has had the privilege of serving in government, so he knows that it is not about costs, but about principles. If 420 out of 421 billing and precepting authorities have managed to live within their means and be financially responsible, it would be ludicrous to make an exception in any case. That would send out entirely the wrong message and would set a detrimental precedent that could heap up many problems in both the short and longer term.</p>
	<p pid="a.206.7/3">I have heard a lot about Surrey being a fountain of wealth creation in the UK, and that it should therefore benefit disproportionately through expenditure on it, but the Government do not believe in redistribution based on the amount of wealth created in an area.</p>

	<p pid="a.207.3/1"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1933" name="Humfrey Malins">The hon. Member for Woking (Mr. Malins)</phrase> has been here long enough to know that and has, unfortunately, just eaten up even more of my time, leaving me less time to respond to his points.</p>
	<p pid="a.207.3/2">I accept that much of Surrey police authority is probably excellent, as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1603" name="Anne Milton">the hon. Member for Guildford (Anne Milton)</phrase> has said, but, sadly, its financial arrangements do not fall into that category. I take her point about the Street Angels project, which seems a worthy initiative, and I wish it well.</p>
	<p pid="a.207.3/3">The hon. Member for Woking spoke at some length about terrorism and counter-terrorism, for which there is a separate budget, which has more than doubled in the past few years because the Government have recognised some of the challenges that the country faces in that regard.</p>
	<p pid="a.207.3/4">Much has been said about common sense, but there is no more basic common sense than living within one's means. Why can 420 other authorities accept and live within their means, while Surrey cannot? Every one of the 36 other police authorities could have come here and made many of the same arguments, but they have not. I have heard today that they recognise the challenges that budgets impose on them, but they also recognise their responsibility to stay within budget and make reasonable increases. That is common sense to everyone else.</p>
	<p pid="a.207.3/5"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1793" name="Philip Hammond">The hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge (Mr. Hammond)</phrase> made some arguments that I simply did not find credible. There were some rather silly and churlish accusations about petty political vindictiveness, but, as I have just explained, this has nothing to do with politics. Surrey is the only billing and precepting authority out of 421 that has gone for excessive increases in two successive years.</p>

	<p pid="a.208.0/1">I thank the Minister for giving way in the last few moments. The one thing that we have asked throughout is that there should be the opportunity, with the placing of the order, to designate the capping and set it against next year. That would save an enormous amount of money which the authority would have to find otherwise, whether from balances, with which I would disagree, or in a precept or savings. Is the Minister prepared to reconsider that and lay an order so that re-billing does not have to occur?</p>

	<p pid="a.208.1/1">At this stage, I am not prepared to reconsider, because I think it would be wrong and would set a wholly inappropriate precedent. Surrey had the opportunity to look at things again last year, but it chose to ignore that and now it is paying the price. Even though it knew what the price would be, it is complaining. That is completely inappropriate, and it would be a wrong precedent to set. For that reason, I am pretty sure that I will not reconsider this matter in the way that the hon. Gentleman would like.</p>
	<p pid="a.208.1/2">We will not have the final word today, however, as the capping of the authority in 2009-10 is subject to the approval of the House of Commons. A draft order to cap it is being laid tomorrow, and we expect the House to debate the order at the end of this month or at the beginning of July. Hon. Members are right to vent their spleen about this, but they ought to vent it at Surrey police authority for not managing its books in the way in which 420 other billing and precepting authorities have been doing.</p>

	<p pid="a.209.1/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2008-04-23">23 April 2008</phrase>, the Select Committee on Innovation, Universities, Science and Skills published its report on science budget allocations. During the course of the Committee's inquiry, we received a number of representations from different scientific bodies about the decision of the Science and Technology Facilities Council to reduce the budget allocation for ground-based solar terrestrial physics to zero. We received evidence from UK Solar Physics research and from the British Academy, but the clearest evidence that we received was from the British Antarctic Survey.</p>
	<p pid="a.209.1/2">I shall quote two parts of the British Antarctic Survey's evidence, in which it makes a case for not cutting the budget in relation to solar terrestrial physics:</p>
	<p pid="a.209.1/3" class="indent">&quot;Sun-climate links: researchers are becoming increasingly aware of links between solar variability and the earth's climate. It is critical that we establish the relative importance of solar-induced effects on climate change so we can predict more accurately the man-made influences on climate. The InterGovernmental Panel on Climate Change reported that the current level of understanding is very low and Sir Keith O'Nions in recent evidence to the Public Accounts committee about the Halley research station in Antarctica asserted that the 'physics of the upper atmosphere there will be a very key part of climate change'.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.209.1/4">It is therefore an odd decision to cut the budget.</p>
	<p pid="a.209.1/5">More importantly for the case I want to make, the British Antarctic Survey stated:</p>
	<p pid="a.209.1/6" class="indent">&quot;Space weather: solar variability has a very strong influence on the near-earth space environment, including large transient increases in the amount of radiation there. Such space weather events are frequent but intermittent and of varying severity, the prediction of which is an ultimate goal of STP research. They can lead to temporary loss of service from satellites, or even the complete loss of satellites worth about $300 million each. More than half of all space insurance is done through London and is worth $500 million per year.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.209.1/7">The Committee went on to make a case for fewer cuts to the budget. The work had not been done, so we could not have known that a month later&mdash;on May 22-23&mdash;a meeting was held under the auspices of the Space Studies Board about the societal and economic impacts of severe space weather events. Such work comes under the national academies in the United States, which had been called together to discuss the impact of severe space weather. I have heard that National Aeronautics and Space Administration funded the project because it was concerned about the matter. NASA was particularly concerned about what became known as the Halloween storms, which took place in autumn 2003, when there was a large space storm and transformer problems in Sweden. Commercial airline flights were moved away from the Arctic region and the level at which commercial airlines were flying had to be lowered. The advanced earth observing satellite II has not been heard of since; it was damaged beyond repair after that space storm.</p>
	<p pid="a.209.1/8">At this point, it is worth discussing the definition of space storms, what the likely future impacts might be and how that should be reflected in the Government's response. Space storms are associated with sun spots&mdash;a cooling of the sun's surface&mdash;which are caused by bursts of magnetic knots from the interior of the sun. Associated with space storms are coronal mass ejections, which are essentially billions of tonnes of plasma composed of protons and electrons that hurl very quickly towards the earth. Coronal mass ejections travel at varying speeds depending on how big and concentrated they are, but they can travel up to 1,500 miles a second. They can travel at a considerable speed and they seem to happen every 11, 12 or 13 years.</p>
	<p pid="a.209.1/9">The largest such event was known as the Carrington event, which took place just under 150 years ago. The size of that event has since been studied and it turned out to be four times larger than any of the recently measured solar weather events. Richard Carrington was a British scientist and astronomer who first worked out the relationship between sun spot activity and the magnetic phenomena in the earth's atmosphere, such as the aurora borealis, the aurora australis and St. Elmo's fire, which sailors have known about for years. Richard Carrington worked out that such atmospheric magnetic events were related to what was happening on the sun.</p>
	<p pid="a.209.1/10">The 2003 event&mdash;and to a lesser extent the 1989 event, in which 9 million people in Quebec lost power&mdash;meant that the body that works with the national academies in the States sat down and discussed what was happening. I know that anyone who talks about space, cataclysmic events and potential disasters is not likely to be taken too seriously, but I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister will take the matter seriously. If there were a large solar storm of the strength of Carrington&mdash;there is no reason to believe that the event of 150 years ago was as large as space storms can get&mdash;there would not only be serious consequences for western society, but all societies that are dependent on current technologies.</p>
	<p pid="a.209.1/11">There are particular concerns that the magnetic impact of these storms would cause induced currents in step-up and step-down transformers. Direct current would be induced in systems that are meant to deal with alternating currents, which would saturate the magnets at the core of the transformers and melt the copper wire. Such a proposition is not theoretical; it is what happened in Quebec in 1989. The current systems are more vulnerable because, for greater efficiency, modern grids operate at ever higher voltages&mdash;for example, the Chinese have recently put in voltage systems that operate at 1,000 V.</p>
	<p pid="a.209.1/12">When the relevant bodies looked at the situation, they worked out what the impact would be in north America and China. They also said that the inter-dependability of the grids in Europe meant that we could have a serious catastrophe in Europe. For north America, they estimated that within 90 seconds of one of these events, 300 key transformers could go down, affecting 130 million people. The impacts are obvious to anyone who thinks about it: water that needs to be pumped up multi-storey buildings would stop; trains would stop; the underground would stop; and, because we live in a just-in-time society, a lot of industry would stop. It would be very difficult after a few days to get petrol to petrol stations, the back-up generators for hospitals could fail, and we would be in a serious situation.</p>
	<p pid="a.209.1/13">There have been attempts to estimate the number of back-up transformers, but there are very few. In any case, there are not many crews available to put in new transformers. Nuclear power stations would shut down if the grid went down. The Committee estimated that a Carrington-type event would have 10 times the impact on the United States of the Katrina hurricane a few years ago and would cost that country $2 trillion. That is a large figure, and consequences could be dire.</p>
	<p pid="a.209.1/14">When I tabled a parliamentary question, I was told that the Government were aware of the matter and that contingency plans were in place. I would be interested to know the answer to a question about timing. Again, this is covered in the National Academies report. Much of the information about the timing and prediction of such events comes from the ACE satellite&mdash;the advanced composition explorer&mdash;which can get information to us in about 15 to 30 minutes. However, if the plasma were travelling as fast as it is estimated that it travelled 150 years ago, it would get here in 12 minutes, so the advanced warning would not arrive in time. The other satellite that can provide such information&mdash;it was damaged in the last solar storm in 2003&mdash;is SOHO, or the solar and heliospheric observatory. It, too, would have difficulty getting the information to us in time.</p>
	<p pid="a.209.1/15">There have to be particular circumstances for a Carrington event to happen. Solar winds and ejections of plasma happen from time to time, but the most difficult events involve plasma directed straight at the earth. In 2003, the largest ejection just missed the earth. The plasma has to be travelling very quickly, it has to be dense and intense, and finally&mdash;this is quite important&mdash;its polarity has to be the opposite of the earth's polarity. If it is the same, it just slips past the earth. It is like the difference between a knife going through water and an explosion in water. If plasma with an opposite polarity were to hit the earth's atmosphere, it would cause many problems.</p>
	<p pid="a.209.1/16">Given that there is no evidence that the current events are as large as they could get, and given the estimates that a large event could have serious consequences, I have two or three questions to ask the Minister. First, was it wise to cut the money going to ground-based solar-terrestrial physics, when one of the objectives is to understand the signs better and to predict events? Secondly, does the Minister agree with the National Academies estimates that the fastest of such storms are not predictable, and, therefore, that it would not be possible to take generators out of the system to protect them, and that we are vulnerable? The consequent question is, if something like that were to happen, are contingency plans in place for transformers and emergency services that go beyond the normal emergency plans that we have in place in this country? I look forward with interest to my hon. Friend's reply.</p>

	<p pid="a.211.0/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1704" name="Graham Stringer">the Member for Manchester, Blackley (Graham Stringer)</phrase> on securing this important debate and on giving us an interesting presentation. I am sure that this matter is not well known to most people; none the less, as he said, it is extremely important.</p>
	<p pid="a.211.0/2">Before I turn to the specific issue of solar storms, I would like to thank my hon. Friend for the wider interest that he has demonstrated in this matter. I am aware of his work on the Innovation, Universities, Science and Skills Committee which, as he pointed out, has considered funding for research. In the course of my reply, I shall also expand on the answer provided in response to my hon. Friend's recent parliamentary question on the need to protect the national grid from extreme solar weather.</p>
	<p pid="a.211.0/3">A recent article in the <i>New </i><i>Scientist</i> raised concerns that a repeat of the Carrington event to which my hon. Friend referred could have a major impact on national electricity transmission networks. It prompted a letter from a concerned constituent of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1938" name="Liam Fox">the hon. Member for Woodspring (Dr. Fox)</phrase> and a debate in both the Scottish Executive and the Welsh Assembly. I therefore very much welcome this opportunity to discuss the issue and to explain the Government's view on the risk that we believe is posed to the UK's electricity network, and the measures that are in place to monitor events and mitigate the risks.</p>
	<p pid="a.211.0/4">National Grid Electricity Transmission owns the England and Wales electricity transmission system, and Scottish Power Transmission Ltd and Scottish Hydro Electric each own part of the transmission system in Scotland. National Grid also has responsibility for overseeing and managing the flow of electricity across the whole of the Great Britain transmission network. My Department maintains close contact with those companies on all network resilience issues.</p>
	<p pid="a.211.0/5">As my hon. Friend said, satellites are capable of giving several hours' warning that a major solar storm has occurred on the sun, and about 30 minutes' warning that the subsequent discharge could impact on the earth. The information is available in real time to National Grid, which has procedures in place that set out the actions that would be taken should such an alert be received.</p>
	<p pid="a.211.0/6">There is also an international research programme to improve understanding of the potential impact of solar storms. It is led by the Electric Power Research Institute based in the USA, to which my hon. Friend referred, and National Grid is a partner in that research. The programme monitors the ongoing low-level solar storms that are detected from time to time by satellites and correlates them with measurements of induced currents on the ground as detected by monitors placed around the globe. In that way, we are gaining experience in interpreting early warning signs of solar storms.</p>
	<p pid="a.211.0/7">My hon. Friend asked whether it was wise to cut the budget. I shall write to my relevant opposite numbers and make an inquiry further to his inquiry. I am not in a position to make a judgment, but I would say to him that, as in so many such matters, the international scientific endeavour is most important. As the UK Government, and through the partnership of National Grid with the US institute, we are able to obtain up-to-the-minute, appropriate science.</p>

	<p pid="a.212.0/1">I am grateful for that response, and I realise that this debate covers several departmental responsibilities. Would my hon.

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-06-09a.212.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1681" speakername="Joan Ruddock" colnum="212"  time="012:44:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090609/halltext/90609h0009.htm#09060973000619">
	<p pid="a.212.1/1">I will certainly look at that and make the specific connection that my hon. Friend just made.</p>
	<p pid="a.212.1/2">The procedures that National Grid and other utilities have in place for reacting to a major solar flare include steps to increase the generation reserves that can improve voltage levels across the network, and possibly switching out certain transformers at the edge of the network if sufficient information is available to give confidence in the route that the electrical currents caused by the solar storm will take.</p>
	<p pid="a.212.1/3">My hon. Friend asked whether I agree that the fastest storms would not predictable. It is a fact that, if something occurs at a speed that we are not able to pick up in the networks that already exist&mdash;in the satellite messaging systems that we depend on&mdash;we would be taken by surprise. Generally, however, through satellites, we are certainly getting information within a reasonable time frame. All transformers connected to the national grid transmission network since 1999 have been designed to eliminate the risk of damage presented by solar storms. That answers my hon. Friend's question about more modern facilities with higher voltages. Protection has been built in and there is an acceptance that, as voltages have increased, there is a need to introduce appropriate safeguards.</p>
	<p pid="a.212.1/4">Of course, a wide range of incidents and emergencies might have an impact on all or significant parts of the UK. The national risk register, published in March 2008, sets out the Government's assessment of the likelihood and impact of a range of different risks that may directly affect the UK over the next five years, including accidents such as major fires or technical failures, natural events, including severe weather and flooding, and particularly the threat of international terrorism. Comprehensive plans are in place for handling both a complete national outage of electricity supplies, which, of course, has never occurred, I am glad to say, and regional outages. Although solar storms are not included specifically in the national risk register, the resilience measures in place to deal with the risks I have mentioned would be equally applicable to the effects of solar storms.</p>
	<p pid="a.212.1/5">As my hon. Friend said, solar storms approximately follow an 11-year cycle and are thought to be related to changes in the sun's magnetic field. We are in a quiet phase at present and the latest information from NASA is that the next peak is likely during mid 2013. My hon. Friend hoped that I would take this matter seriously. Indeed, the Government do take it seriously. Solar storms are known to be capable of damaging electricity transmission networks on earth and this has happened, as he said, in both Canada and Sweden. The most significant event occurred on <phrase class="date" code="1989-03-13">13 March 1989</phrase>, when a severe storm caused the collapse of the Canadian Hydro-Qu&eacute;bec power grid in a matter of seconds. As he said, millions of people were left without power for nine hours, with significant economic loss. In the UK, there have been at least four peak cycles of solar storms during the existence of modern high-voltage transmission networks. Generally, these have caused no problems, although in 1989 two transformers suffered damage: one in East Anglia and one in the west country. However, in both cases, the impact was limited to the locality.</p>
	<p pid="a.212.1/6">I am glad to say that the UK is not at a particularly high risk of disruption from solar storms, as we are a good way south of the magnetic north pole. The history of extreme solar weather events and the science indicate that the risk of a major impact in the UK is very low. Although the UK may not be completely immune from the impact of solar storms, it is extremely unlikely that we would suffer widespread damage. The damage that could occur is therefore small and well within the scope of the resilience and contingency planning that we have in place to deal with terrestrial weather events and other risks that could impact on the electricity networks.</p>
	<p pid="a.212.1/7">The main risk to electricity supplies during a severe solar storm is that one or more transformers at the edge of the network could be damaged, which would cause a localised loss of supply if the capacity of remaining transformers could not deliver all the demand for electricity in that area. Generally, a damaged transformer can be replaced within about two weeks and it is often possible to take other measures to restore supplies much quicker than that, including an early return to service of equipment being maintained or the re-routing of supplies from a different location.</p>
	<p pid="a.212.1/8">The highest risk areas of the UK are the west country and parts of Scotland, due to the granite rock formation of the ground in those parts. That type of ground is particularly susceptible to electrical currents, so the geomagnetically induced currents caused by the solar storm are therefore more likely to find a path through the electricity networks. That is more likely to happen because of the terrain in those areas.</p>
	<p pid="a.212.1/9">A severe solar storm can also depress the overall voltage of the transmission network by a few per cent. However, that is unlikely to cause damage or disruption and defence measures can be taken to reduce the risk even further. For example, National Grid may be able to increase the number of electricity generators on the network to help support the voltage.</p>
	<p pid="a.212.1/10">These impacts are comparable to the risks faced by the transmission networks in day-to-day operation, for example, by the breakdown of generation or transmission equipment or through the terrestrial weather events that I mentioned earlier. The ability to cope with such events and minimise their impact is built into the design of the networks, operating procedures and the resilience measures available to the grid operators. Emergency planning arrangements are also in place to cover significant and unexpected events.</p>
	<p pid="a.212.1/11">I am grateful to my hon. Friend for raising this important issue. The Department of Energy and Climate Change maintains its capacity to lead the response to energy emergencies and incidents. That means planning, training and exercising alongside those likely to have a stake in a potential crisis. That includes the energy sector, together with local, regional and devolved Administrations, as well as other Departments and agencies whose interests may be affected and whose assistance would be needed.</p>
	<p pid="a.212.1/12">Although there are clearly uncertainties about the impact of a major solar storm, experience to date indicates that the UK is not unduly exposed to such events and, in the worst case, it could be expected that any interruption to electricity supplies would be localised and of relatively short duration. However, as my hon. Friend implied, there is no absolute certainty in this regard. There is clearly a need for continuing scientific research. We cannot be certain: although we have seen events of a certain nature and events for which we could make reasonable predictions, and although we have in place a significant range of measures that are capable of coping with and, to some degree, mitigating the potential effects on our electricity networks, none the less we need to keep such matters under review. The Department needs to be constantly appraised of, and must follow, developments in science.</p>
	<p pid="a.212.1/13">The resilience and defensive measures that network owners take to protect against terrestrial weather events are equally applicable in dealing with solar storms. Where specific measures are appropriate, such as the development of reliable early warning systems, work is in hand to improve our understanding. I am confident that we can, as a country, cope within the range of what we know has happened in other parts of world and in this country, and which may happen here in future.</p>
	<p pid="a.212.1/14">Some hon. Members may be concerned about the Olympics&mdash;a major event in this country&mdash;which could conceivably be affected if such a storm were to happen, but I say to my hon. Friend, although he did not raise this issue, that we have considered that and we expect that all the measures that I have described to be in place and to be appropriate. We have contingency arrangements for that major national event. However, we are not complacent on these issues. Once again, I thank my hon. Friend for raising an important matter in this debate.</p>

	<p pid="a.216.1/1">I recognise that the Minister is making her debut here, and that this matter is work in progress for her Department. I contacted her civil servants, and made it clear that the bulk of this half-hour debate will be taken up by my contribution, but that my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1798" name="Anne Main">the Member for St. Albans (Anne Main)</phrase> and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1801" name="Andrew George">the hon. Member for St. Ives (Andrew George)</phrase> may wish to intervene.</p>
	<p pid="a.216.1/2">In the middle of January, the Department for Children, Schools and Families launched an independent review of home education by Graham Badman, the former director of children and educational services at Kent county council. Mr. Badman has been charged with investigating the current system for supporting and monitoring home education, and was asked to consider how any concerns about children's safety, welfare or education are dealt with. From the outset, the Government have emphasised that they have no plans to change parents' well-established right to educate their children at home.</p>
	<p pid="a.216.1/3">All that sounds harmless enough, and in light of recent child abuse cases it is little wonder that the Government want to safeguard children who are not visibly in the system, and to keep tabs on parents. It is right for any Government to want evidence that each and every child receives a suitable education, and genuine home educators have nothing to fear. However, the message coming loud and clear from home educators in my constituency is that that hype should not be believed. Their worry is that the Government are manipulating current anxiety about child abuse to intrude further into home education when they have little legal right to do so.</p>
	<p pid="a.216.1/4">The latest review will mark the third such consultation pertaining to home education over the past four years. Any action stemming from it could affect the balance of power between civil liberties and state intervention, whether one is innocent until proven guilty or guilty until proven innocent, and whether the state or parents have ultimate responsibility for their children. The ability to be free from an all-knowing, all-seeing state's ideas of education, welfare and standards forms the fundamental appeal for many of those who choose home education for their children. Any attempt to alter what is very much a matter of balance would undermine the entire ethos of education.</p>
	<p pid="a.216.1/5">I became interested, involved and engaged in home education some months back when I met two articulate and passionate local mothers in the Pimlico area of my constituency who had decided to educate their children themselves. One made that decision as a result of her son's unhappy and unproductive first 18 months in the state school sector. The other had seen home education work brilliantly for family friends, and made the positive decision to take on that task for her daughters. The matter is a Cinderella area, and I approached my meeting with those two mothers with some standard misconceptions that a home education might produce an unsocialised, precocious child who is unable to interact with their peers and perhaps shielded from all negative experiences. However, the more I listened to the two mothers, the more impressed and excited I was by their passion and enthusiasm for home education. Each was able to provide an individualised learning experience tailored to the child's abilities and interests. Far from having an isolated and insulated existence, the children of those two mothers frequently attended classes with other home schoolers, interacted with children of different ages and abilities, and experienced a wide range of activities from practising judo and learning Japanese to visiting galleries and museums during quieter times of day.</p>

	<p pid="a.217.0/1">My hon. Friend's experience is replicated in my constituency where there are 60 home schoolers. That has come to the forefront in my constituency because some parents are deeply unhappy about the school that they have been allocated and are investigating home schooling. It is a resourceful way of proceeding with a valuable education that is tailored to their child's needs. I echo what my hon. Friend is saying. When one looks into the matter, one sees that it is a heartening way forward and can be complementary to the state system.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-06-09a.217.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1503" speakername="Mark Field" colnum="217"  time="013:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090609/halltext/90609h0009.htm#09060973000622">
	<p pid="a.217.1/1">I thank my hon. Friend for her observations. I stress that the notion of a homogenous group of home educators with a single mind could not be further from the truth. Diversity is one of the most important aspects of the home education ideal and the education that is provided for those children who have the great benefit of it. A home-educated child will naturally have a close relationship with their parents, whose lives are often enriched by learning new skills and knowledge alongside their children.</p>
	<p pid="a.217.1/2">I have discovered that in my constituency, in the heart of the biggest city in our nation, there is an active community of home educators who share classes and co-ordinate their knowledge base. A nationwide lively online community shares best practice and experience, and I have learned about that from the inundation of information to my private office during the past three or four days since it became known that I was having this debate today. I apologise that I will not be able to make all the points that were made to me by interested parents. Many home educators choose not to engage with other families, and the appeal of home education is that individual educational experience can be tailored to best suit the child and the family.</p>
	<p pid="a.217.1/3">All that comes at no cost to taxpayers because the vast majority of home educators shoulder not only the teaching burden, but the financial one. Despite that, the choice for many home educators is often not the ability to afford such a route&mdash;many probably struggle to some extent&mdash;but stems from lack of faith in what the state sector provides, particularly when the basis of that provision is &quot;take it or leave it&quot;. That is a problem not so much in my constituency, but in other parts of London where many parents are dissatisfied when only their third, fourth or fifth choice of school is available for their children. Home educators come from a wide variety of backgrounds, and many find that home schooling is the most workable or perhaps the only alternative to expensive school fees or an unattractive local state school.</p>
	<p pid="a.217.1/4">Unfortunately, both the mothers to whom<i></i>I spoke at length were deeply concerned about the future of home education. There is long-standing suspicion that the Government, both local and national, are uncomfortable about parents providing education that cannot be monitored, tested or accounted for. There is a real fear that the Government, under the banner of child protection, will try to interfere with the freedom of choice of home educators. I represent a big flagship Conservative borough, but the same probably applies to the local education authority, which is equally to blame. I am not making a partisan party political point. The freedom that is so fiercely guarded by the majority of home educators and their choice to pursue that path is due to a fundamental rejection of the state's values, and lack of faith in the state's ability to provide a suitable education for their child.</p>
	<p pid="a.217.1/5">Home education has been under constant scrutiny since the Children Act 2004, which enshrined the Government's Every Child Matters agenda in legislation. Draft guidelines clarifying the rights and responsibilities for home educators and local authorities were drafted and debated in early 2005, shelved for two years, and finally published in autumn 2007. That consultation caused great anxiety among home educators because it was feared that the Government would try to introduce inspections and to control the curricula. Eventually, guidelines issued after the review maintained the previous position, and most families were incredibly relieved.</p>
	<p pid="a.217.1/6">Meanwhile the Education and Inspections Act 2006 introduced new duties for identifying children who were missing education. Yet there was another consultation in autumn last year on children missing education, and all home educators will eventually be tracked down as a result of the ContactPoint database. Local authorities will be required to determine</p>
	<p pid="a.217.1/7" class="indent">&quot;as far as they are able&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.217.1/8">whether a child is receiving what a local education bureaucrat deems is a suitable education. Before that, local authorities were required only to make a note of any families whom they found home educating.</p>
	<p pid="a.217.1/9">All this casts doubt on the Government's motives with the Badman review, particularly as the consultation response time has been cut from 12 weeks to four. Why have they not given the latest guidance a chance to work through? Could it be that the consultation is a knee-jerk reaction from a Government who are fearful of any further culpability in the face of some quite deep failings in the care system?</p>
	<p pid="a.217.1/10">Home educators with whom I have engaged conclude that either the Government have no faith in the previous reviews or this is a superficial exercise to try to allay public concern&mdash;a bid to make good other failures with frenetic activity&mdash;which will result in few or no changes.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-06-09a.218.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1801" speakername="Andrew George" colnum="218"  time="013:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090609/halltext/90609h0009.htm#09060973000623">
	<p pid="a.218.0/1">The hon. Gentleman is making a very strong case. He says that there may be public concern about this sector, but having visited a group of home educators in Penzance in my constituency, it was clear to me that in many cases these people have chosen this option precisely because they want to escape abuse and bullying in schools. Some choose it for other reasons. In a letter dated <phrase class="date" code="2007-06-19">19 June 2007</phrase> that I received from the then Under-Secretary in the Department, Lord Adonis, he made it clear that under section 47 of the Children Act 1989 the powers already exist to intervene in cases in which the state believes that a child may suffer harm. I agree with the hon. Gentleman. The state already has the powers to intervene where it suspects that harm may be going on.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-06-09a.219.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1503" speakername="Mark Field" colnum="219"  time="013:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090609/halltext/90609h0010.htm#09060973000624">
	<p pid="a.219.0/1">That is a very valid point and I am glad that the hon. Gentleman has brought it up. There is obviously passion about this issue not just in big cities or suburban conurbations, but in the depths of the far south-west of England. It is probably worth stressing&mdash;I appreciate that in many ways the hon. Gentleman made this point&mdash;that the issue is not simply children who are being bullied dropping out of the system. It is much wider. Home education is a choice of parents for the good of the children, and one should always trust the instincts of parents rather than the instincts of a bureaucrat in the local education department or of the state as a whole. I am talking about parents' instincts about what is best for their children. One interesting point, which has been very evident, is that home education is not necessarily something that all the children in a family will go through. Parents may make the choice that particular children are best suited to home education and that their other children will go down a much more conventional path by going to school.</p>
	<p pid="a.219.0/2">People unfamiliar with the ethos behind home education might question the defensiveness of some who home educate: &quot;Why not let the Government in if there is nothing to hide?&quot; Of course, that refrain has seen many other freedoms cast aside over the past decade or so. Independence to pursue the choice that is right for a particular child at the speed at which that child wishes to learn is the cornerstone of home education. Home educators opted out of the system by and large because they lacked confidence in the idea of a very strict and regulated state system. That is something that has been apparent for quite some time&mdash;20 or 30 years. I am talking about the rise of the national curriculum and ever more testing, which are, understandably, concerns.</p>
	<p pid="a.219.0/3">So sacred is the independence of home educators that for a long time they have remained under the radar. However, they now feel compelled to put forward their case, as they have little faith in the review process that is currently being undertaken&mdash;I think that the Badman report will come through in the next few weeks&mdash;and what it is trying to achieve. Indeed, very few believe that it will produce anything but the &quot;right&quot; result in terms of what the Government now seek. As one home educator told me, &quot;They keep asking us for our views and when we don't give them the right answer they come back and ask again.&quot; It seems to be a function of Government all too often&mdash;not just in the education sphere but beyond&mdash;that they look at individuals who are not doing the conventional, standard thing. I therefore want to ensure that home educators' concerns are firmly put on the record.</p>
	<p pid="a.219.0/4">It is important to clarify the law when it comes to education. The Human Rights Act 1998 states:</p>
	<p pid="a.219.0/5" class="indent">&quot;In the exercise of any functions which it assumes in relation to education and to teaching, the State shall respect the right of parents to ensure such education and teaching in conformity with their own religious and philosophical convictions.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.219.0/6">The Government have a right only to ensure that the education that the state, predominantly via local government, provides is of good quality, and the authorities can intervene only when people are seen to be breaking the law. It is for the same reason that police do not routinely visit people's homes to check for stolen property. Therefore, there is an overwhelming case that home educators should be allowed to get on with their lives without undue state interference.</p>
	<p pid="a.219.0/7">Unfortunately, local authorities have become increasingly confused about what is law and what is merely Government guidance. I believe that much of the confusion arises from the Government's Every Child Matters agenda, in which issues of education, health and welfare have been conflated. Home educators are deeply concerned about that. The Every Child Matters outcomes are to be healthy, to stay safe, to enjoy and achieve, to make a positive contribution and to achieve economic well-being. The Government have naturally found it rather difficult to ensure that that agenda is being applied by parents in choosing to home educate a child.</p>
	<p pid="a.219.0/8">On launching the latest consultation, the Government suggested that local authorities and children's organisations had expressed concern about the current system's ability adequately to support and monitor the education, safety and well-being of home-educated children. That fits with a growing body of evidence from home educators that they are more regularly encountering social workers, who turn up, often unannounced, to make demands: evidence of class timetables, written work and so on. In considering forced marriage, the Select Committee on Home Affairs has also raised the fear that home schooling might be used as a cover for something more sinister.</p>
	<p pid="a.219.0/9">However, home educators vigorously reject the attempts by the Government to mix concerns about child welfare into any review of home education. They believe that the Government's concerns in that regard are in line with the misunderstanding that a child is safe when seen once or twice by a local authority. Furthermore, home educators feel that once the proposition has been made that home education can be used as a cover for child abuse, the onus of proof has shifted on to them to prove their innocence. That is not in any way desirable.</p>
	<p pid="a.219.0/10">Many home educators believe that the mixing of agendas stems partly from a fundamental misunderstanding of how they school their children. Much of the Government involvement in this area has linked work on uncovering hidden children to home education. In reality, very few home-educated children are hidden, as much of their education is conducted outside the home. Home-educated children are normally seen by a wide range of adults and children: education officers at museums, other home educators, private tutors and normal contacts such as GPs, librarians and youth group leaders.</p>
	<p pid="a.219.0/11">I am not diminishing in any way legitimate concerns about child abuse. I have a great deal of sympathy for the Government in the very difficult task that they face in preventing cases similar to the appalling ones that we have heard about recently. However, we must be clear. Local authorities, as the hon. Member for St. Ives pointed out, already have powers to get involved in a family when there are concerns about abuse. Admittedly the processes involved can sometimes fail, but that is not the fault of the home educator. It is for Government to re-examine social services procedures if there are concerns.</p>
	<p pid="a.219.0/12">The uncomfortable truth is that no amount of legislation will ever remove all risk. The task of Government is to balance the rights of all individuals. Given that home-educated children are not proven to be at any greater risk, it is inappropriate to throw away the liberty of parents, even in part, to choose how to educate their child, particularly when it is equally possible for a child to go to school and be abused when they return home or for children in the care of the state to suffer abuse.</p>
	<p pid="a.219.0/13">With regard to the other aspirations in the Every Child Matters agenda, home educators contend that they are far more likely to fulfil the Government's objectives than the state system. Home education is personalised, child led and free from some of the detrimental effects of curriculum constraints, constant testing and standardisation. Home-schooled children can learn autonomously, often spend more time on physical activity and can learn in an environment free from bullying and peer pressure. Many studies have shown that, regardless of socio-economic background, home-educated children consistently outperform school-educated children.</p>
	<p pid="a.219.0/14">The Government, however, regularly fail to fulfil the Every Child Matters objectives. The number of pupils achieving grades A* to C in GCSE exams remains only 57.1 per cent. Well-being surveys point to mental dissatisfaction in many children in our country. As the Minister will be aware, the UK was ranked in the bottom third for five of the six dimensions in UNICEF's report on childhood in industrialised countries only last year.</p>
	<p pid="a.219.0/15">Against such a background, it is perhaps not surprising that in Essex, for example, even the county council, as the education authority, accepts that home education can be a safer bet. Six families there will be paid a little over &pound;10,000 each to educate their children at home because the parents have refused to send their children to what are universally regarded as failing schools in Clacton-on-Sea.</p>
	<p pid="a.219.0/16">I could say quite a lot more, and I appreciate that I have taken rather more time than I have given the Minister. That is simply because we are waiting for the Badman review, and it would be invidious to expect her to half-guess what it will say or to announce anything that might prejudge it. I am sure that we will return to many of these issues once the review is in place and the ever-vigilant community of home educators has its say on some of the proposals in the review.</p>
	<p pid="a.219.0/17">It is difficult firmly to say what, if anything, home educators want from the Government. By definition, the community is very diverse, and it is impossible for every home-educating parent to speak with one voice; indeed, it is rather desirable that they have no wish to do so. However, most in the community simply wish to defend their independence, and they reject any attempt by national or local government to impose the state's values on them and their children.</p>
	<p pid="a.219.0/18">With one review after another in recent years, home educators are frustrated, and the majority feel that the Government are incapable of trusting parents to do the best for their children. Yes, parents do fail sometimes, but so, too, do the Government. We cannot prevent all cases in which a child is abused or not given a decent education; indeed, such cases happen just as often&mdash;in fact, rather more often&mdash;when the state is involved. It is for Governments to assess risk and to ask which areas warrant more attention.</p>
	<p pid="a.219.0/19">Increased intervention makes little financial sense and has the potential to divert resources from truly vulnerable children. It also further infringes the rights of parents to make the best decisions for their children. Current legislation is perfectly adequate, but poorly understood. The Government must guard parents' sacred right to educate their children, while vigorously tightening the current system of child welfare. After that, the Government should look at their own ability to fulfil the Every Child Matters objectives, rather than continue to pursue those who put their faith, time and passion into home education.</p>

I congratulate him on securing this short debate and I thank other hon. Members for their contributions.</p>
	<p pid="a.222.0/2">The Government are committed to building a world-class education system for our children. That system must be built on the highest standards of teaching, real choice for parents and pupils, and rigorous accountability. Home education is a vital part of that system. This debate draws out two important themes, which must be held in balance. One is the right of parents to decide what is best for their children in their education and development. The other is the right of every child to receive a high standard of education in a safe, secure environment.</p>
	<p pid="a.222.0/3">At present, in England, we have a system that takes great account of the rights of parents to choose an education for their child that</p>
	<p pid="a.222.0/4" class="indent">&quot;is in conformity with their own religious and philosophical convictions&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.222.0/5">However, every child has the fundamental right to receive an education, and we need to ensure that that important human right is delivered for every child in the land, even in those rare cases where their parents' convictions conflict with their right to be educated.</p>

	<p pid="a.222.2/1">It would be rather extreme convictions. It would be a very small number of parents who did not want their children to be educated. It would be a very extreme belief or philosophy that made them follow that path, and the state would, rightly, have to take a view.</p>
	<p pid="a.222.2/2">We must also ensure that children have the opportunity freely to express their views about the education that they receive, in line with the United Nations convention on the rights of the child. That is a difficult balancing act, and Graham Badman's review is considering it carefully. There can be no question but that we need to ensure that every child receives a good and safe education, and the hon. Gentleman highlighted that in much of his speech.</p>
	<p pid="a.222.2/3">Let me turn now to the benefits of home education. Home education is a well-established part of our education system. Where it works, and where it is the best option for a child, there are great benefits. It is the ultimate form of personalised learning, with provision tailored to a child's specific needs and with a real opportunity for the child's views and voice to be heard. It also demonstrates real engagement by parents in their child's learning, which is something that we are trying to encourage more consistently across the national picture, whatever educational setting children are in. Furthermore, the sense of community that the hon. Gentleman describes between home educators in his constituency is something that we want to see in other educational provision, with partnerships between providers, the sharing of resources in communities and the maximising of the opportunities available to young people.</p>
	<p pid="a.222.2/4">The vast majority of home educators do an excellent job, and the examples that the hon. Gentleman and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1798" name="Anne Main">the hon. Member for St. Albans (Anne Main)</phrase> cite from their constituencies are clearly testament to that. Let me be clear from the outset that the Government recognise the valuable contribution made by home education, and we certainly do not seek to abolish it.</p>
	<p pid="a.222.2/5">On the review, the hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster is wrong to say that home education has been consistently under scrutiny since 2004. We first issued guidance on the issue in 2007, clarifying the role and obligations of parents and local authorities. The guidance brought together the statutory requirements and the roles and obligations of parents and local authorities, as well as the Department's view on how those should be interpreted in practice. There were no new requirements, and local authorities and home educators told us that it was helpful to bring everything together in one place so that everyone involved in home education could refer to it.</p>
	<p pid="a.222.2/6">The duty to identify children who are missing education, which was introduced by the Education and Inspections Act 2006, was not a duty to identify home educators. Its purpose was far broader: to identify children who are receiving no education at all. Children who are home educated will inevitably be identified where they are not known to local authorities, but provided that they receive a suitable education, there is no reason why the new duty should have any impact on them or their parents. I think that the hon. Gentleman accepts that we need to do everything we can to ensure that children do not go missing from the education system. I hope that he will support our efforts to ensure that all children attend school regularly or receive a good-quality home education.</p>
	<p pid="a.222.2/7">Graham Badman's review of home education was set up for a number of reasons. It is looking at the barriers to local authorities and other public agencies safeguarding home-educated children, as well as at ensuring that their safety, well-being and broader development are nurtured along with their academic achievement. It is also looking at the extent to which home education might be being used as a cover for child abuse, at whether local authorities are providing the right support to home-educating families and at whether any changes are needed to the processes for monitoring the standard of home education.</p>
	<p pid="a.222.2/8">In November 2007, we issued guidance on home education to local authorities, but clarity about roles and responsibilities has still not been achieved. The responses from home educators and local authorities to the consultation on the guidance only underlined the polarised views on this matter. It is clear that further clarity is needed. The underpinning principles behind the criteria for the review are therefore not sinister. They are sensible and simple. They are intended to ensure that everybody involved in home education&mdash;local government, central Government and parents&mdash;is clear about their responsibilities and that there are clear lines of accountability. They are also intended to achieve greater national consistency in providing suitable full-time education for all children and to ensure that, where there are problems, safeguards are in place to detect them and to allow us to intervene quickly.</p>
	<p pid="a.222.2/9">Graham Badman wanted to ensure that he took account of all the evidence that could be gathered, and that is why he made a public call for evidence. Reference was made to the 12-week consultation period being shortened to four weeks, but we are talking about a review, not a formal Government consultation. That is why there is a little uncertainty about the 12-week period. Home education is a vital part of the education system. The review is&mdash;</p>

	<p pid="a.225.1/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend the Minister on his appointment, which is richly deserved. I was rather surprised myself this morning when my office told me that the man from No. 10 had been on the phone. In fact it was the man from No. 10 in a particular road in my constituency, who wanted to talk to me about his long-standing drainage problems.</p>
	<p pid="a.225.1/2">The idea for this debate originated in parliamentary discussions I chaired earlier this year, under the banner of the Inter-Parliamentary Union, with a visiting delegation from the United Arab Emirates. I am delighted that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1699" name="Nicholas Winterton">the hon. Member for Macclesfield (Sir Nicholas Winterton)</phrase> is present today, because he took a big part in the discussions, which lasted two or three hours and were very fruitful. Subsequently I received an invitation from the Speaker of the Federal National Council to visit the United Arab Emirates and have further discussions. My accommodation was paid for during that visit by the Mashreq bank and I have made the necessary declarations in the Register of Members' Interests.</p>
	<p pid="a.225.1/3">During those parliamentary discussions, we ranged over a large number of different topics. The historical links between our two nations are of course very close. Today 120,000 British nationals live and work in the United Arab Emirates. I am told that there are about 1 million British visitors a year. There are very many business links. Obviously, Barclays bank is much in the news at the moment. Those business interests have expanded from the oil and energy sectors to the finance sector in recent years. There are many sporting and cultural links. For example, the main English language newspaper in the Gulf is edited by a former editor of <i>The Daily Telegraph</i> and citizens of Abu Dhabi have a particular interest in the Manchester City's results. Equally, our defence interests are strong. Our defence co-operation agreement represents the UK's largest defence commitment outside NATO. The UAE is our largest export market in the middle east for non-military goods.</p>
	<p pid="a.225.1/4">I could have concentrated my remarks on any of those aspects of our relations, but I decided to focus the debate on the issue of the islands of Abu Musa and the Greater and Lesser Tunbs. The delegation from the Federal National Council was keen to impress on the UK Parliament the importance of the islands and the part that they play in political debate in both the United Arab Emirates and the wider Gulf. I checked up, and the last time the issue was raised in the House was when Edward Heath was Prime Minister in 1971. It was in that debate of December 1971 that figures such as Sir Alec Douglas-Home, the Foreign Secretary at that stage, Jeremy Thorpe and Roy Hattersley all gave the House the benefit of their opinions. Having researched some of the history, I decided that it was about time that the subject got another little airing; so this is the story.</p>
	<p pid="a.225.1/5">Abu Musa, the Greater Tunb and the Lesser Tunb are three small but strategic islands located along the narrow route through the Gulf into the straits of Hormuz and out into the gulf of Oman. Much of the Gulf's oil exports and its non-oil imports pass along that route, as do naval vessels entering and exiting the Gulf. Indeed, a fifth of the world's oil supplies pass through the straits of Hormuz. About 15 million barrels per day, equivalent to Europe's daily consumption, pass through the mouth of the Gulf in tankers that must slow down to navigate a hairpin turn in waters 35 miles wide at the straits' narrowest point. In addition, a number of the Gulf's offshore oil and gas fields are located in the vicinity.</p>
	<p pid="a.225.1/6">In the early to mid-18th century, the three islands were used on a seasonal basis by Arab tribes dependent on, and loyal to, the Qawasin, a clan based in Ras al-Khaimah. The islands were a source of fresh water and refuge from bad weather and political trouble&mdash;a sort of Chequers in the Gulf, really. The Abu Musa island is only 12 sq km. Abu Musa is the name of both a town and an island. It has a population of around 500, and is notable for its golden sandy beaches. The nearby Greater and Lesser Tunbs derive their title from the word &quot;Tunb&quot;, which is an Arab word meaning a long rope used to erect a tent. The Greater Tunb has a surface area of 10 sq km and is known for its red soil. The Lesser Tunb has a surface area of 2 sq km and is uninhabitable.</p>
	<p pid="a.225.1/7">There is, inevitably, a complex story to be told in the region, but in essence it appears that successive UK Governments unequivocally endorsed the claims of Sharjah and Ras al-Khaimah to Abu Musa and the two Tunbs respectively while those kingdoms were under British protection in terms of the 1892 treaties with the Trucial States. Iran did not accept those claims. However, following the decision in 1968 to withdraw British forces from the Gulf, while formally upholding the &quot;Arab claims&quot;, successive UK Governments in practice focused on trying to achieve a peaceful, compromise resolution of the territorial disputes as part of Britain's legacy.</p>
	<p pid="a.225.1/8">Once Iran knew that Britain was departing it made a variety of claims, all the more forcefully, for a variety of territories in the Gulf. For example, the Government of Iran put forward a claim for the whole of the island of Bahrain. In the wake of a referendum on Bahrain under United Nations supervision, Iran was obliged to abandon its claim. It promptly revived its dormant claim to Abu Musa and the Greater and Lesser Tunbs. Ultimately, the then Conservative Government were unable to secure a deal for all three islands in 1971. That proved achievable only with regard to Abu Musa. Iran and Sharjah agreed to a joint administration of Abu Musa, without prejudice to their competing territorial claims. The late Sheikh Khalid Mohammed, who was the ruler of Sharjah at that time, said:</p>
	<p pid="a.225.1/9" class="indent">&quot;I had spent about two years collecting documents proving that the island is Arab territory, and that it belongs to Sharjah. I had asked a team of jurists to prepare legal documents and papers. These were presented to the Iranian Government. However, the logic of force and threat allowed no room for reason and legitimate proofs...Several factors contributed to the delicacy of the situation, combining to form significant pressure...Thus, after consultations with brothers, I deemed it appropriate to seek a formula that would freeze the problem politically, while dealing with it economically. Hence came the said agreement.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.225.1/10">Iran then seized Greater and Lesser Tunbs by an amphibious assault using hovercraft in the very last hours of the British protectorate and just before the coming into existence of the United Arab Emirates. One Arab policeman and three Iranians were killed. Richard Mobley, in an interesting article in <i>Naval War College Review </i>in autumn 2003, said of the period leading to the creation of the United Arab Emirates that</p>
	<p pid="a.225.1/11" class="indent">&quot;the United Kingdom, on behalf of the emirates of Sharjah and Ras Al Khaimah, asserted that all three islands were Arab territory. London explicitly backed Sharjah's claim to Abu Musa and Ras Al Khaimah's claim to the Tunbs. With its security obligations scheduled to lapse by the end of 1971, however, Great Britain attempted to resolve the islands dispute while fostering the creation of the new United Arab Emirates.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.225.1/12">I now want to make a brief reference to the exchanges in the House that I have referred to already, which followed the invasion of the Tunbs in December 1971. Sir Alec Douglas-Home stated on 6<sup>( )</sup>December:</p>
	<p pid="a.225.1/13" class="indent">&quot;Once the decision to withdraw our forces from the Gulf and to end our special treaty relationships with the Gulf States was taken, it was inevitable that these long dormant disputes would come into the open. Our aim has therefore been to settle these issues where possible, so that they would not drag on, generating suspicion and hostility in the future.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.225.1/14">Jeremy Thorpe then asked a question. He said that</p>
	<p pid="a.225.1/15" class="indent">&quot;when the Tunbs were invaded we were still under treaty obligations to Sharjah. As a result of that, is it our intention to use our good offices between the Sheikh of Sharjah and the Shah of Iran to bring about some amicable settlement? Does he accept that we have continuing political obligation in that connection?&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.225.1/16">Roy Hattersley then spoke:</p>
	<p pid="a.225.1/17" class="indent">&quot;The right hon. Gentleman&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.225.1/18">the then Secretary of State&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.225.1/19" class="indent">&quot;said that so far as the sovereignty of the Tunbs and Abu Musa is concerned the issue remains open. Is that the view of the Government of Iran or is it the Foreign Secretary's view?&quot;&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="debates/1971-12-06.944"><i>Official Report</i>, 6 December 1971; Vol. 827, cc. 944</phrase> to 949.]</p>
	<p pid="a.225.1/20">What happened next? Diplomatic relations were established between Iran and the United Arab Emirates in October 1972. On <phrase class="date" code="1972-10-05">5 October 1972</phrase>, a statement was read to the 27th session of the General Assembly of the United Nations in which the UAE reaffirmed its sovereignty over the islands. A similar statement was read out before the Security Council on <phrase class="date" code="1974-02-20">20 February 1974</phrase>; and a third statement was read to the UN Special Political Committee on <phrase class="date" code="1974-11-19">19 November 1974</phrase>. In 1980, the UAE joined five other nations to form the GCC&mdash;the Gulf Co-operation Council.</p>
	<p pid="a.225.1/21">Throughout the 1980s, the dispute over the islands was overshadowed by the Iran-Iraq War. The Iranians began encroaching beyond the assigned area for their presence in Abu Musa by constructing roads and an airport, and other civilian and military installations. In 1987, they moved troops to the southern side of Abu Musa. In late 1991, Iran imposed restrictions on third-party citizens wishing to enter the UAE zone of Abu Musa by requiring entry permits. The UAE rejected that measure, so in April 1992, Iran ordered all foreigners off the island. Those foreigners ran the UAE-sponsored school, medical clinic and power-generating station. Iran took full control of the island.</p>
	<p pid="a.225.1/22">After the UAE had taken the matter to the GCC in September 1992, Iran declared full sovereignty over the islands. However, the dispute was temporarily resolved when Iran and Sharjah agreed to abide by the 1971 agreement. When Iraq made threatening moves towards Kuwait in October 1994, Iran increased its military presence on Abu Musa. When the crisis subsided, Iranian troops remained on the island and surface-to-air missiles and anti-ship missiles were deployed. American Secretary of State for Defence Perry noted that Iran had deployed chemical weapons in the Gulf, particularly on Abu Musa.</p>

	<p pid="a.228.0/1">I congratulate the hon. Gentleman on securing this debate, which is critical and on a matter of great principle. He referred to the distinguished UAE delegation that visited the United Kingdom earlier this year, and to our discussions about the three disputed islands. Does he believe that the islands belong to the Arabs, and that the United Kingdom Government should make it extremely clear to the Governments of the UAE that we will support them in every possible way in seeking about to bring a peaceful conclusion?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-06-09a.228.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1807" speakername="John Grogan" colnum="228"  time="013:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090609/halltext/90609h0011.htm#09060973000631">
	<p pid="a.228.1/1">As always, the hon. Gentleman cuts to the quick. Having studied their history, I agree that the UAE has a strong case for claiming the islands. If the hon. Gentleman bears with me, I shall suggest a way forward in my closing remarks.</p>
	<p pid="a.228.1/2">Tensions between Iran and its Arab neighbours have a long history. Despite that, however, there are many modern-day ties between the UAE and Iran. For example, the UAE is Iran's main trade partner. The director general of the trade planning office of Iran's trade development organisation has said that Iran's exports to the UAE have been on the rise, with an average growth rate of 27.8 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="a.228.1/3">Earlier this month, the Prime Minister of the United Arab Emirates hailed the advancing trade ties between Iran and the UAE, saying that said the two sides enjoyed &quot;deep-rooted and amicable relations&quot;. He reiterated that the UAE will never interfere in the internal affairs of other countries, particularly Iran, and said that he always stresses the importance of improving ties with all countries. He expressed hope that the middle east would be free from weapons of mass destruction but supported Iran's peaceful use of nuclear power for energy.</p>
	<p pid="a.228.1/4">Sheikh Mohammed said that disputes</p>
	<p pid="a.228.1/5" class="indent">&quot;over national borders have never prevented trade and human exchange&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.228.1/6">He also said:</p>
	<p pid="a.228.1/7" class="indent">&quot;Trade relations between any two nations always lead to better relations and facilitate the resolution of conflicts.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.228.1/8">The commentator Hassan al-Alkin put it another way. He noted that the UAE</p>
	<p pid="a.228.1/9" class="indent">&quot;has pursued a policy of peace co-existence with Iran, hoping that the development of good relations would inevitably lead to the settlement of contentious problems.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.228.1/10">On <phrase class="date" code="2009-05-23">23 May 2009</phrase>, the Minister of State for Foreign Affairs, Anwar Mohammed Gargash, gave more detail on the approach of the UAE to the three disputed islands. He said that his country wants to resolve the issue through direct talks or international arbitration. At a side-meeting of the Organisation of the Islamic Conference in Damascus, Gargash said:</p>
	<p pid="a.228.1/11" class="indent">&quot;The Emirates want to resolve the occupied islands problem with neighbouring Iran&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.228.1/12">He continued:</p>
	<p pid="a.228.1/13" class="indent">&quot;Unfortunately despite the passage of more than three decades I cannot remember there having been any positive issues in that respect&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.228.1/14">In recent times, there have been a number of statements of support from the international community in favour of referring the issue to the International Court of Justice at The Hague, in accordance with article 33 of the charter of the United Nations and article 36 of the statute of the International Court of Justice. Not surprisingly, the Gulf Co-operation Council countries&mdash;including Kuwait, Oman, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and Qatar&mdash;have repeatedly backed the UAE, which is an approach that I endorse. However, there has been wider support.</p>
	<p pid="a.228.1/15">In April 2009, the EU and GCC reiterated their support in a joint communiqu&eacute; for a peaceful settlement of the dispute in accordance with international law through direct negotiations between the parties or by referring the matter to International Court of Justice. In January 2009, the Speakers of the Italian and Turkish Parliaments spoke on the matter. The Speaker of the Italian Parliament said that Abu Musa and the Greater and Lesser Tunbs belong to the UAE and that diplomacy is the way to restore them. The Speaker of the Turkish Parliament said that he would speak to the Speaker of the Iranian Parliament, urging the country to speed up the resolution of the dispute. Last year, the US deputy assistant Defence Secretary for middle eastern affairs, Christopher Straub, supported the UAE's claim over the islands, accusing Iran of exercising hegemonic behaviour in the region.</p>
	<p pid="a.228.1/16">In recent years, the UAE has painstakingly set out its legal and historical case for sovereignty over the three islands. It points to a clear British recognition of that claim during the protection of the Trucial states. It notes the protestation to Britain by the then rulers of the two Emirates against Iranian violations of its sovereignty. The two Emirates exercised all aspects of sovereignty over the islands before the Iranian invasion, including levying and collecting taxes and duties from pearl fishers and shepherds using the island, installing governors on the island, running public services and so on.</p>
	<p pid="a.228.1/17">The best way ahead is surely for the International Court of Justice to consider the matter in detail and to reach a conclusion. As I have said, I believe that the UAE has a strong case. Of course, there are many others area of contention in the Gulf and the middle east, but the islands of Abu Musa and the Greater and Lesser Tunbs should not be forgotten by the House. We have a long and historic association with the UAE and a responsibility to comment on the matter. Indeed, given the strategic location of the islands, the security and stability of the Gulf region will remain fragile in the absence of an effective resolution.</p>

	<p pid="a.229.0/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1807" name="John Grogan">the Member for Selby (Mr. Grogan)</phrase>&mdash;my honourable and good friend&mdash;on securing this Adjournment debate. I thank him for his generous and kind remarks on my new role. I suspect that No. 10 has not been in contact with my hon. Friend this morning, because it has been trying the wrong number. I will happily share the correct number later&mdash;not, I hasten to add, that I have the ability to influence decisions taken there.</p>
	<p pid="a.229.0/2">My hon. Friend has raised an incredibly important issue. The Foreign Office and the Government are concerned by the continuing dispute between the UAE and Iran over the over the islands of Abu Musa, Lesser Tunb and Greater Tunb. As previous Ministers have made clear, we support a peaceful settlement of the dispute by means in accordance with international law. That might be through direct bilateral discussions or undertaken through international mechanisms, such as the International Court of Justice. The United Kingdom, the Gulf Co-operation Council and the European Union are concerned about the lack of progress. As his Excellency, Sheikh Mohamed bin Rashid, Prime Minister of the UAE, said last week:</p>
	<p pid="a.229.0/3" class="indent">&quot;If this issue is resolved...we could together avoid all that could possibly disturb the security and stability of this region and the relationship between the two countries.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.229.0/4">Of course, any agreement must be in accordance with international law.</p>
	<p pid="a.229.0/5">British interests demand peace, tranquillity and constructive relationships in the middle east and in the Gulf. That is the entire focus of British foreign policy in the region, where we have long-standing friendships and partnerships. Events in the Gulf have profound effects on our own security, economy and commercial interests. As hon. Members are aware, the Gulf has 60 per cent. of the world's oil reserves and 40 per cent. of its gas reserves. We work closely with Gulf nations to enhance regional security, to combat terrorism and to develop a sustainable and successful global economy. As the Foreign Secretary said only last month, in just two generations, the Gulf states have created some of the most advanced and inspiring cities in the world.</p>
	<p pid="a.229.0/6">The UAE is one of the UK's closest allies, and we enjoy a long-standing, warm and valued relationship built on years of co-operation in fields as diverse as trade, defence and low carbon energy. For some years, we have been working in co-operation with the UAE in the development of its military capability, and we have assured our Emirati friends of our substantial and enduring support to their security as well as our commitment to that of the wider Gulf region. These close ties have been brought even closer by our peoples&mdash;the migration and travel of UK and UAE citizens&mdash;and by trade. The UAE is now the biggest middle east export market for UK companies. In fact, the UK exports more to the Gulf than it does to China and Hong Kong combined&mdash;a total of &pound;12 billion of goods and services in 2007. About 130,000 UK nationals live in the UAE and more than 1 million visit every year. Many UK companies have a presence in the UAE, including representatives of our banking profession, construction industry and energy sector.</p>
	<p pid="a.229.0/7">To echo the words of my right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary during his visit to the UAE last November, the UAE is a global success story and a</p>
	<p pid="a.229.0/8" class="indent">&quot;model of openness; business-friendly, tolerant, peaceful and responsible...a microcosm of what a successful Middle East can become&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.229.0/9">If I may, Mr. Weir, I shall depart briefly from my script and refer to a comment made by my hon. Friend. The most important recent development is the fact that the UAE now owns Manchester City, which is the most important and successful football team in the world&mdash;at least that will be the future story. I wish that I could say, hand on heart, that that has been the story of the past 30 years, but I have chosen to support the club in an era when trophies have not been readily available. However, I am delighted not only that the UAE's royal family have assumed ownership of the club, but that so far they have been very clear about their responsibility to the wider community.</p>
	<p pid="a.229.0/10">I pay tribute to them not just for purchasing the football club and being determined to make it successful, but for caring passionately about the city of Manchester and about Greater Manchester more generally. That relationship with Manchester City will bring opportunities in economic regeneration, social relationships and bridging divides between different regions of the world. I have been very impressed during these early days. I also have four season tickets, Mr. Weir, so I do not spend my time in the corporate hospitality part of the great stadium of Eastlands.</p>

	<p pid="a.231.1/1">I shall move on, Mr. Weir. I just thought that it was important to make that serious point.

That is important educationally, culturally and economically, and I welcome the early stages of that relationship.</p>

	<p pid="a.231.2/1">I congratulate the Minister on his appointment and new responsibilities; they are, indeed, richly deserved. However, have not his comments emphasised the importance of a total commitment from us to the UAE that it will always have our support in this matter? Clearly it owns those islands, and it must be in no doubt that we will give it ongoing and total support.</p>

	<p pid="a.231.3/1">As ever, the hon. Gentleman makes a salient point. The British role is to argue, advocate and facilitate a solution that underpins stability in the region, and that is consistent with international law. It would be easy, especially on day two of my new job, to engage in bellicose rhetoric, but that would not be appropriate in this job, and I have never done it in any previous job. In this new role, grandstanding will not help the situation. I have made clear our friendship and economic and social relationship with the UAE, which are as deep-rooted as those with almost any other country. We are very proud of that relationship, and we want to deepen and strengthen it in future.</p>
	<p pid="a.231.3/2">We believe in the need for a just settlement in the matter before us today. The best role that we can play is to continue to make that point to the UAE and to use all means possible through international institutions to influence Iran's attitude and to encourage it to desire a sensible and fair settlement of that long-standing dispute, which continues to be a bone of contention and adds to instability and insecurity. We hope for rapid progress, but we want to facilitate a solution. It is very important, however, that whatever solution emerges is consistent with international law.</p>
	<p pid="a.231.3/3">As hon. Members are aware, regional security in that part of the world is vital. We therefore support efforts to resolve the issues peacefully and quickly. History has shown that acts of aggression do not create lasting peace and stability. As hon. Members have said, we remain concerned about the lack of progress in a dispute that has lasted for 40 years, and we shall continue to do everything in our power to facilitate a fair and just settlement by any standards in accordance with international law. My new role gives me an opportunity to engage afresh with this issue and to consider mechanisms&mdash;perhaps bilateral, but more realistically through international institutions&mdash;to begin a process to end this 40-year-old dispute. I shall focus on this matter, consider what is possible and keep hon. Members informed of any progress that we can make.</p>
