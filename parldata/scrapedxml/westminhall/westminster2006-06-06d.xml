<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-06-06d.2.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1977" speakername="Anne Moffat" colnum="2"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060606/halltext/60606h0128.htm#06060647000573">
	<p pid="d.2.1/1">That is a key point. This debate is about the fact that resources are being taken from clubs, when what is needed is far more investment. I agree with my hon. Friend and Walter Smith.</p>
	<p pid="d.2.1/2">The Inland Revenue operated a concession that allowed junior football clubs to submit retrospectively informal returns detailing payments to players and coaching staff, giving their national insurance numbers. Clubs understood that any tax due to the Inland Revenue was then the responsibility of the players themselves. However, from the 2003-04 season, junior football clubs have had dealings with the Inland Revenue over the introduction of direct taxation for all payments to players and coaching staff. The Inland Revenue has determined that junior clubs are employers and, as such, are responsible for operating a pay-as-you-earn scheme. That is the crux of the matter. No one disputes that players should pay tax on what they earn, but we should not make clubs enforce the pay-as-you-earn scheme.</p>
	<p pid="d.2.1/3">Since that time, to make matters even worse, the Inland Revenue has written to some junior clubs in Scotland seeking back-dated revenue, in some cases up to several thousand pounds. With the best will in the world, I would have to say that the measures have tackitty bits written all over them. The junior football clubs rely heavily on local fundraising initiatives such as running totes or selling scratchcards simply to stay afloat. Unlike senior football clubs, the small junior clubs do not generate significant income from home games&mdash;for example, in my constituency, Musselburgh Athletic averages about 80 spectators to a home game. None the less, that is a big part of the community. Everyone loves the team. It is no great shakes&mdash;it is not your Ibrox, your Hamden or even your Parkhead&mdash;but it is an important part of the community. When 80 people go to watch a game and there are 22 players at the park, those people are not doing some of the other things that youngsters do. They are not engaging in antisocial behaviour or hanging around on street corners. It is clubs like those that are being hit for money and, without wishing to sound melodramatic, that will put them under a serious threat.</p>
	<p pid="d.2.1/4">At a recent meeting in my constituency, which has four registered junior teams&mdash; Dunbar United, Tranent Juniors, Musselburgh Athletic, which I have mentioned, and Haddington Athletic&mdash;people were up in arms about what they saw as the decimation of junior football clubs by the heavy-boot tactics of the Inland Revenue. To illustrate how ludicrous the situation is, Tranent Juniors is struggling even to find pitches to play on. It is trying to find out whether it can use school pitches, even though it is a successful junior football team, which could be the future of Scottish football&mdash;and we certainly need a future for Scottish football. Representatives of teams in my constituency, as well as neighbouring Midlothian&mdash;my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2001" name="David Hamilton">the Member for Midlothian (Mr. Hamilton)</phrase>, who could not be here today, would want to express the same concerns as I have&mdash;fear that the demands being made on their clubs will cause them to fold.</p>
	<p pid="d.2.1/5">The clubs are run by local individuals who volunteer to give up their time and effort to provide a valuable resource to their communities. My fear is that many of those unpaid volunteers, who are now expected to sort out their players' tax affairs and become financial experts and form-filling anoraks with a nearly degree-level understanding of PAYE, will walk away. Who could blame them? They are ordinary folk, some of whom are retired, who give of themselves, not for thanks and accolades, but certainly not for worry and the sleepless nights that the new burdens will place on them.</p>

	<p pid="d.6.1/1">It is a great privilege to follow my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1977" name="Anne Moffat">the Member for East Lothian (Anne Moffat)</phrase>, who is a good and long-standing friend.</p>
	<p pid="d.6.1/2">If Martians decide to invade this world in the near future, they will wonder where we all are. Most of us will be sitting watching television, and a lucky few will be over in Germany, being looked after by McDonald's, although I will not be one of them, thank God. Things have not always been this way, and mass coverage on television and the influence of big money and Russian billionaires have obviously raised the profile of football.</p>
	<p pid="d.6.1/3">The other day, I was thinking about what things were like when I was younger. The last time the World cup was held in Germany was during England's sabbatical from the competition, and the British Isles representative was the country of my hon. Friend the Member for East Lothian and most of the hon. Members here today. There were some real stars in that squad, such as Jim Stewart, Donald Ford and Tommy Allan. Who can forget them? Who can remember them? Of course, there was also Kenny Dalglish, Danny McGrain and Jim Holton&mdash;six foot two, eyes of blue. There was Billy Bremner, the man we all love to hate, and Jimmy Johnstone, the man we all love to love. Sadly, as well as being great footballers, the last three have one thing common&mdash;they are no longer with us, which is sad for us.</p>
	<p pid="d.6.1/4">In 1974, I was not the man you see before you now, Mr. Chope. I was 20&mdash;that was my age, not my weight&mdash;and I was playing local football, as were hundreds of thousands of other people, just as they are now. Then, as now, the world of football seen on our screens is not the real world of football. Then, that was merely pub and club football and some school football. Today's world is different and the situation is different.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-06-06d.8.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1974" speakername="James McGovern" colnum="8"  time="009:54:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060606/halltext/60606h0128.htm#06060647000596">
	<p pid="d.8.0/1">I fear that with such a specific topic up for debate today, you may hear the same speech, or variations on it, several times, Mr. Chope. I apologise in advance if that is the case.</p>
	<p pid="d.8.0/2">I start by congratulating my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1977" name="Anne Moffat">the Member for East Lothian (Anne Moffat)</phrase> on securing this debate. I know that she takes an active local interest in this issue. She should be praised for the hard work she has done locally, and the fine way in which she laid out the arguments to start the debate.</p>
	<p pid="d.8.0/3">As a comparatively newly elected MP, I imagine that I come fairly late to the issue. My colleagues from around Scotland, notably my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1962" name="Brian H Donohoe">the Member for Central Ayrshire (Mr. Donohoe)</phrase>, who unfortunately is not here today, have been campaigning on this issue since the Revenue announced its intention to change the rules for Scottish junior football about four years ago.</p>
	<p pid="d.8.0/4">Despite this being a relatively long-standing issue, the debate is especially important and comes at an appropriate time. Junior football clubs across Scotland have just hung up their boots for the summer. The close season provides the opportunity for many of the unpaid volunteers who do such good work in those clubs to find the time and expertise to operate a PAYE system while trying to find ways to keep their clubs running with the extra burden that has been placed on them. The debate comes only a couple of months after tranche 2 of the Revenue's programme to get PAYE established throughout Scottish junior Football.</p>
	<p pid="d.8.0/5">My constituency has five junior football clubs, all of which are part of a proud tradition within Dundee. Despite being the new kids on the block, Downfield FC are celebrating their centenary this year. Dundee Violet were formed in 1883, and are therefore the oldest club, closely followed by what must be the most successful club in the region Lochee United, who managed to win 17 honours between 1977 and 1987. That feat has not been repeated in recent years, but it will not be easily forgotten. Indeed, last year Lochee managed to resurrect some of that fighting spirit and reached the final of the Scottish cup. My favourite team in Dundee, West&mdash;Lochee Harp&mdash;were formed in 1904, and Dundee North End make up Dundee, West's complement.</p>
	<p pid="d.8.0/6">In Perthshire, there are teams such as Jeanfield Swifts, Bankfoot, Kinnoull. Up in Angus, there are clubs such as Forfar Albion, Forfar West End, Brechin Vics, Arbroath Vics. Coming back down into Dundee, East, Carnoustie have been one of the most successful clubs in recent years, and were Scottish cup finalists a couple of years ago. Coming back into Dundee, there are Broughty Athletic and East Craigie. Unfortunately, my favourite team from Dundee, East&mdash;St. Joseph's&mdash;went defunct a few years ago because of financial considerations. Moving across the Tay bridge into Fife and the constituency of the leader of the Liberal Democrats, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1984" name="Menzies Campbell">the right hon. and learned Member for North-East Fife (Sir Menzies Campbell)</phrase>, teams include Tayport, who are probably the most successful team in Scotland in recent years at junior level. I think they have won the Scottish cup three times in the past five seasons. Moving through Fife into the Chancellor's constituency, there are clubs such as Lochgelly Albert, Lochore Welfare and Kelty Hearts.</p>
	<p pid="d.8.0/7">Throughout the Tayside and Fife area, junior football clubs are at the heart of every community.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-06-06d.10.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1974" speakername="James McGovern" colnum="10"  time="009:54:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060606/halltext/60606h0128.htm#06060647000600">
	<p pid="d.10.1/1">I could not possibly comment on that. This is the British Parliament and every MP is allowed to vote on every issue regardless of their constituency.</p>
	<p pid="d.10.1/2">As I suggested, this issue stems from the decision of one player on a fairly large retainer from a bigger club who claimed that he did not have to sort out his tax receipts as his club should do it for him. Whatever the reason, it seems that big assumptions have been made on the experience of a very limited set of teams, which has led to a regrettable situation.</p>
	<p pid="d.10.1/3">The new PAYE system, which many clubs are expected to introduce, replaces the informal returns system negotiated for junior football in the 1960s by Tam Dalyell, the former Member of Parliament for Linlithgow. That system allowed clubs simply to submit an informal return to the Inland Revenue each year, on which would be a full list of all the moneys that had been paid to players over the past year, allowing the Revenue to ensure that the players' tax returns were correct and thus ensure that it collected all the tax that was due to it. It should be emphasised that the aim of the informal agreement was not for the clubs to avoid tax altogether, but to ease the burden on the junior football clubs and to place it on the individual players and the Revenue. I like to think that that was partially in recognition of the unique role that junior football plays in Scotland and the desire in the 1960s to help maintain it.</p>
	<p pid="d.10.1/4">Phase one of the PAYE introduction tended to affect clubs that had social clubs attached to them and were more or less of a size that they could handle a PAYE system without its destroying the club. After all, some of the social clubs already employed staff and therefore applied PAYE to them. It caused some problems, although not as many as have been caused by the second tranche of the reforms.</p>
	<p pid="d.10.1/5">I want to discuss three key areas. First, I should like to emphasise my belief that junior football clubs are not &quot;employers&quot; as any reasonable person would understand the term, and should not be treated as such. Secondly, where the tax regulations have been introduced, it has been done in a manner that has promoted rather than reduced confusion, and they have often been perceived as incredibly unfair. Thirdly, I should like to address the effect that the new tax regime is having on the volunteers, who are crucial to the running of the clubs.</p>
	<p pid="d.10.1/6">The first problem is simply the mistaken belief that the clubs are employers. Under the strict letter of the law&mdash;I am talking about the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988&mdash;it is entirely possible that junior football clubs that pay their staff &quot;emoluments&quot;, which to most of us means bonuses, should operate a PAYE system in the payment of them. I can therefore see why, under the strict letter of the law, the Revenue has decided to take the position it is taking. However, it has a long history of working out special exemptions for certain areas in order to make an inflexible tax system just a little more flexible&mdash;in fact, that is exactly how the original arrangement came about. These exemptions and arrangements are designed to promote fairness in the tax system and to ensure that the burden of taxation and PAYE does not fall disproportionately on some people.</p>
	<p pid="d.10.1/7">The clubs do not operate as normal employers would and therefore should not be treated as employers by the tax system. I cannot think of another &quot;employer&quot; in which the entire board running the company&mdash;if we are to call clubs that now&mdash;get paid nothing at all and give up all their time for free. That does not sound like an employer to me. In fact, the more we examine the clubs and how they operate, the more they sound like exactly what they are: a collection of people who care about their local community and their local football team enough to give up many hours to support the clubs and their community. We are talking about a bunch of dedicated people who do not gain financially from their enterprise and who are not necessarily cut out to be finance directors or managing directors.</p>
	<p pid="d.10.1/8">Recently, I received an email from a secretary at one of the junior football clubs in the constituency of my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2001" name="David Hamilton">the Member for Midlothian (Mr. Hamilton)</phrase>&mdash;unfortunately, he cannot be here today&mdash;who summed things up well. He said:</p>
	<p pid="d.10.1/9" class="indent">&quot;Most of the guys who involve themselves in junior football clubs do it for the love of their local team. They are not rocket scientists but what they lack in brains they more than make up for with enthusiasm and the ability to gather funds locally.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="d.10.1/10">In addition to that, we need to be honest when we consider the sort of wages that are paid to the players at junior football clubs. I spoke to different clubs, and I was constantly struck by the low level of the payments that were causing all this trouble. Admittedly some players were given signing-on fees ranging from &pound;250 to &pound;1,000, but that aside, the so-called &quot;wages&quot; were small sums such as &pound;5 or &pound;10 for training sessions and away games. Again, it does not sound as if we are talking about the sort of employer that the Revenue would usually go after; in fact, it does not sound to me like an employer at all.</p>

I am unaware of any player going to a tribunal but I am sure that a few would regard themselves as being unfairly dismissed; in football terms, that is called a &quot;free transfer&quot;. [Hon. Members: &quot;On your bike&quot;] Yes.</p>
	<p pid="d.11.1/2">The decision to classify the teams as employers has other knock-on effects that are proving even more worrying for the game: For example, some clubs are being told that as they are now classified as employers they might have to start paying the minimum wage to their players. That, of course, stretches the law to whole new limits of absurdity. For example, I spoke to one club that was drawn in a Scottish junior cup game at the other end of the country. Such a journey could be from Ayrshire to Inverness and might take nearly five hours by bus. Another four hours at the stadium for the match and another five hours getting back home might be involved. If the club paid every player the minimum wage, the players would need to be paid more than &pound;75, as opposed to the &pound;5 or &pound;10 that most players get for an away game.</p>
	<p pid="d.11.1/3">If that were to happen, in the words of Tom Johnston, Secretary of the Scottish Junior Football Association:</p>
	<p pid="d.11.1/4" class="indent">&quot;We might as well shut up shop tomorrow, junior football would be finished.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="d.11.1/5">I know that that is not the Government's aim and I hope that they will be able to use good judgment to prevent such unintended consequences.</p>

	<p pid="d.13.3/1">My hon. Friend's intervention drives home the financial constraints facing these clubs. The new tax burden is just one more exacerbating factor.</p>
	<p pid="d.13.3/2">The volunteers and committee men&mdash;they are overwhelmingly men&mdash;are the lifeblood of the game and without them the clubs would simply cease to exist and the vital link that they provide for the community would go&mdash;and all for the sake of easing the bureaucracy for the Inland Revenue.</p>
	<p pid="d.13.3/3">I am sure that there must be a way through the problem, albeit that it might take a little imagination from the Inland Revenue. Perhaps the Revenue could design a system so that any club with player expenses below a certain level could be allowed to use the old system and those with expenses above that level could be put on PAYE. That would provide clarity and allow the Revenue to get those clubs that they are obviously trying to target to sort out their own taxes. If the limit was set high enough it would provide protection for junior football and a long-term solution to stop what the Revenue obviously sees as junior clubs shirking their responsibilities. There would almost certainly be problems with that approach, but I am sure that my right hon. Friend the Minister and her many officials could be able to put their minds together and come up with something suitable.</p>
	<p pid="d.13.3/4">In 1997, our newly elected Labour Government published a pre-Budget report that emphasised the need for a tax system that is not only fair to current and future generations, but is seen to be fair. I am sure that we all stand by that. It is obvious from the evidence that treating junior football clubs as employers is technically legal, but will never be seen to be fair. It is not fair to the communities in which the clubs operate, it is not fair to the people who give their time free of charge to provide a service to the community and it is not fair to the many people who enjoy junior football in Scotland. I urge the Minister to reflect on that when she responds.</p>

	<p pid="d.17.0/1">Mr. Chope, it is a pleasure to see you in the Chair. I shall also be brief, because much of the ground has already been covered. I shall begin by congratulating <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1977" name="Anne Moffat">the hon. Member for East Lothian (Anne Moffat)</phrase> on securing the debate. She has been involved with early day motion 2178, as has her hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1974" name="James McGovern">the Member for Dundee, West (Mr. McGovern)</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="d.17.0/2">I am far from an expert on the world of junior football clubs in Scotland, and I suspect that the opportunities for me to enlarge my knowledge will be limited, but from what the hon. Lady and hon. Gentlemen said, one point came over loud and clear to me and, I am sure, to the House: the great social and cultural importance to the whole community of the clubs whose financial livelihoods seem to her and her colleagues to be under threat from the change that has been made. Football is not just a common language. The hon. Lady mentioned the World cup, and I was very amused by the banter between some Government Back Benchers who seem more inclined to support Rangers, and others who might be more inclined to support Celtic. Even though my knowledge of football in Scotland is limited, it is extensive enough to clock that. More seriously, football is not just a common language, but a neutral space&mdash;an odd way of putting it, but accurate&mdash;in which, as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1427" name="David Anderson">the hon. Member for Blaydon (Mr. Anderson)</phrase> said, people from different backgrounds and cultures who might not mix in other circumstances can come together. That is why, as he said, the police are so often interested in building up community football, and why a threat to the financial future of such clubs is so serious.</p>
	<p pid="d.17.0/3">If I understand the situation correctly, players in junior clubs were minding their own tax affairs and the clubs were muddling along happily, building up a community, building up football and playing a role in their communities&mdash;and then the change occurred. Like other hon. Members, I am not clear on why the Inland Revenue made the change, whether a local department made it, or the degree to which the decision had national backing. I would be grateful to the Paymaster General if she cleared that up; I am sure that she will.</p>
	<p pid="d.17.0/4">The change will have a knock-on effect, because clubs will, in effect, become employers. Government Back Benchers brought up many examples of what that might mean in practice. I think that it was the hon. Member for East Lothian who said that clubs might have to pay the minimum wage. It is the first time that I have ever heard a Labour Back Bencher express any reservations about paying the minimum wage, but in those circumstances I can understand why she is concerned. Other examples followed, including whether shin pads will be taxed. One enters such territory if one changes the nature of taxation.</p>
	<p pid="d.17.0/5">As Labour Members said&mdash;I did not get the details, but I understand the general picture&mdash;the people who make such clubs work are not professionals but essentially amateurs. They love what they do, and they support the club because it is a community endeavour. Now, they will have to deal with extremely complicated tax arrangements that will stretch their expertise. That will clearly be a problem for the clubs.</p>
	<p pid="d.17.0/6">As well as asking the Paymaster General to give us a few more details of how the change arose, I should like her to comment on the element of retrospection and back payment, which, on the face of it, seems a bit questionable. I would also be grateful if she explained the wider implications&mdash;if there are any&mdash;of the change for other clubs and societies, including those involved in sport. She may have to finish off this point at the meeting that she will attend with her colleagues, but what can she do to find a way forward that will allow the clubs a bit of space, so that they can find a balance that allows them to pay the tax that they should pay without imperilling their financial future? We look forward to hearing what the right hon. Lady has to say.</p>

	<p pid="d.18.0/1">I, too, congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1977" name="Anne Moffat">the Member for East Lothian (Anne Moffat)</phrase> on securing the debate. A lot of important issues have been raised and I welcome the opportunity to discuss them.</p>
	<p pid="d.18.0/2">Reinforced by other speakers, my hon. Friend spoke about nurturing talent and helping young people, although I think that we are all clear that &quot;junior clubs&quot; refers to the leagues in which they are involved, not to the age of the players. I absolutely agree with her on the importance in local communities of clubs, whether football clubs or any other kind. I understand only too clearly from my own constituency experience how important those amateur arrangements are, so I have been genuinely perplexed&mdash;both by correspondence that I have received and, at times, by the debate today&mdash;about the precise nature of the problem that is that is being identified. However, I shall try to deal with the points made.</p>
	<p pid="d.18.0/3">At the outset, I want to make it clear that Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs is not proposing any change to the long-standing informal arrangements operated by smaller community clubs. I am not sure that I can put it any more clearly than that. I was asked what goes on in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. We are seeking the same treatment in Scotland as in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. Whether I happen to represent an English constituency is irrelevant; I know that my hon. Friend the Member for East Lothian and other hon. Friends feel as strongly as I do that what is important is nurturing talent anywhere in the United Kingdom.</p>
	<p pid="d.18.0/4">When football clubs of whatever status in England, Wales and Northern Ireland make payments that represent profit to players over 16, they are obliged to operate pay-as-you-earn. As is the case for any employer, when HMRC discovers that a club should be operating PAYE, it requires it to do so. That is what we are discussing today. We are talking about a minority of clubs where quite significant sums of money can be involved.</p>

A team could go from the informal arrangement to employer status in one season.

	<p pid="d.30.3/1">I began this debate by saying that I would try to bring a thoughtful spirit of inquiry to the Chamber, and I hope that we shall retain that.</p>
	<p pid="d.30.3/2">When people talk about grammar schools, emotions quite often take over and the debate starts to generate more heat than light. I am not opposed to the extension of grammar schools, of which there are about 167 in the country, but I am much more interested in having a debate about education that would improve the quality of life of all our children in all schools in the country. We need a debate far wider than an exclusive discussion of grammar schools. By all means, we can debate those schools, but I deliberately phrased the title of the debate so that it focused on the interests of the many, not the few.</p>
	<p pid="d.30.3/3">It is important that any policy should be assessed according to the impact that it might have on the most vulnerable. I feel that strongly, given my experience with children with special educational needs in my constituency. If we are to give schools greater independence and parents effective power, we need to ask ourselves about the impact that that might have on the more vulnerable in our education system.</p>
	<p pid="d.30.3/4">For me, the key critical test, first and foremost, is whether such children would be better off. We could come up with a system that ensured that. Too often, the statementing process to which those with special educational needs are subjected has put vulnerable individuals at the mercy of education experts. Such children have been more dependent on remote experts and, on occasion, have suffered as a result.</p>
	<p pid="d.30.3/5">The immoral policy of enforced inclusion and the immoral closure of specialist schools, such as the Leas school in Clacton in my constituency, which help those with special educational needs, are further manifestations of what happens when schools, parents and pupils surrender their independence to experts happy to dictate what they believe is right for other people's children.</p>
	<p pid="d.30.3/6">By reforming the statementing process, we could ensure that greater independence meant that children with special educational needs were better off. Such children's statements should not only be specific in spelling out what is necessary to help them, but include a form of financial entitlement that indicates the LEA money to which the child is entitled to have their needs met. If we introduced such a system and made schools more independent, we could show that, demonstrably, the more vulnerable children in our education system benefited the most.</p>
	<p pid="d.30.3/7">I shall wrap up my remarks and open the Floor to debate by drawing a few conclusions. There will be those who are opposed to ideas about parent power and setting schools free. Those who oppose greater independence for parents and schools are, in essence, stuck in a regressive 1950s mindset. It is progressive to give parents greater choice and to set schools free. The days of deference to remote experts are rightly over. We who argue for school independence and parental choice are the real progressives now. We need a system of education that offers genuine pluralism that cannot be dictated from the centre, and with pluralism and choice will come genuine innovation.</p>
	<p pid="d.30.3/8">To conclude, the only people in this room who are experts on what is right for children are those of us who are parents and who have the expertise to decide what is right for our child. The days of national politicians dictating what sort of education every child should receive should be over.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-06-06d.35.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1591" speakername="Edward Leigh" colnum="35"  time="011:21:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060606/halltext/60606h0132.htm#06060647000676">
	<p pid="d.35.1/1">I agree completely. Great&mdash;let us try that, but we have to be realistic about our abilities, especially when we are dealing with the educational establishment that we have.</p>
	<p pid="d.35.1/2">The opinion of one professor of education writing recently, which Chris Woodhead mentioned in a speech, is that</p>
	<p pid="d.35.1/3" class="indent">&quot;The great challenge for education in the 21st century is...the discovery of a holistic, problematised pedagogy&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="d.35.1/4">Does that mean anything to you, Mr. Chope? It means nothing to me. Then there is the commissioner for London schools&mdash;an official person, presumably&mdash;who said recently:</p>
	<p pid="d.35.1/5" class="indent">&quot;In the light of research into the brain and theories of learning, teachers' questioning techniques will have moved (by 2050) beyond traditional methods.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="d.35.1/6">That is what we are dealing with, and what my hon. Friend will be dealing with as a Minister.</p>
	<p pid="d.35.1/7">We will go on debating the issue, but let us not get any more bogged down. I must not speak for too long, because others might want to get in. However, my hon. Friend has raised an interesting debate that need not necessarily be the preserve of members of the Conservative party. I have great hopes for the hon. Member for Taunton, whose early intervention convinced me that there are people in the Liberal party who also believe in localism and local determination&mdash;I hope that there are such people in the Labour party, too.</p>
	<p pid="d.35.1/8">Such people might follow us in supporting the concept of schools being given increasing powers over their budgets if, for instance, there was a shortage of maths or language teachers. Indeed, there is a great crisis in languages in state schools, as well as in mathematics and science teaching, and it is independent schools that are saving sciences and languages in universities. That is something that the Government should be worried about. I hope that all hon. Members here would agree that schools should be given more independence over their budgets, if that is what they wish.</p>
	<p pid="d.35.1/9">The great divide is of course over selection. My hon. Friend the Member for Harwich was again right to say that we should not get bogged down in the debate about grammar schools. That debate has gone&mdash;it is finished, it is in the past. A Conservative Government would not need to say that we will introduce a grammar school in every town. That was one line in the 1997 manifesto. It is not going to return and the debate is in the past. All we need to do is give head teachers and their governing bodies increasing powers over admissions.</p>
	<p pid="d.35.1/10">It was said earlier that the only result of doing that would be that schools would choose pupils, and that pupils and parents would not be able to choose schools. It is claimed that if we give head teachers greater power over admissions, large numbers of schools will suddenly become ultra-selective and turn people away, and there will be no decent schools for kids. Indeed, I am not sure that my children could have got into grammar schools, although I am not for or against those schools&mdash;that is irrelevant.</p>
	<p pid="d.35.1/11">For the sake of argument, does the Minister or anybody else think that if we gave head teachers increasing independence, there would be a revolution in our schools? Teachers are actually quite conservative in how they run their schools. Those running a pure comprehensive school are allowed to test anyway, to create a pure comprehensive system, in which there are three bands, of the most able, the middle and the less able. If comprehensive schools were given the freedom to select who they wanted, some might become more academic, some might remain comprehensive and some might admit more pupils of less academic ability. We do not know.</p>
	<p pid="d.35.1/12">There are schools in the independent sector that cater for all abilities. There are Winchesters and the Etons, which are highly academic and highly selective, but there are also many independent schools that cater for middle and lower ability ranges. I therefore urge hon. Members to forget the party political polemic about grammar schools and to think about giving more freedom and responsibility to head teachers to run their own schools in their own way. Let us imagine that we did that and allowed schools to run their own budgets&mdash;we allowed, in effect, all schools to become grant maintained. The problem with the creation of grant-maintained schools was that only some schools became grant maintained, so there was a dispute about whether those schools were receiving preferential capital funding. Let us imagine that all schools had the freedoms of grant-maintained schools in respect of hiring and firing, selecting and deselecting, their budgets and paying French teachers and others. I do not believe that there would be a revolution in those schools, but I do believe that there would be a revolution in terms of choice and freedom, and that that would be extraordinarily beneficial to our system.</p>

	<p pid="d.36.0/1">Is the hon. Gentleman really saying that if there was a free-for-all on admissions, some schools would voluntarily select pupils who were less academically able and who came from more challenging backgrounds, such as children with special educational needs and looked-after children? Is he really saying that he believes such pupils would be catered for without some protection from an admissions code and without the local authority having a role to play in admissions?</p>

	<p pid="d.37.0/1">If we gave schools greater choice, certain schools that are currently barred from taking on children with special educational needs would do so. Market Field school, just outside my constituency, is trying to expand, but is in effect prevented from doing so by educational experts. If we adopted the scheme that my hon. Friend and I are advocating, a school such as Market Field would expand and welcome children with special educational needs&mdash;children that other mainstream schools may find it more difficult to cater for. More children would have their needs catered for than under the current system.</p>

	<p pid="d.38.1/1">I am delighted to answer that question, because I have thought about the issue a lot. I have been arguing for this proposal for many years, and my colleagues on various Treasury teams have said, &quot;Oh, it's a wonderful idea, Edward, but of course we can't do a dead-weight cost.&quot; My idea is that we would do it incrementally. If there was an incoming Conservative Government, we would say that we would provide a voucher, a credit, a right to opt out in the first year of the new Act operating. The first year to which it would apply would be year R, the next year would be year R plus year 1 and the next year would be year R plus year 1 plus year 2. The scheme would roll out over 14 years. Therefore, I am not arguing for myself, because by the time that happened, all my children would have left school. I fear that you, Mr. Chope, would be in the same sad position. We would not benefit from the proposal.</p>

	<p pid="d.39.1/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1621" name="Douglas Carswell">the hon. Member for Harwich (Mr. Carswell)</phrase> on securing the debate. I shall comment on a few of the issues raised. I was somewhat surprised at how little reference there was to the debate that we have been having over the past few months on the Education and Inspections Bill, which I believe strikes the right balance between moving away from a very centralised, local education authority-controlled education system towards more independence for schools. However, some ideas flagged up today by Conservative Members go too far down that route.</p>
	<p pid="d.39.1/2">On admissions, when I intervened earlier the focus of the debate was very much on pupils with special educational needs, to whom it was said a price tag is attached which acts as an incentive to take in such children. I was looking at the matter in a broader context, in relation to pupils who might be termed less desirable from the point of view of a head teacher who wants the school to do well in the league tables. In my constituency, for example, there are pupils from refugee backgrounds who have English as their second language, and whose parents, often, are illiterate, so that they do not receive support at home. What would happen to them?</p>
	<p pid="d.39.1/3">I welcome the move to give more power to head teachers and parents. I think that, often, those at the chalk face in the teaching profession know what is best for children. Parents, too, obviously know what is best for them, but that does not necessarily apply across the board. A great many parents, because of their educational background or social circumstances, do not have all that great a role in their children's education at present. I welcome the moves in the Education and Inspections Bill to give the local authority the role of parents' champion and of supporting parents in exercising a greater say in their children's education. However, there will always be some children whose parents are not the best people to make those choices for them. There must be a mechanism to enable other people to supervise the child's education and make the right choices.</p>
	<p pid="d.39.1/4">The hon. Member for Harwich frequently used the term &quot;expert&quot; pejoratively, which is quite demeaning to people who work in the education profession. I recently met, in my constituency, a group of educationists who work with children who have special educational needs, and they are devoted to making sure that children in the city of Bristol get the best education. To dismiss their contribution and the expertise that they have built up by working with children, parents and teachers over the years is going too far. The hon. Gentleman also talked about local education authorities all in the same breath, as though all were equally bad. There are local education authorities that do an incredibly good job of ensuring that schools perform well and give pupils the best deal.</p>
	<p pid="d.39.1/5">That leads me to my main points. I am in the unfortunate position, I suppose, of representing the place that has the worst-performing local education authority in the country as far as state secondary schools are concerned. It is now adrift at the bottom of the league tables by about 5 per cent. As the Secretary of State would tell hon. Members, even Hull is performing better than Bristol these days. We accept that we have a serious problem. It is not a recent development. Over many years the local authority has failed to tackle the problem of underperformance in Bristol's state schools. We have schools where not even one in five pupils achieve five good GCSEs. In two schools serving my constituency, with a very diverse intake of pupils, not one African-Caribbean child achieved five good GCSEs last year.</p>
	<p pid="d.39.1/6">People admit that the state school system in Bristol is failing pupils. As a result there has been a mass exodus from Bristol schools, either into the private sector or out to schools in Gloucestershire and Somerset. It is estimated that about 50 per cent. of parents choose to abandon Bristol's state secondary schools as a result of that poor performance. I accept that the local authority has not got to grips with that, and although there has been some incremental improvement and the school results were up last year by a tiny percentage, unless there is change on a radical scale we shall fail another generation of children.</p>
	<p pid="d.39.1/7">That is why I welcome some of the proposals in the Education and Inspections Bill to give schools more independence. I have in my constituency a school that is a shining example of what happens when schools are given more independence. It is one of the first city academies. Before what was called the St. George school became an academy it was one of the most unpopular with parents and one of the most under-subscribed schools in Bristol. Parents went to great lengths to avoid sending their children there. It serves a deprived area and parents in the locality do not have high incomes, but they would still scrape together the money to send their children to private schools or bus them out of the county, because they did not want to send their kids to St. George. The pupils were disaffected and the exam results were dismal.</p>
	<p pid="d.39.1/8">When St. George became a city academy and got the independence&mdash;and, admittedly, the capital injection that went with that&mdash;things turned around dramatically. In the past year, 51 per cent. of pupils gained five or more good GCSEs. That was a 19 per cent. increase on the previous year. There are some schools where not even 19 per cent. get five GCSEs in the first place; it is a fantastic increase. The academy is now the most improved school in Bristol and one of the best performing academies in the country.</p>
	<p pid="d.39.1/9">That success is all the more remarkable in the light of the intake of pupils at the academy, 35 per cent. of whom have free school meals. That compares to a national average of about 10.5 per cent. and a Bristol-wide average of less than 10 per cent.&mdash;about 9.3 per cent. Sixty per cent. of the pupils in the academy come from visible ethnic minorities and 31 languages are spoken there. Many pupils come from refugee families and live under the constant threat of deportation or have endured traumatic situations to get to the school. Often they start at the school with a limited grasp of English, but leave with a very good education. They have a real pride in their school.</p>
	<p pid="d.39.1/10">I do not say that all that has been achieved at the academy is due to independence, but whenever I have visited the school it has been clear that the head teacher can mould what happens there to the needs of the people who attend it. For example, he is working with the Institute for Fiscal Studies on piloting a financial capability study, which teaches children the basic facts about handling money&mdash;finance&mdash;and how to run their finances in future life. From speaking to IFS representatives I know that those children go home and teach their parents how to do the same. The school is in an area with a significant financial exclusion problem, but it is also in a city that is fast becoming one of the biggest financial services centres in the country, and the curriculum is being tailored both to deal with problems that pupils and their families might experience in the wider world, and to give them a leg up into the job market. They will get a diploma, on completing the course, equivalent to a GCSE.</p>

	<p pid="d.42.2/1">I welcome you to the Chair, Mr. Pope. It might surprise some hon. Members to hear that I was the keynote speaker at the Independent Schools Bursars Association conference about three weeks ago. It was an enjoyable event, and I was pleased to receive the invitation. I met a lot of independent schools' bursars and got an invitation to visit Eton, which I might take up once I have visited all the schools in my constituency.</p>
	<p pid="d.42.2/2">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1621" name="Douglas Carswell">the hon. Member for Harwich (Mr. Carswell)</phrase> on securing the debate, which is very timely, given the stage that we have reached in the education debate nationally. In the spirit of our proceedings, let me start by agreeing with him on various points. The Liberal Democrats certainly agree that there are problems and that far too many schools are failing or coasting. We wholeheartedly agree that we need to encourage innovation and local leadership, free from central Government diktat, which still casts a shadow over the education system.</p>
	<p pid="d.42.2/3">We also agree that we have an over-prescriptive centralised national curriculum, with far too much nationally imposed testing. Furthermore, I agree with <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1591" name="Edward Leigh">the hon. Member for Gainsborough (Mr. Leigh)</phrase> that the dogmatic obsession with the question whether public or private is best is damaging, and there is clearly a role for the public, private and voluntary sectors in our public services.</p>
	<p pid="d.42.2/4">I would probably also agree with the hon. Member for Harwich and the Conservative party that the trust schools proposed in the Education and Inspections Bill will not deliver the vision that he outlined. Indeed, they have become something of a fudge&mdash;they are neither one thing nor the other. So, despite the Conservative party's support for the Bill, I am sure he would acknowledge that it will not implement what he advocates.</p>
	<p pid="d.42.2/5">That Bill is certainly a long way from the original vision outlined by the Prime Minister, who said that he wanted all schools to become trust schools. I fundamentally disagree with that approach, which is a strange and over-prescriptive way of running our education system. It reminds me of Henry Ford, because it is a bit like saying, &quot;You can choose any school you want as long as it's a trust school.&quot; That is not parental choice, which is the one thing we all agree that we want, although we have different ways of achieving it.</p>
	<p pid="d.42.2/6">I shall follow the development of Conservative party education policy with interest, because having supported the Bill, Conservative Members are likely to be quite critical of trust schools when they do little to improve standards over the coming years. However, we shall wait and see.</p>
	<p pid="d.42.2/7">As regards the Liberal Democrat vision, we agree with more freedom, localism and choice&mdash;those the buzz words that we all use, although we have different ways of implementing our policies. However, the one freedom that schools need above all is the one that the Bill does not give them&mdash;the freedom to teach what they want. We made that clear throughout proceedings on the Bill, although we shall not, of course, go through those debates again.</p>
	<p pid="d.42.2/8">The one freedom that the Bill gives schools with which we disagree is the freedom to pick pupils. A Headspace survey of head teachers showed that 38 per cent. admitted breaking their own admissions code. I accept that my party has a different vision of education, but our concern is that giving schools more independence will allow them to pick their own pupils.</p>
	<p pid="d.42.2/9">My party does not agree with that approach, although other hon. Members might, and that is a perfectly reasonable perspective. However, the evidence is that such things are happening, and they will become more likely to happen the more we go down the route of having independent schools. That will be to the detriment of the pupils whom our education system currently fails most.</p>
	<p pid="d.42.2/10">My hon. Friends and I are also concerned about accountability, which is another reason why we do not want to go down the route of introducing further independence for schools. The hon. Member for Gainsborough mentioned localism, and it is extraordinary that, in trust schools and particularly academies, private companies will now have power over elected parent governors, never mind head teachers and elected local education authorities. That is a strange vision of localism and accountability.</p>
	<p pid="d.42.2/11">There is a danger in saying that independence is the solution to the problems in our schools, in the same way that we said that comprehensive education was the one-size-fits-all solution. We have had a healthy debate, and it has been interesting and valuable to take part because none of those who have contributed have fallen into the trap of talking about party political positions, but we must be aware of the danger of saying that independence in itself, or a comprehensive education in itself, is the key to unlocking the door and will give us wonderful schools everywhere.</p>
	<p pid="d.42.2/12">Let me also sound a brief note of caution. I understand the vision outlined by the hon. Member for Harwich, but we must listen to schools. Throughout proceedings on the Education and Inspections Bill, there was lots of talk about how we must empower schools, but are we listening to schools in the first place? In January, a Guardian/ICM poll of 805 head teachers and assistant head teachers showed that only 29 per cent. backed plans to free schools from direct local education authority control, but I suspect that such things are not taken into account in those debates or when we discuss measures such as those in the Bill.</p>
	<p pid="d.42.2/13">Indeed, in <i>The Independent</i> in April, Mick Brookes, the general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, said that trust schools are</p>
	<p pid="d.42.2/14" class="indent">&quot;all smoke and mirrors. We already have freedom as heads. You don't have to buy into local authority services if you don't want to.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="d.42.2/15">Again, are we falling into the trap of political dogma?</p>
	<p pid="d.42.2/16">To conclude, there is little concrete evidence that self-governing independent status for state schools drives up standards, and driving up standards is the one thing to which we are all absolutely committed. The Minister could mention other examples, but in the case of academies, there is extra funding and various other things. As we know, academies have a mixed record, so independence in itself does not deliver&mdash; <i>[Interruption.]</i> The Minister is welcome to intervene.</p>

	<p pid="d.45.0/1">It is a pleasure to follow <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1672" name="Greg Mulholland">the hon. Member for Leeds, North-West (Greg Mulholland)</phrase>, and I agree that we must not concentrate too much on structures. There is a range of issues that we need to address to raise standards, which we should now focus on in our debates.</p>
	<p pid="d.45.0/2">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1621" name="Douglas Carswell">the Member for Harwich (Mr. Carswell)</phrase> on securing the debate. He made an interesting and thoughtful speech, but we have come to expect that during his first year as a Member of the House.</p>
	<p pid="d.45.0/3">The desire to increase independence for state schools is shared in all parts of the House, or at least on the Government and official Opposition Benches. That commitment was demonstrated by the overwhelming support that the Education and Inspections Bill received on Second and Third Reading. We supported the Bill because it makes it easier for schools to adopt foundation status and become trust schools. That reflects the increasing body of evidence, which my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1591" name="Edward Leigh">the Member for Gainsborough (Mr. Leigh)</phrase> mentioned, from Sweden and the United States, and indeed from this country's grant-maintained schools programme, that increasing diversity, independence and choice has powerful effects in raising school standards.</p>
	<p pid="d.45.0/4">The Prime Minister is committed to independence. He recently said:</p>
	<p pid="d.45.0/5" class="indent">&quot;The logic of changing to the specialist schools, of starting City Academies, of giving greater freedom to schools in who they hire, what they pay, how they run their school day, is very clear. It is to escape the straitjacket of the traditional comprehensive school and embrace the idea of genuinely independent non-fee paying state schools.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="d.45.0/6">A key part of the Prime Minister's solution to this problem lies in granting schools additional freedoms. In October, he said:</p>
	<p pid="d.45.0/7" class="indent">&quot;By the end of this third term, I want every school that wants to be to be able to be an independent, non fee-paying state school with the freedom to innovate and develop in the way it wants and the way the parents at the school want&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="d.45.0/8">That commitment to giving greater autonomy was a dominant feature of the recent education White Paper, in which the Prime Minister said:</p>
	<p pid="d.45.0/9" class="indent">&quot;Our reforms must build on the freedoms that schools have increasingly received, but extend them&quot;</p>
	<p pid="d.45.0/10">rapidly.</p>
	<p pid="d.45.0/11">Independence and innovation can play a vital role in raising the quality of education. That is why, in 2004-05, only 38 per cent. of pupils at community schools achieved five or more GCSEs at grades A* to C, including English and maths, but in city technology colleges, which have independence, 66 per cent. of pupils achieved five or more good GCSEs, including English and maths. A quarter of pupils at community schools leave with no GCSEs at all, but in the CTC sector that figure is only 3.6 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="d.45.0/12">Thomas Telford school, which I mentioned on many occasions during our debates on the Education and Inspections Bill, has a national ability range or intake, and 11 per cent. of pupils take free school meals, but 100 per cent. of pupils achieved not five or more, but 12 or more, good GCSEs or equivalent.</p>
	<p pid="d.45.0/13">Of course, the results for academies seem slightly less promising, although, in an excellent speech, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1455" name="Kerry McCarthy">the hon. Member for Bristol, East (Kerry McCarthy)</phrase> pointed out that her academy is achieving results of about 51 per cent. of pupils getting five or more GCSEs, which is a 19 per cent. increase on last year. Those are promising results. It would be interesting to visit that school at some point.</p>
	<p pid="d.45.0/14">Many academies still achieve quite poor results, but if we compare them to those of their predecessor schools, there are still clear signs of improvement. Results show that by 2005 the proportion of students gaining five or more good GCSEs had risen from 21 per cent. in the predecessor schools to 36.4 per cent. in the academies. There is an interesting comment in the PricewaterhouseCoopers report:</p>
	<p pid="d.45.0/15" class="indent">&quot;A very clear and significant finding from the early research is that there does seem to be a significant difference in the learning culture in new Academies, compared to their predecessors. For example, 8 out of 10 pupils in the survey said that 'the teachers at this Academy really believe that all pupils can achieve', and similar numbers of staff surveyed said 'staff at this Academy believe that all pupils can achieve regardless of their social background'.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="d.45.0/16">Some academies have failed principally because they appointed the wrong head teachers to run them. At Unity City academy in Middlesbrough, only 12 of the 200 pupils taking GCSEs achieved grade C in maths and English compared with 17 pupils at the two predecessor schools. An article in <i>The Sunday Times</i> in March said:</p>
	<p pid="d.45.0/17" class="indent">&quot;When Unity opened in 2002 the new head...promised a revolution in learning that would 'discard the Victorian-style chalk and talk' and put in place 'learning sessions' taken by 'learning facilitators'.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="d.45.0/18">That reflects many of the points that my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough made about some of the vogue methods of teaching that take place in some schools. The article continued:</p>
	<p pid="d.45.0/19" class="indent">&quot;Old-style history and science were to be replaced by 'concepts' taught as topics, and teachers were told to adjust their styles to cater for whether children were 'kinesthetic, visual or auditory' learners.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="d.45.0/20">Since then, the Unity academy has been identified as a failing school by Ofsted, with debts of &pound;1.5 million. Of course, the head teacher was got rid of, and the school is showing signs of improvement. In that case and in other examples, the governing bodies and proprietors of schools took decisive and swift action, replacing the heads and ensuring that standards were safeguarded.</p>
	<p pid="d.45.0/21">I want to raise two quick points with the Minister, the first of which concerns the importance of provisions on freedoms, which are already on the statute book. The hon. Member for Leeds, North-West made the point that a lot of the freedoms for the new trust schools are illusory and that the real freedoms are in previous legislation, such as, to quote the Secretary of State, the</p>
	<p pid="d.45.0/22" class="indent">&quot;tortuous process under the power to innovate&quot;&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2006-05-24.1590"><i>Official Report</i>, 24 May 2006; Vol. 446, c. 1590</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="d.45.0/23">available under chapter 1 of part 1 of the Education Act 2002. Only a tiny number of schools have taken advantage of that freedom because of the tortuous route to acquiring it. In fact, only 178 out of 26,000 have made use of it.</p>
	<p pid="d.45.0/24">It is also disappointing that the Government have not yet implemented chapter 2 of part 1 of the 2002 Act on earned autonomy. That was a major element of the previous education White Paper, which said:</p>
	<p pid="d.45.0/25" class="indent">&quot;Where schools are successful, well-led and have a record of school improvement, we want to free them from those conditions and regulatory requirements which they tell us stand in the way of yet higher standards and further innovation.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="d.45.0/26">It went on:</p>
	<p pid="d.45.0/27" class="indent">&quot;We will allow schools flexibility over some elements of teachers' pay and conditions, for example to provide even greater recruitment and retention incentives&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="d.45.0/28">Those reforms were central to the 2002 Act.</p>
	<p pid="d.45.0/29">The then Secretary of State, now Lady Morris, said:</p>
	<p pid="d.45.0/30" class="indent">&quot;We want to give the best schools even greater freedoms.&quot;&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2001-12-04.196"><i>Official Report</i>, 4 December 2001; Vol. 376, c. 196</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="d.45.0/31">Despite her words, those provisions have not yet been implemented. The Department for Education and Skills website said that a consultation document on earned autonomy was due to be published on <phrase class="date" code="2002-09-30">30 September 2002</phrase>, but that that did not take place due to &quot;operational pressures&quot;. The issue has become a saga that has run for over four years.</p>
	<p pid="d.45.0/32">I recently asked the previous Minister, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1776" name="Jacqui Smith">the right hon. Member for Redditch (Jacqui Smith)</phrase>, what was happening with the new provisions and when they were going to be brought into force, to which she replied:</p>
	<p pid="d.45.0/33">&quot;We are keeping the provisions of Chapter 2 of the Education Act 2002, conferring exemptions related to school performance, under review.&quot;&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2006-03-28.889"><i>Official Report</i>, 28 March 2006; Vol. 444, c. 889W</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="d.45.0/34">As the hon. Member for Leeds, North-West said, giving schools more autonomy and freedom over their day-to-day running is not the whole story when it comes to raising standards. Issues such as the curriculum, discipline in schools and ending mixed ability teaching in comprehensives are all hugely important. However, when the right head teacher is appointed, autonomy has a major effect in raising standards.</p>
	<p pid="d.45.0/35">Conservative Members hope that many schools will use the provisions in the latest education Bill to become trust schools in the years ahead. If the Government are committed to autonomy, it would be helpful if they implemented the earned autonomy provisions in the 2002 Act and made it easier for schools to use the other elements of freedom that are contained in it.</p>

	<p pid="d.51.1/1">The world's attention is focused on Iran's nuclear ambitions and the danger that that undoubtedly poses for the region. However, there is a long-running cause of concern that should not be allowed to escape the spotlight: Iran's abysmal record on human rights. Iran's abuse of human rights has been condemned by the United Nations, the European Union, Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International. In this short debate, I shall focus on limited areas of persecution, but it is important to appreciate the context in which the abuses that I shall detail take place.</p>
	<p pid="d.51.1/2">The systematic suppression of dissent in Iran permeates the whole of Iranian society. The abuses are not random. They are organised by the Government or by what Iranians call parallel institutions, such as the intelligence service and paramilitary groups. President Ahmadinejad's Cabinet is dominated by former members of the intelligence and security services, some of whom are allegedly implicated in serious violations, including the assassination of dissident intellectuals.</p>
	<p pid="d.51.1/3">Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International have condemned the deterioration of freedom of expression and the routine use of arbitrary arrest, torture and solitary confinement. Tehran's public prosecutor, Saeed Mortzavi, has been implicated in major violations, including the unresolved death in custody of the Iranian-Canadian photo-journalist Zahra Kazemi in June 2003, yet no proper investigation has taken place.</p>
	<p pid="d.51.1/4">Executions, including those of juveniles, continue after highly questionable judicial processes. Amnesty International reports that in the past year at least 94 people have been executed, including at least eight who were under 18.</p>
	<p pid="d.51.1/5">At the end of May 2006, 500 armed riot police stormed into Tehran university campus following a student protest after a purge of the university's academic faculty. Live bullets were fired, people were injured and arrests were made. At the end of May, no further information was available about the fate of the arrested students.</p>
	<p pid="d.51.1/6">A systematic purge of the media in 2000 closed newspapers and imprisoned journalists. In 2005, the Iranian Government turned their attention to targeting websites and internet journalists. Those who were arrested were sent to secret detention centres. In February 2005, a court in the province of Gilan sentenced Arash Sigarchi to 14 years imprisonment for online writing.</p>
	<p pid="d.51.1/7">Those attacks on the media send out a clear message. The result is that where the media is not shut down, there is self-censorship. Both Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International report that independent harassment of human rights organisations and lawyers continues. Prominent activists such as the Nobel peace prize winner, Shirin Ebadi, was held in jail in January 2005 and released only after an international outcry. Akbar Ganj, the investigative journalist who exposed the role of high-ranking officials in the murder of writers and intellectuals in 1998, remains in prison. Political executions take place, and in May concern was expressed about the imminent execution of Valiolla Feyz Mahdavi, a 28-year-old member of Iran's main opposition party.</p>
	<p pid="d.51.1/8">That systematic oppression has had profound consequences. It has resulted in what Human Rights Watch calls</p>
	<p pid="d.51.1/9" class="indent">&quot;an atmosphere of impunity in which oppression thrives&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="d.51.1/10">It means that people are silenced because they fear speaking out and there are fewer voices to speak out about what is wrong, so abuses are not fully documented. It is against that background that I draw attention to particular concern about two minority communities in Iran.</p>
	<p pid="d.51.1/11">The Iranian Baha'i community numbers 300,000, but Baha'is also live in other countries and, indeed, there are some in my constituency. The Baha'is in Iran have long been persecuted.</p>

	<p pid="d.54.2/1">Thank you, Mr. Pope, for that helpful suggestion.</p>
	<p pid="d.54.2/2">I begin by congratulating my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1688" name="Louise Ellman">the Member for Liverpool, Riverside (Mrs. Ellman)</phrase> on securing a debate on a subject that is of real concern to the United Kingdom Government and, indeed, to this House.</p>
	<p pid="d.54.2/3">Efforts to improve respect for human rights have long been a central element of the United Kingdom's and, indeed, the European Union's approach to Iran. The current situation in Iran seems to be deteriorating and lacking in transparency&mdash;from the situation of religious minorities to the conduct of trials and sentencing. The situation is well reported by non-governmental organisations such as Amnesty International, and in its latest report Amnesty highlighted the growing difficulties faced by ethnic and religious minorities, harassment of human rights defenders, the erosion of free expression and the serious concerns about Iran's use of the death penalty.</p>
	<p pid="d.54.2/4">We have frequently set out those concerns bilaterally and through the relevant international human rights mechanisms. As my hon. Friend mentioned, that includes our concern about the position that the Iranian Government have taken towards Israel. President Ahmadinejad call for Israel to be wiped from the map and his attempts to cast doubt on the holocaust are outrageous and unacceptable.</p>
	<p pid="d.54.2/5">We have long-standing concerns about political freedoms in Iran. An unelected committee, the Guardian Council, comprised of jurists and clerics, was able to prevent all women and many reformists from standing in last year's presidential elections. Many reformist candidates, including a third of the sitting Members of Parliament, were similarly excluded from standing in the parliamentary elections in 2004.</p>
	<p pid="d.54.2/6">We are also very concerned about Iran's treatment of women. Although the situation for women is in some respects better than in certain other countries in the region&mdash;women can, for instance, vote and drive, and they make up more than half of the university population&mdash;they nevertheless face significant discrimination. For instance, the evidence of a woman continues to be worth less than that of a man in court, and women do not enjoy equal rights in cases involving divorce, inheritance or the custody of children.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-06-06d.64.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1686" speakername="Gillian Merron" colnum="64"  time="013:10:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060606/halltext/60606h0135.htm#06060647000726">
	<p pid="d.64.1/1">I appreciate the frustration expressed by the hon. Gentleman on behalf of his constituents. He rightly acknowledged, however, that previous Governments have failed to respond as he would have liked. I stress the need to take all factors properly into account before taking a decision.</p>
	<p pid="d.64.1/2">That leads me to the second point: funding and procurement. As is normal with all large transport schemes, we invited the three authorities to explore the possibility of private finance as a means of delivering and funding the SEMMMS road scheme. One of the principal advantages of private finance is that, for such large schemes, it can offer valuable efficiencies in the procurement and subsequent management of the assets over the life of the concession, which is normally 25 years. However, PFI is approved only when it represents better value for money than the alternative of conventional funding.</p>
	<p pid="d.64.1/3">The hon. Gentleman will be aware that the Government provide financial support for local authority PFI schemes through the system of PFI credits. The amount of the PFI credit broadly represents the amount of capital investment that the Government are supporting financially. The authorities' latest estimate of the PFI credit funding requirement for the SEMMMS road scheme is about &pound;860 million, which covers both construction and future capital maintenance. As I have already noted, we have asked the authorities to update their cost estimate, which makes it possible that the estimated PFI credit requirement will increase further.</p>
	<p pid="d.64.1/4">Even at &pound;860 million, that is a very large amount of funding. For example, it is more than the Department's total PFI budget for the current year for local authority transport PFI schemes in the whole of England. We must therefore consider the affordability of SEMMMS alongside our other priorities for PFI funding&mdash;including, for example, our programmes for street lighting and road maintenance, as well as other major investment schemes. We are still considering the provision of PFI funding for the scheme, which raises some complex issues, but it has to be recognised that delivering SEMMMS as a conventionally funded scheme would raise even more difficult questions on affordability.</p>
	<p pid="d.64.1/5">As I mentioned earlier, we provided each region last year with indicative funding allocations for major transport schemes over the next decade. In the north west, the funding allocation starts at &pound;115 million in 2006-07, rising to &pound;135 million in 2014-15. The north-west has an ambitious programme of transport improvements and, even without SEMMMS, it has faced some difficult choices in deciding which schemes to prioritise. It is clear that SEMMMS, at its current estimated cost of some &pound;550 million, would take up several years of the region's allocation if the scheme were to be funded conventionally. It seems doubtful that the region would be prepared to prioritise funding for the SEMMMS scheme by sacrificing a major part of its other scheme priorities.</p>

	<p pid="d.67.1/1">I am grateful to have the chance, yet again, to raise in this place what I believe is a vital and important matter. I am pleased to see the Minister in his place. He has returned from visiting our oldest veteran, who I believe is 110 years old. It was a great ministerial duty&mdash;and, I am sure, one of importance to the nation&mdash;to visit one of our oldest and most important citizens.</p>
	<p pid="d.67.1/2">Defence is a genuine interest of mine. I used to be an adviser at the Army Land Command headquarters. I maintain the rank of Major, and I am still on the reserve list of the Territorial Army. Most important of all, I represent a constituency with a proud history of providing our Army, Navy and Air Force with the real means to do the job&mdash;in other words, to put forward the Government's will anywhere in the world. In Bridgwater, we make bombs. We have done so efficiently, economically and successfully for more than 50 years&mdash;since 1939 in fact. Some of my constituents are the best legal bomb-makers in the business. They are true specialists and dedicated to their work. Unfortunately, next year there may be no work for them to do. Next year, the people who now own what we call the Royal Ordnance just outside Puriton intend to close it. Why? They reckon that they can buy what we need elsewhere in the world but a whole lot cheaper&mdash;and unfortunately they have convinced the Government&mdash;but they are absolutely wrong, and history proves them to be wrong.</p>
	<p pid="d.67.1/3">It is rather pithy that the debate should be on the anniversary of D-day. It was today, 62 years ago&mdash;unfortunately, the Minister and I were not there. Thank God for the Americans; we launched a joint operation from these islands to bring a final end to the bloodshed that we know as the second world war. Brave allied soldiers&mdash;British, American, Canadian, Australian and other allied forces&mdash;landed on the beaches of Normandy. It was the severest test of manpower and equipment. The symbolism of a successful invasion disguised the carnage; we have only to ask those soldiers who survived. Putting it in today's crude terms, there were far too many Private Ryans, far too many weapon systems that did not share the same ammunition, far too many home-grown disasters on that day. D-day was a victory, but it was also something of a miracle.</p>
	<p pid="d.67.1/4">Military success relies on courage, training and scrupulous attention to detail. That detail includes knowing exactly what your weapons are capable of doing&mdash;what they will do when the trigger is pulled. We can be completely sure only if we know exactly where the kit was made and by whom. When Hannibal set off across the Alps, he had not bought his elephants on eBay; he knew exactly where they came from and what they were capable of. Those elephants were tried, tested and reliable. In Queen Victoria's time, the dear old British Admiralty, which we all love, would insist that every issue and item of munitions on board all our fighting ships was made here, at home&mdash;hence the Royal Ordnance factories, which have existed since the days of Henry VIII.</p>
	<p pid="d.67.1/5">Even the glasses for the telescopes had to come from a specific British manufacturer with a reputation for excellence&mdash;no ifs or buts. That was not blind patriotism or protectionism, but simple common sense. I wish our neighbours and allies no disrespect whatever; I have trained and worked with most of them. However, British standards in military matters have rightly always been of the very highest; every other nation works hard to match them. There is a huge risk in buying bits and pieces&mdash;especially those deliberately designed to go bang&mdash;on the open arms market.</p>
	<p pid="d.67.1/6">I am afraid that under many Governments, Britain has acted stupidly in the past. Not long ago, the British Army took delivery from India of an enormous consignment of 9 mm ammunition. I have a horrible suspicion that it was bought as a special offer&mdash;probably two for the price of one. The ammunition jammed and misfired with such frightening regularity that it was taken out to sea and quietly dumped. Meanwhile, British officers and soldiers who attempted to fire certain 7.62 mm shells made in Portugal still refer to them as &quot;Lisbon crackers&quot;. Unfortunately, once again, the Ministry of Defence had to cut its losses; it fed the useless Portuguese munitions to the fish. Buying those munitions was neither sensible nor economic.</p>
	<p pid="d.67.1/7">We still have problems with shells. These days we get them from France, where &quot;quality control&quot; is a phrase for which there does not seem to be a direct translation. Even suppliers in Germany are suspect on quality. I hope that the Minister is taking note of what I say; I am delighted that he is here, although I accept that responsibility for defence procurement lies with another Minister. As the Minister can well imagine, much of the information comes from the experts who make the bombs in Bridgwater. Those people, who make up an old work force, have spent their lifetimes in the industry. They believe strongly in their country and in what they do, and still see themselves as employees of the Royal Ordnance factories.</p>
	<p pid="d.67.1/8">I shall provide an example of some slightly heavier artillery. The old Royal Ordnance factories won a contract to manufacture the RO18, a weapon still in service today. However, the MOD first insisted on buying a Belgian version, which went on test in Canada and proved so inaccurate that the safe area for our troops had to be increased tenfold. The Secretary of State at the time&mdash;not the present one&mdash;said that he knew all about it. He explained that the fault was common, but refused to stop the MOD buying cheap Belgian products. That was not acceptable. The only line of defence against the shoddy workmanship was the expertise of Royal Ordnance staff, who were then responsible for checking every item of stock that came in. One report eerily catalogued the landing of a consignment from a European arms factory:</p>
	<p pid="d.67.1/9" class="indent">&quot;When the first batch arrived the base plates simply fell off. We had to teach them how to weld them on!&quot;</p>
	<p pid="d.67.1/10">That ought to be the scary stuff of history. Unfortunately, however, I know that it still happens. The more we buy abroad in the mistaken belief that cheapest is best, the more we risk embarrassment, accident and, ultimately, potential military disaster.</p>
	<p pid="d.67.1/11">When loading big munitions, we need propellant, which we used to make here. However, now we buy it from Switzerland&mdash;a little nation more famous for its cuckoo clocks and chocolate. Swiss propellant still gives problems. We still import erratic naval shells from Australia. TNT from eastern Europe is of &quot;very dubious quality indeed&quot;. Those words are not mine, but from the report of someone who deals with TNT and works inside this close-knit and very loyal British industry. Why are we forced to import TNT, of all things, from eastern Europe? The British company that makes it over here reckons that it can make far more money by not making it here at all.</p>
	<p pid="d.67.1/12">The parliamentary advisers to BAE Systems should start taking note at this point. British Aerospace was proud enough to use the national name when it bought Royal Ordnance plc in 1986, not under this Government. However, then came the rebrand&mdash;everything in this country has to be rebranded. Out went the words &quot;British Aerospace&quot;; in came the abbreviation &quot;BAE&quot;. The company is now so busy getting rid of other essential British assets that I rather wonder why its title still includes the B for British at all. I do not believe that it is a British company any more. We should say goodbye to Airbus and to the Bridgwater bomb factory, too&mdash;it is all becoming a bit of a tragedy.</p>
	<p pid="d.67.1/13">Some 130 BAE Systems workers agree with me, as do, I like to think, many Members of this House. My illustrious predecessor, the former Secretary of State, Lord King, agrees with me. Shutting the BAE plant would be much more than a local blow; it would be a national disgrace. It could put at risk the very defence of the realm, about which every Member, regardless of who they are, should care.</p>
	<p pid="d.67.1/14">We started making armaments in Bridgwater during the last war; it was a question of necessity. Germany was stretching our military capabilities to the limits. It was in my local Royal Ordnance factory that the famous bouncing bombs designed to destroy the Ruhr dams were loaded. Their inventor, Sir Barnes Wallis, is probably rotating in his grave at the news that we now know.</p>
	<p pid="d.67.1/15">The bombs aimed at Saddam Hussein's bunkers were also made at Bridgwater; the final charges for our ultimate weapons are still made in the area. Next year, however, the essential ingredients will be shipped in from France, provided that the French are not on strike. Relying on foreign suppliers for anything as essential as military munitions is mad. No Government should treat defence as they do commerce, and no Government should ever be held hostage by any company, British or otherwise. Who will pack our bombs in future? Who will load our bullets? It will not be done at Glascoed.</p>
	<p pid="d.67.1/16">I hope that my questions are sensible, but so far I have not been given a real answer from any Minister in this place or the Lords. I have corresponded with Ministers and taken part in rather too many detailed face-to-face sessions. I am always told, not only by Ministers, but BAE, &quot;There is nothing to worry about; BAE Systems is confident that there is no risk to supply.&quot; I am sorry, but I do not believe that. I can understand why BAE Systems cannot be bothered with a little bomb-making factory that ticks over nicely but will never make a real bomb in the financial sense.</p>
	<p pid="d.67.1/17">I am told that a consignment of explosives was recently shipped from France to Somerset so that the experts at Puriton could have a look at it. The product was passable&mdash;just about. However, security at the French depot at which it was collected was lamentable. The gates were wide open; the staff had gone to lunch. The lorry driver went in, picked the stuff up himself and delivered it back here. That cannot be right in any country. It certainly would not happen here&mdash;I know that it would not&mdash;and it should not be allowed to happen in places on which we depend in other countries. Making weapons is far too important to leave to the sloppy or cut-throat practices of the marketplace. I am convinced that the risks of buying abroad outweigh the advantages. To adapt the words used by a recent Defence Secretary when giving evidence to a Select Committee, buying abroad is not &quot;fit for purpose.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="d.67.1/18">Of course closing our arms factory would be a bitter blow to Bridgwater, but it would also be a dangerous step for national security. I ask the Minister to use his muscle and to intervene before it is too late.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-06-06d.72.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1919" speakername="Tom Watson" colnum="72"  time="013:39:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060606/halltext/60606h0136.htm#06060647000734">
	<p pid="d.72.1/1">The countries that are hoping to supply us will have given guarantees that they will retain a security of supply. Perhaps the hon. Gentleman will be comforted on that point when I discuss Eurenco and future reassurances that we hope to make in that area.</p>
	<p pid="d.72.1/2">The company has indicated that it is likely to source raw materials from the Holston plant in the United States, which the hon. Gentleman mentioned. It is one of two potential international suppliers, the other being Eurenco in France. The hon. Gentleman raised the point about security in a previous debate. I have been assured that BAE Systems has talked to the company about security, and perhaps some of his concerns could be allayed by its security arrangements.</p>
	<p pid="d.72.1/3">My officials have visited Holston and are wholly assured that it can easily produce ample quantities of the materials we require while meeting the stringent quality standards that he says are vital. However, the final decision on sourcing will be for the company, based on the parameters that we offer in the contract.</p>
	<p pid="d.72.1/4">The hon. Gentleman tried to test my French on quality control. I shall not even attempt to come up with a phrase, but I assure him that quality control underpins everything that our officials are trying to achieve in the contracts. It is important that we include a system of monitoring and testing so that quality never decreases. He raised an important point, and I hope that the systems that we put in place will reassure him in that regard.</p>
	<p pid="d.72.1/5">It should also be noted that the Holston plant can manufacture crude RDX to the same standard as that previously produced at Bridgwater. BAES Land Systems, overseen by the Defence Ordnance Safety Group, validated initial samples, and I am assured that they are of excellent quality. From the frown on the hon. Gentleman's face, we might have to disagree on that point as well. Each batch of raw material will be tested in the same manner to ensure continued quality.</p>
	<p pid="d.72.1/6">The hon. Gentleman should be reassured that the decision to support the company's plans was not taken lightly. The company could not allow a situation to continue in which BAE Systems was starting to underwrite inefficient production. We applaud the company's efforts to achieve a better balance of cost and capability. Its decisions are in line with the defence industrial strategy and are in the best interests of producing a modern and sustainable munitions business in the UK for which we can tell the British taxpayer we are getting value for money. I hope he understands that that is the balance we must strike.</p>
	<p pid="d.72.1/7">The hon. Gentleman should be reassured that a project team is closely monitoring and challenging BAE Systems as it undertakes that transition. I congratulate him, because these debates are profoundly challenging to BAE Systems as well, and perhaps a bit of parliamentary scrutiny will its keep technicians&mdash;although he mentioned its parliamentary officer&mdash;on their mettle.</p>
	<p pid="d.72.1/8">In addition, the company has contingency plans, particularly as there are at least two overseas suppliers for each of the main raw energetic materials that we require. Should the unforeseen happen and supply be interrupted from one source, BAE Systems will retain the technical ability to switch to the alternative or draw on existing stockpiles.</p>
	<p pid="d.72.1/9">Another benefit of the company's transition is the considerable investment&mdash;up to &pound;10 million&mdash;in its facility at Glascoed. That will become a centre of excellence in the development and production of insensitive munitions, which are what we will need to operate all our future munitions requirements safely.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-06-06d.73.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1919" speakername="Tom Watson" colnum="73"  time="013:39:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060606/halltext/60606h0136.htm#06060647000736">
	<p pid="d.73.1/1">I cannot give the hon. Gentleman a long-term guarantee, but I can certainly write to him and sketch out the future arrangements for munitions manufacture.</p>
	<p pid="d.73.1/2">The company has already invested about &pound;12 million in the new insensitive munitions plant at Glascoed, and we continue to examine new ways to provide capability and value for money. That is not an exclusive process, and if the hon. Gentleman can bring his experience to bear on it, I will welcome his input and that of his colleagues.</p>
	<p pid="d.73.1/3">In munitions, that aim is being exercised through project MASS&mdash;munitions acquisition, the supply solution. With the hon. Gentleman's defence background, he will know that the MOD is fuelled by acronyms, and project MASS is one that does what it says on the tin. The project is in its assessment phase and is examining our requirements beyond 2010 with regard to the entire munitions supply chain, as well as analysing the potential benefits of further involving industry in the end-to-end supply chain for munitions.</p>
	<p pid="d.73.1/4">The hon. Gentleman should also be reassured that even though BAES Land Systems is doing its utmost to guarantee security of supply, we have gone one step further. The Department is taking active steps to help the company to create an even more robust supply chain. A good example of that can be seen in the potential Holston arrangements. The supply arrangement from Holston will be a commercial one between two separate arms of BAE Systems&mdash;BAES Land Systems in the UK and BAE Systems Inc. in the US, which runs Holston&mdash;but we are already in negotiation with the US Department of Defence for a stand-alone munitions memorandum of understanding to underpin that. That will ensure clear understanding on both sides of the importance of reliable supply.</p>
	<p pid="d.73.1/5">A similar memorandum of understanding with France is being considered for the products supplied by Eurenco, so on the hon. Gentleman's point about Belgium, I hope I can reassure him that we are trying to offer that extra confidence to the system.</p>
	<p pid="d.73.1/6">More widely, there are also a number of international agreements with our allies, such as the implementing agreement on security of supply with France, Italy, Germany, Spain and Sweden, and the US-UK defence co-operation memorandum of understanding, which provide support and assurance in the security of supply of defence equipment, including munitions.</p>
	<p pid="d.73.1/7">Although the supply of explosives to our armed forces is an emotive matter, it must be remembered that we already rely on overseas suppliers for a great deal of our equipment. The UK is successfully procuring a range of munitions components from overseas already, not to mention a range of complex weapons. Therefore, even if BAES Land Systems was to reinvest at Bridgwater and accept the resultant cuts in other capability areas, we would still have to source many of the remaining components of each ammunition round from overseas.</p>
	<p pid="d.73.1/8">In general, even if a UK company is the prime contractor for a particular equipment, it is likely that it will source many of the components from overseas. We would not wish to hamper UK companies in their efforts to produce top-line equipment for our troops by insisting that they source components in the UK. Obviously, a balance must be struck between security of supply and value for money, and I hope that the hon. Gentleman will, if not be happy with my contribution, understand that we keep the issue at the forefront of our minds in every decision that is taken.</p>
	<p pid="d.73.1/9">Conversely, many of our allies rely on us for many of their defence equipments where we are the leaders in a particular area. Only through that global marketplace can we ensure that we can afford to give our troops the best equipment they deserve.</p>
	<p pid="d.73.1/10">As a new defence Minister, I say to the hon. Gentleman that I want the best equipped and the best trained forces, so that they can live up to their name as the best armed forces in the world. Although I do not do defence procurement&mdash;that is done by another Minister&mdash;and I am not the Minister with responsibility for the armed forces, that is a shared goal that all four Ministers at the Department are keen to achieve. Our new Secretary of State is particularly keen that we give the reassurances that the hon. Gentleman and other Members are looking for on security of supply.</p>
	<p pid="d.73.1/11">To sum up, I am confident that the changes that I have described will provide better capability at better value for money in such an important sector, ensuring that our armed forces are provided with the general munitions necessary for success on operations. The hon. Gentleman might not walk away with the assurances that he requires on the future of Bridgwater, but I hope that I have been able to allay some of his fears on the strategic level of security of supply.</p>
	<p pid="d.73.1/12">I understand how the hon. Gentleman is standing up for his constituents and the work force, and he has also talked to the trade unions about the issue. If there are any other ways in which the Department can soften the blow in our commercial relationship with BAE Systems, we will do everything we can to help him and his constituents.</p>
	<p pid="d.73.1/13" class="italic">Question put and agreed to.</p>
	<p pid="d.73.1/14" class="italic">Adjourned accordingly at two minutes to Two o'clock.</p>
